 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I am offering my bill, the Increasing  American Jobs and Exports Act, as an amendment to H.R. 4863.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It will allow the Export-Import  Bank to use up to 3 percent of its surplus profits per year for 5 years  to open new regional offices. These additional offices will grow small  businesses by assisting with their capital needs to increase their  exporting capacity and job growth ability.   This bill will grow American jobs, increase exports of American  goods, and strengthen our local and regional economies around the  country.   The Export-Import Bank is important for our Nation. Over the last 10  years, it has supported more than 1.5 million jobs at absolutely no  cost to the American taxpayer. The Bank has helped grow American jobs  at no cost. It has even returned more than $3.4 billion to the United  States Treasury. The Export-Import Bank helps grow American jobs, grow  small businesses, and grow our economy.   Trade and exports are important to my district and, specifically, to  the Coachella Valley in the Inland Empire. The Inland Empire is one of  the fastest growing economic regions in the United States and is a hub  for international trade. The Riverside-San Bernardino region is 38th  nationally in total export value and sixth in California in total  export value. Let me remind everybody, California has the fifth-largest  economy in the world.                                time  1645    The Riverside-San Bernardino Counties region is home to 6,200  exporters, as well as $10 billion worth of exported products.   More specifically, exports are important to my district; and within  Coachella Valley agriculture, there are $500 million worth of fruits,  nuts, vegetables, and melons, and all are top California exports. They  are exported to more than 50 countries.   I want this success repeated across my district and the entire  Nation. The problem, however, is that the closest Export-Import  regional finance office is more than a 2-hour drive away, in San Diego.  That office serves businesses in four California counties and even  three States: Montana, Wyoming, and Arizona.   Small business owners who have the product, the vision, and the  ability to expand their businesses deserve to have local and regional  access to export financing services.   The potential for more American jobs and more American exports is  there. We just have to unlock it. Regional finance offices help small  businesses and small farms succeed where private capital cannot.   Most of the farm businesses in my district are small. Seventy-five  percent are fewer than 50 acres in size. Last year, the Export-Import  Bank financed $1.1 billion worth of agricultural products, and 81  percent of those were small businesses.   With more regional offices, we can continue to grow American exports  and jobs and help small businesses compete. I urge support of my  amendment and the Increasing American Jobs and Exports Act, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I just want to clarify something, that the  $3.4 billion surplus goes to the U.S. Treasury. My bill will not take  one-third of that, only up to the 3 percent that would be available for  regions that would like to have a regional finance office near them.   For example, in North Carolina, which my esteemed colleague is from,  his constituents have to drive all the way to south Florida, to Miami,  to get services from the Export-Import Bank. So it is in my  constituents' interest, and it is the interest of my colleague's that a  regional office is financed closer to his State so that his businesses  can acquire the capital necessary to increase jobs and increase  exports.   In fact, there is data to show that the cluster of businesses that  benefit, by far, are those that are near the surrounding regional  offices. So it is common sense to assume that, if you open an office  near the region, more businesses will benefit and you will have created  more jobs with more exports.   I want to thank Chairwoman Waters for her work on this important  legislation and for her support for my amendment. The Export-Import  Bank has been a success story and can continue to grow. Today's  legislation will further that success.   The Bank supports American jobs, while also returning money to  taxpayers year after year. My amendment would not cost the taxpayer a  single dime. My amendment would grow jobs and businesses by exporting  American goods.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, the Increasing American  Jobs and Exports Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.
