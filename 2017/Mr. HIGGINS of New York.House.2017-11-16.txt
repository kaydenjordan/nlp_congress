 Mr. Speaker, this is nothing more than a hit  job on middle America to pay for a massive tax cut for corporate  America. The only certainty from this charade is slower economic  growth, more income inequality, and exploding budget deficits.   When you take away tax relief from sick people who were born into  illness and for whom insurance doesn't provide enough coverage, that is  a hit on middle America.   When you remove help for people who are just trying to make college  affordable, who are trying to make themselves better, that is a hit on  middle America.                                time  1015    And when you take away healthcare from 13 million Americans and raise  the cost for millions more because you needed another $300 billion to  give more to corporate America, that is a hit on middle America.   And when 152,000 people from my community and millions more from New  York lose 100 years of protection from State and local taxes,  protection worth more than $8,000 per household, that is a hit on my  community, it is a hit on New York State, and it is a hit on each and  every community in America.   And when you take away the essential needs of middle America to feed  the rapacious needs of corporate America, it is a hit on fundamental  fairness, and that, Mr. Speaker, is a hit on all of America.
