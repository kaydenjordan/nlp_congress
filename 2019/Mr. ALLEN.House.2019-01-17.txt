 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Smith for organizing  this Special Order today.   Madam Speaker, every year, hundreds of thousands of individuals from  all over the country come together for the annual March for Life,  marking the Supreme Court decision on Roe v. Wade.   As a strong advocate and believer in the Word of God, I believe it is  my duty to stand up for those who cannot defend themselves and lend my  voice to those who cannot speak for themselves.   Psalm 127:3 says: ``Children are a gift from the Lord; they are a  reward from him.'' That is exactly what they are, a gift from God that  should be cherished mightily.    We must do more in this body to fight for the life of these children.  I, myself, have cosponsored and supported pro-life bills, but we must  bring them to the House floor and always ensure that pro-life  priorities are included in any relevant bill we pass.   I am proud to be an advocate for life and a fighter for the unborn,  just like the thousands of men and women and children who will be  marching along the streets of Washington, D.C., tomorrow. I thank them  for their commitment to this important cause.
