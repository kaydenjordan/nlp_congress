 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly encourage my colleagues to  support the HEALTHY KIDS Act. There are many reasons to support this  bill, but, most importantly, it extends the Children's Health Insurance  Program, CHIP, until 2022.   CHIP ensures that children with incomes too low for Medicaid get  basic health insurance. Close to 400,000 children in Texas rely on CHIP  for access to quality healthcare services. We must act now.   Earlier this year, Hurricane Harvey left a path of destruction across  Texas. It put a major strain on our communities and resources that has  resulted in moments of uncertainty.   The bottom line is, we must act now. This bill responsibly provides  children in need with the proper resources to live a healthy life  without adding to our country's deficit.   Mr. Speaker, again, I strongly urge my colleagues to act now. Vote  for this bill.
