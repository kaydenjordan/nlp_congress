 Mr. Speaker, as we continue to commemorate Mental Health  Awareness Month, I recognize an organization in Guam, which started in  October of 2021 and has continued to advocate for mental health and  suicide prevention.   TU;MA is a woman-owned small business, and I am honored to recognize  the founder, Mrs. Jesrae Moylan, who is here with us today in the Halls  of Congress.   It was founded through the challenges faced when Jesrae's younger  brother, Ray, took his life in 2017. TU;MA was a nickname provided to  Ray by Jesrae's son, Apollo.   A name which had no meaning then has a significant presence today  with the island community. TU;MA focuses on shifting the stigma  surrounding mental health and normalizing such conversations through  the sharing of stories and connections assisting in the healing  process.   On behalf of a thankful Nation and island, I commend Mrs. Jesrae  Moylan and team TU;MA for their selfless efforts in helping others and  reminding them to always choose themselves.                            ____________________
