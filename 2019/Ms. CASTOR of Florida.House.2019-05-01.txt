 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Engel of the  Foreign Affairs Committee for yielding the time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise humbly as a Representative of my home State of  Florida and as a patriotic American but, especially today, as a mother  of two daughters and future generations because I feel the weight of  our moral responsibility to address climate change.   This is a historic day here in the House of Representatives. This is  the first time in 10 years that major climate legislation is being  heard in the people's House.                                time  1445    H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act, is where we will start by  honoring America's commitment to address the climate crisis, and it is  a crisis. The last time global monthly temperatures were below average  was in February of 1985. That means everyone who is 34 years of age or  younger has grown up in a world that has been forever altered by the  change in climate.   How severe the impacts of climate change will be to us personally  over time depends on the actions that we take now.   Based on the latest science from the administration's own National  Climate Assessment, we have reason to worry. Seas are rising. America's  heartland and farms have suffered unprecedented floods. Snowpack is  shrinking, and that is bad for clean water supplies. Droughts are  getting worse. Hot, humid heat waves are becoming more intense, with  more days where people cannot safely work or play outside. Higher  temperatures mean that pollutants, like ground-level ozone from car  exhaust, will become more damaging to our health.   One-and-a-half years ago, I had to pack up my home, board up the  windows and doors, pack up my most cherished belongings, and flee as  Hurricane Irma, that monster hurricane, threatened the State of  Florida. We were scared of a huge storm surge coming up from the Gulf  of Mexico and into Tampa Bay. We were petrified.   Fortunately, we had time to get out of the way, but that isn't true  for so many Americans who have suffered floods, fires, and more. They  haven't been as lucky. And the risks and costs going forward are likely  to be more severe.   What is necessary to combat the climate crisis is to stop carbon  pollution from accumulating in the atmosphere. That requires action,  urgent action, ambitious action.   Fortunately, we have made some progress in recent years in cutting  carbon pollution. Thousands of businesses, houses of worship, States,  and communities are taking action. Now they are demanding that we do  the same.   A few years ago, there was also good news. After years of finger- pointing, the United States, China, India, Europe, and other countries,  all of the countries around the world, came together and agreed to cut  carbon pollution. With America's leadership and engagement, the U.S.  led other nations in committing to take climate action in an  international agreement called the Paris climate accord. The agreement  was a breakthrough.   After years of playing the blame game, nearly every other country  said, here is our plan, and each country developed its own individual  plan, and America has done just that. That plan has incredible upsides.  [[Page H3365]]    We are creating millions of clean energy jobs right now, and they are  good-paying jobs. We are saving billions of dollars on home energy  bills, and businesses are saving huge amounts of money through energy  efficiency. We can finally address climate injustice.   And despite what the Trump administration says, America is still in  the international agreement. We have not formally withdrawn. If this  bill becomes law, we never will, because America does not cut and run,  America keeps its commitments, and we will recommit to doing so when we  pass this bill.   My Climate Action Now bill is straightforward. It would block the  administration from spending any money on withdrawal, and it would  require the Trump administration to release its plan to cut carbon  pollution.   Americans overwhelmingly support U.S. leadership on the climate  crisis because they understand that when America leads, we win. Ask the  23 States, 300 cities, and more than 2,000 businesses who have pledged  to honor the Paris goals. Now they will be joined by the House of  Representatives.   Some of the fastest growing jobs in America are clean energy,  engineering, green building, solar installers, and wind turbine  technicians. This is just the beginning, but we have to stay on course.    In addition to sending an important signal to  clean energy, job-creating businesses, this will send an important  signal to our allies across the world. We expect ambitious action from  them.   I have heard my friends on the other side of the aisle say, but  China. Well, if the President forces a retreat here, other countries  will retreat, as well. A vote against H.R. 9 is a vote to let China off  the hook. This is a patriotic vote. Vote for America, vote for our  future, and keep us in the climate Paris Agreement. I thank the  hundreds of my colleagues who have joined this, and I thank the brave  Republicans who will join us in this patriotic vote for Climate Action  Now.
