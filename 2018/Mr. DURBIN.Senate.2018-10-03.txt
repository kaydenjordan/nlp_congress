 Mr. President, I have been waiting for 10 minutes. I  didn't realize it was going to be an alternating situation, but I will  defer to him because of his seniority and our friendship. I wish to ask  how long he will  [[Page S6461]]  speak, and I wish to ask unanimous consent to follow him.    Ten minutes.    Mr. President, it is hard to believe that it was 3 weeks  ago when we first heard the name Christine Blasey Ford. It seems like a  lot longer; doesn't it?   In that period of time, a lot of things have occurred. The first  thing was the announcement from Kellyanne Conway at the White House  when she said that Dr. Ford's testimony and complaint would neither be  ignored nor would she be insulted. Last night at a rally in  Mississippi, the President of the United States mocked Christine Blasey  Ford for her lack of specific memory about this terrible sexual  assault, which occurred 36 years ago.   I think most people realize that she testified under oath, gave us  all the information she knew, and conceded there were things she  couldn't remember. Neither she nor any victim should be in any way  belittled because they can't remember all of the details of something  that happened in the distant past, something they would much rather  forget.   Let me also remind those who are following this debate that it was  Dr. Ford who stepped forward and called for an FBI investigation. She  was willing to step forward before the FBI and tell her story. It was  Judge Kavanaugh who resisted it, even when I asked him directly. Now  the FBI investigation is under way.   For the good of the Senate and for our Nation, I hope this is a  complete, professional, nonpartisan investigation, and I hope we are  given the time to at least read the report from the FBI before the  Republican majority leader in the Senate plows through, as he said over  and over, to a vote in this Senate.   I hope those who come to this issue in good faith, regardless of  their position, will be respectful of the process, which we may be  using in the future and should respect as it reaches its conclusion.                           Forced Family Separation    Mr. President, on a separate issue, I wish to tell the Senate about  an experience I had several months ago. I was at an immigration court  in Chicago. I had never been there before. It was at a high-rise office  building in the Chicago Loop. The corridors were packed with those who  were waiting for an opportunity for a hearing.   I went into this courtroom where a judge was sitting, and I saw the  two people who were before the court that day to have their case heard.  The judge called the courtroom to order. She was very respectful to the  two individuals who were there, but she had a problem. One of the  people before her could not get into the chair to sit down for the  proceeding. The reason that young girl, whom I will call Maria, could  not get into the chair was because she was 2 years old--2 years old.  One of the volunteer attorneys lifted her up and put her in the chair  and handed her a stuffed owl, which she clung to through the whole  hearing.   The other person who was being subject to a hearing that day had no  trouble getting into the chair. He scrambled into the chair and sat  down because he was anxious to play with the Matchbox car that was on  the table. This young man, whom I will call Hamilton, was 4 years old.   In the United States of America, in the city of Chicago, at an  immigration court of this Federal Government, these two individuals  were up for a hearing because they had been separated forcibly from  their parents. There was no real conclusion to the hearing. They reset  the next hearing date for these two children--2 years old and 4 years  old--for 4 days before Christmas.   How did we get to this point in America where we are actually having  a Federal court hearing of an immigration court for a 2-year-old and a  4-year-old--one too small even to get into a chair by herself and the  other who, thank goodness, found a Matchbox car to play with during the  proceeding? We reached this point because of the announcement of the  Trump administration of something called zero tolerance and the  decision to separate over 2,700 children from their parents at the  border.   Where are we today? We are in a situation where 136 of these  children--months after this policy was started and then discontinued-- are still being held by the government. Ninety-six of them have parents  who we believe to be outside the United States.   Just this last week, the Department of Homeland Security inspector  general came out with a report, which I commend to everyone, analyzing  what the zero tolerance policy meant. I will tell you what it meant. It  meant the absolute ultimate when it came to cruelty and incompetence.  What they tell us in this report was that a decision was made by the  Trump administration and by the Department of Homeland Security under  Secretary Nielsen to separate children from their parents, even before  these children had the ability to speak. They were called preverbal  children. They separated them without any plastic bracelets on their  wrists, without any fingerprints to trace them back to their parents.  They were separated not by blocks or even a few miles but sometimes  1,000 miles.   I came to learn the story of a little boy I will call Hamilton  because it was published in The New Yorker. It was a story about his  mom from El Salvador and the little boy being taken from her in March-- taken from this mother. They left the mother in Texas in detention, and  they transported the child to Chicago. Initially, a volunteer lawyer  came in and bought a phone card and said to the mother: You can call  him. And she did. They would talk for a little while and sing a little  song.   The next time she called him, he wasn't as responsive. It has now  reached a point where this 4-year-old little boy will not speak to his  mother on the telephone, will not communicate with her. The people at  the shelter in Chicago had begged the mother: Tell him he has to eat.   Did you ever see a little 4-year-old boy you would have to tell to  eat? It says something about his state of mind. Sadly, this 4-year-old  has now reverted back to diapers and will not say a word to his mother  on the phone--separated by a zero tolerance program of this Trump  administration.   What they tell us from the Department of Homeland Security Inspector  General's Office is that we are far from the end of this sad,  disgraceful chapter in American history.   Who is going to be held accountable for this? Will it be the  President, perhaps in some election in the future? Will it be the  Attorney General, who proudly announced this new program separating  mothers from children? Will it be the Secretary of the Department of  Homeland Security, who separated these children, according to the  inspector general's report, putting them in confined spaces, which were  unacceptable by humane standards, which we actually have been governed  by for years in the United States?   I believe Secretary Nielsen should be held responsible. I believe she  should resign. Someone has to answer for this disgraceful chapter in  American history, and we still must remember that 136 eligible children  are still being held by our government under this policy. It is time  for us to reunite these children with their parents. Except in the most  extraordinary circumstances, it is time for us to try to put these  families back together again. I want Hamilton to start eating again. I  want him to be in his mother's arms again. I want him to try to get  over this chapter in his young life. It can affect him for as long as  he lives.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to engage in a colloquy with  Senator Portman to speak about section 5052 of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for  Patients and Communities Act.   Section 5052 of H.R. 6 takes a long-overdue step of lifting the  ``Institutions for Mental Disease,'' or IMD, exclusion for individuals  with a diagnosis of substance use disorder. For more than half a  century, this arcane provision has restricted access to care for  patients struggling with addiction by prohibiting Medicaid from  reimbursing for residential substance abuse treatment in facilities  with more than 16 beds.   Sixteen beds? That might suffice in some parts of the country, but  certainly not in many Illinois communities suffering from the opioid  epidemic. I have visited facilities down in Carbondale, IL, where they  told me they have hundreds of people waiting for treatment and a 12- week wait for an open bed. We don't restrict cancer or diabetes or  heart disease patients to only receiving care in certain-sized  facilities, and we should not do the same for substance use disorders.   In the face of the Nation's worst ever drug overdose epidemic, this  Federal law has prohibited treatment centers from expanding services to  accommodate the growing demand for recovery services and blocking an  entire class of high-quality providers from providing care. It is  unacceptable.   For years, I have worked in a bipartisan manner to lift this IMD  exclusion. I have led bipartisan groups of Senators in writing to the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, urging them to provide  flexibility from this treatment barrier and also worked to ensure  Illinois's section 1115 Medicaid waiver includes authority to partially  waive the IMD exclusion.   I have also worked on legislation for multiple years to lift the IMD  exclusion for individuals with a diagnosis of substance use disorder. I  first reintroduced the Medicaid CARE Act in a prior Congress and then  last year teamed up with Senators Portman, Brown, King, and others to  reintroduce the legislation, which lifted the bed cap from 16 beds to  40 beds and allowed for up to 60 days of residential treatment if it  was deemed medically necessary. Later, we joined to introduce the  Improving CARE Act, which removed the bed cap altogether, allowed for  inpatient stays for up to 90 days, and introduced measures to ensure  that patients would have access to all necessary treatments, in the  highest quality facilities, with a plan for successful transitions to  outpatient and community-based care.   Section 5052 of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act took  much of our proposal from the Improving CARE Act, including ensuring  that we lift the IMD exclusion for individuals with all diagnoses of  substance use disorder and improving the array of patient treatment  options when seeking care. This work will have an incredible impact on  improving access to care in my State and nationwide, and I would like  to thank all of our bipartisan colleagues who helped to secure this  important language to break down the IMD exclusion.   Unfortunately, section 5052 does not include a policy that matters a  lot to me and my colleagues: directly allowing for eligible individuals  seeking  [[Page S6481]]  such care to stay up to 90 days in a facility for treatment. Inpatient  and residential stays for substance use disorder treatment should by no  means be indefinite, and I believe that individuals should seek  outpatient treatment as quickly as possible so that they can return to  their homes and communities. However, section 5052 raises the statutory  length of stay for only 30 days, which in many cases is insufficient  for individuals that need more intensive treatment for their substance  use disorder.   I know Senator Portman is going to discuss this further, but section  5052 includes language defining eligibility under this new authority to  include Medicaid enrollees enrolled under a State plan or a waiver of  such plan. Given that Illinois and other States do have Medicaid 1115  waivers to provide substance use disorder treatment in IMDs, I want to  affirm that this new statutory authority for 30 days of care can be  woven seamlessly together with separate State waivers to maximize the  length of stay for patients to include additional days under a waiver.    Mr. President, I would like to reiterate my appreciation  to Senators Portman, Brown, Cardin, King, and others and echo what  Senator Portman said about flexibility to elongate lengths of stay as  medically necessary for patients, beyond the 30 days under this new  statutory authority. Earlier this year, Illinois obtained a Medicaid  1115 waiver to address behavioral healthcare in the State, which  allowed for a partial waiver of the IMD exclusion to allow for Medicaid  beneficiaries in my State to receive up to 30 days of treatment in  these IMD facilities. That was good news.   Nonetheless, I expect that section 5052 of the SUPPORT for Patients  and Communities Act will still be able to help residents of Illinois  and those in other States with 1115 waivers, because, similar to the  authority that Senator Portman noted that Medicaid managed care plans  have, States will be able to pair this new authority under section 5052  with the existing authorities under State waivers. Thus, Medicaid  enrollees in Illinois will be able to combine the 30-day stay under our  waiver with the 30 days under this new authority, thus giving my  constituents the opportunity to receive up to 60 days of inpatient,  substance use disorder treatment a year. That is an important new step  forward, and I look forward to working with our State and CMS to fully  implement this policy for States to coordinate waivers and statutory  authority for longer lengths of stay.   This is by no means a uniform policy for each of the States, and I  hope that we can come together again to lengthen these stay limits.    Mr. President, I agree with Senator Portman on stitching  together this new statutory authority with existing managed care and  waiver authorities to elongate patients' lengths of stay, as medically  appropriate. I would once again like to thank all of my colleagues,  including Chairman Hatch, Ranking Member Wyden, Chairman Alexander, and  Ranking Member Murray, for their help in getting this important policy  across the finish line.
