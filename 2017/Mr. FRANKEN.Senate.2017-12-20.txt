 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, unlike most of my colleagues, the time I  spent here in the Senate represents the sum total of my experience in  elected office. For most of my life I approached politics and public  policy from a very different perspective. I tried to be an educated  citizen who understood how the issues being debated here in Washington  affected me, my family, my neighbors, and those in my State and my  country. I tried to be an advocate for the values I believed in-- honesty in public discourse, for sure, but also fairness, justice, and  the idea that in America we are all in this together. I tried to be an  activist, putting my voice and my energy behind candidates and causes  that I cared for and about.   When I leave the Senate in a few weeks, I will continue trying to be  an educated citizen, an advocate, and an activist. Over the last 8\1/2\  years, as I have had the privilege of serving the people of Minnesota,  I also gained a new perspective on the issues we face and the way we  here in Washington make decisions.   Before I go, I want to spend some time sharing some of what I have  learned in a series of speeches focusing on the challenges I came to  Washington to address--challenges that my colleagues will continue to  wrestle with, challenges that will determine not just the political  landscape we leave for the next generation of Senators but what kind of  country we leave for the next generation of Americans.   Today I want to start by talking about education. Even at a time when  our politics is more polarized and more poisonous than it has ever  been, you would think that education is one place where Democrats and  Republicans could come together to make progress. After all, while we  do have significant differences on the details of education policy,  nobody disagrees about the importance of getting it right. We all agree  that education from pre-K through college and beyond is essential to  providing our economy with a skilled workforce that is ready to  innovate and lead us into the future.   Ever since I have been here, employers in Minnesota have stressed to  me that they need employees with critical thinking and problem solving  skills, with team work and creativity--tools that we need our children  to be developing long before they enter the workforce. I am pretty sure  that my colleagues hear this from employers in their States too.   Of course, education isn't just about our economy. It is about the  most basic responsibility we have as human beings. Many of us who have  served in the Senate have children and grandchildren, and we would do  anything to be able to promise to them that when they grow up, they  will be able to follow their dreams and take a risk on themselves to  achieve more than we ever could. Many of us remember just how hard our  own parents worked to keep that promise to us. All of us, Democrat and  Republican alike, want to be able to make that promise not just to our  own children but to every child in America, no matter where they grow  up or what their family life is like or what obstacles they may  encounter along the way.   We all want a country where every child has the opportunity to  fulfill his or her God-given potential. We all understand that whether  we can provide every child with a great education is the most basic  measure of whether we are keeping that promise. Fortunately, the HELP  Committee, which I had the honor of serving on since I first arrived in  the Senate, has been led by public servants who share those values and  a common commitment to delivering on that promise. Under Chairman  Harkin and now under Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray, the  HELP Committee has often been able to be an example of how Democrats  and Republicans can work together to make progress.   When I first got here, the debate was focused on No Child Left  Behind, which Congress had passed and President Bush had signed into  law in 2002. Democrats and Republicans worked together on that bill  back then because they all believed that it was important that our  schools be held accountable for the results they achieved on behalf of  all students. But by 2009, it had become clear that No Child Left  Behind simply wasn't getting the job done.   A couple of weeks after I got to the Senate, I held a roundtable with  principals at a school that had been turned around in a poor  neighborhood by a great principal in St. Paul. One of the other  principals told me that he referred to the NCLB tests as autopsies. I  knew exactly what he meant. The kids were taking the tests in late  April. The results didn't come back until late June or later--too late  to let the results inform teachers' instruction of each child.   In Minnesota, therefore, most school districts added computer  adaptive tests  [[Page S8160]]  in addition to the required NCLB tests--computers so the teachers could  get the results right away and adaptive so that if a kid was getting  all the questions right, the questions would get harder and if the  kid was getting all of the questions wrong, the questions would get  easier. That way, instead of measuring whether or not a student was  appropriately proficient at grade level in reading and math, educators  could find out exactly what grade level each student was at in those  subjects--adaptive. NCLB, on the other hand, didn't allow a State to  test outside of grade level. Schools and teachers were judged on  whether a sufficient percentage of kids met this arbitrary standard.  This became known as measuring for proficiency, and it created what  teachers in Minnesota described to me as ``a race to the middle.'' It  made them focus on kids just below or just above proficiency. So the  ones just below would get above and the ones just above would stay  above proficiency, and they would ignore the kid at the top because  those kids at the top, no matter what you did, wouldn't go below  proficiency. They would ignore the kids at the bottom because no matter  what you did that year you couldn't get those kids to proficiency. So  there was this race to the middle. Think about how perverse that is.    Think about a fifth grade teacher who takes a kid from a second grade  level of reading to a fourth grade level of reading. Well, that kid  didn't get to proficiency. So under No Child Left Behind, that teacher  was a goat. But a teacher who helps a child grow by two grade levels in  a single year is a hero. Teachers, principals, superintendents, school  board members and parents all argued that it was time to stop measuring  just for proficiency and to measure for growth or measure just growth,  instead. This became quickly a central focus of the debate over how to  reform No Child Left Behind, and it remains a pivotal debate when it  comes to the future of our education system, which is why it was so  shocking when President Trump picked a Secretary of Education, Betsy  DeVos, who turned out to have no idea what the growth versus  proficiency debate was even about.   It would be as if our children's future relied on the outcome of a  football game and the President nominated a head coach who didn't know  how many yards it took to get a first down. It was a deeply upsetting  moment, not just because of what it revealed about Mrs. DeVos or the  President who had picked her to be in charge of our Nation's education  system but because these are the kinds of problems that we should be  able to solve. There is nothing ideological about the debate. It is  simply a matter of coming together and working in good faith to make  things work better. A functioning democracy should be able to get stuff  like this right, and sometimes we have.   For example, in the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act we were  able to address some of the excessive testing that was burdening  educators and students alike. Under the new law, schools would still  have to test every year between third and eighth grade and once in high  school, but each State would control the consequences of the test  results and that would almost certainly mean fewer high stakes tests,  less drilling, more time to teach and learn.   Meanwhile, the law included important priorities like strengthening  STEM education, expanding student mental health services, increasing  access to courses that help high school students earn college credit,  and preparing and recruiting more and better principals to lead better  schools. These are all things that I fought to include in that final  law.   It also included a long overdue investment in early childhood  education, but not enough--not enough. We know from study after study  that a quality early childhood education returns between $7 and $16 for  every dollar invested. That is because children who get a quality early  childhood education are less likely to be referred to special ed and  less likely to be held back a grade. They have better health outcomes.  Girls are less likely to get pregnant in adolescence. They are more  likely to graduate high school, go to college, and get a good job and  pay taxes. And they are less likely to go to prison.   If we really want to address future deficits, we would be pouring  money into training early childhood educators. Instead, in his budget  in the Congress, the Trump administration proposed major cuts to early  childhood education. We could easily put more money into these programs  if we weren't giving enormous tax cuts to the wealthy and to powerful  corporations.   We also need to make sure that as our kids get older, they can rely  on quality afterschool programs. Last spring, I visited Roosevelt High  School in Minneapolis. During my tour of the school's afterschool  program, I saw students rehearsing for a production of the ``Addams  Family.'' I saw students getting critical academic support like  tutoring and college prep. In fact, Roosevelt's successful afterschool  programs contributed to their graduation rate going from less than 50  percent to over 70 percent in just 3 years. That is pretty incredible.  That is why I fought to renew the 21st Century Community Learning  Centers Program in the reform of No Child Left Behind. It is a program  that keeps schools open after school.   If we all agree that education should be a priority, we should be  willing to put our money where our mouths are and fund these programs.  I am proud that during the course of my time here, we have had a  bipartisan commitment in doing just that. We made progress--not enough,  but we made progress. Again, however, that progress was put at risk  under this administration. That afterschool program was zeroed out in  its proposed budget. What is more, this administration seems to be  outright hostile to the idea that we have responsibilities to provide  children with a quality public education.   I am proud of the work we have done to support and improve our public  schools, but the Department of Education is now led by a Secretary with  a long history of actively undermining public education. Secretary  DeVos and her family have spent millions and millions of dollars  advocating for an ideology that would steal funds from public schools  in order to fund private and religious education.   Now, let's take a moment to talk about what that means. Secretary  DeVos ran a political action committee called All Children Matter,  which spent millions in campaign contributions to promote the use of  taxpayer dollars for school vouchers. The argument was that these  vouchers would allow low-income students to leave the public school  system and attend private schools of their family's choice. Secretary  DeVos has been pushing to expand vouchers for years, even though  research clearly shows that voucher programs don't work. In fact, the  academic outcomes for students who use vouchers to attend private  schools is abysmal.   A New York Times article from February of this year reported on three  different studies of large State voucher programs in Indiana,  Louisiana, and Ohio. Each study found that vouchers negatively impact  results in both reading and math. In fact, in Louisiana's voucher  program, public elementary school students who started at the 50th  percentile in math and then used a voucher to transfer to a private  school dropped to the 26th percentile in a single year. Harvard  education professor Martin West said this negative effect was ``as  large as any I've seen in the literature,'' and he was talking about  all literature, the entire history of American education research.   Secretary DeVos is a serious threat to our public school system and a  threat to the quality of education in this country overall. I have  pushed as hard as I can to protect our students from what this  administration has been trying to do. I have sent the Secretary over a  dozen letters this year on protecting students from harassment, helping  defrauded students, and holding for-profit schools accountable. It is  my hope that my colleagues will continue to be vigilant in overseeing  the Department of Education and making sure our public education system  is not dismantled.   Our public education system was designed to give all kids a real  chance in life, but teachers and administrators often lack the  resources they need to give the kids the opportunities they deserve.  Every year, I push appropriators to increase funding for a number of  critical education programs like early childhood, STEM, and  professional development for teachers, and I hope my  [[Page S8161]]  colleagues will continue that fight to increase resources for these  programs.   Improving our education system isn't just about funding and  accountability. If we want to keep the promise of opportunity to every  child, we have to recognize that some kids face obstacles others do  not, and we have to do more to make sure they are not left behind. For  example, particularly kids who grow up poor are far more likely to  suffer what are called adverse childhood experiences, not just the  stress of living in poverty itself but exposure to domestic violence,  abuse or neglect, drug and alcohol abuse, the incarceration of a  parent, the death of a sibling. All of those adverse childhood  experiences affect brain chemistry and the ability to learn. If we want  to improve education, we need to do a better job of helping these  children overcome these traumas and a better job of addressing economic  inequality so fewer have to deal with the trauma in the first place.  This is another reason we need more high-quality, early childhood  programs and more training for childcare providers so they can better  support kids who have experienced trauma.   Here is another example, foster kids. It is not uncommon for foster  children to have 10, 11, 12 sets of foster parents during their  childhood. This wreaks havoc on their education. Sometimes foster kids  fall through the cracks of our education system. If a child's new  foster parents live in a different school district, the foster child is  yanked out of school and sent to one in the new school district. Kayla  VanDyke, who at the time was an incredibly impressive high school  senior from Minnesota, testified before the HELP Committee that she had  been in seven foster homes, and she did fall through the cracks. She  missed fourth grade entirely. For foster kids, school is often the one  constant in their life--maybe they have a teacher they really like or  an extracurricular activity that means everything to them or maybe they  have these things called friends. That is why I wrote a provision in  the Every Student Succeeds Act to require school districts to work with  child welfare agencies to make sure foster children who are changing  homes are not forced to change schools. I would like to think that  somewhere there is a foster child running cross-country or developing a  passion for history because of a great teacher or doing homework with a  good friend because of legislation I worked on, legislation that passed  with a strong bipartisan majority.    Here is yet another example--kids in Indian Country. When I first  came to the Senate, I asked for a seat on the Indian Affairs Committee.  Serving on that committee, you are confronted with the tragic  disparities from which Native people in our country suffer. One of them  is the huge disparity in educational resources for Native kids compared  to their peers. That inequity in education plays out in many ways, but  you can literally see it in the school buildings some Native kids are  forced to learn in. Indian school buildings are often unsafe, harmful  to the health of children and teachers, and ultimately a barrier to the  education of the students.   So going back to early 2009, I had been fighting for funding to fix  the Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig High School on Leech Lake Reservation in northern  Minnesota. When I first visited the school, I saw exposed wiring, mold,  roof leaks, rodents, uneven floors, poor lighting, and sewer problems.  I learned the students had faced these horrendous conditions in their  classrooms for years. It was deplorable and was a terrible place to  learn, so I worked for the better part of a decade to rebuild that  school. I sent my colleagues a series of powerful editorials about  conditions at the school as written by the Minneapolis StarTribune. I  raised this issue at what seems like countless Indian Affairs hearings.  After a lot of work from the community, the Tribe, and the Obama  administration, we were able to secure the funding to rebuild the Bug- O-Nay-Ge-Shig school.   I am thrilled so many bright, young students in Leech Lake will be  able to feel safe and comfortable in a brandnew school, which will be  opening this coming March, but this is one school, one reservation, and  there are hundreds of schools like the Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig High School  that are not suitable for learning, and we need to do so much more for  our Native kids.   In Indian Country, we know that historical trauma has a huge impact  on our children. We have seen the ripple effects of intergenerational  trauma, and we know it can lead to other types of trauma experienced in  childhood.   That is why, when we look at these adverse childhood experiences,  particularly within the Native community, we can't dismiss their  effects on kids' ability to learn. Kids in Indian Country are woefully  underserved when it comes to housing and economic opportunity. A report  by Wilder Research states that this can ``threaten their educational  success, health and mental health, and personal development.'' I am  pleased Senator Heitkamp of North Dakota has been focused on addressing  this issue.   One more example: LGBT students deserve to learn in an environment  free from discrimination, and they deserve to be treated with dignity  and respect. Far too often, LGBT kids endure harassment and  discrimination. More than 30 percent of LGBT kids report missing a day  of school in the previous month because they felt unsafe. You can't  learn when you dread going to school, and when that happens, those  students are deprived of an equal education.   In America, we have passed laws that guard against harassment in our  schools on the basis of race, national origin, sex, and disability, but  LGBT students continue to face bullying and intimidation without  recourse. I have a bill called the Student Non-Discrimination Act that  would merely provide LGBT students the same legal remedies available to  other kids under our Federal civil rights laws. It says, schools would  have to listen when a parent says ``my child isn't safe,'' and the  school has to do something about it. It would ensure that LGBT kids  have the same protections as every other child. I worked very hard to  get this provision into the final law, and I was greatly disappointed  it wasn't included, even though it got 52 votes on the Senate floor.   It is our responsibility, not just as Senators but as adults, to  protect children and help them flourish, and I sincerely hope every one  of my colleagues will take up this fight and work to get this across  the finish line.   The last thing I want to mention on the subject of education is this.  For a long time, we thought about learning as something that started  when you went to kindergarten and continued until you got your high  school diploma and either went off to college or went off to work. We  now know education is a lifelong pursuit, but we also know we need to  do more to make it possible for it to continue long after 12th grade.   College used to be an affordable and accessible step into the middle  class for so many Americans. I always think of my wife Franni and her  family. You see, when Franni was 17 months old, her dad, a decorated  World War II veteran, died in a car accident, leaving her mom widowed  with five kids. Neil, her brother, went into the Coast Guard and became  an electrical engineer, but all four girls went to college, and they  went on combinations of Pell grants and scholarships. You see, back  then, a Pell grant covered about 80 percent of the cost of a public  college education. Today, it is less than 35 percent.   So today kids have to work while they go to college. That is not new,  but when I have done roundtables at colleges across Minnesota, many of  them tell me they are working full time, in addition to going to school  full time, which seems like it might make it harder to focus on your  studies or to stay awake. That is why I have been working to bring down  the cost of college, increase financial aid to students, and make  textbooks cheaper. We need to help millions of Americans refinance  their student loan debt at lower interest rates, and we need to help  low- and middle-income students go to college debt-free. This is  something we could easily be doing if we weren't giving giant tax cuts  to the superwealthy and to powerful corporations.   It is important to remember, too, that young people don't necessarily  need to start at a 4-year college to become successful in life or to  build a secure middle-class lifestyle. In many career and technical  programs, students complete their education after they have been  employed in good jobs because they had the credentials to get those  jobs--good jobs with benefits that promise a secure career. Some of  [[Page S8162]]  those benefits are often that company paying for the rest of your  education--finishing, maybe, your associate's degree or your bachelor's  degree or graduate school.   We need to overcome the assumption that career and technical schools  are a ceiling to future success. They are a ladder to careers with good  wages and benefits that can support a comfortable lifestyle.   There is a high demand for these workers now. That is because we have  what is called a skills gap in this country. Every Senator has it in  their State. It is one of the things I hear about frequently when I  travel around Minnesota, especially when I talk to businesses. I hear  about job positions employers can't fill because they can't find  qualified workers or workers with the right skills. At the same time, I  hear from students who are anxious to start a career but lack specific  technical skills.   To remain competitive in today's global economy, we need a better  trained workforce. That is why I introduced the Community College to  Career Fund Act. The grants would help create public-private  partnerships that support Learn and Earn on-the-job training programs.  Employers would develop a workforce with the specific skills they need  to grow their businesses, and everybody wins.   Here is how it works. You go to get a credential. That credential  gets you a job. Then the employer will pay for you to continue your  education as you continue to work and make a living. I have seen this  time and again, and it works.   We also need to reauthorize the Perkins Career and Technical  Education law, which includes support for public-private partnership  training programs in K-12.   I think some of the things we need to do to make college more  affordable and accessible and valuable for students are pretty clear.  But let's be honest. The Trump administration--after nearly a year in  office--has been going in a very different direction and has been  working against the best interests of college students. One of the most  unfortunate aspects of this is that predatory for-profit colleges have  been able to get even more of a foothold in our higher education system  since Secretary DeVos took over.   The good news when it comes to education is that America still has  teachers and principals and school board members and superintendents  who work hard every day to take responsibility for every student under  their care and deliver on the promise of a great education. We still  have parents and neighbors and coaches who look out for our children's  well-being and who work to equip them with the skills they need to  succeed in school and beyond.   As anyone who has spent any time in a school lately can tell you, our  kids themselves still have some pretty impressive potential. What is  more, we still have people on both sides of the aisle in the Senate who  care passionately about education and are willing to do the hard work  of bipartisan legislating in order to improve our schools and keep that  promise of opportunity for the next generation.   If the last 8\1/2\ years have taught me that progress on education is  possible, even in a divided Washington, this past year has taught me  that further progress isn't inevitable and that the progress we have  already made may not be safe.   It will be up to my colleagues not to address just the policy  challenges posed by an education system that faces a big transition and  a budget that forces hard choices but also the political challenges of  the moment. It is my hope and prayer that they will be up to the task.  Our children's future depends on it.   Thank you.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to deliver the second in a series  of floor speeches that I offer as I close out my time in the Senate.   This afternoon, I want to talk about Americans' relationship with  telecommunications and technology companies and what that means for  their access to essential services and for their privacy.   When I entered the Senate in July of 2009, then-Majority Leader Harry  Reid asked me to serve on the Judiciary Committee. I pointed out that  there are a lot of lawyers in the Senate and that I wasn't one of them,  but he said he needed Members with my perspective on the committee. I  wondered how my background could possibly serve me on Judiciary, but it  did--almost immediately--when in December of that year, Comcast  announced its intention to acquire NBCUniversal.   I happened to know a lot about the effects of media consolidation  because I used to work in media. When powerful corporations are  permitted to acquire other powerful corporations, it is the American  consumers who are left facing higher prices, fewer choices, and even  worse service from their telecommunications providers. I questioned why  an already powerful company should be allowed to get even bigger and  thus extract more leverage over consumers and the businesses reliant on  its platform.   It was through my work on Comcast and NBCUniversal that I learned  about the rising costs of internet, phone, and TV services, as well as  the importance of preserving net neutrality. I also became interested  in how giant telecommunications companies, as well as ever-evolving  tech companies, were treating the massive troves of user data they were  collecting on a perpetual basis.   I believe consumers have a fundamental right to know what information  is being collected about them. I believe they have a right to decide  whether they want to share that information and with whom they want to  share it and when. I believe consumers have a right to expect that  companies that store their personal information will store it securely.  [[Page S8173]]    I also believe all Americans deserve affordable access to high- quality telecommunications services--services they depend on to  communicate with the world, get an education, and find a job. I believe  the internet should remain the open platform for innovation, economic  growth, and freedom of expression it has always been.   Perhaps it was the complex nature of these issues or even the  financial incentive to turn a blind eye, but when I came to the Senate,  very few Members of Congress were talking about corporate  consolidation, commercial privacy, or net neutrality--issues that have  gained much deserved attention in more recent years. Whatever the  reason for other Members' hesitance, I felt it was incumbent upon me to  get into the weeds on these issues so I could be a leader in the Senate  and ultimately address the concerns of ordinary Minnesotans.   That is why, when the interests of the American consumers have  clashed with the desires of powerful telecommunications and technology  companies, I have always tried to put the public first and to fight on  their behalf by shedding light on corporate abuses and using all the  tools at my disposal to curb them.   Again, it is through my work on the Judiciary Committee--and, more  specifically, my work on media and technology policy--that I believe my  perspective from my previous career has been of most value.   Comcast's proposal to acquire NBCU immediately made me uncomfortable  because I had seen their motives for this deal before. In 1993, during  my 13th season at ``Saturday Night Live,'' the Big Three networks--NBC,  CBS, and ABC--pressured Congress to change the rules that had  previously prevented them from owning any of the shows they aired in  prime time. The purpose of the rules had been to prevent the networks  from prioritizing their own shows over others or otherwise harming  competing programming.    Unsurprisingly, after the rules were repealed, the networks--contrary  to their guarantees and assurances they had given Congress--began  giving the shows they owned preferential treatment. At the time,  ``Seinfeld,'' which aired on NBC, was not owned by NBC and had been  produced before the rules had changed--was the No. 1 show on  television, which made the Thursday night timeslot following  ``Seinfeld'' the most valuable real estate on television. I watched as  shows that eventually wound up in that premium location were all owned,  at least in part, by NBC.   So when I became a Senator, one of the first major deals I opposed  was Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal. As in the case of AT&T's  current bid to buy Time Warner, this deal was about giving one company  the ability to control both the programming and the pipes that carry  it. I knew from my time in media that a combined Comcast-NBCUniversal  would have strong incentives to favor its own programming over that of  others and restrict competing distributors from accessing that  programming. I knew these incentives would hurt competing content  creators, inhibit the free flow of information, and ultimately harm  consumers.   Unfortunately, I was not wrong. In the years after its acquisition of  NBCUniversal, Comcast repeatedly violated the terms of its agreements  with the FCC and the Department of Justice, favoring its own news  programming over its competitors in Comcast's channel lineup and  failing to live up to its promises regarding offering affordable  standalone broadband, racial diversity in programming--they did not  live up to their promises there--and online video distribution. Because  merger conditions are extremely difficult and costly to enforce,  competition and consumers were harmed in the process.   Comcast's behavior in the wake of acquiring NBCUniversal was one of  the major reasons I then opposed its proposal to turn around and buy  Time Warner Cable a couple years later. It was also one of the major  reasons I believe that later deal was ultimately dropped after  objections from the FCC and the Department of Justice.   For a long time in the Senate, it was a lonely battle. For over a  year, I was the only Senator to oppose Comcast's proposals to buy Time  Warner Cable--a deal that would have given the combined company 57  percent of the broadband market--but advocates and ordinary citizens  raised their voices, and together we were able to stop the deal.   Most recently, I have led my colleagues in scrutinizing AT&T's  proposed acquisition of Time Warner, and I have once again called on  regulators to move to block the deal for the inevitable harm it will  cause to competition and consumers.   I have been proud to lead these efforts, and I leave here in a much  different environment than when I arrived. I know there are strong  voices in the Senate that will carry on the fight when I am gone.   These efforts to slow down and halt media consolidation are part of a  very important, larger development we have seen in our country. In  recent years, there has been a resurgence in the American public's-- and, in turn, Congress's--interest in combating corporate  consolidation.   When I first entered the Senate, I wasn't sure most Americans  understood what was at stake when these powerful companies wanted to  combine. Vertical integration and antitrust laws sounded like obscure,  almost boring, topics, but more and more Americans are getting educated  about these issues, and more and more Members of Congress are working  to get Washington focused on how they affect the lives of real people.   Just look at the fight for net neutrality. For many of the same  reasons that I opposed Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal, I have  long supported strong net neutrality rules to ensure that the internet  remains a level playing field where everyone can participate on equal  footing, free from discrimination by large internet service providers  like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T.   Net neutrality preserves the internet as the engine for innovation  that it has always been and allows businesses of all sizes to thrive-- even when they are up against the largest, most profitable  corporations. Here is just one example I found useful in explaining net  neutrality:   In 2005, three guys set up shop over a pizzeria in a strip mall in  San Mateo, CA, where they launched the now-ubiquitous YouTube. Video- sharing websites were in their infancy, but these guys already faced  competition from something that preceded it called Google Video, but  Google Video wasn't very good. Because of net neutrality, YouTube was  able to compete with Google Video on a level playing field. The giant  internet service providers treated YouTube's videos the same as they  did Google's, and Google couldn't pay them to gain an unfair advantage,  like a fast lane into consumer homes.   They were treated the same, neutrally. The content was neutral--net  neutrality. People really liked YouTube. They preferred YouTube to  Google Video, and YouTube thrived. In fact, in 2006, Google bought it  for stock valued at $1.65 billion. That is a nice chunk for three guys  over a pizzeria in San Mateo.   It is not just tech companies and small businesses that rely on open  internet. In a submission to the FCC in 2014, a coalition that includes  Visa, Bank of America, UPS, and Ford explained that ``every retailer  with an online catalogue, every manufacturer with online product  specifications, every insurance company with online claims processing,  every bank offering online account management, every company with a  website--every business in America interacting with its customers  online is dependent upon an open Internet.'' I have repeated this quote  on the floor and at rallies time and time again over the years because  I think it perfectly exemplifies the importance of this issue.   Preserving net neutrality is only controversial for the few deep- pocketed entities that stand to financially gain without it.   If FCC Chairman Pai ultimately has his way, we will be entering a  digital world where the powerful outrank the majority, a world where a  handful of multibillion-dollar companies have the power to control how  users get their information, and a world where the deepest pockets can  pay for a fast lane while their competitors stall in the slow lane.   For nearly 9 years, I have been calling net neutrality the free  speech issue  [[Page S8174]]  of our time because it embraces our most basic constitutional freedoms.  And ironically, the kind of civic participation that has aspired so  many of us in recent months--and has effected real change, like in the  fight for net neutrality and the successful efforts to save the  Affordable Care Act--has depended in no small part on a free and open  internet.   In 2015, the FCC's vote to reclassify broadband providers as common  carriers under title II of the Communications Act didn't just mean good  things for net neutrality; it also had important implications for  consumer privacy. It gave the agency the authority and the  responsibility to implement rules to protect Americans' privacy by  giving consumers greater control of their personal data that is  collected and used by their broadband providers. That was a big win.  Republicans didn't see it that way. One of the first things they did  this Congress was to repeal those rules, which was a huge blow to  Americans' right to privacy.   For my part, I have long believed that Americans have a fundamental  right to privacy. I believe they deserve both transparency and  accountability from the companies that have the capacity to trade on  the details of their lives. And should they choose to leave personal  information in the hands of those companies, they certainly deserve to  know that their information is being safeguarded to the greatest degree  possible. This transparency and accountability should come from all the  companies that have access to Americans' sensitive information. This  includes internet service providers like Comcast and AT&T but also edge  providers like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.   In 2011, I served as chair for the inaugural hearing of the Judiciary  Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law--a subcommittee that I  founded after it became abundantly clear that our Nation's privacy laws  had failed to keep pace with rapidly evolving technologies.   When people talked about protecting their privacy when I was growing  up, they were talking about protecting it from the government. They  talked about unreasonable searches and seizures, about keeping the  government out of their bedrooms. They talked about whether the  government was trying to keep tabs on the books they read or the  rallies they attended. Over the last 40 or 50 years, we have seen a  fundamental shift in who has our information and what they are doing  with it. That is not to say that we still shouldn't be worried about  protecting ourselves from government abuses, but now we also have  relationships with large corporations that are obtaining, storing,  sharing and in many cases selling enormous amounts of our personal  information.   When the Constitution was written, the Founders had no way of  anticipating the new technologies that would evolve in the coming  centuries. They had no way of anticipating the telephone, for example,  and so the Supreme Court ruled over 40 years ago that a wiretap  constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. The Founders had no  idea that one day the police would be able to remotely track your  movements through a GPS device, and so the Supreme Court ruled in 2012  that this was also a search that required court approval. All of this  is a good thing. Our laws need to reflect the evolution of technology  and changing expectations of American society. This is why the  Constitution is often called a living document. But we have a long way  to go to get to the point where our modern laws are in line with modern  technology.    My goal for the subcommittee was to help members understand both the  benefits and privacy implications of emerging technologies; to educate  the public and raise awareness about how their data is being collected,  used, and shared; and, if necessary, to legislate to fill gaps in the  law. When politics prevented legislation, I repeatedly pressed  companies--many of them more than once--to be more transparent about  how they were treating their customers' private information, including  users' location data, web-browsing histories, and even their finger and  face prints.   As consumer awareness has evolved, these companies have taken  important steps to improve transparency of their use of Americans'  personal information. But unfortunately, accumulating massive troves of  information isn't just a side project they can choose to halt at any  given time; for many of them, it is their whole business model. We are  not their customers; we are their product.   Recently, we have seen just how scary this business model can be. In  October of this year, the Judiciary Committee examined Russia's  manipulation of social media during the 2016 campaign, and both the  public and Members of Congress were shocked to learn the outsized role  that the major tech companies play in so many aspects of our lives,  based primarily on the mass collection of personal information and  complex algorithms that are shrouded in secrecy. Not only do these  companies guide what we see, read, and buy on a regular basis, but  their dominance--specifically in the market of information--now  requires that we consider their role in the integrity of our democracy.  Unfortunately, this fall's hearings demonstrated that they may not be  up to the challenge that they have created for themselves.   The size of these companies is not--in isolation--the problem, but I  am extremely concerned about these platforms' use of Americans'  personal information to further solidify their market power and  consequently extract unfair conditions from the content creators and  innovators who rely on their platforms to reach consumers. As has  become alarmingly clear in recent months, companies like Google,  Facebook, and Amazon have unprecedented power to guide Americans'  access to information and potentially shape the future of journalism.  It should go without saying that such power comes with great  responsibility.   Everyone is currently and rightfully focused on Russian manipulation  of social media, but as lawmakers, it is incumbent upon us to ask the  broader questions: How did big tech come to control so many aspects of  our lives? How is it using our personal information to strengthen its  reach and its bottom line? Are these companies engaging in  anticompetitive behavior that restricts the free flow of information in  commerce? Are they failing to take simple precautions to respect our  privacy and to protect our democracy? And finally, what role should  these companies play in our lives, and how do we ensure transparency  and accountability from them going forward?   Modern technology has fundamentally altered the way we live our  lives, and it has given us extraordinary benefits. As these companies  continue to grow and evolve, challenges like those we have recently  confronted in the Judiciary Committee will only grow and evolve with  them. So we must now muster the will to meaningfully address the tough  questions related to competition, privacy, and ultimately the integrity  of our democracy.   I will not be here to ask those questions. I will do what I can to  find the answers from the outside, but it is my colleagues in the  Senate who must prioritize them going forward. There is simply too much  at stake. I know that they will do so with the help of a tireless  advocacy community and the brilliant minds who have long contemplated  these incredibly complex issues and ensured that lawmakers pay  attention. And more importantly, they will do so with the support and  encouragement of the American people.   I have witnessed significant highs and significant lows in the fight  to protect consumers' rights, but the most important lesson I have  learned along the way is that ordinary Americans can wield  extraordinary power when they raise their voices. For this reason and  despite significant setbacks in recent months, I know that it is the  public's interests that can ultimately prevail.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
