 Mr. Speaker, I associate myself with Mr.  Neal's remarks, and especially him framing this issue from the outside  about the arc of history.   As we have witnessed in this Chamber time and again, dating back to  Franklin Delano Roosevelt, when you look at the impact of 24 million  people, you have to look at your colleagues on the other side of the  aisle and say: Are you frozen in the ice of your indifference to what  impacts the daily lives of people who have showed up at our forums and  the forums that you have conducted?   The sheer humanity of what is taking place across this country cries  out for a solution. Yet all we have heard, as Mr. Neal said, is the  helter-skelter back and forth of who is winning politically, what is  happening with the Freedom Caucus, what is going to--if Trump loses, is  Ryan out?   The American people don't care about that. They care about their  families. And this is the institution that we were sent to to work on  their behalf. It is up to us to come together and work on behalf of the  American people.   This is not a healthcare bill. This is a tax bill. We are going to  work on that later on, but we shouldn't start by saying that we are  going to have a transfer of wealth in this Chamber from people who are  begging and pleading and showing up at the townhalls and asking for our  help, and our answer is a transfer of wealth in a tax bill. Everybody  wants to know why we are taking this up first and not taxes. Because it  is a tax bill, that is why.                                time  1430
