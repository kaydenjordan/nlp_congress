 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Maggie  Scarlett of Wilson, Wyoming, who has been awarded an honorary doctorate  from the University of Wyoming.   This is the highest award the university confers. Maggie's tireless  work on behalf of our great State warrants this well-deserved honor.   Maggie was awarded this honorary doctorate of humane letters for her  lifetime of work creating and expanding museum and library collections.  Throughout her life, Maggie has given so much back to our great State  and our citizens, and she has demonstrated a lifelong commitment to the  importance of museums and libraries in preserving our heritage and our  history.   She served as a public school teacher in communities across Wyoming  and brought educational opportunities, including in the field of speech  language pathology, to rural Wyoming.   Maggie was 1 of 10 founding trustees of the National Museum of  Wildlife Art in Jackson, Wyoming, and she was instrumental in securing  its recognition as the National Museum of Wildlife Art of the United  States.   She also serves on the board of the Buffalo Bill Center of the West  in her hometown of Cody, Wyoming, and she earned an appointment by  President George W. Bush to serve on the board of the Institute of  Museum and Library Services.   Mr. Speaker, Maggie Scarlett is a true inspiration and has set an  example for her children, her seven grandchildren, her friends, and  people all across our State and Nation. I am extremely grateful for her  contributions, and I am blessed to call her my friend.   Maggie and her family deserve to be extremely proud of her work and  of this honor.                            ____________________
