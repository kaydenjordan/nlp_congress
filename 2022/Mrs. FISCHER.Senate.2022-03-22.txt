 Mr. President, earlier this month, the commanders of  the U.S. Strategic Command and the U.S. Space Command, ADM Charles  Richard and GEN James Dickinson, testified before the Senate Armed  Services Committee for their annual posture hearing.   The backdrop for their testimony was two twin challenges facing the  United States and our allies: Putin's desire to recreate the Russian  Empire, demonstrated most recently in his unprovoked and unjustified  invasion of Ukraine, and China's plan to massively expand their power,  rolling back U.S. influence in the process.   Both of these American adversaries are expanding their nuclear  arsenals to back up their ambitions.   As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces and with  STRATCOM's headquarters in my State of Nebraska, I appreciated this  chance to engage with Admiral Richard on such an important issue.   As the commander of STRATCOM, Admiral Richard has one of the highest  pressure jobs in the world--overseeing America's nuclear forces. He  knows  [[Page S1287]]  better than anyone how important our nuclear deterrent is to preventing  war around the world, and he understands the threat posed by our  adversaries' growing arsenals.   Admiral Richard told the Armed Services Committee that Putin's war in  Ukraine is giving us ``a very vivid real-world example of the  importance of extended deterrence.'' What he meant by that is that,  even though Putin has brought a major war back to Europe for the first  time since the end of World War II and heartbreaking destruction to the  people of Ukraine, nuclear deterrence, including the extended  deterrence commitments that we provide our allies, has shielded NATO  countries and discouraged the conflict's spread. More specifically,  without our nuclear deterrent, our plans to protect American citizens  and our allies would fall apart.    Take it straight from Admiral Richard. He said:         Every operational plan in the Department of Defense, and       every other capability we have, rests on the assumption that       strategic deterrence is holding, and in particular that       nuclear deterrence is holding.        If strategic or nuclear deterrence fails, no other plan and       no other capability in the Department of Defense is going to       work as designed.    When people who care about a safe and secure America say that  strategic deterrence, especially nuclear deterrence, is the bedrock of  our national security, that is exactly what we mean because, at the end  of the day, American strength is the only thing that tyrants like Putin  actually respect.   Just as we need to reassess our approach to Putin in light of his  invasion of Ukraine, we also need to rethink our approach to our  nuclear deterrent. Barely 2 months ago, on January 3, the five members  of the U.N. Security Council released a joint declaration on  ``Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races.'' Russia, of course,  is one of those five members.   People who want our deterrence to continue aging while Russia and  China modernize their own forces, including many members of the media,  rushed to hail the joint statement as a long-awaited and revolutionary  breakthrough. They seemed certain that we had turned a corner and that  by signing this statement, we were ushering in a new and enduring era  of world peace.   I was skeptical. I wrote an op-ed in National Review Online that  responded to what I called the ``delusional'' parts of that statement  and the wishful thinking that led the United States to sign our name  next to those of Russia and China.   More than a month before Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, I  wrote:         This would be a historic moment for international unity--or       rather, it would be if it were true. China and Russia may       have signed this document, but they do not intend to honor       it.    They clearly did not.   Since then, Russia has put their deterrent on high alert, essentially  threatening to use their nukes against the other countries that signed  that statement. I believe it was clear to anyone who had been paying  attention that signing our names to a feel-good piece of paper wasn't  actually going to change anything about Putin's behavior or the  behavior of China.   While our deterrent remains effective, we are asking it to protect  against a growing range of threats. Russia is continuing the deadliest  war in Europe in nearly a century, and the Chinese Communist Party-- well, they are hard at work expanding their own nuclear arsenal. And  they are doing it at a pace we have never seen in world history.   I asked Admiral Richard about the U.S. intelligence community's  estimate that China plans to potentially quadruple their nuclear  arsenal by the year 2030. He told the committee:         Last fall, I formally reported to the Secretary of Defense       the PRC's strategic breakout. Their expansion and       modernization in 2021 alone is breathtaking. And the concern       I expressed in my testimony last April has now become a       reality.    China is attempting a rapid buildup of unprecedented scope and scale,  and we have no reason to think they will stop once they reach the  Pentagon's estimate. We have even less reason to think it will take  China 8 more years to grow their stockpile to 1,000 deliverable  warheads.   Admiral Richard agreed. In response to my questioning, he said:         Whatever the time estimate that the intelligence community       gives you on anything from China, divide it by two and maybe       by four and you will get closer to the right answer.        So, no, I don't know that we have any idea of [China's]       endpoint and/or speed.    And as Admiral Richard pointed out at another point in the hearing,  many observers have gotten too caught up on the ``1,000 by 2030''  figure.   Since the Pentagon released their report in November of last year, an  unspoken assumption has developed that China will simply stop building  nukes once they reach that point, whether that is in 2025 or 2030. But  let me point out, the Chinese Communist Party has given us no reason to  think that that might be the case.   In fact, given their ambitions to take Taiwan and develop a Chinese  sphere of influence beyond Asia, I think it is very likely they will  continue building far beyond that number.   And even as China works to expand its nuclear arsenal, ours is  rapidly aging. The United States has not designed or built a new  nuclear warhead since the end of the Cold War. We don't even have the  ability to produce a new warhead right now, and we are the only nuclear  power unable to do so. China and Russia can. The United Kingdom can.  France can. And India and Pakistan can. Even North Korea can.   But here in the United States, we cannot. Instead, we have focused on  extending the life of our current systems. This has pushed our  deterrent far beyond its designed lifetime and made the need for  modernization even more acute.   Admiral Richard went out of his way to stress this point during his  testimony. He told the Senate Armed Services Committee:         Right now, I am executing my strategic deterrence mission       under historic stress, crisis levels of deterrence, crisis       deterrence dynamics that we've only seen a couple of times in       our nation's history.        And I'm doing it with submarines built in the '80s and       '90s, an air-launched cruise missile built in the '80s,       intercontinental ballistic missiles built in the '70s, a       bomber built in the '60s, part of our nuclear command and       control that predates the internet, and a nuclear weapons       complex that dates back to the Manhattan era.   We have ignored the need to modernize our deterrence for far too  long. As Admiral Richard said at another point during his testimony:  The nuclear force we have today is the absolute minimum we need to  guarantee our security.   The world has only gotten more dangerous over the past decade, and  the last few weeks in Ukraine are the latest evidence of that.   But Washington--well, Washington has spent that time procrastinating.   Our failure to make tough decisions has left Admiral Richard with a  deterrent that simply hasn't kept up with those of our adversaries. The  final piece of Admiral Richard's testimony I will read is this:         We have reached a point where we can no longer deter with       the leftovers of the Cold War. We have life extended them to       the maximum extent possible.        We must now start to recapitalize, remanufacture those that       require a very robust infrastructure . . . We're 10 years       behind the point where we needed to start recapitalizing the       infrastructure . . . And the consequence is we simply won't       have the capabilities that we are going to have to have to       deter the threat environment we're in.    We cannot keep kicking the can down the road. We are not in the 1990s  or the 2000s anymore. The threat environment is changing, and we have  no choice but to keep up. But our nuclear deterrent is sized based on  the 2010 New START Treaty, written in a very different world, before  Putin decided to behave like a war criminal and before China's  unprecedented nuclear breakout.   To wrap up, I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to an  exchange from the Foreign Relations Committee's hearings during the  ratification process for the New START Treaty.   Responding to a question about whether the posture set by the treaty  left the United States with nuclear forces beyond what we needed, the  STRATCOM commander at the time, GEN Kevin Chilton, completely rejected  that idea. He said instead:         I think the arsenal that we have is exactly what is needed       today to provide the deterrent.    We need to think long and hard about if a deterrent designed around  the  [[Page S1288]]  threats of 2010 is still what is needed for the very different and much  more dangerous world we live in now.   I hope the administration will address that question in its upcoming  Nuclear Posture Review. In fact, the upcoming fiscal year budget and  various strategy documents we expect to be released soon, including the  NPR, are a chance for the administration to show that they do  understand the challenges that we face. Most fundamentally, that is the  erosion of global stability and the increasingly challenging threat  environment facing our country.   These documents are an opportunity for President Biden to propose a  realistic plan to meet these threats. I hope that he will. The hard  truth is that every day that we refuse to commit to the modernization  schedule today's world needs is a day that Russia and China become  greater threats. They get further ahead.   If we wait too long, we are going to wake up 5, 10, 20 years from now  with no way to deter adversaries who did commit to modernization. That  is not a position anyone wants to wind up in.   We need to act like adults and make difficult choices to prioritize  our nuclear deterrent, the most fundamental part of our defense  strategy. And we have to keep modernization on schedule in the FY2023  NDAA.   I yield the floor.
