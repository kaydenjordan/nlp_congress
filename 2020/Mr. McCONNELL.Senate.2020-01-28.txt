 Mr. Chief Justice, we expect several hours of session  today, with probably one quick break in the middle.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res  483, the counsel for the President have 15 hours and 33 minutes  remaining to make the presentation of their case, though it will not be  possible to use the remainder of that time before the end of the day.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S619, January 28, 2020, second column, the following  appears: The CHIEF JUSTICE.

Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res 483, the counsel for the  President have 15 hours and 33 minutes    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The Senate will now hear you.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, just  to give you a very quick, brief overview of today, we do not intend to  use much of that time today. Our goal is to be finished by dinnertime  and well before. We will have three presentations. First will be Pat  Philbin, Deputy White House counsel. Then, Jay Sekulow will give a  presentation. We will take a break, if that is OK with you, Mr. Leader.  And then, after that, I will finish with a presentation. That is our  goal for the day. With that, I will turn it over to Pat Philbin.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate,  Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer, I would like to  start today by making a couple of observations related to the abuse of  power charge in the first Article of Impeachment. I wouldn't presume to  elaborate on Professor Dershowitz' presentation from yesterday evening,  which I thought was complete and compelling, but I wanted to add a  couple of very specific points in support of the exposition of the  Constitution and the impeachment clause that he set out.   It begins from a focus on the point in the debate about the  impeachment clause at the Constitutional Convention where  maladministration was offered by George Mason as a grounds for  impeachment, and James Madison responded that that was a bad idea, and  he said: ``So vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during the  pleasure of the Senate.'' That evinced the deep-seated concern that  Madison had, and it is part of the whole design of our Constitution for  ways that can lead to exercises of arbitrary power.   The Constitution was designed to put limits and checks on all forms  of government power. Obviously, one of the great mechanisms for that is  the separation of powers--the structural separation of powers in our  Constitution. But it also comes from defining and limiting powers and  responsibilities and a concern that vague terms, vague standards are  themselves an opportunity for the expansion of power and the exercise  of arbitrary power. We see that throughout the Constitution and in the  impeachment clause as well. This is why, as Gouverneur Morris argued in  discussing the impeachment clause, that only few offenses--he said few  offenses--ought to be impeachable, and the cases ought to be enumerated  and defined.   Many terms had been included in earlier drafts, when it was narrowed  down to treason and bribery, and there was a suggestion to include  maladministration, which had been a ground for impeachment in English  practice. The Framers rejected it because it was too vague; it was too  expansive. It would allow for arbitrary exercises of power.    We see throughout the Constitution, in terms that relate and fit in  with the impeachment clause, the same concern. One is in the definition  of ``treason.'' The Framers were very concerned that the English  practice of having a vague concept of treason that was malleable and  could be changed even after the fact to define new concepts of treason  was dangerous. It was one of the things that they wanted to reject from  the English system. So  [[Page S620]]  they defined in the Constitution very specifically what constituted  treason and how it had to be proved, and then that term was  incorporated into the impeachment clause.   Similarly, in the rejection of maladministration, which had been an  impeachable offense in England, the Framers rejected that because it  was vague. A vague standard, something that is too changeable, that can  be redefined, that can be malleable after the fact, allows for the  arbitrary exercise of power, and that would be dangerous to give that  power to the legislature as a power to impeach the executive.   Similarly--and it relates again to the impeachment clause--one of the  greatest dangers from having changeable standards that existed in the  English system was bills of attainder. Under a bill of attainder, the  Parliament could pass a specific law saying that a specific person had  done something unlawful--they were being attainted--even though it  wasn't unlawful before that.   The Framers rejected that entire concept. In article I, section 9,  they eliminated both bills of attainder and all ex post facto laws for  criminal penalties at the Federal level, and they also included a  provision to prohibit States from using bills of attainder.   In the English system, there was a relationship, to some extent,  between impeachment and bills of attainder because both were tools of  the Parliament to get at officials in the government. You could impeach  them for an established offense or you could pass a bill of attainder.   It was because the definition of ``impeachment'' was being narrowed  that George Mason at the debates suggested--he pointed out--that in the  English system there is a bill of attainder. It has been a great,  useful tool for the government, but we are eliminating that, and now we  are getting a narrow definition of ``impeachment,'' and we ought to  expand it to include ``maladministration.'' Madison said no, and the  Framers agreed: We have to have enumerated and defined offenses--not a  vague concept, not something that can be blurry and interpreted after  the fact and that could be used, essentially, to make policy  differences or other differences like that the subject of impeachment.   All of the steps that the Framers took in the way they approached the  impeachment clause were in terms of narrowing, restricting,  constraining, and enumerating offenses and not a vague and malleable  approach, as they had been in the English system.   I think the minority views of Republican Members of the House  Judiciary Committee at the time of the Nixon impeachment inquiry summed  this up and reflected it well because they explained--and I am quoting  from the minority views in the report:         The whole tenor of the Framers' discussions, the whole       purpose of their many careful departures from English       impeachment practice, was in the direction of limits and of       standards. An impeachment power exercised without extrinsic       and objective standards would be tantamount to the use of       bills of attainder and ex post facto laws, which are       expressly forbidden by the Constitution and are contrary to       the American spirit of justice.    What we see in the House managers' charges and their definition of  abuse of power is exactly antithetical to the Framers' approach because  their very premise for their abuse of power charge is that it is  entirely based on subjective motive--not objective standards, not  predefined offenses, but the President can do something that is  perfectly lawful, perfectly within his authority. But if the real  reason, as Professor Dershowitz pointed out--that is the language from  their report--the reason in the President's mind is something that they  ferret out and decide is wrong, that becomes impeachable, and that is  not a standard at all. It ends up being infinitely malleable.   It is something that I think--a telling factor that reflects how  malleable it is and how dangerous it is in the House Judiciary's report  because after they define their concept of abuse of power and they say  that it involves your exercising government power for personal interest  and not the national interest and it depends on your subjective  motives, they realize that is infinitely malleable.   There is not really a clear standard there, and it is violating a  fundamental premise of the American system of justice that you have to  have notice of what is wrong. You have to have notice of an offense.  This is something Professor Dershowitz pointed out last night. There  has to be a defined offense in advance. The way they try to resolve  this is to say: Well, in addition to our definition, high crimes and  misdemeanors involve conduct that is recognizably wrong to a reasonable  person. And that is their kind of add-on to deal with the fact that  they have an unconstitutionally vague standard.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S620, January 28, 2020, second column, the following  appears: There is not really a clear standard there, and it is  violating a fundamental premise of the American system of justice  that you have to have notice of what is wrong.

This is something Professor Dershowitz pointed out last . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================      They don't have a standard that really defines a specific offense.  They don't have a standard that really defines, in coherent terms that  are going to be identifiable, what the offenses are, so they just add  on. It has to be recognizably wrong.   They say they are doing this to resolve a tension, they call it,  within the Constitution because they point out--and this is quoting  from the report--``The structure of the Constitution, including its  prohibition on bills of attainder and the ex post facto clause, implies  that peaceable offenses should not come as a surprise.''   That is exactly what Professor Dershowitz pointed out. And everything  about the terms of the Constitution, speaking of an offense and a  conviction, that crime should be tried by jury except impeachments.  They all talk about impeachment in those criminal offense terms.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S620, January 28, 2020, second column, the following  appears: That is exactly what Professor Derschowitz pointed out.

And everything about the  terms of the Constitution, speaking of an offense and a . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================      But the tension here isn't within the Constitution; it is between the  House managers' definition, which lacks any coherent definition of an  offense that would catch people by surprise and the Constitution. That  is the tension that they are trying to resolve between their malleable  standards that actually states no clear offense and the Constitution  and the principles of justice embodied in the Constitution that  requires some clear offense.   I wanted to point that out in relation to the standards for  impeachable offenses because it is another piece of the constitutional  puzzle that fits in with the exposition that Professor Dershowitz set  out. And it also shows an inherent flaw in the House managers' theory  of abuse of power, regardless of whether or not one accepts the view  that an impeachable offense has to be a defined crime. There is still  the flaw in their definition of abuse of power; that it is so  malleable, based on purely subjective standards, that it does not  provide any recognizable notice of an offense. It is so malleable that  it, in effect, recreates the offense of maladministration that the  Framers expressly rejected, as Professor Dershowitz explained.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S620, January 28, 2020, third column, the following  appears: I wanted to point that out in relation to the standards  for impeachable offenses because it is another piece of the  constitutional puzzle that fits in with the exposition that  Professor Derschowitz set out.

How are we supposed to get the proof of what is inside  the President's head because, of course, motive is inherently difficult  to prove when you are talking about, as they conceded they are talking  about, perfectly lawful actions, on their face, within the  constitutional authority of the President? They want to make it  impeachable if it is just the wrong idea inside the President's head.  And they explain in the House Judiciary Committee report that the way  we will tell if the President had the wrong motive is we will compare  what he did to what staffers in the executive branch said he ought to  do. They say that the President ``disregarded United States foreign  policy towards Ukraine'' and that he ignored ``official'' policy that  he had been briefed on and that ``he ignored, defied, and confounded  every . . . agency within the Executive Branch.''   That is not a constitutionally coherent statement. The President  cannot defy agencies within the executive branch. Article II, section 1  of the Constitution vests all of the Executive power in a President of  the United States. He alone is an entire branch of government. He sets  policy for the executive branch. He is given vast power. And, of  course, within limits set by laws passed by Congress and within limits  set by spending priorities--spending laws passed by Congress--he,  within those constraints, sets the policies of the government. And in  areas of foreign affairs, military affairs, national security--which is  what we are dealing with in this case--in foreign affairs and head of  state communications, he has vast powers.   As Professor Dershowitz explained, for over two centuries, the  President  [[Page S621]]  has been regarded as the sole organ of the Nation in foreign affairs.  So the idea that we are going to find out when the President has a  wrong subjective motive by comparing what he did to the recommendations  of some interagency consensus among staffers is fundamentally anti- constitutional. It inverts the constitutional structure, and it is also  fundamentally anti-democratic because our system is rather unique in  the amount of power that it gives to the President.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S620, January 28, 2020, third column, the following  appears: As Professor Derschowitz explained, for over two  centuries, the President . . .      The online Record has been corrected to read: As Professor  Dershowitz explained, for over two centuries, the President . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The Executive here has much more power than in a parliamentary  system, but part of the reason that the President can have that power  is if he is directly democratically accountable to the people. There is  an election every 4 years to ensure that the President stays  democratically accountable to the people. Those staffers in these  supposed interagencies who have their meetings and make recommendations  to the President are not accountable to the people. There is no  democratic legitimacy or accountability to their decisions or  recommendations. And that is why the President, as head of the  executive branch, has the authority to actually set policies and make  determinations, regardless of what his staffers may recommend. They are  there to provide information and recommendations, not to set policy.    The idea that we are going to start impeaching Presidents by deciding  that they have illicit motives if we can show they disagree with some  interagency consensus is fundamentally contrary to the Constitution and  fundamentally anti-democratic. Those were the two observations I wanted  to add to supplement specific points on Professor Dershowitz' comments  from last night.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S621, January 28, 2020, first column, the following  appears: The idea that we are going to start impeaching Presidents  by deciding that they have illicit motives if we can show they  disagree with some interagency consensus is fundamentally contrary  to the Constitution and fundamentally anti-democratic.

Those were the two  observations I wanted to add to supplement specific points on  Professor Dershowitz' comments from last night . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================      I want to shift gears and respond to a couple of points that the  House managers have brought up that are really completely extraneous to  this proceeding. They involve matters that are not charged in the  Articles of Impeachment. They do not relate directly to the President  and his actions, but they are accusations that were brought up somewhat  recklessly, in any event, and we can't close without some response to  them. The first has to do with the idea that somehow the White House  and White House lawyers were involved in some sort of coverup related  to the transcript of the July 25 call because it was stored on a highly  classified system.   Let me start with that. The House managers made this accusation of  something nefarious going on. Let's see what the witnesses actually had  to say. LTC Alexander Vindman--remember Lieutenant Colonel Vindman is  the person who was listening in on the call and who raised a concern.  He was the only person who went and raised a concern with NSC lawyers  that he thought there was something improper, something wrong with the  call. Even though he later conceded under cross-examination it was  really a policy concern, but he thought there was something wrong.   And he had to say: ``I do not think there was malicious intent or  anything of that nature . . . to cover anything up.''   He is the one who went and talked to the lawyers. He is the one whose  complaint spurred the idea that, wait, there might be something that is  really sensitive here. Let's make sure this is not going to leak. He  thought there was nothing covering it up.   His boss, Senior Director Tim Morrison, had similar testimony.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Mr. Chief Justice, we will be in recess for 15  minutes.   There being no objection, at 2:18 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 2:44 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate will come to order. Please be seated.   Mr. Cipollone.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. I thank Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the  Senate.   Well, I had kind of a lengthy presentation prepared, but I think you  have heard a lot from our side, and I think we have made our case.   I just want to leave you with a couple of points. First of all, I  thank the majority leader and thank Democratic Leader Schumer and all  of you for the privilege of speaking on the floor of the Senate and for  your time and attention. We really appreciate it.   We made three basic points. One, all you need in this case is the  Constitution and your common sense. If you just look at the Articles of  Impeachment, the Articles of Impeachment fall far short of any  constitutional standard, and they are dangerous. If you look to the  words from the past that I think are instructive, as I said last night,  they are instructive because they were right then and they are right  now, and I will leave you with some of those words.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Mr. Chief Justice, I have reached an agreement with  the Democratic leader on how to proceed during the question period.  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the question period for  Senators start when the Senate reconvenes on Wednesday; further, that  the questions alternate between the majority and minority sides for up  to 8 hours during that session of the Senate; and finally, that on  Thursday, the Senate resume time for Senators' questions, alternating  between sides for up to 8 hours during that session of the Senate.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. Chief Justice, we will complete the question  period over the next 2 days. I remind Senators that their questions  must be in writing and will be submitted to the Chief Justice. During  the question period of the Clinton trial, Senators were thoughtful and  brief with their questions, and the managers and counsel were succinct  in their answers. I hope we can follow both of these examples during  this time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. During the impeachment trial of President Clinton,  Chief Justice Rehnquist advised ``counsel on both sides that the Chair  will operate on a rebuttable presumption that each question can be  fully and fairly answered in 5 minutes or less.'' The transcript  indicates that the statement was met with ``laughter.''  [[Page S627]]    Nonetheless, managers and counsel generally limited their responses  accordingly. I think the late Chief's time limit was a good one and  would ask both sides to abide by it.                            ____________________     Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the  trial adjourn until 1 p.m., Wednesday, January 29, and that this order  also constitute the adjournment of the Senate.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 2:54 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, January 29, 2020, at 1 p.m.                            ____________________
