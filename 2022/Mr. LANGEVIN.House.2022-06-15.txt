 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Lower  Food and Fuel Costs Act.   Every day, I hear from Rhode Islanders rightly frustrated by the  rising cost of everyday goods.   Exacerbated by Putin's invasion of Ukraine, grocery bills are  climbing higher, gas costs more than $5 per gallon, and tangled supply  chains continue to fuel inflation.   The American people are being pushed to the breaking point. The  status quo is simply unacceptable.   This bill will provide relief to Americans feeling the pain at the  pump by boosting domestic biofuel production, and it will drive down  costs at the grocery store.   Best of all, Democrats have worked hand-in-glove with our Republican  colleagues to advance this bipartisan legislation out of committee and  onto the House floor.   Madam Speaker, this legislation is a great step in the right  direction, but we must do more. We must crack down on gas companies  exploiting this crisis for profit.   Like President Biden suggested, we must work with oil companies to  address supply and capacity shortages.   Finally, if we don't want to be back to this point ever again, we  must accelerate our transition away from fossil fuels once and for all.  The American people are counting on us.                            ____________________
