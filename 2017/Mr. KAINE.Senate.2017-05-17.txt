 Mr. President, today I want to discuss legislation I am  introducing, the School Infrastructure Modernization Act.   To claim the federal tax credit for historic preservation, a building  renovation must be for a different purpose than that for which the  building was previously used, a requirement known as the ``prior use''  rule. This bill waives that requirement for renovations of K-12 public  school buildings. This will make it easier to restore historic-but- dilapidated school buildings across the country so our children have  safe, modern spaces in which to learn.   As a Richmond City Council member and later Mayor, I faced challenges  familiar to many municipalities--overcrowded schools, aging buildings,  and limited dollars in the budget. But in one particular case, I and a  group of local stakeholders identified a creative solution. On one hand  we had an overcrowded Thomas Jefferson High School with in-zone and  magnet students. On the other hand, we had a closed Maggie Walker High  School that needed renovations. We put together a financing package  that made use of federal and state historic tax credits to renovate  Maggie Walker High School and satisfied the prior use rule by  consolidating the magnet program from Thomas Jefferson into a new  Maggie Walker Governor's School for Government and  [[Page S3014]]  International Studies. Today, some 20 years later, this is one of  America's highest performing public high schools. Without the federal  historic tax credit, this would have been too expensive to make happen.   This bill will make it easier to do similar projects around the  country. More modern school buildings will bolster the quality of  public education, and carrying out these projects will generate private  sector infrastructure investment and jobs. In Virginia alone, according  to a 2013 study, more than 800 K-12 schools are at least 50 years old,  representing some 40% of all the K-12 schools in the Commonwealth.   As the Senate considers tax reform and a comprehensive infrastructure  package, I encourage my colleagues to support this common-sense  incentive that is good for education, good for infrastructure, and good  for jobs.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Young, Mr. Tillis, Mr. Durbin,          Mr. Rubio, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms.          Warren, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. Gillibrand, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs.          Shaheen, Mr. Franken, Mr. Peters, Mr. Coons, Ms. Stabenow, Mr.          Booker, Mr. Markey, Mr. Brown, Ms. Baldwin, and Mr. Wyden):   S. 1158. A bill to help prevent acts of genocide and other atrocity  crimes, which threaten national and international security, by  enhancing United States Government capacities to prevent, mitigate, and  respond to such crises; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.
