 Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege and honor  today to congratulate the University of South Carolina women's  basketball team on winning the NCAA National Championship. It is a  great day to be a Gamecock.   After a heartbreaking loss in the Final Four last year, South  Carolina found redemption Sunday night, earning the program's second  national championship title with a 64-49 victory over second seed  UConn.   The Gamecock women's basketball team had an incredible season with a  35-2 record, averaging 70 points a game.   While every member of the team played their hearts out, Aliyah  Boston, the Southeastern Conference Player of the Year, won the Final  Four Most Outstanding Player award. She is the first South Carolina  player to earn that honor since A'ja Wilson in 2017.   Coach Dawn Staley had an incredible season. Hard work breeds success,  and this team is a prime example of that. The national title is a win  for South Carolina and every fan who helped cheer them to victory.    Congratulations, Gamecocks, on being the national champions once  again.                            ____________________
