 Madam Speaker, last month, a judge delivered a ruling to  gut the Affordable Care Act, a warning shot that was fired at millions  of Americans of all ages, backgrounds, and beliefs. The decision  changed little immediately, but that didn't matter. Patients again  panicked because, yes, they have been here before.   The family with a young child who will spend their entire life  battling diabetes, the father in remission, the young woman facing  addiction desperately seeking treatment, over the past 2 years, they  have watched their government, led by a Republican Congress and a  reckless President, come after their healthcare coverage again and  again and again.   So families wake up wondering if this is the day. Is this the day  where they succeed, the day the President finally wins, the day my  coverage goes away, the day I have to face my loved ones, my kids, my  ailing parents, and tell them that we can't afford the care to make  their suffering go away?   They deserve better, and that is why I ask everyone to support this  rules package.
