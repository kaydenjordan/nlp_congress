 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I join my colleagues in expressing the will to have an honest debate  of the War Powers Act, should the majority party choose to do so.   Before I move any further, I submit for the Record a report from the  Director of National Intelligence on Barack Obama's use of drones, an  average of 67 drone strikes a year over his first 7 years in office,  killing an average of six enemy combatants a week, wherein the majority  said absolutely nothing about it at the time.  Summary of Information Regarding U.S. Counterterrorism Strikes Outside                        Areas of Active Hostilities         In accordance with the President's direction and consistent       with the President's commitment to providing as much       information as possible to the American people about U.S.       counterterrorism activities, the Director of National       Intelligence (DNI) is releasing today a summary of       information provided to the DNI about both the number of       strikes taken by the U.S. Government against terrorist       targets outside areas of active hostilities and the assessed       number of combatant and non-combatant deaths resulting from       those strikes. ``Areas of active hostilities'' currently       include Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria.     Summary of U.S. Counterterrorism Strikes Outside Areas of Active         Hostilities between January 20, 2009 and December 31, 2015         Total number of strikes against terrorist targets outside       areas of active hostilities: 473.        Combatant deaths: 2372-2581.        Non-combatant deaths: 64-116.        The assessed range of non-combatant deaths provided to the       DNI reflects consideration of credible reports of non-      combatant deaths drawn from all-source information, including       reports from the media and non-  [[Page H84]]       governmental organizations. The assessed range of non-      combatant deaths includes deaths for which there is an       insufficient basis for assessing that the deceased is a       combatant.         U.S. Government Post-Strike Review Processes and Procedures         The information that was provided to the DNI regarding       combatant and non-combatant deaths is the result of processes       that include careful reviews of all strikes after they are       conducted to assess the effectiveness of operations. These       review processes have evolved over time to ensure that they       incorporate the best available all-source intelligence, media       reporting, and other information and may result in       reassessments of strikes if new information becomes available       that alters the original judgment. The large volume of pre-       and post-strike data available to the U.S. Government can       enable analysts to distinguish combatants from non-      combatants, conduct detailed battle damage assessments, and       separate reliable reporting from terrorist propaganda or from       media reports that may be based on inaccurate information.    Discrepancies Between U.S. Government and Non-Governmental Assessments         In releasing these figures, the U.S. Government       acknowledges that there are differences between U.S.       Government assessments and reporting from non-governmental       organizations. Reports from non-governmental organizations       can include both aggregate data regarding non-combatant       deaths as well as case studies addressing particular strikes,       and generally rely on a combination of media reporting and,       in some instances, field research conducted in areas of       reported strikes. Although these organizations' reports of       non-combatant deaths resulting from U.S. strikes against       terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities vary       widely, such reporting generally estimates significantly       higher figures for non-combatant deaths than is indicated by       U.S. Government information. For instance, for the period       between January 20, 2009 and December 31, 2015, non-      governmental organizations' estimates range from more than       200 to slightly more than 900 possible non-combatant deaths       outside areas of active hostilities.        Consistent with the requirements applicable to future       reporting under Section 3(b) of the Executive Order ``United       States Policy on Pre- and Post-Strike Measures to Address       Civilian Casualties in U.S. Operations Involving the Use of       Force,'' the information we are releasing today addresses       general reasons for discrepancies between post-strike       assessments from the United States Government and credible       reporting from non-governmental organizations regarding non-      combatant deaths and does not address specific incidents.       There are a number of possible reasons that these non-      governmental organizations' reports of the number of       noncombatants killed may differ from the U.S. Government       assessments, based on the information provided to the DNI.        First, although there are inherent limitations on       determining the precise number of combatant and non-combatant       deaths, particularly when operating in non-permissive       environments, the U.S. Government uses post-strike       methodologies that have been refined and honed over the years       and that use information that is generally unavailable to       non-governmental organizations. The U.S. Government draws on       all available information (including sensitive intelligence)       to determine whether an individual is part of a belligerent       party fighting against the United States in an armed       conflict, taking a direct part in hostilities against the       United States, or otherwise targetable in the exercise of       national self-defense. Thus, the U.S. Government may have       reliable information that certain individuals are combatants,       but are being counted as non-combatants by nongovernmental       organizations. For example, further analysis of an       individual's possible membership in an organized armed group       may include, among other things: the extent to which an       individual performs functions for the benefit of the group       that are analogous to those traditionally performed by       members of a country's armed forces; whether that person is       carrying out or giving orders to others within the group; or       whether that person has undertaken certain acts that reliably       connote meaningful integration into the group.        Second, according to information provided to the DNI, U.S.       Government post-strike reviews involve the collection and       analysis of multiple sources of intelligence before, during,       and after a strike, including video observations, human       sources and assets, signals intelligence, geospatial       intelligence, accounts from local officials on the ground,       and open source reporting. Information collected before a       strike is intended to provide clarity regarding the number of       individuals at a strike location as well as whether the       individuals are engaged in terrorist activity. Post-strike       collection frequently enables U.S. Government analysts to       confirm, among other things, the number of individuals killed       as well as their combatant status. The information is then       analyzed along with other all-source intelligence reporting.       This combination of sources is unique and can provide       insights that are likely unavailable to non-governmental       organizations.        Finally, non-governmental organizations' reports of       counterterrorism strikes attributed to the U.S. Government--      particularly their identification of non-combatant deaths--      may be further complicated by the deliberate spread of       misinformation by some actors, including terrorist       organizations, in local media reports on which some non-      governmental estimates rely.        Although the U.S. Government has access to a wide range of       information, the figures released today should be considered       in light of the inherent limitations on the ability to       determine the precise number of combatant and non-combatant       deaths given the non-permissive environments in which these       strikes often occur. The U.S. Government remains committed to       considering new, credible information regarding non-combatant       deaths that may emerge and revising previous assessments, as       appropriate.     Madam Speaker, if we want to have an  honest debate about the War Powers Act, then let's have an honest  debate about the War Powers Act.   Why didn't we hear anything from our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle about Libya when President Barack Obama took action that led  to the death of Muammar Qadhafi? Why not Syria? Why not Yemen? Why is  Iran individually spelled out in this resolution?   The only reason Iran is singled out in this resolution is to take a  political jab at President Trump for utilizing an airstrike to take out  General Soleimani, a terrorist who was responsible for killing  thousands of Americans, partner troops, and, yes, Iranians.   While our colleagues are upset with the use of airstrikes to kill  General Soleimani, I remind them that the Obama administration,  according to their own Director of National Intelligence, conducted  hundreds of airstrikes, averaging more than six kills a week between  January 2009 and December 2015, and that was in areas of  nonhostilities. That doesn't even include Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria,  which are classified numbers.   Let's just be honest about what this is. This is another partisan  attack against the President of the United States for killing General  Soleimani, who was a terrorist in an area where the President had the  absolute legal authority to operate.
