 Madam Speaker, it is time to put Harriet  Tubman on the $20 bill.   The Treasury has had this design in the works for years, and now, all  of a sudden, it is backpedaling. It takes 10 years, they say, to  complete this work.   During a 10-year period, Harriet Tubman made 19 round trips on the  underground railroad to lead over 300 slaves to freedom; and, in less  time, Treasury can't put this American hero on a piece of paper.   How long must it take to reflect our Nation's rich diversity on our  currency?  [[Page H5206]]    How long must it take to recognize an icon of freedom and courage?   How long must it take to rightfully acknowledge the work of a woman  who helped countless enslaved Americans of African descent?   How long must it take when the American people overwhelmingly  selected her as the face of the new $20 bill?   Harriet Tubman embodies the American spirit of strength and hope.   It is time to put a woman on the $20 bill. In this year, the 100th  anniversary of women's suffrage, we want to guarantee that Treasury  will follow through on this promise and this commitment.                            ____________________
