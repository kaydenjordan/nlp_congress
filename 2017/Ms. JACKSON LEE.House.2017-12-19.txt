 Mr. Speaker, a bill that is done in the dark of  night, in the midst of a crisis like the lack of Perkins funding for  our students, the lack of funding for CHIP and for healthcare for  millions of Americans--yet our friends on the other side go without  shame in passing the GOP tax scam bill.   In the Houston Chronicle, they aptly put winners and losers, and they  aptly put at the top of the winners The Trump Organization. This is a  Christmas gift for the Trump family--no one else--with huge cuts to the  uninsured, to commuters, and to homeowners in high-tax States. This is  not a fair distribution of funds, and it certainly is going to impact  those who are still suffering from hurricanes all over the Nation.   So I ask the question: Why the rush? Why the rush to give tax cuts to  the top 1 percent, and increasing taxes on millions of middle class  Americans, to pay for a permanent tax?   The American people have it right: a permanent tax cut for the rich.  This is the worst catastrophic bill that has ever been passed by the  Members of the Republican Party in the House of Representatives. It is  a shame.    Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget Committee, I  rise in strong and unyielding opposition to the rule and the Conference  Report to H.R. 1, the so-called ``Tax Cut and Jobs Act,'' which more  accurately should be called the ``Republican Tax Scam Act.''   There are four reasons why I oppose this cruel and immoral $1.7  trillion tax giveaway to wealthy corporations:   1. The GOP tax scam raises taxes on tens of millions of middle class  households and distributes the largest tax cuts to those in the top 1  percent causing $1.7 trillion to be added to the debt;   2. It eliminates or reduces tax benefits that directly benefit the  middle class at every stage of life;   3. It results in 13 million fewer Americans with health insurance  coverage; and   4. And it adds over $2 trillion dollars to deficit spending, which  triggers statutory PAYGO's automatic spending cuts to mandatory  programs such as Medicare, which along would see a $25 billion cut.   Instead of doing tax reform the Republicans have found new ways for  the wealthy who use tax accountants and lawyers to further game the tax  payer system by adding new loop holes that are only for the  corporations and the wealthy.   Corporations receive a 14 percentage point reduction in their  statutory tax rate, from 35 percent to 21 percent, the largest one-time  rate reduction in U.S. history.   Republicans designed this tax scam to benefit the wealthiest in our  country and now they are working as hard as possible to make sure  Americans are too busy looking the other way to notice.   I have to tell them that it is too late, the American public sees  what you are doing and they are not going to have any of it.   The Republican Tax Scam doubles the dollar amount at which the estate  tax, currently affecting only the wealthiest 2 in 100 families.   It lifts the level at which the alternative minimum tax (AMT) would  kick in, while dropping the top tax rate from the current 39.6 percent  to 37 percent.   Mr. Speaker, where are the promises made to working Americans to give  them a break.   Americans are not fooled; they know trickle-down economics has never  worked, and they see right through this phony tax plan and recognize it  for the scam that it is.   What people may not understand is they will not have to wait until  2027 to see the pain and misery that this tax cut will cause.   Congress has established mechanisms in rules that require pay-fors  when budget deficit spending reaching astronomical levels, like what we  have in this bill's wholesale giveaway of taxpayer money to  Corporations and the wealth--it is called PAYGO.   The PAYGO compels new spending or tax changes not to add to the  federal debt.   PAYGO requires that new spending must either be ``budget neutral'' or  offset with cuts to existing programs.   So the Tax cut that corporations will be getting today, will cost the  American workers dearly in next year when the Budget Committee must  draft a budget that will have to slash domestic programs to pay for  these cuts.   Mr. Speaker, as you may know, my constituents and others in Texas are  still struggling to recover from the devastation caused by Hurricane  Harvey, the worst storm ever to make landfall in the continental United  States.  [[Page H10198]]    Two weeks ago, nearly 8,000 of them took time out of their busy  schedules to join me in a tele-town hall to discuss the tax scheme that  has been rushed to the floor for a vote by the Republican leadership in  the hope of passing it before the American people learn its insidious  details.   My constituents understand and let me know that they believe it is  important that the United States has a tax system that is fair,  balanced, smart, and provides the resources and opportunities to allow  all Americans to reach their potential.   And by margins exceeding 90 percent, they reject:   1. Any cuts to Medicare or Medicaid to finance tax cuts for wealthy  corporations and the top 1 percent;   2. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction;   3. Eliminating the deductibility of state and local taxes;   4. Eliminating existing deductions for student loan interest or  making taxable college endowment funds or college fellowships expenses.   Mr. Speaker, my constituents, and Americans across the country,  oppose this unfair Republican tax giveaway because nearly half of the  $1.7 trillion tax cut goes to just the top one percent.   In fact, the average annual tax cut for the top one-tenth of one  percent is $320,000; for the top one percent it is $62,000, and for  those earning $1 million a year it is $68,000.   Nearly 25 percent of the tax cut goes to households in just the top  one-tenth of one percent, who make at least $5 million a year (2027).   While super-wealthy corporations and individuals are reaping  windfalls, millions of middle-class and working families will see their  taxes go up:   1. 13 million households face a tax increase next year.   2. 45 million households face a tax increase in 2027.   3. 29 million households (21 percent) earning less than $l00,000 a  year see a tax increase.   On average, families earning up to $86,000 annually would see a $794  increase in their tax liability, a significant burden on families  struggling to afford child care and balance their checkbook.   It is shocking, but not surprising, that under this Republican tax  scam, the total value of tax cuts for just the top one percent is more  than the entire tax cut for the lower 95 percent of earners.   Put another way, those earning more than $912,000 a year will get  more in tax cuts than 180 million households combined.   The core of this Republican tax scheme is a massive tax cut from 35  percent 20 percent corporations, but that is not the only way that the  wealthy are rewarded.   The massive tax cuts for corporations are permanent but temporary for  working and middle-class families.   Another immoral aspect of this terrible tax scam is that it abandons  families that face natural disasters or high medical costs by repealing  deductions for casualty losses and medical expenses.   Mr. Speaker, in what universe does it make any sense to eliminate, as  this bill would, a deduction for:   1. teachers who purchase supplies for their classroom;   2. moving expenses to take a new job and taxes employer-provided  moving expenses; or   3. Dependent care assistance, making it harder for families to afford  day care, nursery school, or care for aging parents?   This Republican tax scam jeopardizes American innovation and  competitiveness by eliminating the deduction for student loan interest,  which affects 12 million borrowers, and cuts total education assistance  by more than $64 billion.   Under the extraordinary leadership of President Obama and the  determined efforts of ordinary Americans, we pulled our way out from  under the worst of the foreclosure crisis when the housing bubble burst  in 2007.   Inexplicably, Republicans are now championing a tax scheme that will  make the homes of average Americans less valuable because deductions  for mortgage interest and property taxes are much less valuable than  under current law.    A tax plan that reduces home values, as this one does, puts pressure  on states and towns to collect revenues they depend on to fund schools,  roads, and vital public resources.   Mr. Speaker, an estimated 2.8 million Texas households deduct state  and local taxes with an average deduction of $7,823 in 2015.   But this is not the end of the bad news that will be delivered were  this tax scam to become law, not by a long shot.   The proposed elimination of the personal exemption will harm millions  of Texans by taking away the $4,050 deduction for each taxpayer and  claimed dependent; in 2015, roughly 9.3 million dependent exemptions  were claimed in the Lone Star State.   Equally terrible is that this Republican tax scam drastically reduces  the Earned Income Tax Credit, which encourages work for 2.7 million  low-income individuals in Texas, helping them make ends meet with an  average credit of $2,689.   The EITC and the Child Tax Credit lift about 1.2 million Texans,  including 663,000 children, out of poverty each year.   So to achieve their goal of giving more and more to the haves and the  ``have mores,'' our Republican friends are willing to betray seniors,  children, the most vulnerable and needy, and working and middle-class  families.   The $5.4 trillion cuts in program investments that will be required  to pay for this tax giveaway to wealthy corporations and individuals  will fall most heavily on low-income families, students struggling to  afford college, seniors, and persons with disabilities.   America will not be made great by financing a $1.7 trillion tax cut  for the rich by stealing $1.8 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid,  abandoning seniors and families in need, depriving students of  realizing a dream to attend college without drowning in debt, or  disinvesting in the working families.   America will not be positioned to compete and win in the global,  interconnected, and digital economy by slashing funding for scientific  research, the arts and humanities, job retraining, and clean energy  just to pay for a tax cut to corporations and individuals who do not  even need it.   Mr. Speaker, the tax scheme presented here by Republicans is not a  plan but a scam that represents a betrayal of our values as a nation.   This tax scam is not a revenue policy adapted for the real world that  real Americans live in but a fantasy resting on the monstrous belief  that the wealthy have too little money and that poor, working, and  middle-class families have too much.   Our Republican friends continue to cling to the fantasy belief that  their tax cuts for the rich will pay for themselves despite all  precedent to the contrary and evidence that their tax scheme is  projected by experts to lose between $3 trillion and $7 trillion.   Mr. Speaker, in evaluating the merits of a taxing system, it is not  enough to subject it only to the test of fiscal responsibility.   To keep faith with the nation's past, to be fair to the nation's  present, and to safeguard the nation's future, the plan must also pass  a ``moral test.''   The Republican tax bill fails both of these standards.   I strongly oppose the Conference Report to H.R. 1, the ``Republican  Tax Scam Act,'' and urge all Members to join me in voting against this  reckless, cruel, and heartless proposal that will do nothing to improve  the lives or well-being of middle and working class families, and the  poor and vulnerable `caught in the tentacles of circumstance.'   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 667 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:       ``SEC. 5. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST ANY TAX BILL THAT RAISES                     TAXES ON MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES BY ELIMINATING                     OR LIMITING THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION.         (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the House       of Representatives to consider any bill, joint resolution,       motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses, or       conference report that repeals or limits the State and Local       Tax Deduction (26 U.S.C. Sec. 164).        (b) Waiver in the House.--It shall not be in order in the       House of Representatives to consider a rule or order that       waives the application of subsection (a).

[[Page H10199]]                                          ____         The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget Committee, I  rise in strong and unyielding opposition to the Conference Report for  H.R. 1, the so-called ``Tax Cut and Jobs Act,'' which more accurately  should be called the ``Republican Tax Scam Act.''   With this Conference Report House and Senate Republicans have pulled  off a near-impossible feat: they have taken a bad bill and made it  worse, much worse.   I oppose this cruel and immoral $1.7 trillion tax giveaway to wealthy  corporations and the top one percent because it raises taxes on poor,  working, and middle class families; explodes the deficit by adding an  additional $2.2 trillion over ten years; and will require an estimated  $5.4 trillion cut in funding for the programs ordinary Americans depend  on for health security, educational opportunity, and economic progress.   Mr. Speaker, Americans are not fooled; they know trickle-down  economics has never worked, and they see right through this phony tax  plan and recognize it for the scam that it is.   That is why Americans reject this Republican tax giveaway by an  overwhelming 2:1 margin.   Here are just a few of the myriad reasons why this Republican Tax  Scam is by far the most unpopular tax measure ever considered by the  Congress:   1. Raises taxes on 86 million middle class families;   2. Gives 83 percent of the tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent and  explodes deficit by $1.7 trillion;   3. Gives new tax breaks to corporations shipping American jobs  overseas which will eliminate jobs and drive down American wages and  salaries.   4. The $1.5 trillion deficit that will be created by the GOP Tax Scam  will be used by the Republicans to justify devastating cuts in Medicare  and Medicaid.   This Republican tax plan is even more toxic to my constituents in the  Eighteenth Congressional District of Texas.   Mr. Speaker, as you may know, my constituents and others in Texas are  still struggling to recover from the devastation caused by Hurricane  Harvey, the worst storm ever to make landfall in the continental United  States.   And by margins exceeding 90 percent, they reject:   1. Any cuts to Medicare or Medicaid to finance tax cuts for wealthy  corporations and the top 1 percent;   2. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction;   3. Eliminating the deductibility of state and local taxes;   4.

Mr. Speaker, I hold in my hand the vote tally for  the ``Tax No Jobs'' bill. It is interesting, when you are asked about  the tax bill, they put the word ``jobs.''   This was a very close vote, and 12 Republicans understood this was  the worst vote, worst bill in the history of the United States; and the  reason is, of course, because tens of millions of middle class  households and those who need a tax break will not get it. $1.7  trillion in debt.   It eliminates tax benefits that directly impact the middle class, it  results in 13 million fewer Americans with health insurance, it adds  over $2 trillion in deficit spending, and it triggers PAYGO's automatic  spending cuts to mandatory programs.   So let me tell you, my voice is a little rough, but my heart is  strong. Social Security to the American people, it is going to be cut.  Medicare, it is going to be cut. The Medicaid, for those in nursing  homes like my friend who I visited over the weekend, will be cut.   And you know what? There will be no answer in jobs of corporations  who got low tax rates, lower than you.   This is a debacle so bad that it has to come back and we have to vote  again for it.   My voice is a little rough, but I am going out there to tell the  American people that this is the worst calamity since we collapsed  under the past Republican administration. Vote ``no'' every time you  see this bill because it is ``no'' for the American people.                            ____________________
