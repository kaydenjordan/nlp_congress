 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Karen  Bass of California, for her relentless work, and also my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle, including Congressman Chris Smith, for  working on this.   Mr. Speaker, today is a historic day. I stand on the U.S. House floor  to advocate for the passage of the Frederick Douglass Trafficking  Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act.   I have had many meetings with Kenneth Morris, Frederick Douglass'  great-great-great-grandson on this issue, sharing with him my work on  my bill, H.R. 246, from the last Congress, which improves the response  of victims of child sex trafficking. I am committed to ending human  trafficking and to ensuring that this bill honoring Frederick Douglass'  legacy becomes a law.   The Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection  Reauthorization Act puts $130 million in funding for the prevention,  protection, and, yes, prosecution of human trafficking. This investment  is so needed, Mr. Speaker, because victims of human trafficking often  live in the shadows of society. That is why it is up to all of us and  why it is a bipartisan bill.   This legislation makes an investment in education. We have heard what  it does with airports and what it does if you have survivors and  government working together.   So let me end by reminding all of us that, in the words of Frederick  Douglass, if we talk about protecting our children and preventing human  sex trafficking, he would say, as he has said, ``It is easier to build  strong children'' than to repair a broken system.   Let us talk about protection. These young girls and boys are  sometimes held by invisible chains. We are here today to remove those  chains.
