 Mr. Speaker, for millions of Americans,  homeownership stands as a source of personal and economic security and  is a defining part of the middle class life.   Earlier this month, under President Obama, the Federal Housing  Administration announced a plan to make mortgages more affordable for  nearly 1 million working and middle class families who are buying their  first homes. In his first hours in office, President Trump reversed  President Obama's plan with an executive action that will cost  Americans an average of $500 more per year to get a mortgage. Experts  project that 40,000 families who would have bought homes will no longer  be able to do so.   The Trump administration's order to make mortgages more expensive  will not strengthen our economy; it will not create jobs; it will not  make America great again--but it will make life harder for working  families.                            ____________________
