 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the  alarming crisis that is ocean acidification. This is not only an  environmental issue, but it is an economic issue as well, and one that  greatly impacts my congressional district in south Florida.   South Florida's world-famous beaches, delicious seafood, incomparable  fishing, boating, and sailing, and spectacular marine life are all  dependent on a healthy ocean. However, our oceans are becoming more and  more acidic as seawater absorbs increasing amounts of carbon pollution,  causing what is known as ocean acidification.   This increased acidity makes it harder for corals, oysters, shrimp,  lobster, and other sea animals to develop their shells or skeletons,  which they rely on for survival to grow. These organisms are extremely  important to the vitality of our ecosystem.   In addition, corals host a vast number of ocean species, protects  coastlines from large waves and hurricanes, and attract visitors with  its beauty.   Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration--NOAA-- also suggests that tourism, recreation, and fishing related to south  Florida's coral reefs alone generates more than $4.4 billion in local  sales and $2 billion in local income.   Ocean Conservancy, which is a tremendous environmental advocacy  group, has been a champion in raising awareness about the negative  impact of ocean acidification. Recently, they premiered an outstanding  documentary, a short film which highlighted two gentlemen who either  work for or own ocean-dependent businesses that are located in my  congressional district.   Dale Palomino, right over here, this fine-looking young man, he is  the general manager and head chef at Captain's Tavern Restaurant and  Seafood Market, a family-owned business in Miami and one of my favorite  places to dine with my husband, Dexter, and our grandkids.   And Captain Ray Rosher, right here, who owns and operates Miss Britt  Charter Fishing and R&R Tackle in Coconut Grove, also located in my  congressional district.   In addition, this film highlights ocean expert, Dr. Chris Langdon, a  professor from my alma mater, the University of Miami--Go Canes. His  research on coral reef ecosystems has allowed us to better understand  the capacity and limitations of coral to adapt to a changing physical  and chemical environment. Dr. Langdon has also been a leader in  bringing stakeholders together to learn about the threats posed by  ocean acidification to commercial and recreational fishing and tourism  industries throughout Florida.   These two gentleman know a lot about the impact of ocean  acidification on their business because saltwater recreational and  commercial fishing combined support an estimated 175,000 jobs across  our beautiful Sunshine State.   Mr. Speaker, it is truly astounding the amount of jobs and revenue  that come out of ocean-related industries. Our country enjoys thousands  of miles of coastlines with so many people benefiting from their  environment and providing jobs and nutrients for their family. From the  oyster hatcheries in the Pacific Northwest, to the lobster in Maine,  and South to the reefs and fish in Florida, the real world implications  of ocean acidification will spell trouble for these ocean-dependent  jobs, which is why we must not wait until the tragedy truly unfolds.   My constituents and I are also blessed to live, to work, and to play  in the paradise that is south Florida. Our kids and our grandkids, they  want to enjoy the same positive experiences we have, but in order to do  so, it is vital that we act now.   In Congress, we need to do a better job at listening to all  stakeholders who are speaking out, and we need to continue to promote  the valuable work of researchers, people like Dr. Langdon, the work  that they are doing to ensure that these important marine research  institutions and organizations have the resources they need.   My district is home to a community that cares deeply about the ocean,  and it is because of the efforts of folks like these two gentlemen and  Dr. Langdon of south Florida that I have learned more about the issues  and what is at stake.   I remain committed to continue to work with my colleagues, with  industry experts, with all stakeholders in tackling head-on these  important issues and lead in mitigation and adaption solutions to the  changing ocean around us and, indeed, across the globe.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Lieutenant  Commander Miguel Santiesteban, who is receiving the U.S. Navy's  nomination to be commander. Having fled Castro's regime at a young age,  Miguel moved with his family to south Florida.   Driven by his desire to serve our great country, Miguel joined the  Navy in 1989. While stationed in Japan as a deck seaman, Miguel was one  of the few selected to attend the Hospital Corpsman ``A'' School.   He earned a master's degree in healthcare service administration at  my alma mater, Florida International University.   Miguel was commissioned in 2001 and completed his first duty  assignment at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He is  currently an administrative officer for research and development at the  U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery.   Miguel has earned many accolades, including the Defense Meritorious  Service Medal, the NATO Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal  several times. Miguel lives the Navy's core values of honor, courage,  commitment.   I join Lieutenant Commander Miguel Santiesteban's family and friends  in congratulating him on this well-deserved nomination. We are so proud  of you, Miguel.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce, as well as my  good friend, the ranking member, Mr. Engel, for their help in bringing  H. Res. 317 to the floor today and for their tireless efforts to hold  the Iranian regime accountable for all of its illicit activity,  including the taking of American citizens and U.S. legal permanent  residents as hostages. They have been incredible supporters of this  movement, and I thank them for their unwavering support.   Of course, I want to thank Ranking Member Nita Lowey for her help--I  had the opportunity of meeting one of the family members with her  before this presentation--and Judge Poe, who is always at our side; and  my south Florida colleague and my dear friend, Ted Deutch, the ranking  member on our Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee. We have all  joined together in authoring and introducing this resolution.   The resolution, Mr. Speaker, is important for all of us. But for Ted  Deutch, for my friend from south Florida, I know how very personal this  is for him because it is his constituent, Bob Levinson, who continues  to be held by Iran 10 years after his disappearance.   Just yesterday, Ted and I convened a hearing in our Middle East and  North Africa Subcommittee with some of the family members who are named  in this very resolution.    Doug Levinson, for example, Bob's youngest child, testified.   Babak Namazi, son of Baquer and brother of Siamak testified.   Omar Zakka, son of Nizar, testified.   All three of them testified before our subcommittee, and their  stories were moving, they were heartfelt, and they were heartbreaking.  Each one, along with their families, forced to live in their own  personal hell.   In Doug Levinson's case, Mr. Speaker, he presented photos, emails,  even videos of his father who, after more than 10 years, is the  Nation's longest held hostage in our history. What a sad distinction.   We heard how Iran has reportedly and repeatedly failed to live up to  its promise to assist in Bob's case and help return him to his loved  ones, including the five grandchildren that Bob has yet to meet.   We heard Omar plead for his father's life, as Nizar is now 1 month  into his fifth hunger strike. But this time, Mr. Speaker, Nizar has  vowed that there will be no turning back. Nizar says that he will  continue with his hunger strike for himself and the others who are  unjustly held by Iran, stating, it is ``liberty or death; there is no  turning back.''   So can you imagine, Mr. Speaker, being 19 years old, a teenager, and  he is testifying in front of us yesterday, and he is hearing his father  say that he is willing to die in Iran in pursuit of truth and justice,  and his throat was breaking as he is testifying in front of us.   We also heard Babak distress over the health of his father and his  brother, two loved ones. Mr. Namazi's father has lost more than 30  pounds in Iran's notorious prisons. He is 81 years old. He suffers from  a severe heart condition. He had to be hospitalized twice in just the  past few months. Babak fears that his father's physical and mental  condition--they are both rapidly deteriorating.   His brother, he fears, has given up hope because of the horrific  conditions he is being held under. He is kept in isolation. He is  mentally abused. He is physically abused. That is horrifying. That is  heartbreaking.   Though we heard the sorrow in their voices, Mr. Speaker, we also  heard defiance and determination. Defiant in accepting the Iranian  regime's absurd claims against Bob, against Baquer, against Siamak,  against Nizar; defiant in accepting that their fates are sealed, that  there is nothing more that can be done; defiant in remaining silent as  their loved ones suffer under the terror regime in Tehran.   We saw their determination--determination as each of the witnesses  before us yesterday vowed that their fight is not nearly over, that  they remain determined that they can force the return of their loved  ones.   And they looked to us, Mr. Speaker, they looked to us to use our  positions as Members of the United States House of Representatives to  pressure the Iranian regime to release all American citizens, all  American legal permanent residents, unconditionally.   They looked to us to demand that Iran be held accountable for its  tactic of taking our people hostage in order to get financial or  political concessions. They looked to us to stand up and to decry this  practice for what it is--morally corrupt, ethically corrupt, and  legally wrong.   That is why Nita, and Ted, and Judge Poe, and Chairman Royce, and  Ranking Member Engel, and I introduced this resolution before us today,  and that is why Ted and I convened our hearing yesterday; and that is  why, today, I am urging all of our colleagues to stand in solidarity  with us, with the family members, with the hostages, and demand that  Iran release all American citizens and legal permanent residents that  it is holding hostage immediately and unconditionally.  [[Page H6334]]     Mr. Speaker, I hope that our colleagues will indeed  stand with us. I hope that this resolution sends a strong message to  Iran that this practice will not be tolerated. And I hope that it sends  a strong message to our own administration that Congress is heavily  invested in the fate of Americans being held by Iran and that we will  demand action to win their unconditional release, their immediate  release.
