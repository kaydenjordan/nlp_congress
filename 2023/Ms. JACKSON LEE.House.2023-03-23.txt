 Mr. Chairman, I want to adhere to the protocols of  the floor. If I did not, I would shout from the rooftops as a mother  and a happy grandmother that I champion parental rights and parents. I  am happy to have been one and to continue to be one, and I view  parenthood and parents' rights as cherished rights.   Not one Democrat here would argue against that principle. In fact,  there is no doubt that we, as Democrats, have fought for parents and  their rights.   Child tax credits should now be made permanent, taking care of  additional childcare for those parents who are burdened, and for those  who need housing, investing more so that children have roofs over their  heads, as well as ensuring that no one is left alone looking for  housing.   Why I cannot support H.R. 5 is not because of my championing parents'  rights. Before I came here from Houston, I was with parents, fighting  against the devastating takeover by a Republican Governor and State  education commissioner of a school district that has a rating of B.   I am against undermining nutrition in schools. That is in this bill.  I am against undermining vulnerable children, such as transgender  children. I am against banning books, such as a book about a Black  astrologist, a scientist, Neil deGrasse Tyson, or the story of a man  ultimately of peace who brought South Africa together, Nelson Mandela.   Banned books, I am against that. I am against it because I want to  make sure that parents want to have involvement in what their children  learn.   I am against not wanting to hear the words of Elie Wiesel about the  Holocaust. He said: ``I swore never to be silent whenever wherever  human beings endure suffering and humiliation.''   Don't we want our children to be kind?   Don't we want our children to know that slavery was wrong, as I fight  against slavery today that still exists?   Don't we want our children to understand the basis of all of our  history, the mosaic of this Nation and African-American history?   Don't we want teachers to get the salaries that they deserve?  [[Page H1359]]    Don't we want to make sure that it is important, if you will, to  ensure that our school buildings are repaired?   That is why I include in the Record the First Focus letter.                                                         First Focus                                           Campaign for Children,                                     Washington, DC, March 20, 2023.      Hon. Julia Letlow,      Member, Committee on Education & the Workforce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Chair, Committee on Education & the Workforce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education & the Workforce, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Letlow, Speaker McCarthy, Leader       Jeffries, Chairwoman Foxx, and Ranking Member Scott: I am       writing on behalf of First Focus Campaign for Children, a       bipartisan children's advocacy organization dedicated to       making children and families a priority in federal budget and       policy decisions, to express opposition to H.R. 5, the       Parents Bill of Rights Act. We do not believe this bill       strikes the right balance between the duties of schools, the       rights and responsibilities of parents, and the oft-ignored       but important rights of children.                       Parental Engagement Is Critical         First, let's be clear: Parents are fundamental to the       upbringing of children and absolutely should be engaged and       involved in the education of their children. In fact,       children have better outcomes when their parents are       involved. As a parent of four children myself, I have engaged       with my children's schools by voting in school board       elections, attending all parent-teacher conferences,       volunteering in my children's classrooms, scheduling time to       meet with teachers and administrators when important issues       arise, serving on the PTAs at my children's schools, serving       on athletic booster clubs, and volunteering as an assistant       boys and girls basketball coach for two county schools.        In addition to my personal experiences, I have learned a       great deal over the years from both of my parents, my step-      mother, step-brother, my uncle, and several cousins, who are       all educators. Consequently, I have immense respect for the       work, talent, dedication, and concern that the vast majority       of teachers and educators bring to their profession on a       daily basis--all with the goal of educating our nation's       children to best achieve their hopes and dreams while also       trying to provide a place of safety and compassion for each       and every one of their students.        Again, we strongly support parental engagement in       education, but parents should not control all curriculum and       educational decisions. Doing so is unworkable.        For example, imagine an elementary school of 500 students       where 12 parents oppose the teaching of evolution, 8 parents       believe the early is flat, 21 are Holocaust deniers, 14       oppose learning about slavery, 7 believe in racial       segregation, 17 believe in the concept of schools without       walls, 27 believe in corporal punishment, 12 want Harry       Potter books to be banned, 25 want books banned that mention       the Trail of Tears, 31 believe parents should be allowed to       overrule a physician's decision that a child with a       concussion should refrain from participating in sports, 39       oppose keeping kids out of school when they have the flu, 4       believe that a child with cancer might be contagious, 34       believe students should be ``tracked'' in all subject areas,       12 believe students should not be taught how to spell the       words ``sinal tap'', ``quarantine'', or ``isolation'' because       they are too ``scary of words,'' 41 don't like the bus       routes, 45 want a vegan-only lunchroom, 4 demand same-sex       classrooms, etc. Even though most parents oppose these       demands by some parents and many of them are completely       false, undermine the purpose of education, threaten the       safety of children, or promote discrimination, H.R. 5 would       seek to push their accommodation in some form.     Mr. Chair, I also include in the Record a March 7,  2023 letter to President Biden and Secretary Miguel Cardona.                                      Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                      Washington, DC, March 7, 2023.      Hon. Joseph R. Biden,      President of the United States,      The White House, Washington, DC.      Dr. Miguel Cardona,      Secretary of Education, U.S. Department of Education, Lyndon           Baines Johnson Building, Washington, DC.      CC: Catherine E. Lhamon,      Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, Office for Civil           Rights, U.S. Department of Education, Lyndon Baines           Johnson Building, Washington, DC.        Dear President Biden and Secretary Cardona: Public school       education around the country is under attack and the actions       of the Texas Education Agency (TEA) in taking over one the       largest school districts in the nation, despite a B+ rating       overall and intense work with schools needing additional help       the state has underfunded, HISD is further evidence we must       support schools, parents and teachers.        We the undersigned Members of Congress are writing to       request that the Department of Education take immediate       action to investigate systemic and discriminatory state       takeovers of public schools receiving federal funds from the       U.S. Department of Education throughout the State of Texas.       It is imperative that there be some form of federal       intervention immediately to prevent a takeover of the Houston       Independent School District (HISD) because of the detrimental       impact on a predominantly minority school district that is a       recipient of major federal funding.        State officials in Texas are actively working to eliminate       public education and erode federal protections in educational       institutions throughout the State of Texas, causing racially       disparate and harmful outcomes for children and families in       Black and Hispanic communities in Texas.        The recent actions taken by the Texas Education Agency       (TEA) and the state of Texas are an absolute outrage and a       threat to all Texans. There is no justifiable reason for the       TEA to take over HISD. Rather, the continued intermeddling       and overstepping into our educational systems by Texas state       officials is causing further harm and damage to our       communities--and it must stop.        Taking over a school district such as HISD makes absolutely       no sense at all. HISD is the largest school district in       Texas, with 274 schools and a student population of       approximately 200,000 students. HISD is rated B+, and 94       percent of HISD schools now earn a grade of A, B or C, up       from 82 percent in 2019. Yet, TEA is basing its decision to       take over HISD on one school. As of today, Phyllis Wheatley       High School is no longer low performing and there are new       members on the board. The conditions that existed when the       takeover was first proposed no longer exist. Moreover,       Wheatley would've passed under the rules that were in place       at the time, but TEA changed the rules, and made them fail.       Given Wheatley's improvement to a C and the district's       overall B rating, the TEA's reason for initiating a takeover       bid in 2019 is no longer valid.        TEA has no experience managing a district of this magnitude       and should not be engaging in such drastic efforts without       any viable justification. The structure that will be used to       govern this huge school district will be a board of managers       solely selected by the TEA--with no input by voters,       teachers, students and/or administrators. There is a question       of whether the TEA is operating correctly under Texas State       education law and the Texas State Education Code. Pursuant to       Senate bill 1365, Section 39.0546 (c) and Texas State       Education Code. Section 39.0546(c)(1) and (2) it is unclear       that the TEA commissioner even has the authority to takeover       HISD because the school in question, Wheatley High School,       has maintained a C performance rating at this time. This       action is confusion to the constituents of HISD, and the       state has no answer as to why they think they have the right       to do this--particularly when Wheatley High School is       performing, other schools are performing, and the school       district is performing, even though there are schools with       challenges that the school is focusing on.        While the TEA Commissioner's stated reasoning for pursuing       a state takeover of HISD, namely one single underperforming       school in Houston ISD, this rationalization further       highlights the latest confusing and contradictory actions       taken by Texas state officials in their larger efforts to       justify stripping locally elected school boards of their       authority, and effectively stripping Texans of their       federally protected rights.        Despite the long-evidenced fact that state takeovers have       targeted low income and Black and Hispanic communities,       resulting in lower graduation rates and higher student       suspensions, Governor Abbott has made no secret of his       support for privately run charter schools--of which do not       have to provide a free, appropriate public education under       federal law--and his discontent for public schooling for all       children in Texas, of which is subject to federal law and       oversight. Seizing HISD, the eighth-largest school district       in the country is a clear overreach by Texas government       officials and their pursuit and intent to turn over state run       schools to privately run charter schools.        A state takeover would not only lead to school closures,       layoffs and no improvements in test scores, it would also       absolutely harm the HISD scholars. All you have to do is look       around to see any urban schools that TEA has taken over and       you will see that TEA did not make them better. The vast       majority of school districts that have been taken over by       state agencies (TEA included) have not improved but declined.        There are 15 such instances over the course of three       decades, according to state records. None likely offer a case       study that would compare to a takeover of the diverse student       body of HISD, the largest school district in the state and       the eighth largest in the nation--which also serves       predominantly Black and Hispanic children and families       considered to be ``economically disadvantaged''. According to       the recent article in the Houston Chronicle reporting on this       concern of prior Texas state school takeovers, it is       pertinent to quote the following information:        Seven of those districts were predominantly Black,       including multiple districts with schools significant to       Texas' African  [[Page H1360]]       American history. Another seven of the districts taught       mostly Hispanic student bodies. Only one district--Shepherd       ISD--was predominantly white. Around 66 percent of       students in that district are economically disadvantaged.        Of HISD's 187,000 students, 62 percent are Hispanic and 22       percent are Black. Nearly 80 percent of its students are       economically disadvantaged.        None of the districts previously taken over by TEA come       close to comparing in size to HISD. The smallest of those       districts, Kendleton ISD, had less than 100 students and the       largest, El Paso ISD, has 50,709. Beaumont ISD has around       17,000.''        While there are real schools struggling throughout Texas       and despite an overall increase in public school       performances, TEA is choosing to target only those schools       with predominantly Black and Hispanic children over other       school districts with far greater rates of performance       decline. In fact, TEA released a report for its 2022 A-F       accountability ratings for districts and campuses, which       showed that of the 1,195 districts and 8,451 campuses rated       in 2022, 25% of districts and 33% of campuses improved their       letter grade from 2019, and 18% of high-poverty campuses in       Texas were rated an A.        It is also important to highlight that Texas is behind the       national average in how much it spends per student in the       classroom. More specifically, data from the U.S. Census       Bureau shows that Texas spends $3,000 less than the national       average. Overall, Texas spent a little over $10,000 per       student in 2020; as the largest school district in the state,       HISD spent even less, averaging $9,380 per student. Given the       complete lack of funding infused into school districts like       HISD, it should be incumbent upon the State of Texas to       reprioritize and shift its focus to allocating more       appropriate and equitable funding across shamefully       underfunded and underserved communities and school districts.        In fact, it is well known that a critical factor impacting       students' academic outcomes is investing even more money into       low-income students. Low-income students perform worse in       states with larger spending gaps--states whose actual       spending is furthest from the amount needed. With data       ranging back to the late 1980s, researchers found that most       state takeovers don't translate to academic improvements. And       in states with no spending gaps, poor students perform at or       above the national average for all U.S. students--which shows       that states can improve the academic performance of even our       poorest students by investing more--not by discriminately       targeting schools for state takeovers.        As your agency is aware, Texas is plagued with 154 open and       pending cases of reported discrimination currently under       investigation at elementary, secondary and post-secondary       schools throughout the state. Between 2015 and 2023, there       have been at least 51 cases opened at such institutions and       are currently pending investigation for racial discrimination       and harassment, as well as at least 28 cases for retaliatory       discrimination at various educational institutions across       Texas. And yet, these numbers do not even begin to account       for the countless documented and undocumented cases of       current and historical discriminatory practices, of which no       state in this nation is immune to.        The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights       serves to enforce several federal civil rights laws that       prohibit discrimination in programs or activities that       receive federal financial assistance from the Department of       Education. Whereby, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964       prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and       national origin; Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972       prohibits sex discrimination; Section 504 of the       Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the       basis of disability; and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975       prohibits age discrimination, the primary role of OCR is to       assist student populations facing these areas of       discrimination, and to resolve their complaints, as well as       to provide guidance and assistance to advocates and       institutions promoting systemic solutions to civil rights       problems.        These civil rights laws enforced by OCR extend to all state       education agencies, elementary and secondary school systems,       colleges and universities, vocational schools, proprietary       schools, state vocational rehabilitation agencies, libraries,       and museums that receive U.S. Department of Education funds,       including but not limited to: admissions, recruitment,       financial aid, academic programs, student treatment and       services, counseling and guidance, discipline, classroom       assignment, grading, vocational education, recreation,       physical education, athletics, housing, and employment. An       additional critically important part of OCR's       responsibilities is to foster partnerships and initiatives       designed to develop creative approaches to preventing and       addressing discrimination.        Unfortunately, Texas educational school systems and their       controlling governmental officials are no stranger to running       afoul of federal laws your agency is tasked with enforcing       and protecting.        In 2018, the Department of Education found the entire state       of Texas to be in violation of the Individuals with       Disabilities Education Act. By setting an enrollment target       for special education, the Texas Educational Agency (TEA)       denied tens of thousands of children their federally       protected right to free and appropriate public education       supports and services. Governor Abbott has long sought to       restrict access to free public education to all children in       Texas and takeover control of all Texas educational systems       in order to implement harmful and discriminatory policies and       agendas.        Most recently, Governor Abbott has been pushing for       additional voucher programs across Texas--namely an $8,000       initiative for individuals in rural communities. While some       may say that school choice efforts are critical to ensuring       that families can decide the best educational settings for       their children, such programs are not going to help public       school systems. Instead of providing critical funding for       underfunded school programs, money and resources simply get       diverted away from the public schools that serve the majority       of children in Texas.        Now, with the recent Texas Supreme Court ruling to lift the       temporary injunction, that kept the TEA Commissioner,       Governor Abbott and other state officials from taking over       the HISD, the plight of schools and the educational future in       Houston, as well as throughout the entire state of Texas, is       particularly dire and in need of federal oversight and       intervention.        A TEA takeover would have a significant and negative impact       on HISD and other Independent School Districts in Texas       because a board of managers is not elected, and they don't       have to answer to the constituents, including children,       parents and teachers, in those districts. This is       particularly relevant given the day before the TEA       Commissioner announced the state takeover of HISD, voters had       democratically elected new members to the school board--      raising many unsettling questions about the state's true       agenda.        Additionally, we must not lose sight of the fact that       teachers and support staff within the education system are       some of the most important people in our society. The       dedicated public service they provide represents the heart of       our nation--as the work they do is vital to fabric of our       communities. They shape generations of our future leaders and       hold the key to our children's potential. As we know,       however, teachers are underpaid and often go unappreciated in       their efforts to make our world a better place. The TEA       takeover of HISD would not only result in school closures and       job cuts, but the actions of the TEA would also eliminate all       of their rights on how to be heard on how they can proceed in       the face of such attacks on their livelihoods and service to       our communities. Well-meaning and extremely qualified       teachers would lose their jobs and their voice.        That is why we are writing to request that the Department       of Education, pursuant to its duty and authority under law,       investigate and take immediate action to address the recent       systematic and dangerous efforts underway by state and local       officials in Texas seeking to undermine and undo decades of       civils rights protections and advancements in educational       institutions and student populations. I am confident that the       Department of Education will do all that is necessary to       ensure that the rights of Texans and all those impacted by       the heightened discriminatory actions by Texas officials are       protected and safeguarded.        Thank you very much for your consideration and assistance       in this matter.

Mr. Chair, I want us to know that, in supporting  parents' rights, we must support not destroying public school  education, and we must support the Houston Independent School District  to not allow----
