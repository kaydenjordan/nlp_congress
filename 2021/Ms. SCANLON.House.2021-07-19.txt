 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the important  work being done by our former First Lady, Michelle Obama, through her  Pass the Love campaign.   In collaboration with the Partnership for a Healthier America, Mrs.  Obama has been on a mission to distribute one million healthy meals to  families in need.   Last week, we learned that Philadelphia, part of my district, has  been selected as the next city for this campaign.   Pass the Love will work with Philabundance--a local leader in hunger  alleviation--to deliver healthy meal kits to 5,000 families. Over the  course of 4 weeks, they will provide 240,000 meals to families  experiencing food insecurity.   Children in Philadelphia and across America are hungry.   Creative initiatives like this one from the former First Lady should  be lauded for what they do, but they cannot solve this systemic issue  on their own.   Our country has every resource required to eradicate hunger. We can  and must make the decision to end hunger in America now.                            ____________________
