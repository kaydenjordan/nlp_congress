 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   In the face of this crisis, I have seen so many New Mexicans step up.  They have gathered fabric scraps, distributed masks, checked in with  their neighbors, and showed their resilience over and over. But so many  people, small businesses, and communities continue to struggle.   Today, we approve $360 billion for small businesses, $75 billion for  our hospitals and frontline workers who are doing heroic work to save  lives, and $25 billion so that more people can be tested for this  deadly virus.   But our work is not done. Everyone knows this is not enough, and due  to Republican opposition, this package fails to provide necessary  relief to our local, State, and Tribal governments. Mitch McConnell  said local governments should file for bankruptcy to make themselves  whole.   I had the honor this last week to participate in a townhall with the  Navajo Nation, and I heard firsthand their struggles. They need  resources, water, and testing. We need to do more for them, and we need  to do more for the people of New Mexico and everyone living in the  United States of America.   Small businesses must be prioritized by approving these loans and  grants. The American people are counting on us. Let's act.
