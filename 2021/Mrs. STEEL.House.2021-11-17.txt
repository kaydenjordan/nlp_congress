 Madam Speaker, we are just 1 week away from Thanksgiving,  and American families are bracing for one of the most expensive in  history.   The cost of almost everything is up; from the turkey to the pumpkin  pie, your Thanksgiving meal will cost you significantly more than last  year's.   Rising costs aren't just making it hard to put food on the table. The  price of a gallon of gas is up 61 percent nationally from last year,  making it more expensive for families to travel to loved ones this  holiday season.   Inflation is a hidden tax that hurts the lowest income Americans the  most.   This Thanksgiving tax is just the latest example of bad economic  policies that are making life for Americans more expensive.   Throwing trillions of dollars at the problems we are facing is not  the solution and will only make these issues worse.                            ____________________
