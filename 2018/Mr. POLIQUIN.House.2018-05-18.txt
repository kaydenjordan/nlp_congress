 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, fellow Mainers and law  enforcement officials from across our great State gathered in Augusta  to add one more name to the Maine Law Enforcement Officers Memorial  Wall: Nathan Desjardins.   The number of names on the memorial wall recognizes all law  enforcement officers in the State of Maine who have died in the line of  duty. That number, Mr. Speaker, has now reached 85.   Yesterday, we also honored Corporal Eugene Cole of the Somerset  County Sheriff's Department. He was killed in the line of duty, Mr.  Speaker, just a few weeks ago. His name will be added to the memorial  wall next year.   My heart goes out to the families of these two brave law enforcement  officials whose lives were both tragically cut short.   As Police Week comes to a close, let us all remember and recognize  the immeasurable courage, sacrifice, and dedication of our law  enforcement personnel across our Nation. Every day, they put their  lives on that thin blue line that keeps our families safe and our  communities strong. And, Mr.  [[Page H4213]]  Speaker, sometimes they don't return home.   May the good Lord accept Nathan Desjardins and Eugene Cole to rest in  peace. Maine, America, and our world is a much better place because of  their good work and their sacrifice.                            ____________________
