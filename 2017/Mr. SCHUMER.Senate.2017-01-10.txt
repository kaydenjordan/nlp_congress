 Mr. President, as hearings for the President-elect's  nominees get underway starting today, I want to reiterate that a fair  and thorough vetting process is a top priority, not only for my caucus  but for the American people.   Chief to achieving that is a fair hearing schedule and process.  First, it means hearings that are sufficiently spaced out so Members  who sit on multiple committees can actually attend all the hearings. It  means only holding hearings after the full committee paperwork--OGE  review, FBI background check, and a full divestment plan--has been  received and Senators have adequate time to review the information.  That means, if there are Senators with remaining questions that weren't  covered in a first hearing, they can have the nominee come back for a  second day.   Our caucus and much of America was alarmed and disappointed by the  announcements of the hearing schedule this week, which did not meet  these basic courtesies and best practices that have always been  extended in the past. However, I am happy to say that after negotiating  with my friend the majority leader and his respective committee chairs,  we have been able to make some progress on a fair hearing process.   I appreciate the majority leader's openness and efforts to  accommodate our caucus in the last few days. Originally there were six  hearings scheduled for this Wednesday, all especially important Cabinet  posts: State, Attorney General, Education, Transportation, Homeland  Security, CIA. That was largely unprecedented. We have looked back in  history and can only find one instance where there were that many  hearings of important Cabinet members on one day like that.   After negotiations with the majority leader, we have moved things  around so  [[Page S183]]  that there are now only three hearings scheduled for Wednesday:  Secretary of State, Transportation, and the second day of the AG  hearings. All of these nominees have their paperwork in. The nominee  for Secretary of Education, who does not yet have a signed ethics  agreement and whose paperwork is not close to complete, was moved. That  hearing will take place next week, pending her paperwork being  submitted with time for Senators to review.   It is still a busy week. It is a little too busy for my personal  taste, but it is a good first step. I hope we can continue to negotiate  in good faith, to sort out the schedule in a way that is acceptable to  both of our caucuses.   I also want to make clear that this progress does not mean our caucus  is any less intent on having the President-elect's nominees complete  the standard ethics forms, questionnaires, and FBI background checks  required of every nominee. To have all this information come in after  the hearing is sort of like ``Alice in Wonderland''--it makes no sense  and has things upside down. I am still concerned, for example, that we  don't have a completed FBI background check for the nominee for  Secretary of State. His hearing starts tomorrow. And today there are  reports in the media that under Rex Tillerson's leadership, Exxon  conducted business with Iran, potentially in violation of U.S.  sanctions law. There are serious questions that need to be answered.   In this particular case, Mr. Tillerson should release all his tax  returns and promise to answer any questions on the Iran dealings that  members ask. This is too serious a subject to have questions ducked. It  demands a completely open airing of all relevant information. Did Mr.  Tillerson go around our Iran sanctions simply to line Exxon's pockets?  That would be a very bad thing. The American people ought to know about  it before the Senate has to vote to confirm. For Rex Tillerson to  answer the questions, and particularly questions about Exxon setting up  a separate subsidiary to get around our Iran sanctions, is what the  Founding Fathers wanted us to do when they enumerated in the advise and  consent process.   This is not a partisan game. We are not doing this for sport. These  aren't obscure procedural complaints. This is standard process. As I  reminded my friend the majority leader yesterday, this is the same  exact process my counterpart demanded in 2009 when the shoe was on the  other foot. Just as then-Minority Leader McConnell laid out in his 2009  letter to then-Majority Leader Reid, Democrats expect each nominee to  have all the prerequisites, with time to review, before we move forward  with the hearings. President Obama's nominees completed all of their  paperwork in 2009 before the hearings. We expect nothing less from  President-Elect Trump's nominees. Particularly, we expect the paperwork  to be all in with time to review. Having the paperwork in at 7 a.m. and  holding a hearing at 10 a.m. is unacceptable. We expect there will be  adequate time for followup questions on a second day of hearings if  Senators are unable to finish their questions.   Today my colleague the majority leader said: Well, most of the  Cabinet nominees were in already when this letter came out. But the  letter doesn't specify who. It includes Cabinet members, and there were  future Cabinet members who would come forward. It is a good standard.  We are all for it. We are asking our friends on the other side of the  aisle to stick with it. What was good for them in 2009 is good for the  country in 2017.   We are insistent on the process because it is the right thing to do;  it is the American thing to do. We don't hide nominees and rush them  through. They have huge power. If the President-elect and our  Republican colleagues are as proud of the nominees as they state, then  they should be happy to have them answer a lot of questions in a  hearing that is not rushed. It is how we will ensure that Cabinet  officials, who are imbued with an immense power in our government, are  ethically and substantively qualified for these positions.   If there is any group of Cabinet nominees that cries out for this  process, it is this group of nominees. This proposed Cabinet is unlike  any other. It is wealthier than any other. It has complex webs of  corporate connections--so many of the nominees--that pose huge  potential conflict of interest problems. Frankly, it is the most hard- right Cabinet in its ideology. It is quite different from the way  President-Elect Trump campaigned. The potential conflicts of interest  for multimillionaires such as Rex Tillerson or Betsy DeVos or Steve  Mnuchin are enormous.   As I said, the nominees have views far to the right of what the  President campaigned on. The most glaring example is Representative  Price. His whole career has been focused on ending Medicare as we know  it. My colleague the majority leader said the American people want us  to move forward and give President-Elect Trump his nominees. If they  knew that one of the nominees had been dedicated to basically getting  rid of Medicare, would they want us to vote for him? I will bet not. It  sure explains why they want to rush these nominees through.   They don't want all of these things brought to light, but that is the  wrong thing to do. We are going to fight to get to the right thing to  do. The American people have a right to know if they voted for a  President who might be going back on one of his key campaign promises.  They deserve nothing less than open and deliberate hearings going  forward. Will Representative Price stick with what President-Elect  Trump said--no cuts to Medicare, Medicaid--or will he pursue his  lifelong dream of privatizing and limiting them? We shall see, but we  need answers at hearings before we vote. The American people are  entitled to it.   Once again, I thank the majority leader for dealing in good faith and  trying to address our concerns. I hope for the sake of the national  interests that our two parties can come together on an agreement for  the remainder of the process, as we have for the process so far.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last night the Senate Democrats held the  floor late into the night to demonstrate our solidarity and commitment  to defending ACA, to defending the tens of millions of Americans who  have been afforded the opportunity to access care for the first time  and the tens of millions more whose coverage is fairer, more generous,  and more affordable because of the law.   More than 35 Members participated on the floor or on Facebook Live,  Snapchat, or Twitter. I thank each and every one of the Members on my  side--the vast majority of our caucus--for participating. Many of them  discussed the threat the Republican plan to make America sick again  poses to the health care of 300 million Americans. Beyond that, the  Republican budget resolution calls for a massive increase in the  Federal debt.   Yesterday Shaun Donovan, the Director of the Office of Management and  Budget, released a letter explaining that this budget resolution would  allow publicly held debt to increase by $9.5 trillion, from $14.2  trillion in 2016 to $23.7 trillion in 2026.   Our colleagues have talked about being deficit hawks. Democrats bring  up ideas. They say: Can't do it; it increases the deficit. Well, is  that going to apply to this, which increases the deficit by massive  amounts? The deficit would exceed $1.3 trillion in 2026. That is almost  as high as the $1.4 trillion at the depths of that recession and  financial crisis President Obama had to meet. Are my colleagues now  going to do a 180-degree reversal and say that now a debt increase of  such dramatic numbers is OK? I hope not. It wouldn't be right. It  wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't be consistent.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a copy of Director Donovan's letter.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           Executive Office of the President, Office of Management             and Budget,                                   Washington, DC, January 9, 2017.      Hon. John A. Yarmuth,      Ranking Member, House Budget Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard E. Neal,      Ranking Member, House Ways and Means Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Yarmuth and Congressman Neal: I am writing       in response to  [[Page S184]]       your letter requesting OMB's analysis of the Republican       budget resolution and its impact on the budget outlook.        On January 3, 2017, Republicans in the Senate Budget       Committee introduced an FY 2017 budget resolution. Based on       the numbers provided in the resolution, the Republican budget       includes virtually no deficit reduction and would allow debt       held by the public to increase by roughly $9.5 trillion, from       $14.2 trillion in 2016 to $23.7 trillion in 2026. After a       sustained period of historically fast deficit reduction under       the President's leadership, the Republican budget would allow       for a relatively steady increase in annual deficits, with the       annual on-budget deficit increasing to over $1 trillion by       2026.        Assuming that Republicans will not make cuts to off-budget       programs like Social Security, unified annual deficits will       be even larger: growing to over $1 trillion by 2022 and       reaching more than $1.3 trillion by 2026.        Comparisons of debt and deficit totals over time are best       viewed as a share of the economy. Based on the Congressional       Budget Office's most recent economic projections, it is clear       that the Republican budget would fail the key fiscal test of       stabilizing debt as a share of the economy.

Notably, the budget resolution also contains exceptions to       existing Congressional budget rules that seem targeted       towards making it easier to pass legislation that would       further increase deficits.            Sincerely,                                                     Shaun Donovan,                                                          Director.     Mr. President, many of my Republican colleagues like to  claim they care about the deficit. During President Obama's  administration, there was an obsession over deficit and debt  reduction--and, by the way, no praise for the President for reducing  the deficit by a dramatic amount. Now many of those same Members who  chastised President Obama for much smaller deficits than proposed in  their budget are supporting this budget resolution.   I wish to say to my colleagues, you can't claim to be a fiscal hawk  and support a budget that piles on trillions in additional debt. That  is not being fiscally conservative; it is being fiscally hypocritical  in the extreme. So far, my friend Senator Paul of Kentucky has made  this point forcefully. My question is, Will other Republicans stand  with him and stand up against this fiscal hypocrisy?   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
