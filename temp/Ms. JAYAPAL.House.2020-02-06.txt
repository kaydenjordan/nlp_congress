 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support today of the PRO  Act. I talk to people every day who take tremendous pride in the work  that they do, and, yet, many of these workers are facing terrible  injustices on the job; poorly paid; inadequately insured; harassed; and  often in workshops that are dangerous and discriminatory.   Mr. Chairman, no one should have to go to work and face injustice and  be afraid to speak up. That is just not right.   The PRO Act makes it clear that we are putting power back into the  hands of workers; and that we are ensuring and expanding workers'  rights to organize. Let's be clear that that benefits everybody.  Unionized women earn wages that are 23 percent higher. Black workers'  wages are 14 percent higher, and Latinx workers' wages are 21 percent  higher than in nonunionized workplaces.   Young unionized workers more often have health insurance, higher pay,  and a retirement plan. That is why workers' approval for unions keeps  rising.   Mr. Chairman, every worker deserves a fair and safe workplace, and  that is what the PRO Act does.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a petition signed by over 63,000  community members in support of the PRO Act.                                                   February 4, 2020.      Re Delivery of signatures regarding the U.S. House of           Representatives' floor vote on the Protecting the Right           to Organize Act.       Chairman Bobby Scott,      House Education and Labor Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bobby Scott: Please accept over 63,000       signatures from community members across the country on       behalf of a coalition of 11 advocacy, climate, labor, and       trade organizations advocating for the passage of the       Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. We ask that your       office enter this letter and the accompanying signatures into       the public record. We thank you, Chairman Scott, for your       introduction and support of this historic legislation.        Our coalition believes that working class and middle class       families in the United States deserve income security and       should be able to organize their co-workers to demand living       wages and healthy working conditions.        In a time when the richest Americans' wealth growth has       increased by over 200 percent while wages remain stagnant for       the rest of us, we urge the U.S. House of Representatives to       pass the PRO Act.            Sincerely,        AFL-CIO, Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance (APALA),       Climate Hawks Vote, Courage Campaign, CREDO Action, Daily       Kos, Economic Policy Institute Policy Center, Friends of the       Earth Action, National Employment Law Project, People For the       American Way, Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch.     Mr. Chair, I also include in the Record a letter from  the CWA on how unions reduce income inequality.                               Communications Workers of America,                                   Washington, DC, February 5, 2020.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the officers and 700,000       members of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), I am       writing to urge you to vote for H.R. 2474, the Protecting the       Right to Organize (PRO) Act, when it comes before the House       this week and to oppose any amendments that would weaken the       bill. For CWA, this is the most important vote that has come       before the House of Representatives in years and our members       are watching it closely.        The huge surge in economic inequality over the past       quarter-century is related directly to many workers' lack of       a strong voice on the job. Over that time, wages have       stagnated for workers across the economy, while income has       skyrocketed for CEOs and the wealthiest 1%. By 2012, the       wealthiest 1% made 22.5% of national income, while the bottom       90% of families made less than half of national income--just       49.6%.        During that same time period, union density has declined       substantially. Since the early 1980s, the overall       unionization rate has been cut in half. This harms workers       who are unable to form unions directly, but it also hurts       other workers, as research by the Economic Policy Institute       shows that higher union density increases wages for all       workers.        Moreover, the harm to workers caused by the lack of an       organized voice on the job is not limited simply to       compensation. Workers who form unions have stronger       protections against discrimination and retaliation, enhanced       job security, better retirement benefits, and more effective       ways of combating practices that jeopardize their health and       safety on the job.        Unfortunately, the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) does       not currently include protections strong enough to ensure       that workers are able to effectively exercise their right to       organize, bargain collectively, and have a strong voice on       the job. The NLRA's penalties are ineffective and       insufficient, amounting to little more than a vague threat of       a slap on the wrist to employers who violate the NLRA. As a       result, workers are routinely illegally disciplined or even       fired for exercising their NLRA rights, with little to no       consequence for the bad actors.        Just as concerning is what is actually permitted under the       NLRA. Employers can hold ``captive audience'' meetings, in       which executives can and do force workers to attend hours-      long meetings in which management berates and intimidates       workers who want to organize. Employers can and do also fail       to negotiate fair first contracts, preventing workers who       form unions from ever securing a collective bargaining       agreement. As a result, many workers are deterred from       fighting to exercise their rights in the first place.        The PRO Act would strengthen the NLRA and, in so doing,       empower workers across the country. The PRO Act would:        Strengthen remedies for workers who face illegal       retaliation, including swift temporary reinstatement for       workers who are illegally  [[Page H888]]       suspended or fired, real financial penalties, and the       clarification of their ability to have their day in court;        Clarify coverage of the NLRA to prevent the       misclassification of workers as independent contractors;        Protect the integrity of union elections against coercive       captive audience meetings;        Ensure that the National Labor Relations Board's orders are       enforced in a timely manner;        Protect workers' right to strike for basic workplace       improvements;        Ensure that workers and employers are able to reach fair       deals for a first contract by establishing mediation and       arbitration procedures;        Strengthen the ability of workers and companies to       negotiate contracts that include fair share fees that cover       the basic costs of representation and bargaining;        Safeguard the rights of all workers to engage in       employment-related class action litigation.        The PRO Act would ensure that workers' right to a voice on       the job would be protected. In doing so, it would help combat       skyrocketing economic inequality and strengthen the middle       class. Therefore, I strongly urge you to vote for the PRO       Act. CWA will include votes on this bill and any amendments       that would undermine the bill in our Congressional Scorecard       and this is the single highest priority vote for CWA and our       members of the 116th Congress.        Thank you in advance for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                      Dan Mauer,                                     Director of Government Affairs,                           Communications Workers of America (CWA).     Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  bill today.
