 Mr. President, I rise to talk about the shutdown, as my  colleague, the senior Senator from Minnesota, just did. I am grateful  for her comments on what is happening to people in Minnesota, the  direct adverse impact of this shutdown on their lives. We have all seen  it. We have all experienced it.   I will be referring to specific testimony from people who wrote me  letters, but let me just highlight one experience I had the other day  at a food bank in Central Pennsylvania, just miles from our State  capital--a food bank that serves 27 of our 67 counties.   I was talking about how this shutdown could end. The President wanted  the shutdown. He got the shutdown, but he could also end it. Prior to  the discussion we had, behind us, they had an entire table full of food  items that the food bank and others in that region of Pennsylvania were  delivering to Federal workers, especially to TSA agents, who cannot  afford food because they are working but are not being  [[Page S582]]  paid. It is hard to comprehend that. It is hard to comprehend that so  many veterans around the country are, once again, serving their country  by serving in the government as they served in combat or in the  military; yet they are being left out in the cold, so to speak-- sometimes literally--but are, obviously, being left out when they don't  have paychecks.   So this is real life. We debate bills and budgets and appropriations  here in Washington. We have debates on the floor and debates and  discussions in the hallways, but for these folks, this is real life. I  will just point to, maybe, five examples in Pennsylvania.   Adams County, which is in the southernmost part of our State, where  Gettysburg is--just on the Maryland border--is not a big county by  population. Here is what one individual who is married to a Federal  worker wrote. I will just quote her in part.   She writes:         We are expecting our first child this summer and, prior to       December 22, were excited about the future and potential of       2019. Now we are anxious, sad, and angry, not knowing where       the money will come from to buy necessities for this child,       let alone medical expenses related to birth and daycare.    She goes on to write later in the letter:         We are now in real and serious danger of losing our home       and our vehicles. We will soon have to choose between buying       groceries or paying for the electric bill.    She goes on from there. She is one Pennsylvanian in Adams County.   Here is one from Cambria County, which is in the southwestern part of  our State.   This individual wrote: ``My husband is a Federal employee who has  been furloughed.''   She goes on to write:         We have a son in elementary school. It is about time for       spring sports sign-ups, but we don't know how we are going to       pay our bills or buy groceries. It is our son's birthday in       less than 2 weeks. We canceled his birthday party to save       some money.    That was from Cambria County, PA.   The third one I will highlight is from Delaware County, which is one  of the big, suburban Philadelphia counties. It is a big population  county.   Here is, in part, what this individual wrote: ``My in-laws are  selling their home and cannot go to settlement because the FHA will not  close a mortgage for the buyer.''   That was among several things they wrote in the letter. In the  interest of time, I will not read all of it, but we hear these stories  all the time of people not being able to complete the work on a  mortgage because of the impact on the FHA.   Here is one from Montgomery County, which is also a suburban  Philadelphia county.   This individual wrote:         I am a law enforcement park ranger for the National Park       Service. . . . I am the sole provider for a family of four,       to include two young children. Not knowing when I will get       paid again is putting undue stress on the entire family.    That word ``stress'' keeps coming up either directly in these letters  or by implication. Over and over again, we hear of the stress this  shutdown is putting on families across America.   The last one I will highlight is from Warren County, which is in the  northwestern corner of our State. It is a much smaller population  county than were the two suburban Philadelphia counties I just  mentioned of Montgomery and Delaware.   Here is what this individual wrote from Warren County:         Both my wife and I are federal employees working for the       U.S. Forest Service. We are also both veterans. We will be       using our savings to live off of and charging food to our       credit cards if we must.    It goes on and on, and I know the Presiding Officer has seen the same  thing. We have all seen and heard much about this. There is not enough  time tonight to go through every letter.   This is what has to be the priority of all of ours. We have to be  responsive to these cries for help, to be responsive to Americans who  are just asking us to open the government so they can be paid, so they  can make ends meet, so they can pay for groceries, so they can pay  their mortgages--or to even have a mortgage in some cases--so they can  pay for basic necessities, and so they can sometimes even just pay for  birthday parties for their sons. Over and over again, we hear these  stories.   As my colleague from Minnesota made reference to, I was encouraged  that, today, we had two votes. There was a likely expectation prior to  the votes that they wouldn't get enough to pass, but at least we were  voting. At least we were voting on one measure that one side favored  and were voting on another measure that my side of the aisle favored. I  was also encouraged that five Republicans voted for the Democratic  proposal, which is very simple--to fund the government, to open the  government, and add disaster assistance for emergencies from natural  disasters. The lives of people are adversely affected by so many  natural disasters, but this is also, of course, an emergency--funding  the government so as to make sure that workers have their pay and to  make sure people are served by important programs like the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program. Of course, we could make a long list of  programs that are important to people's lives.   In the case of the so-called SNAP program--what we used to call food  stamps--you are talking basically about children, seniors, and people  with disabilities. These are most of the people who get benefits from  the SNAP program. They are only guaranteed help from that program  through February. There is no certainty about March. There is no  certainty about April or the forthcoming months. It is just one program  that serves millions of Americans that has already been adversely  impacted because of the shutdown.   Whether you are talking about a mom or a dad who is a Federal  employee or whether you are talking about someone who needs the help of  the Federal Government--people who we have said over many generations  deserve that help--in either case, it is unacceptable to them, and it  should be unacceptable to us to not have the government open. We have  lots of time to debate many issues after that, but priority No. 1 has  to be to open the government. Then we will have a lot of time for  debate on a range of issues.                          Remembering Harris Wofford    Mr. President, I conclude tonight with some brief remarks. We are  going to have several occasions to amplify these remarks in the coming  days regarding the passing of Senator Harris Wofford, the Senator from  Pennsylvania from 1991 to the early days of 1995. I just want to offer  some personal remarks. In a short timeframe, it is very difficult to  encapsulate the life of any individual, obviously, but in this case, it  is impossible in a few short minutes to encapsulate the life, the  contributions, and the achievements of Senator Harris Wofford, so I  will just highlight a few. If you were to just read his resume, you  would think you were reading the life story of the achievements of  several people instead of just one.   To give you some highlights, he was an early advocate for civil  rights. He was someone who stuck his neck out to march with Dr. King,  his good friend, and to advocate on behalf of the Civil Rights Act of  1957.   He then worked for President Kennedy as a special assistant for civil  rights and prepared the way for the great breakthroughs of the  midsixties, of the civil rights legislation of the sixties. He worked  with Sargent Shriver and others in the Kennedy administration in the  formation of the Peace Corps, and he served in that capacity overseas.   As I mentioned, he was a good friend of Dr. Martin Luther King's and  participated in the Selma to Montgomery civil rights marches in 1965 in  support of voting rights for African Americans.   He was the President of two different colleges--one in Pennsylvania,  Bryn Mawr, which is a great college. It is one of the best in the  country.   I got to know Harris Wofford before he was Senator Wofford. It was  when he worked for the new Casey administration, when my father was  elected Governor of Pennsylvania in 1986. He put together a cabinet in  the early part of 1987, and he appointed Harris as the Secretary of  Labor and Industry--one of the big departments in State government.   It was from that position that he was chosen to be a U.S. Senator. It  was after the tragic and untimely death of Senator John Heinz, who  passed away in April of 1991. Harris was named that next month. He was  elected in 1991 to complete that term and then lost his reelection in  1994, but Harris was not done with service.  [[Page S583]]    After serving in the Kennedy administration and in the Senate--after  doing such great work on education and civil rights in the interest of  justice--he continued his work. He worked very hard to make sure that  the Martin Luther King holiday was not just a holiday but a day of  service. So he and others came together in the midnineties--after  Harris was out of office and after he had left the Senate--to make sure  that day would be a day of service. Now, all of these years later--more  than 20 years later--hundreds of thousands of people across the country  perform acts of service, engage in service, on that day.   We will spend more time highlighting his life here on the Senate  floor and in other places around the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and,  I am sure, across the country, but let me just conclude with these  words: Harris Wofford was a champion for justice. In the Scriptures,  they tell us that those who pursue justice should be blessed. Blessed  are they who will hunger and thirst for justice for they shall be  satisfied.   Harris Wofford was never satisfied when it came to justice. He was  always trying to march us forward. He was always urging us to do more  in the interest of justice, in the interest of civil rights, and of  equal rights. He was a champion for justice. That is probably an  understatement. He was also a person of uncommon courage to stand up as  he did on civil rights when it was not easy--when, at times, it was  literally dangerous.   In addition to his courage, he was a person of integrity and decency.  He always wanted to know what others were doing, what other's lives  were like, what they hoped for our country. He was always curious about  other people's lives and what he could learn from them.   To say that he lived a life of service is, again, an understatement.  I don't know of anyone who served in so many different capacities,  whether it was in the Army Air Corps in World War II, whether it was in  leading the way on civil rights for President Kennedy, or whether it  was here in the Senate in his helping to create opportunities for  service. He not only lived that life of service, but he challenged all  of us. Whether we were public officials or citizens, he challenged us  to serve. He lived the words of Dr. King, the words of service. Dr.  King said that everyone can be great because everyone can serve. Harris  Wofford was great for lots of reasons, but he was also great, of  course, because he served.   We will have more opportunities to amplify this small measure of  commendation to Harris Wofford, but on a night like tonight, we are  thinking of him. We are inspired by him, and we are grateful for his  service and for that of his family's.   I had a chance to talk to his son Dan, who has been a friend of mine  for a long time, just hours before his father passed away. I was  honored to talk to him in those difficult hours.   Mr. President, in remembering Harris Wofford, as we will do more  formally in the next number of days, I want to thank him for his  service to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and for his service to  America.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
