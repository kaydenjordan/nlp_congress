 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 100th  anniversary of the Casper Refinery in Natrona County, WY.   On September 27, HF Sinclair will hold a Casper centennial  celebration lunch. They will ``celebrate the history of the refinery  and the Casper story.'' For the past 100 years, the refinery and its  employees have played a key role in economic and energy development,  benefitting the Casper community and the State of Wyoming.   This facility first opened in 1923 as the White Eagle Refinery. It is  now one of the oldest operating refineries in the Rocky Mountain  region. In the beginning, crude oil was transported fifty miles to a  processing site by horse-drawn wagons. This journey took over ten days.  Initially, the refinery produced an industry-leading 200 barrels-per- day.   In 1968, the former White Eagle Refinery was acquired by Sinclair  Corporation from Mobil Oil. It was then renamed the Little America  Refining Company. In 2022, Sinclair joined HollyFrontier Corporation to  form HF Sinclair. The Casper refinery is a central hub in Wyoming for  crude oil supply. Their goal is to ``update and modernize equipment to  maintain ratable production well into the future.''   The refinery is capable of running both domestic and Canadian  synthetic crudes. With a 30,000 barrels-per-day output, the facility  primarily runs Rocky Mountain Region sweet crude. They are also  efficient in producing gasoline and diesel for customers in Wyoming,  Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Nebraska, Colorado, Montana, and South Dakota.   The Sinclair Casper Refinery focuses on treating their customers and  coworkers like family. They build their company on integrity and  loyalty. Plant Manager Sam Cooper continues the legacy of hard work. He  is joined by 180 employees in this endeavor. The team at the Casper  refinery creates ``a culture driven by excellence in production,  reliability and safety.'' They are able to accomplish this by following  their five core values of safety, integrity, teamwork, ownership, and  inclusion.   It is an honor for me to recognize this significant milestone for the  Casper Refinery. This refinery serves as an economic cornerstone for  central Wyoming. Bobbi joins me in extending our congratulations to the  HF Sinclair Casper Refinery on their 100th anniversary.                            ____________________
