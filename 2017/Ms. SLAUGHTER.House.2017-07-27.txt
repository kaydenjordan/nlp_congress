 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. I certainly thank the  gentleman from Washington, my friend, for his kindness. I think he is  one of the best Members we have, but I am going to have to disagree  with Mr. Newhouse today.   When Speaker Ryan assumed the gavel, he told the American people that  he wanted to have ``a process that is more open, more inclusive, more  deliberative, more participatory.''   When the majority took control of both the Congress and the White  House, they again promised to abide by standard congressional  procedure.   But we are here, 3 months from the end of the fiscal year. The  majority hasn't passed a budget resolution, and legislation moves at a  glacial pace. The majority working to rush through a massive minibus  before any individual appropriations bills have been considered on the  floor is also a mistake.   This may sound pedantic, but we do have rules.   Every one of us wants to improve our security, but this bill, I am  afraid, is a little more than smoke and mirrors. The increase in  defense spending under this bill will never see the light of day.   That is because we operate under the Budget Control Act, and that  mandates that any breach of the defense cap, which this bill does, will  trigger an across-the-board sequestration cut of all defense accounts,  making what we do here a useless exercise, I am afraid.   The majority has also inserted an amendment to provide $1.6 billion  President Trump requested to begin construction of the wall on the  U.S.-Mexico border.   This is surely just the beginning of making taxpayers pay for the  entire wall, which experts have estimated could cost as much as $21  billion, with nary a peso from Mexico. If we are investing $1.6 billion  now, I see no reason why they do not plan to go on to reach the $21  billion expenditure.   Let me put that in some perspective: $21 billion could be used to  double the Federal investments in public schools. Think of that. Just  the money to build that wall, it could provide 6 million people with  healthcare under Medicaid, it could buy school lunches for tens of  millions of low-income children. But these investments are not a  priority for this majority.   President Trump's own budget director famously said that it isn't  worth feeding hungry children if the nutrition does not improve their  school performance, and that Meals on Wheels ``sounds great,'' but  doesn't work.   I never thought I would hear either of those things come from the  mouth of a Federal official. The idea that we should not feed hungry  children unless their school work improves, frankly, I am baffled by  that, let me say it that way.   The opposition to the wall is bipartisan. Republican Representative  Hurd from Texas, a former CIA officer, sits on the Homeland Security  Committee and represents the largest border district in the State of  Texas. He testified before the Rules Committee late Monday night  against it, saying, ``having a one-size-fits-all solution to border  security makes no sense.'' Yet this amendment was included without  debating the merits on the floor and without giving Members an up-or- down vote.   Let me explain that a little bit. This amendment is in the bill, but  there will be no vote on it. It has been what we call self-executed to  keep people from being recorded in any way, whether they are for or  against the wall.   The last statistic that I saw from the American public is that 68  percent of them oppose it. They will never know whether their  Representatives did or not. It is a sort of a bait-and-switch idea.   Mr. Speaker, immigration has enriched our country beyond measure. It  is what has allowed our country to shape the world, rather than to fear  it. A wall will lock the United States away from the rest of the world.   The President's new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci,  wrote online: ``Walls don't work. Never have. Never will.''   We don't know whether he is going to change his mind about that or  not, but that is what he said.   One of our famous Republican Presidents that everybody knew and  loved, Ronald Reagan, 30 years ago last month stood in West Berlin and  demanded that another wall be torn down.   I said in the Rules Committee yesterday and I will say it again here  this afternoon: if the President and the majority build this wall, it,  too, will be torn down, not by someone crossing the border or by an  outside force. It will crumble because the public understands in a way  that this President and majority do not, that our Nation does not  barricade itself away from the rest of the world.   We will not build walls to keep us in. What kind of superpower would  we be if we built a wall around the outside of our Nation and crumbled  from the inside because the money we put on the wall kept us from  updating our infrastructure, which is in such terrible shape, and a  shredded social safety net?    None of us want to find that out, but the majority is putting us on  such a path.   Just yesterday, President Trump announced a ban on transgender  servicemembers serving in the military. It appears today that he made  that announcement all on his own and that neither the Joint Chiefs of  Staff or the Pentagon had any idea that he was going to do that.   The announcement came 69 years to the day that President Truman  desegregated our military. Think about that for a minute. Sixty-nine  years ago, on the very day that President Trump said transgender people  couldn't serve, was the day President Truman integrated the military  services.   This is an insult to the approximately 15,000 transgender soldiers  who sacrifice for our country every day. Transgender servicemembers are  being attacked from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.   Just days ago, Republicans joined Democrats to defeat an amendment  that would bar transgender servicemembers from receiving the necessary  healthcare that they deserve. I will note that these same treatments  would have been available to other servicemembers under this amendment.  Apparently to the majority, it is not about the treatment, but the  person who receives it.   The amendment is especially cruel when you consider that a Pentagon  report has found that gender transition-related treatment costs between  $2.4 and $8.4 million a year. That is the cost of just four of the  President's trips to Mar-a-Lago. Think about that: several millions  dollars to go to Mar-a-Lago would have paid for operations for  transgender persons.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from USA Today that  details this fact.                      [From USA Today, July 26, 2017]      OnPolitics Today: Trump's Mar-a-Lago Trips Cost More Than Trans                           Soldiers' Health Care                              (By Josh Hafner)         President Trump tweeted this morning that the U.S. military       wouldn't allow transgender troops ``in any capacity,'' an       apparent rejection of the military's roughly 6,000 trans       troops and the Obama-era policy that embraced them.        The U.S. ``cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical       costs and disruption that transgender in the military would       entail,'' Trump said.        Except trans troops don't really cost that much, as many       soon pointed out.        A report for the Pentagon last year found that transition-      related care would cost between about $2.4 and $8.4 million       per year--less than 0.14% of the military's medical budget.  [[Page H6483]]         That's roughly the cost of four of Trump's trips to Mar-A-      Lago, GQ noted, even using a conservative estimate of $2       million per trip. And it's way less than the $84 million       spent on Viagra and similar meds by the Department of Defense       in 2014, as others also said.        It was, as Sen. John McCain noted, ``yet another example of       why major policy announcements should not be made via       Twitter.''     I believe all of our soldiers deserve our thanks and  support. They are Americans. They don't need to be attacked based on  who they are.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, it is also outrageous--and I saved this for the  end--that the majority stripped from the bill Congresswoman Barbara  Lee's bipartisan amendment to repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of  Military Force.   Until this AUMF, which, as I said, came into law in 2001, is  rescinded and replaced, the President of the United States can usurp  our power and effectively declare war without Congress' concurrence. In  fact, that has already happened.   Matters of war are the most serious issues that Congress considers.  We should not--and we don't want to--shirk those responsibilities. We  want to fulfill our constitutional duties.   Yet Speaker Ryan removed it from the bill without any debate or  single vote because he was afraid of it. He replaced it with weaker  language requiring a 30-day study. After those 30 days, we are not  assured of anything at all, just a study.   That is not the type of open and transparent process that the Speaker  promised. More than just bad process, it silences the debate we need to  have. All Americans, especially our men and women in uniform, deserve  better from us, as they volunteered to save us with their very lives.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gallego).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank the  gentlewoman from New York for her consistent leadership. Being a  frequent visitor to the Rules Committee as a Member, I want to thank  the manager for the courtesies extended to all of us.   Let me say that I am a member of the Budget Committee, and I want to  associate my stance with the gentlewoman from New York. We do not have  a budget, but, in fact, the budget is not a roadmap that we are even  attempting to do. The budget was a slash and burn  [[Page H6484]]  of Medicare, Medicaid, only to give tax cuts, and it had no vision but  to plus-up the Defense Appropriations.   So now we come with a minibus that wants to do more damage. I have no  quarrel with my friend from Texas, but it is very clear that this  budget is based upon this wall, and this rule is based upon this wall.  It is important for the American people to know that, while we are  fighting for Medicaid and Meals on Wheels, better policing, and better  education for our children, the wall that was supposed to be paid for  by Mexico--let me say it again, the wall that was supposed to be paid  by Mexico, as evidenced by the Commander in Chief--is now, in this  rule, not for $100 million, not for $200 million, not for $50 million,  but for $1,571,239,000. That is what this rule is all about.   Frankly, I believe that this is a shame. Frankly, I oppose it because  the Commander in Chief swore that Mexico would pay for the wall. Now we  are paying for the wall, and, as indicated, a Member of Congress from  Texas who represents the area is adamantly against it. I would only  argue to say that there are other needs in this minibus that the  American people desire.   I also rise to express strong opposition to the fact that the Lee  amendments were not put in. Congresswoman Lee had an amendment for us  to debate the AUMF, two amendments, and those amendments were rejected.  Let us go back to regular order and pass appropriations for the  American people and debate whether we go to war. Going to war is a  point for the American people to hear and discuss.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to register my opposition to the exclusion from  H. Res. 478 of the amendments offered by colleague, Congresswoman  Barbara Lee of California.   This rule makes in order 54 amendments to Division A of H.R. 3219,  the Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2018 and an amendment by  Congressman Carter, the chairman of the Homeland Security  Appropriations Subcommittee, providing $1.57 billion in funding to  begin construction of the infamous ``Trump Border Wall'' that the  presidential candidate Trump promises, assured, and guaranteed American  and the would be paid for by Mexico.   Mr. Speaker, it is passing strange indeed that the Lee Amendments,  which were offered, debated, and approved in the regular order were  excluded from the rule while the Carter Amendment, which was introduced  at the 11th hour, was included.   Lee Amendment No. 95 would repeal the 2001 AUMF after 240 days of  enactment of this Act.   Lee Amendment No. 96 does not repeal the 2001 AUMF but would prohibit  the expenditure of any funds to implement, administer, or enforce the  2001 AUMF beginning 240 days of enactment of this Act.   They knew that the decision to go to war was too important to be left  to the whim of a single person, no matter how wise or well-informed he  or she might be.   Over the last 16 years, we have seen 3 Presidents use the 2001  Afghanistan AUMF as a blank check to engage in serious military action.   In 2016, the Congressional Research Service issued a report detailing  37 unclassified uses of this authorization in 14 countries, including  for operations at Guantanamo Bay, warrantless wiretapping, and recent  military action in Libya, Syria, Somalia, and Yemen.   The overly broad 2001 AUMF represents a critical deterioration of  Congressional oversight, which should be repealed, rather than repeated  with respect to North Korea.   As our brave service members are deployed around the world in combat  zones, Congress is missing in action.   As provided under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, absent a  Congressional declaration of war or authorization for the use of  military force, the President as Commander-in-Chief has constitutional  power to engage the U.S. armed forces in hostilities only in the case  of a national emergency created by an attack upon the United States,  its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.   As a co-equal branch of government, it is Congress's right and  responsibility to be fully consulted regarding any potential plans to  conduct military operations in foreign lands and to assess whether such  action is in the national security interest of the United States and  its allies, and to withhold or grant authorization for the use of  military force based on this assessment.   As we have learned from the painful and bitter experience of the past  16 years, at the initiation of hostilities, the costs in terms of blood  and treasure of U.S. military interventions abroad are often  underestimated and the benefits overstated.   For example, more than 6,800 American service members gave the last  full measure of devotion to their country on battlefields in  Afghanistan and Iraq, with hundreds of thousands more returning with  physical, emotional, or psychological wounds that may never heal.   The direct economic cost of the war in Afghanistan exceeds $1.07  trillion, including $773 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations  funds, an increase of $243 billion to the Department of Defense base  budget, and an increase of $54.2 billion to the Veterans Administration  budget to address the human costs of the military involvement in  Afghanistan.   I am confident that affording Members the opportunity to debate and  vote on the Lee Amendments would strengthen our democracy and help  restore Congress's preeminent constitutional role in the decision to  take the nation to war.   Mr. Speaker, I also rise in strong opposition to the Carter Amendment  to H.R. 3219, Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY2018.   I oppose the amendment because it is ineffective, costly, and  wasteful legislation for three reasons: it is costly and ineffective;  President Trump broke his promise that Mexico would fund the wall; and  a policy shift of this magnitude requires regular order with the  Committees of Jurisdiction weighing in on the real cost to the American  people should a wall be built.   First, I oppose the Carter Amendment because it is costly and  ineffective.   It wastes $1.6 billion to build an unnecessary wall with our already  peaceful neighbors to the south.   Only $32 million dollars of that $1.6 billion would actually go  towards the wall.   That leaves over $1.5 billion simply wasted.   The wall throws away American taxpayers' money when it could and  should be spent on a number of necessary initiatives like education,  healthcare, transportation, infrastructure, or even military  preparedness.   Second, I oppose H.R. 3219 because Trump swore Mexico would pay for  the wall.   The President has broken his promise to the American people and is  asking American taxpayers to foot a $1.6 billion bill for a useless,  expensive wall.   No wonder the wall is strongly opposed by Democrats and many  Republicans.   There is no assurance that Americans would ever be reimbursed by  Mexico.   Trump's cost estimations do not include the cost of building in more  treacherous terrain, access roads, maintenance, or acquiring land in  Texas, where almost all border landholdings are privately held.   Building this wall would require stripping landholders in my very own  home state of Texas of their private land.   Instead of wasting $1.6 billion on building a wall, that money could  be appropriated to maintaining our effective border security and  immigration practices, like those currently in place for asylum  seekers.   The United States already enforces the most extensive immigration and  border security practices in the world. We have   This is a bad business deal for the American people.   Third, I oppose the Carter Amendment because it is represents a  policy shift that will have dire consequences for our economy that far  exceed the $50 billion estimated cost of this wall.   A policy shift of this magnitude requires regular order with the  committees of jurisdiction weighing in on the real cost to the American  people should a wall be built.   Mexico happens to be one of the United States' strongest trading  partners.   U.S. goods and services trade with Mexico totaled an estimated $579.7  billion in 2016.   Exports were $262.0 billion; imports were $317.6 billion.   The U.S. goods and services trade deficit with Mexico was $55.6  billion in 2016.   Mexico is currently our 3rd largest goods trading partner with $525.1  billion in total (two way) goods trade during 2016.   Goods exports totaled $231.0 billion; goods imports totaled $294.2  billion.   The U.S. goods trade deficit with Mexico was $63.2 billion in 2016.   Trade in services with Mexico (exports and imports) totaled an  estimated $54.5 billion in 2016.   Services exports were $31.1 billion; services imports were $23.5  billion.   The U.S. services trade surplus with Mexico was $7.6 billion in 2016.   According to the Department of Commerce, U.S. exports of Goods and  Services to Mexico supported an estimated 1.2 million jobs in 2015.   Mexico was the United States' 2nd largest goods export market in  2016.   U.S. exports to Mexico in 2016 were $231.0 billion, down 2.0 percent  ($4.8 billion) from 2015 but up 72.7 percent from 2006. U.S. exports to  Mexico are up 455 percent from 1993 (pre-NAFTA).  [[Page H6485]]    U.S. exports to Mexico account for 15.9 percent of overall U.S.  exports in 2015.   The top export categories in 2016 were: machinery ($42 billion),  electrical machinery ($41 billion), vehicles ($21 billion), mineral  fuels ($20 billion), and plastics ($16 billion).   U.S. total exports of agricultural products to Mexico totaled $18  billion in 2016, our 3rd largest agricultural export market.   Leading domestic export categories include: corn ($2.6 billion),  soybeans ($1.5 billion), pork & pork products ($1.4 billion), dairy  products ($1.2 billion), and beef & beef products ($975 million).   U.S. exports of services to Mexico were an estimated $31.1 billion in  2016, 1.4 percent (441 million) less than 2015, but 30.5 percent  greater than 2006 levels. It was up roughly 199 percent from 1993 (pre- NAFTA).   Leading services exports from the U.S. to Mexico, in 2015, were in  the travel, transport, and intellectual property (computer software,  industrial processes) sectors.   Mexico was the United States' 2nd largest supplier of goods imports  in 2016.   U.S. goods imports from Mexico totaled $294.2 billion in 2016, down  0.8 percent ($2.3 billion) from 2015, but up 48.4 percent from 2006.   U.S. imports from Mexico are up 637 percent from 1993 (pre-NAFTA).  U.S. imports from Mexico account for 13.4 percent of overall U.S.  imports in 2015.   The top import categories (2-digit HS) in 2016 were: vehicles ($75  billion), electrical machinery ($62 billion), machinery ($51 billion),  optical and medical instruments ($13 billion), and furniture and  bedding ($11 billion).   U.S. total imports of agricultural products from Mexico totaled $23  billion in 2016, our 1st largest supplier of agricultural imports.   Leading categories include: fresh vegetables ($5.6 billion), other  fresh fruit ($4.9 billion), wine and beer ($3.1 billion), snack foods  ($2.0 billion), and processed fruit & vegetables ($1.5 billion).   U.S. imports of services from Mexico were an estimated $23.5 billion  in 2016, 7.0 percent ($1.5 billion) more than 2015, and 57.9 percent  greater than 2006 levels. It was up roughly 216 percent from 1993 (pre- NAFTA). Leading services imports from Mexico to the U.S., in 2015, were  in the travel, transport, and technical and other services sectors.   The U.S. goods trade deficit with Mexico was $63.2 billion in 2016, a  4.2 percent increase ($2.5 billion) over 2015.   The United States has a services trade surplus of an estimated $7.6  billion with Mexico in 2016, down 20.7 percent from 2015.   U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Mexico (stock) was $92.8  billion in 2015 (latest data available), a 3.5 percent increase from  2014. U.S. direct investment in Mexico is led by manufacturing, nonbank  holding companies, and mining.   Mexico's FDI in the United States (stock) was $16.6 billion in 2015  (latest data available), up 0.2 percent from 2014. Mexico's direct  investment in the U.S. is led by manufacturing, wholesale trade, and  depository institutions.   Sales of services in Mexico by majority U.S.-owned affiliates were  $45.9 billion in 2014 (latest data available), while sales of services  in the United States by majority Mexico-owned firms were $8.5 billion.   We share one of the longest peaceful borders in the world with our  neighbors to the north and to the south. We are not at war with our  peaceful neighbors; we do not need to build an almost 2,000 mile wall  to divide us from our neighbor.   This tragic initiative is inconsistent with the American character of  building bridges not walls.   These are just some of the facts that Committees of Jurisdiction  would have to weigh before we make any decision.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this Rule so  that this bill can return to the Rules Committee to have Division E  removed from this appropriations package.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Price), the distinguished ranking member of the  Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban  Development.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  this so-called security minibus.   The Republican majority has rushed through the fiscal year 2018  appropriations process, passing 12 bills without benefit of a budget  resolution. Now they have failed to secure the votes on the floor for  that Republican-only omnibus package, so they have decided to move  forward with what is before us today--four appropriations bills  stitched together that would bust the Budget Control Act defense cap  and, if enacted, result in a $72 billion sequester against all defense  accounts.   The entire fiscal year '18 appropriations process has been a  Republican exercise in sham accounting and wishful thinking: ignore  current law, jack up defense spending, and impose huge, unnecessary,  and detrimental cuts on domestic appropriations.   When future students learn about congressional appropriations, this  episode should be exhibit A of what not to do.   The four bills before us today are also full of objectionable and  unreasonable policy riders, including the ridiculous inclusion in the  rule of $1.6 billion to be spent on 74 miles of border wall. Nobody  would know it from the President's hysterical rhetoric, but there are  already 700 miles of fence along the border--vehicular fencing and  pedestrian fencing. I know about it because most of that fence was  built when I was chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations  Subcommittee.   When Congress appropriated funds to build that fence, we required  segment-by-segment analyses and environmental impact studies. This bill  doesn't include that. It doesn't include any language regarding  congressional oversight. There are no requirements for Homeland  Security to submit a cost-benefit analysis or to work with Congress  through any modifications.   Mr. Speaker, funding an unnecessary wall, especially without  congressional oversight, is not a defensible use of taxpayer dollars.  We would simply become complicit in what we all know was campaign  demagoguery.   Speaking of which, wasn't the Mexican Government going to pay for  this wall? Weren't they going to pick up the tab?   This $1.6 billion should be spent on much more important priorities,  within and beyond homeland security, that would actually improve the  lives of our citizens.   It is time for Republicans to stop playing games with taxpayer money  and start negotiating with Democrats. We know this is going to have to  happen eventually. We need a bipartisan budget and appropriations  package that actually has a chance of becoming law and that addresses  the need of a great country for serious investment.   Oppose the border wall. Oppose this sham appropriations minibus.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New York has 8\1/2\  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I  will offer an amendment to the rule to allow the House to consider  Representative Lee's AUMF amendment--authority to use military force.  This will provide all Members the chance for an up-or-down vote, which  we have, thus far, been denied.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee) to discuss our proposal.    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman.    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, if we hadn't had this last election and the campaign  that went with it, we wouldn't be talking about any wall. One of the  candidates threw out that he would like to have a wall and was sure--he  gave us the absurd notion that somehow Mexico would pay for it.   Not many of us believed that, but I will tell you, now that we have  put in this $1.6 billion for this wall, I will bet you that we are  going to finish it, and we don't know how much it costs--somewhere  between $20 billion and $40 billion for a wall.   Now, if I have heard correctly what my colleagues have said over  there, the walls are working already, the ones they have got. There are  walls there. I  [[Page H6489]]  heard San Diego had three. So the idea, I guess, if one works, we will  build us another one. Oh, my goodness.   This funding bill that we are talking about spending on a wall is  needed to repair roads and bridges and bring down the cost of  education, but the majority refuses to have debate on the AUMF,  something that is critically important, life and death to many people  who live in this country who are presently in the armed services. This  amendment should have been included here.   And I appreciate what my colleague, Mr. Sanford, said. He is  absolutely right. But if we were to get a new AUMF, it would put  Congress back into its duty to declare war. That is something that the  Constitution gave us that we no longer have.
