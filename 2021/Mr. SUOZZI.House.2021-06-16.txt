 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a giant of the judiciary; a  member of the Greatest Generation; an independent advocate for the  least, the lost, and the left behind.   Yesterday, the Eastern District of New York, the residents of Great  Neck, his family, and all justice-seeking people lost a giant intellect  and champion.   Judge Jack B. Weinstein was 99 years old.   Judge Weinstein served as a Navy lieutenant during World War II.  After the war, Weinstein graduated from Columbia Law School on the GI  Bill and went to work for the NAACP; clerk for the Court of Appeals;  teach at Columbia; serve as the Nassau County Attorney; and, in 1967,  President Johnson appointed him to the Federal bench.   My father, also a World War II veteran and member of the State  judiciary, always pushed me to seek out and learn from this brilliant  jurist when I clerked in the same courthouse. Judge Weinstein  encouraged me throughout my career.   Judge Weinstein created the concept of a special master in complex  mass tort cases. He protested mandatory sentencing guidelines that he  believed betrayed the concept that the punishment should fit the crime,  especially in drug cases.   Time does not permit me to properly extol his intellect, compassion,  and impact, but on behalf of the people of the Third Congressional  District of New York, I offer my condolences to his family and I hope  they will take comfort that his life will never be forgotten.                            ____________________
