 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 2474, the Protecting the  Right to Organize Act of 2019.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chair, throughout their history, America's labor unions have  enabled millions of American workers to secure their place in the  middle class and receive their fair share of the profits they produce.  When workers have the power to stand together and negotiate with their  employer, they have higher pay, better benefits, and safer working  conditions.   Unions not only benefit union members, but also nonunion members  benefit from the higher wages that union members enjoy. And even the  children of union members also do better. And under union contracts,  pay gaps disappear because union members get equal pay for equal work.   But union membership, which peaked at around 30 percent of the  workforce during the 1950s, is just at 10 percent today. That is the  lowest level since just after the National Labor Relations Act was  enacted in 1935. It is not a coincidence that as union membership has  decreased, income inequality has increased.   This decline in union membership is not a function of workers'  choices. A recent study found that nearly half of nonunion workers  would join a union if given the chance. The gap between worker  preferences and union membership is the product of intensified  antiworker attacks and labor laws that fail to address unfair labor  practices.   The lesson from the last 40 years is clear: That it is our current  labor laws that are too weak to defend workers' rights to join a union  and to collectively bargain with their employer.   H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or the PRO Act,  is the most significant upgrade in U.S. labor laws in 80 years. This  comprehensive proposal makes sensible reforms to protect and strengthen  workers' rights.   The PRO Act would put teeth in the Nation's labor laws by authorizing  the NLRB to assess meaningful civil penalties when companies violate  their workers' rights to organize and bargain.   It will close loopholes that the corporations use to misclassify  workers as independent contractors instead of employees; thereby  evading their obligation to bargain, as well as evading their  obligation to pay minimum wage and overtime; provide Worker's  Compensation, unemployment compensation, and employee benefits.   It ensures that workers can decide whether to form a union without  interference. Democracy in the workplace should be a right, not a  fight.   Too many Americans are now working too hard for too little. And while  corporations are enjoying record-level profits, workers and their  families are struggling to keep pace with rising costs of housing,  childcare, education, and other essentials.   So I urge my colleagues to support the PRO Act, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, low-income workers are being  better paid because of State minimum wage laws that most Republicans  opposed. And jobs created in the 35 months of the Trump administration  are fewer than the jobs created in the last 35 months of the Obama  administration.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wilson), chair  of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the chair of the Subcommittee  on Civil Rights and Human Services.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), the co-chair of the Progressive  Caucus.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), a distinguished member of  the Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), a distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross), a distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan), a distinguished member of  the Committee on Education and Labor who knows that union members make  more than nonunion members.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), the co-chair of the  Progressive Caucus and distinguished member of the Committee on  Education and Labor, and a lady who knows, by every measure, that  economic progress was better under Obama than President Trump.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader  of the House of Representatives.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), who is the co-chair of  the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee). She is someone who has read the  bill and knows that civil fines in the bill are paid to the U.S.  Treasury, not to the unions victimized by unfair labor practices.    Mr. Chairman, can you advise how much time is  remaining on each side?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch), who is a strong supporter of  workers and who hails from one of the majority of States that have an  ABC test.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski), who knows that Social Security  numbers are not available under this bill, but the same information  that the Trump NLRB currently provides is in the bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Rose).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), the vice chair of the Committee on  Education and Labor.    Mr. Chair, I have a couple of other speakers,  but they are not here now, so we are prepared to close.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act is based on a  simple idea that hard work should pay off. Strong labor unions and  collective bargaining rights have long ensured that workers receive a  fair share of the profits that they have produced.   Unfortunately, decades of antiunion attacks have slowly eroded  workers' collective bargaining rights, weakened labor unions, and  contributed to a dramatic rise in income inequality.   When workers have the power to stand together and form a union, they  [[Page H893]]  have higher wages, better benefits, and safer working conditions. The  protecting the Right to Organize Act is an opportunity for all of us to  stand with workers and help build an economy where everyone can  succeed.   Mr. Chair, I recognize the workers and advocates, both here today and  across the country, who have been critical in bringing this legislation  to the floor. In that regard, I include in the Record a letter from 138  unions and civil rights and faith-based organizations in support of  H.R. 2474.                                                   January 31, 2020.        Dear Representatives: The undersigned organizations support       the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, as introduced       by Senators Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Jacky Rosen (D-      Nevada), Representatives Bobby Scott (D-Va.), Frederica       Wilson (D-Fla.), Andy Levin (D-Mich.), Pramila Jayapal (D-      Wash.), and Brendan Boyle (D-Penn.).        The ability of working people to join together to       collectively bargain for fair pay and working conditions is a       fundamental right. When working people join a union, they       have a voice on the job and the ability to collectively       bargain for wages, benefits, and working conditions. Unions       are crucial in fostering a vibrant middle class and reducing       income inequality. When unions are strong, they set wage       standards for entire industries and occupations, they make       wages more equal within occupations, and they help close       racial and gender wage gaps.        For decades, however, that right has been eroding as       employers exploit weaknesses in the current law to interfere       with workers' rights--and face no real consequences for doing       so. The result has been stagnant wages, unsafe workplaces,       and rising inequality.        The PRO Act would go a long way toward restoring workers'       right to organize and bargain collectively by streamlining       the process for forming a union, ensuring that new unions are       able to negotiate a first collective bargaining agreement,       and holding employers accountable when they violate workers'       rights.        This is important because by bringing workers' collective       power to the bargaining table, unions are able to win better       wages and benefits for working people. On average, a worker       covered by a union contract earns 13.2 percent more in wages       than a peer with similar education, occupation, and       experience in a nonunionized workplace in the same sector.       Moreover, when unions are strong, they set wage standards for       entire industries and occupations, they make wages more equal       within occupations, and they help close racial and gender       wage gaps. Finally, there is a huge gap between the share of       workers with union representation (11.9 percent) and the       share of workers that would like to have a union and a voice       on the job (48 percent). The PRO Act would take a major step       forward in closing that gap.        The PRO Act protects the right to join a union by:        1. Imposing stronger remedies when employers interfere with       workers' rights. Under current law, there are no penalties on       employers nor any compensation awarded to workers when       employers illegally fire or retaliate against workers who are       trying to form a union. The PRO Act would institute civil       penalties for violations of the National Labor Relations Act       (NLRA) and would also require the National Labor Relations       Board (NLRB) to go to court and get an injunction to       immediately reinstate workers if the NLRB believes the       employer has illegally retaliated against workers for union       activity. Finally, the PRO Act would give workers the right       to go to court on their own to seek relief, bringing labor       law in line with other workplace laws that allow for a       private right of action.        2. Strengthening workers' right to join a union and       collectively bargain over working conditions. Though current       federal law requires employers to bargain in good faith with       the union chosen by their employees to reach a collective       bargaining agreement, employers often drag out the bargaining       process to avoid reaching an agreement. The PRO Act       establishes a process for reaching a first agreement when       workers organize, employing mediation and then, if necessary,       binding arbitration, to enable the parties to reach a first       agreement. The PRO Act would also allow employers and unions       to agree upon a ``fair share'' clause requiring all workers       who are covered by the collective bargaining agreement to       contribute a fair share fee towards the cost of bargaining       and administering the agreement, even in so called ``right-      to-work'' states. Furthermore, the PRO Act will help level       the playing field for workers by repealing the prohibition on       secondary boycotts and prohibiting employers from permanently       replacing strikers.        3. Unrigging the rules that are tilted against workers. Too       often, employers misclassify workers as independent       contractors because only employees have the right to organize       under the NLRA. Similarly, employers will misclassify workers       as supervisors to deprive them of their NLRA rights. The PRO       Act tightens the definitions of independent contractor and       supervisor to crack down on misclassification and make sure       that all eligible workers are able to unionize if they choose       to do so. The PRO Act also makes clear that workers can have       more than one employer, and that both employers need to       engage in collective bargaining over the terms and conditions       of employment that they control or influence. And in an       effort to create transparency in labor-management relations,       the PRO Act would require employers to post notices that       inform workers of their NRLA rights and to disclose contracts       with consultants hired to persuade workers on how to exercise       their rights.        The time for the PRO Act is long overdue, and we cannot       delay in working toward its passage. We call on Congress to       enact this important piece of legislation as quickly as       possible to ensure working people are paid fairly, treated       with dignity, and have a voice on the job.

[[Page H894]]          Mr. Chair, I once again urge my colleagues to  support the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, under current law, which has been  in effect since 1935, an employer may voluntarily recognize the union  if a majority of employees have demonstrated support through signed  cards or a petition to organize.   If an employer decides not to recognize the union based on those  signatures, then NLRB will direct a secret ballot election to determine  whether the employees will be represented by the union. The PRO Act  does not alter these requirements which have been in effect since 1935.   This amendment would limit the workers' and employers' option to  enter into voluntary recognition agreements. There is no reason why we  should limit workers' options to an election if the workers and  employers agree to forego it.   But let's be clear. The PRO Act does not require card check in lieu  of elections. Instead, it strengthens current law by requiring an  employer to bargain with a union if the union has demonstrated majority  support and the employer's interference coerced employees into voting  against the union.   The only time the NLRB can order an employer to bargain, absent a  secret ballot, is when the employer interferes with the union election  after a majority have already indicated support through signed  authorization cards or a petition. Again, this is current law, set  forth by the Supreme Court, and it has been in effect since 1969.   In fact, the PRO Act actually strengthens secret ballot elections by  ensuring they are free and fair, both to the workers and to the  employers.   Contrary to the argument that this legislation undermines secret  ballots, the PRO Act does make a change because it expands the use of  secret ballot elections because current law allows employers to  withdraw recognition of a union without an election to decertify the  union if the employer has evidence that the union has lost the majority  support.    The PRO Act just says that union elections are required for  decertification, by secret ballot, that must take place before the  employer can withdraw recognition. So this actually expands secret  ballot elections and, otherwise, pretty much maintains current law that  has been in effect for decades.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my  time, only to remind the House that the only time the NLRB can order an  [[Page H902]]  employer to bargain with a union, absent a secret ballot, is when the  employer interferes with the union election after the majority has  already indicated support through signed cards or petitions.   If the employer wants to insist on a secret ballot, all they have to  do is not violate the Labor Relations Act.   The other side of it is that if they want to decertify, they have to  have an election. So that is a change. But that is more secret ballot  elections, not fewer.   So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).    Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   First, I want to point out that, by every measure, unemployment, jobs  per month, a Dow Jones industrial average, even the deficit were all  better under President Obama than President Trump.   We also know that union members get better wages, better benefits,  and safer workplaces than nonmembers. But unions have the duty to  represent all workers in a bargaining unit, even those who are not  members of the union.   In so-called right-to-work States, that means the union must equally  represent those nonmembers who are free to avoid paying their fair  share of the costs of representation. This obligation to represent  everyone is known as the duty of fair representation.   Since all workers receive a benefit from union representation, it is  only fair that everyone contribute their fair share. For example, if a  worker files a grievance, the union must represent  [[Page H904]]  that person with individualized representation, and that could cost  thousands of dollars a day.   Likewise, when a union incurs expenses while bargaining for raises or  benefits, everyone in the bargaining unit benefits, so it only makes  sense that everyone help pay for that representation.   The PRO Act permits unions and employers to negotiate labor  agreements, which include a service fee to cover the fair share of the  cost of providing services mandated by law. That does not mean  political activities or advocacy or holiday parties or Fourth of July  celebrations, just those that are required by law. It just ensures that  those who enjoy the benefits of union representation pay their fair  share.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, this is the last step before we  can pass the PRO Act. We know that union members make higher salaries,  get better benefits, work in safer workplaces. Nonunion members benefit  from the high salaries.
