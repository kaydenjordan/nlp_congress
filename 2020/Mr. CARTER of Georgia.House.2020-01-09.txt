 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Georgia State Senator Greg Kirk, who passed away on December 22 at  the age of 56 after a battle with cancer.   A former pastor, Senator Kirk was first elected to the State senate  in 2014. Representing Americus in southwest Georgia, he spent his 6  years in the State senate working hard for rural Georgians: spurring  job creation, protecting life, and always putting God first.   His colleagues in the State senate remember him as an exceptional  public servant who was always a champion for doing what is right,  making him one of the State's most fervent and gracious leaders.   One of his most important pieces of legislation included a bill that  would legally protect people who broke into a vehicle to help rescue a  child that had been left unattended in hot weather.   His presence, leadership, and passion for service will be dearly  missed in the Georgia State senate. Senator Kirk's family and friends  will be in my thoughts and prayers during this most difficult time.              In Recognition of International Seafarers' Center     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  International Seafarers' Center in Brunswick, Georgia, for all of their  work throughout the First Congressional District of Georgia.   Operating in coastal Georgia for the last 38 years, the International  Seafarers' Center strives to provide spiritual, emotional, physical,  and material support to mariners passing through our area. Currently,  the Port of Brunswick, alone, receives 16,000 seafarers annually who  have very little access to the conveniences of home while they are at  sea.   The International Seafarers' Center is guided by its Christian faith,  and with their two hospitality centers, they have done an exceptional  job of serving those mariners from all walks of life, different  religions, countless languages, and diverse races.   One of the most notable examples of their work includes their effort  to provide clothing and food to 20 crew members of the Golden Ray cargo  ship that had capsized off the coast of St. Simon's Island in September  of 2019.   I cannot thank everyone involved with the International Seafarers'  Center enough for making the First Congressional District of Georgia  such a welcoming place for seafarers to pass through during their time  at sea.   Keep up the good work.                                time  1100                     Honoring the Service of Betty Gillis     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms.  Betty Gillis, who is retiring after 41 years serving as supervisor of  Ware County's Board of Elections and Registration.   Throughout the past 4 decades, Ms. Gillis has done an exceptional job  in the First Congressional District, ensuring that Ware County's  elections are both robust and fair.   Looking back on her time, she remembers that she has enjoyed every  minute of it, and she has come to think of her colleagues as extended  family.   In her retirement, Ms. Gillis is planning to spend more time with her  family. However, it will simply be impossible to replace a public  servant as dedicated and excited about her role as Ms. Gillis.   Thank you for your service to the First Congressional District of  Georgia, Ms. Gillis. Congratulations on a retirement well-deserved.            Honoring the Life and Legacy of Clair Wofford Frazier     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Ms. Clair Wofford Frazier, who passed away on December 23, 2019, at  the age of 58, after a battle with cancer.   Ms. Wofford Frazier dedicated her life to serving her alma mater,  Young Harris College. A member of the Board of Trustees for over a  decade, she served on a number of different committees that impacted  daily campus life, including committees on academic affairs,  development, and student affairs.   She also created the Wofford-Frazier scholarship to help a Young  Harris education be as accessible as possible for deserving students. A  testament to her work, the executive board room at the college is named  in her honor, and she won the Susan B. Harris Award from the Alumni  Association in 2008.   Similar to her generosity with the college, those who knew her  remember that Ms. Wofford Frazier was always the first person to offer  help to someone in need.   My thoughts and prayers will be with Ms. Wofford Frazier's family  during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
