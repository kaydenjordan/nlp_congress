 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay  tribute to a lost hero.   This past Saturday evening, around 6 p.m., L.A. County Sheriff Deputy  Ryan Clinkunbroomer was ambushed and brutally executed while sitting in  his patrol vehicle in broad daylight in my district's Antelope Valley.   At the young age of just 30 years old, Ryan had proposed to his  beautiful fiancee, Brittany, just 4 days before he was murdered. He was  a field training officer and was by all accounts one of the best  sheriffs in the Palmdale station.   Ryan was a third-generation sheriff. His dad, Mike, served as a  sheriff, as well as his grandfather.   Mr. Speaker, there are no words that can give solace to his family  and fellow sheriffs in the station. The healing will take decades and  even then will only just begin to close these very deep wounds.   This morning, his alleged killer was apprehended.   In the midst of the unbearable pain, Mr. Speaker, we have an  obligation to seek justice and full accountability. We have an  obligation to compel all elected officials at all levels of government  and all citizens, regardless of political party, to unequivocally  support our precious and vulnerable police officers, not just with  words but also with resources, and not just with resources, but also  with respect.   The killing of a police officer should be a Federal felony punishable  by death or life in prison, and I will do all I can to make sure that  that happens.   It is an indication of a failing society and culture that develops a  human being that is comfortable with executing a hero like Deputy Ryan  Clinkunbroomer.   Ryan served every day of his life with honor and dignity to protect  the good guys from the bad guys. He did it right. We owe him and his  family and his fellow law enforcement officers a level of gratitude  that will never be sufficient. As hard as we may try to appreciate what  they have done, it will still only just be at the feet of their  towering service and sacrifices.   Praise be to God and His Son, the Father of compassion, to give the  [[Page H4354]]  Clinkunbroomer family comfort now at their darkest hour. May He and we  hold Ryan's killer accountable with the fury of a thousand suns.   I implore District Attorney Gascon of Los Angeles to file maximum  charges against his alleged killer.   May God, with Ryan by his side, protect and bless our police officers  who put their lives on the line every day while they provide the rest  of us with our security blanket.                             Honoring Carl Raggio     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay  tribute to my good friend, the former mayor of Glendale, and my mentor,  Mr. Carl Raggio, who passed away on June 20 of this year.   Carl, despite his nearly 95 years of age, remained a wise and  sprightly man until he left us.   A resident of my hometown, Santa Clarita, Carl was a family man. He  is survived by his lovely bride of 72 years, Lynne; as well as their  sons, Carl and Paul; and their daughter, Lisa; 15 grandchildren; and 8  great-grandchildren.   Carl was, in fact, a rocket scientist. Working at JPL for 39 years,  he was instrumental in the design of several pioneering spacecraft,  including Explorer 1, which was the first satellite launched by the  United States into space in 1958, and he did it all with just a slide  rule. Can you imagine that?   Today, Carl is in Heaven, flying higher than any spacecraft he  developed in this world.   Godspeed, Carl Raggio. Thank you for your love of country and your  service to our beautiful Nation.                            ____________________
