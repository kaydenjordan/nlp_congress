 Mr. Speaker, Saturday, we cobbled together a 45-day  continuing resolution. That is not my preferred way of doing business  around here. Indeed, what I talk about to my constituents at home is  the process that the House Republicans with our majority have attempted  to put in place and are putting into place, a successful Appropriations  Committee process.   Now, this isn't just jargon, and it is inside baseball for a lot of  people, but when people understand what it is they are trying to  accomplish, the Appropriations Committee is going to be the  transparency, the light of day, the sunshine on the spending process  that D.C. has, and of which we need much more.   We didn't quite get there this year. We got 70 percent of our  spending--I hate to use that term, but that is the jargon here-- accomplished in four bills already. We still need to do eight bills as  our budget is divided into about 12 pieces in the appropriations  process. We have a little ways to grind out here.   So what happened? We weren't able to come to agreement, even amongst  all Republicans on getting all these bills done. We had a good start in  getting a few things done last week, but we have much more to do.                                time  1230    We want to get through the whole process because we want transparency  so the public can see what it is we are doing in this process, the  Appropriations Committee, in the light of day, line-by-line, et cetera,  so that we can then send documents over to the Senate and have them  contemplate those bills. They are not going to like exactly what we do,  but we will bring those bills back and hopefully achieve a consensus we  can all live with in this era.   I have to remind you, what we have laid out as our goals as House  Republicans aren't necessarily shared by the Senate or the White House.  It is a hostile environment to try and cut back to pre-COVID levels of  spending, as well as secure our border, from the Senate Democrat  majority and the Biden White House.   These are our goals.   We want to have a secure border.   We had a document early last week that we thought was going to take a  giant leap there, but we couldn't get all the votes we needed even in  our own Conference to get it done. That is pretty frustrating.   Now, we have this 45-day ability to buy time with what we passed the  other day. I am not happy with continuing resolutions, especially long- term ones. This is fairly short-term. It will enable us to do our work  and get these appropriations done. That is what we are doing. Yes, it  continues spending pretty much as it was, but we were up against a  deadline.   Now, what are the bad things? A government shutdown is what we were  up against. That is a terrible way of doing business. I have been  around a couple of them and so have my colleagues that  [[Page H4939]]  have been here longer than me. One of my friends who has been through  five of them has said nobody ever wins politically or policywise on a  shutdown.   What happens?   Our troops stop getting paid. Our loyal soldiers out there on the  front lines stop getting paid, and they are already underwaged, so to  speak.   The contracts that we would have with Defense come to a grinding  halt.   Other Federal projects like construction, roads, infrastructure, what  have you, come to a grinding halt.   Now, what happens on that? When you demobilize construction crews or  assembly lines like that, they don't just turn right back on and off  like a light switch. People go home. They move their equipment to other  projects. It is much more expensive to turn something back on that was  already in momentum.   Try shutting off a nuclear power plant. That is not the same as what  we are talking about here, but you don't just turn these things on and  off. That is what happens.   Permitting. When folks have been waiting so long for EPA or Army  Corps of Engineers or somebody else to get their freaking job done on  getting permits out, and then they have an excuse to shut down--oh,  this week-long shutdown, this 2-week shutdown, it is going to set us  back 3 months. We have heard that sort of thing around here.   Even though it might feel good to say, yeah, let's shut the mother  down--because a lot of people don't like what government does,  including me, in my real life as a farmer in northern California I see  a lot of dumb stuff the government does--shutting things down in the  middle of the stream here doesn't really work for anybody,  unfortunately.   The Federal employees will still get paid even if they are not at  work, so it is a paid vacation. They will get their backpay. Congress  will still get paid by the month. It doesn't really shut anything off  that way. We don't gain a lot with a shutdown. We held our nose, and we  are going to do this for 45 days to do a good process in the  Appropriations Committee.   I want to have faith in that, and I want the American public to have  faith in an open process and doing it correctly because process is  something that has been lacking a lot in Congress and in government in  recent years. We have to cling to the process as something that is  important so we can have things laid out constitutionally.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, securing our border should be a bipartisan  goal, and indeed House Republicans are dedicated to that. We had most  of the elements of H.R. 2 in a bill last week that we just fell short  on mustering, unfortunately. We did pass H.R. 2 separately earlier on  to achieve that goal for the border. It is a comprehensive security  package that would end the invasion at the southern border, halt the  abuse of the asylum process, and strengthen border security.   Unfortunately, Senate Leader Schumer won't even bring it up for a  vote over in the Senate. Why not?   His own New York Governor, Democrat Kathy Hochul, called on Congress  this weekend demanding a limit on who can come across and for more  agents to catch illegal immigrants.   While Schumer should be listening to her, at least, every single New  York Democrat who voted for these right-to-shelter laws and soft-on- crime open border policies needs to realize their policies have now had  detrimental consequences.   It is not extreme to want law and order or to track who is coming  into our country. If New York City doesn't have the resources to deal  with these waves of illegals coming on to their streets, neither do the  small border towns in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.   The Senate must take up H.R. 2, and the Biden administration must  actually take action on our border.                            ____________________
