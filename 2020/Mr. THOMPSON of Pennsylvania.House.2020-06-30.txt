 Mr. Speaker, America found itself in  the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a crisis, the likes of which  many have not experienced in their lifetimes. There are those who run  from the crisis, those who run toward it, and those who find themselves  right in the middle without any say in the matter.   Today, many of those in the middle are the men and women stocking,  sanitizing, and serving our communities in grocery and convenience  stores throughout our country. These employees are among the unsung  heroes in the fight against COVID-19 who have been overlooked not only  in appreciation, but also in our support.   Grocery stores and convenience stores play a critical role in our  Nation's food supply chain, and reliable access to healthy foods is  essential for all Americans, as we have seen throughout this crisis.   To thank them for working around the clock and putting themselves at  risk throughout the pandemic, I would say that the employees working  our grocery stores and our convenience stores have probably had more  exposure to the public than any other position out there.   To thank them for what they do, I have introduced the Giving  Retailers and Our Convenience Employees Relief Act, or the GROCER Act.  The GROCER Act would alleviate the Federal tax burden for grocery store  and convenience store workers from February 15, 2020, to June 15, 2020,  for individuals making less than $75,000 a year. The bill also gives  the Treasury Secretary discretion to extend this benefit for an  additional 3 months.   The hardworking men and women stocking our shelves are among the  unsung heroes during the COVID-19 pandemic. These frontline workers are  putting in overtime to ensure that we have the resources we need to  weather this storm.   In times of crisis like these, we learn to fully appreciate these  workers who play a valuable role in our food supply chain. Food is  something that connects all of us, and access to food is something we  all depend upon.   I am proud that this is a bipartisan bill, and I would like to thank  my colleague, Congressman Dwight Evans from Philadelphia, for joining  me to lead this effort.   The GROCER Act is a simple way to say thank you to these workers who  leave their families each day, risking exposure to the virus, in order  to ensure that our families and constituents have access to the food  and resources we need. Without these workers, millions of Americans  would struggle to access necessities.    The GROCER Act is a commonsense way to compensate and support our  grocery and convenience store workers. The Federal tax holiday for  these workers would put more of their hard-earned money back into their  pockets to support themselves and their families.   I would like to urge my colleagues to join me in thanking these  frontline workers by supporting and cosponsoring the GROCER Act.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to  commemorate the life and legacy of Rik Paulsen.   Rik Paulsen was a committed community leader, a dedicated sailor, and  a dear friend of mine for many years. He passed away on Sunday, May 24,  at the age of 78.   Mr. Speaker, a graduate of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, Rik  truly lived up to the academy's motto, Acta Non Verba, or Deeds Not  Words.   I have had the pleasure of working with Rik as he served on the  Service Academy Selection Board in my district for more than 30 years.  It was an honor to have his input and his help while choosing the best  and brightest men and women to nominate for service to our Nation's  Armed Forces. Rik was truly passionate about service and was committed  to helping these students fulfill their dreams of serving this country.   Mr. Speaker, Rik's wife, Pamela, and the rest of the Paulsen family  are in my thoughts and prayers. He will truly be missed.                            ____________________
