 Madam President, along with my colleague Senator Mike  Crapo, I rise today to ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record the mission statement for the Citizens Committee for Election  Integrity and their recommended minimum standards for fair and honest  elections. Idahoans concerned about election integrity formed the  Citizens Committee for Election Integrity to demonstrate the meaning of  the Constitution by helping ensure the voices of ``We the people'' are  heard.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         The Citizens Committee for Election Integrity's mission       statement reads as follows:        All political power rests with the people.        Our Constitutionally guaranteed republican form of       government relies on free, fair, and honest elections to       select our representatives and leaders.        To ensure equal protection and equal representation of the       people, laws governing our elections must meet certain       minimum standards.        It is the purpose of this Citizens Committee to concisely       articulate the minimum standards for free, fair, and honest       elections. These standards shall then be used by our local,       state and federal legislators as a metric for reviewing and       revising election law to ensure free, fair, and honest       elections where the outcome is accepted by all citizens of       good will.        On January 2, 2021, the committee met at the Idaho State       Capitol to recommend the following minimum standards for fair       and honest elections:        Our Constitutionally guaranteed republican form of       government relies on free, fair, and honest elections to       select our representatives and leaders.        The standards listed here shall be used by our local, state       and federal legislators as a metric for reviewing and       revising election law to ensure free, fair, and honest       elections where the outcome is accepted by all citizens of       good will.        1. All voting processes, other than those needed to       preserve the privacy of a citizen's vote, must be open and       available for direct observation, with no minimum distance       requirements, and audit by agents of the candidates or       parties.        2. All election materials must have a secure chain of       custody at all times. Election officials must be accompanied       by observers when accessing any election materials. Records       of the chain of custody shall be complete and available for       audit.        3. All votes, regardless of voting method, shall be held to       equal standards.        4. Voters shall only be qualified electors that are able to       verifiably provide their government issued photo identity       before being issued a ballot. Voters who provide false       information, including information of voter qualification,       should face severe penalties.        5. As a condition of being issued a ballot, the voter's       identity and signature must be recorded in a permanent record       (Poll Book).        6. Original Ballots must have a physical form that allows       voting choices to be examined and properly interpreted by the       naked eye.        7. Ballots must have features designed to prevent       counterfeiting.        8. An auditable system for tracking the status of all       ballots must be implemented and maintained in the State of       origin. The total number of printed ballots must equal the       sum of the number of cast ballots, spoiled ballots, and       unvoted ballots.        9. Ballot tabulation must be conducted by two independent       and unrelated systems. The difference in totals between the       two systems must be less than one half the margin of victory       or 0.1% of the vote total, whichever is less. Tabulating       machines must only tabulate and not modify ballots in any       way, or be connected to the internet.        10. Before the results of an election can be certified, the       ballot counts must be reconciled with the voter records. The       margin of uncertainty must be less than one half the margin       of victory or 0.1% of the vote total, whichever is less.        11. Lists of qualified electors must be purged of       unqualified persons 180 days before an election. Voter Rolls       should be vetted and compared with available government       records to identify duplicate or ineligible registrations.        12. Laws and regulations governing an election may not be       changed for 180 days prior to that election.        13. All election records should be retained and preserved       for not less than 22 months.        14. Voter identification for provisional ballots must be       verified, with information provided by the voter, prior to       that ballot being counted.                            ____________________
