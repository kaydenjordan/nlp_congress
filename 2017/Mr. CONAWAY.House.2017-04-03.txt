 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shed light on the religious  persecution of Christians by the Chinese Government.   On March 5 of this year, Reverend Cao San Qiang, also known as  ``Pastor John,'' was arrested and is still behind bars in the Yunnan  province of southwest China. I believe that his arrest and detention  was for inflated charges leveled against him simply because he is a  Christian.   Pastor John has been a permanent resident of the United States since  1990, where he attended seminary and became a pastor in Greensboro,  North Carolina. He is married, with two children, and is kind and  humble. Even though he was living a comfortable life in the United  States, he kept his Chinese citizenship so he could continue to  [[Page H2618]]  travel there and spread the good word of Jesus Christ.   He has been ministering to the impoverished people of Myanmar and the  Yunnan province of China for over a decade. In these last 3 years, he  helped build and staff 16 schools in northern Myanmar.   For years, Pastor John regularly crossed the border on his small  motorcycle loaded with food and medicine, without incident. For some  reason, this time, he was arrested and charged as a smuggler.   Since his arrest, Chinese officials have raided and threatened a  number of Christian churches in several provinces. I urge the State  Department to seek Pastor John's immediate release from Chinese custody  and to stop further raids before other innocent individuals become  casualties of aggressive religious persecution.                            ____________________
