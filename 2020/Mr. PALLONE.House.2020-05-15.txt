 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise today in strong support of the HEROES Act. Our top priority is  the health and safety of the American people, and the HEROES Act lays  the foundation we will need to safely reopen the economy.   Contrary to my Republican colleagues, this legislation is directly  related to the pandemic. Our legislation builds out national testing  and contact tracing by finally requiring the Trump administration to  develop comprehensive plans with clear benchmarks and timelines.   We also mandate a national czar and supply chain to guarantee that  medical supplies, testing equipment, drugs, and, ultimately, vaccines  are available to all Americans.   The bill also provides States with additional increases for their  Medicaid programs to ensure that Americans don't lose their health  insurance, and it ensures that all COVID-19 treatments and vaccines are  free of cost-sharing for patients, as we did with previous legislation  for testing.   The HEROES Act, Mr. Speaker, protects vulnerable patients in nursing  homes by providing funding for States to establish and deploy strike  teams, manage outbreaks, and assist with clinical care, infection  control, and staffing.   This legislation also helps families stay connected. It ensures that  they don't lose critical utility services. It prevents home energy and  water service shutoffs and establishes a new program to provide water  bill assistance for low-income households.   We also prohibit telephone and broadband service providers from  stopping service, and provide bill assistance to low-income families  and those who have lost their jobs.   The HEROES Act also provides funding to schools and libraries to  purchase hotspots, connected devices, and other equipment.   And finally, Mr. Speaker, we go after price gougers by providing the  Federal Trade Commission and State attorneys general the authority to  seek civil penalties from those engaging in price gouging of goods and  services.   Mr. Speaker, the HEROES Act is a bold next step in our process of  protecting the American people and providing critical assistance during  this crisis, and it is designed to try to end this pandemic,  ultimately. It deserves strong bipartisan support.                                time  1530
