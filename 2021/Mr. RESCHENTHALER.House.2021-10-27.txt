 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend and  colleague, Congressman Bentz, for yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to speak in support of the COPS  Counseling Act. It is a piece of bipartisan legislation that I  introduced with my good friend,   David Trone from Maryland.  Congressman Trone has been an incredible partner. I am really grateful  for all of his hard work, and as everybody in this body knows, no one  works harder than   David Trone when he is pushing a bill. It is quite  amazing to see and watch.   Mr. Speaker, every day, our Nation's law enforcement officers put  their own lives at risk to keep us safe. That service does not come  without sacrifice.   Last year, 178 current or Active-Duty law enforcement officers died  by suicide. Just this year, 121 officers have already taken their own  lives.   S. 1502 seeks to alleviate the stressors law enforcement experiences  by establishing clear confidentiality standards for peer-to-peer  counseling.   A Fraternal Order of Police survey showed that 73 percent of surveyed  officers found peer-to-peer support counseling to be the most helpful  mental health resource offered by police departments. Unfortunately, an  officer's peer support communications can be discoverable on public  record; it can be used in court proceedings; and worse, it can even  impact and affect their employment.   By creating clear standards for confidentiality, the COPS Counseling  Act would provide officers with peace of mind that their privacy is  protected when they seek peer support services.   This legislation also encourages State and local first responder  agencies to adopt peer counseling programs so more officers can take  advantage of this important mental health resource.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support our Nation's law  enforcement officers by voting for this legislation.
