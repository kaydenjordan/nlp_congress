 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for  organizing this Special Order hour conversation.   You asked the right question: What are they hiding and what are they  afraid of?   It is a bit of a rhetorical question, because when you think about  that chart you have displayed there, when you think about the  indictments and the plea deals and all of the other information that we  are beginning to glean, it is pretty obvious what they are afraid of  and what they are hiding.   This investigation is getting pretty darn close to the personal and  political and financial ties between this Presidency and those around  him and Russia, and it is a lot of information that they don't want the  world to know about. That is why we are seeing all of these  distractions, all of these elaborate and increasingly desperate  attempts to change the subject and create diversions.   Frankly, today, I am very worried that--not so much that this is  coming from our President, because we have seen him throughout his  career engage in character assassination, burning down the house  tactics, and all manner of ruthlessness, but I am disturbed that many  of our colleagues in this body have taken up those same tactics and  that same cause. That is dangerous.   One of the great things about this country, I believe, is that it is  about the rule of law. Our Founders actively debated this question  about whether we would be a country of laws and institutions or a  country of men.   Would we have some people above the law or would we all be subject to  the law?   They answered it loud and clear. We were going to be a country of law  and institutions. At every critical test in our history, we have  reaffirmed that essential great aspect of what it is to be the United  States of America. That is what Watergate was all about, as we are  beginning to remember.   Yet, today, it seems that that proposition is being retested all over  again. To my dismay, some of our colleagues are hoping for a different  answer as we retest that proposition this time. That is very troubling.   I am not in the habit of quoting FOX News very often, and certainly  not their news hosts, but one of their hosts, Shepard Smith, said  something that really struck a cord in the last few days. Here is what  he said about the so-called Nunes memo: ``A memo can be a weapon of  partisan mass distraction.''   That is exactly what this is: a desperate attempt to protect  President Trump from investigation and accountability.   I think we need to recap a few facts that brought us to this point.   Back in November 2016, when the chairman of the House Intelligence  Committee was appointed to President-elect Trump's transition team, he,  like our President, started sowing doubts about whether Russia had  interfered with the 2016 election, incorrectly claiming that there was  some kind of disagreement between our intelligence agencies on the  subject.   In fact, there was no disagreement. All of the American intelligence  community agreed that, as they had looked into this, they determined  that Russian operatives had worked to undermine the integrity of our  election. That conclusion has been reinforced and reaffirmed by  everything we have learned since then.   The chairman told Politico shortly before President Trump's  inauguration that the House should not investigate contacts between  Russia and the Trump camp, even though his Senate intelligence  counterparts had already committed to following the facts wherever they  may lead. So he had already made up his mind.                                time  2145    The chairman described the Trump-Russia connections as a dead trail.  He said there is nothing there. And, of course, we know President Trump  has said he has nothing to do with Russia, totally contradicted by  everything we have learned since.   All of this, of course, is going to come as a surprise if there is  nothing there to the President's campaign chair, who is under  indictment; to members of his family, who have been hauled before the  special prosecutor to answer to secret meetings and other dealings that  they have had with Russia; and to others in this administration who had  repeated contacts with Russia.   And, of course, no one can forget the intelligence chairman's trip to  the White House last year, where he staged an impromptu news  conference, claiming that he had briefed the White House about a source  who could explain how Trump campaign officials were caught up in  foreign intelligence intercepts. His unnamed sources that he rushed to  brief the White House about, well, it turned out they were White House  officials.   This was a completely choreographed stunt. They had planted the  misleading information with the chairman in the first place, obviously  desperate to give some cover to the President who had tweeted out about  wiretapping, conspiracies, and on it goes.   Mr. Speaker, my colleague, Ed Perlmutter, is asking all of the right  questions. This investigation is beginning to answer those questions in  very, very important ways. We need to make sure that it runs its  course. It is important to finding out the truth. The American people  deserve to know the truth.   It is also important to reaffirming that incredibly important aspect  of what makes this country great, and that is that we are a nation of  laws and institutions. We have to reaffirm that, unfortunately, over  and over again from time to time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   We are being taken back to the lessons of Watergate tonight. The  system worked in the 1970s. The checks and balances that our Founders  put in place took effect. The public stepped up. The media stepped up.  People of conscience in important positions within the government stood  their ground and did the right thing.   But I think it would be foolish for us not to take the threats of  this moment in our history very, very seriously because there are some  things at play this time around that weren't there in the 1970s. You  did not have rightwing media organs out there actively trying to  undermine public trust in our government. You did not have a complicit  United States Congress that, instead of doing oversight, seems to be  spending more of its effort running cover for the administration,  trying to hide the facts, trying to block investigations, playing  tribal politics at its worst, instead of fulfilling our institutional  role in a critical constitutional test like this.   I think it is a very, very serious moment in our history, and I am  glad that the gentleman is convening discussions like this on the  floor. We have to make sure that, in this investigation, the  professional law enforcement personnel who do this for a living are  allowed to do their job so that we can all learn the truth, whatever  that may be.   The question is: What are they afraid of? What are they hiding?   This investigation is going to answer those questions, and we will  all accept those answers, whatever they may be, but we have got to let  the system work.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership tonight.
