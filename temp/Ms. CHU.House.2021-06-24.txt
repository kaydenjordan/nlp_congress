 Madam Speaker, as the chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus'  Contraception and Family Planning Task Force, I rise in strong support  of Congresswoman Brownley's Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans  Act.   Every day, servicemembers are willing to sacrifice their lives for  our constitutional rights. So we must ensure that those rights are  available to them when they come home, and that includes the right to  contraception.   That is what this bill does, by ensuring that veterans, just like  their civilian neighbors, have access to the contraception that works  best for them, without the burden of copays. And since we know that not  every method of birth control works for every person, this bill  requires the VA to cover all FDA-approved contraception, including  emergency contraception, which is an especially important option in  sexual assault.   Contraception helps people plan for their futures, for their  families, and for themselves. This bill removes unnecessary barriers to  care for our veterans who have already given this Nation so much.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important  legislation.
