 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great  Nebraskan and patriot, John ``Gene'' Slattery, affectionately known as  ``the boy who sold his shirt'' because of his extraordinary efforts as  a young boy to raise funds for North Platte, Nebraska's World War II  Canteen.   Gene recently passed away at the age of 90. The North Platte Canteen  was one of the largest volunteer efforts during the war, providing  millions of American soldiers who passed through North Platte by rail  with meals, baked goods, and other items.   Gene was the last surviving major figure of the beloved Canteen, but  his work and legacy, and the work and legacy of the entire Canteen,  won't ever be forgotten.   Upon learning of the Canteen as a 9-year-old, Gene began donating for  auction anything he could find--toys, scrap metal, even the shirt off  his back. By the end of the war, Gene had raised more than $2,000 for  the Canteen. His contributions and fundraising gained national  recognition and were noticed by President Franklin Roosevelt, who sent  Gene a letter and a $5 donation.    Gene and the North Platte Canteen volunteers represent the very best  of Nebraska and America. The Canteen volunteers and the great lengths  to which they went to support our troops will always live on in our  hearts.                            ____________________
