 Mr. President, this week I have the distinct honor  of recognizing Montana Representative Kelly Flynn of Broadwater County  for his service to the State of Montana. Kelly is currently serving his  fourth term in the Montana State Legislature. He continues to serve  with an unyielding commitment to his constituents and the well-being of  the State, while also fighting cancer. This past November, Kelly made  the motion to adjourn the legislative special session, concluding,  ``Cancer may take my body but it will never take my heart and soul.''   Kelly's heart and soul are Montana through and through. Kelly is a  rancher and outfitter who serves as chairman of the Montana House of  Representatives Fish, Wildlife, and Parks Committee. He has also served  on the Governor's Council for Private Lands and Public Wildlife and the  Montana Board of Outfitters and is currently serving as a member of the  Broadwater County Farm Bureau. Montana has benefited greatly from his  decades of service.   Kelly has been a friend of mine for years. His work ethic is  exceptional, and he is the best master of ceremonies in Broadwater  County. His commitment to others represents the heart and soul of  Montana.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing June Rychalski for her service with the Montana  Department of Military Affairs. She has served Montana with grace,  diligence, a positive attitude, and genuine care for the people of the  Treasure State.   During her 35 years of service, June has been secretary to the senior  Army adviser, administrative assistant to the adjutant general, and  next month will complete her career with the Montana Veterans Affairs  Division. June demonstrated compassion and professionalism on a daily  basis. Her ability to help a grieving family member navigate the  challenges of veteran burial honors or steer a distressed veteran in  the right direction to attain benefits is highly commendable. Her  presence in the Montana Department of Military Affairs will be missed,  but the mentorship she provided agency personnel over the years will  ensure that her legacy endures. To her coworkers, June was regarded as  their greatest advocate.   When June retires, she plans to do what she has always done: continue  to take good care of others. At age 83, June's example is inspiring.  Her work ethic, compassion, and commitment to excellence represent the  best of Montana values.   Thank you, June, for your service. I wish you the best in retirement  and appreciate all you have done for our State.                            ____________________
