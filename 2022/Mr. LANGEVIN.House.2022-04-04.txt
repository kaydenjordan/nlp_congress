 Madam Speaker, this evening, the House of  Representatives passed H.R. 1916, the Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act, a  bill which would require health plans to cover medically necessary  services related to congenital anomalies.   I would like to share the story of one of my constituents, Caleb  Locke, a young man from Ashaway, Rhode Island, who was born with  ectodermal dysplasia. As a result of his condition, Caleb's lower jaw  is both thin and short with no ridge, and his posterior upper jaw lacks  sufficient bone structure.   Caleb is missing teeth, and he needs dental implants, but this  process will require multiple surgeries, including bone grafts from his  hip to reconstruct his jaw and sinuses.   Unfortunately, and unbelievably, Caleb's health insurance has deemed  these procedures as ``cosmetic'' and has consequently denied coverage.   Madam Speaker, Caleb needs these surgeries, and they are clearly not  cosmetic. It is wholly unacceptable that coverage can be denied on  those grounds.   Caleb, and anyone else with a congenital anomaly, should never be  denied coverage for medically necessary services related to their  conditions.   That is why I was proud to support the passage of H.R. 1916 this  evening, and I urge our colleagues in the Senate to promptly do the  same.                            ____________________
