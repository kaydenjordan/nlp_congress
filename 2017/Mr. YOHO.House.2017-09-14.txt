There is 1 minute  remaining.                                time  1135    So the amendment was agreed to.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   The Acting CHAIR. There being no further amendments, under the rule,  the Committee rises.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  Foxx) having assumed the chair, Mr. Hultgren, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3354)  making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment,  and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and  for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 504, he reported  the bill, as amended by House Resolution 500, back to the House with  sundry further amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is  ordered.   Is a separate vote demanded on any further amendment reported from  the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros.   The amendments were agreed to.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third  reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the  desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I am opposed to the bill in its current form.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Ms. Jackson Lee moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3354 to the       Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report the       same back to the House forthwith with the following       amendment:        Page 643, line 11, after the first dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $849,500,000)''.        Page 643, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $849,500,000)''.        Page 659, line 7, after the dollar amount insert       ``(increased by $2,420,739,000)''.        Page 661, line 3, after the dollar amount insert       ``(increased by $2,420,739,000)''.        Page 335, line 24 of Rules Committee Print 115-32, after       the dollar amount insert ``(reduced by $1,571,239,000)''.

Page 336, line 7 of Rules Committee Print 115-32, after the       dollar amount insert ``(reduced by $38,239,000)''.    Ms. JACKSON LEE (during the reading). Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent to dispense with the further reading of the motion.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Texas?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Texas is recognized for  5 minutes.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, this is a final amendment to the  bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If  adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as  amended.   While this amendment will not kill the bill, it will save lives. It  does this by transferring $2.4 billion to the FEMA Pre-Disaster  Mitigation account, offset by eliminating the funding for the  President's border wall and new funds for ICE to be used for an  additional 10,000 detention beds.   Mitigation is preplanning. Mitigation is helping to mitigate the  power outages all over the hurricane region. Mitigation is to minimize  losses.   When we listen to the better angels of our nature, we know in our  hearts that this is the right and just and American thing to do.   I along with my colleagues were eyewitnesses to the devastation  inflicted on southeast Texas and Louisiana when struck on August 25,  2017, by Hurricane Harvey.   Our colleagues from Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto  Rico and those neighbors in the Caribbean are bearing similar witness  to the terrible destruction caused earlier this week by Hurricane Irma.   Irma has taken the lives of at least 75 persons, to date, including  32 in Florida; 5 in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and may be counting  upwards; 37 in the Caribbean; and, as well, 8 seniors who died, and the  numbers may be going up because of those who are critical; and a family  of 6 in the State of Texas. 200,000 Floridians were housed in shelters  as of Monday, and 7.2 million homes and businesses are still without  power.   Our hearts and prayers are with the victims of Hurricane Irma, and  all Americans stand in solidarity with them and pledge to assist them  in the long and hard work of recovery and reconstruction.   Hurricane Harvey is a heartbreaking but, also, a heartwarming story  of horror and heroism. The epic storm dropped 21 trillion gallons of  rainfall on Texas and Louisiana, most of it on the Houston metroplex.  To put this in perspective, that is enough water to fill more than  24,000 Astrodomes or supply water to the power of the raging Niagara  Falls for 15 days.   More than 49,000 homes suffered flood damage. More than 1,000 homes  were completely destroyed in the storm.   But in the response to Hurricane Harvey, the world also saw the large  and small acts of courage and kindness that Americans are known for, by  our volunteers, our military, our Texas National Guard, and many  others.   More than 13,000 people were rescued in the Houston area by the U.S.  Coast Guard and the local first responders, police, fire, and civilian  volunteers risking danger to help their friends and neighbors and  persons they did not even know.   One of those who gave his life in service to others was Sergeant  Steve Perez, who was funeralized yesterday, a 34-year veteran of the  Houston Police Department. He left his home that morning and said: I  have got to go to work. There are things that have to be done.   And then there was the DREAMer, Alonso Guillen, who came to Texas  from Mexico as a teenager, who died  [[Page H7409]]  when his boat capsized while he was rescuing survivors of the flooding.  He was funeralized just a few days ago.   That is who Texans are, and this is what Americans do.   To date, Harvey has claimed the lives of more than 60 persons,  including, as I said, 6 members of the Saldivar family, who perished in  Greens Bayou while trying to evacuate their flooded home and community.   Madam Speaker, Hurricane Harvey was one of the worst, but not the  first, of natural disasters to befall our country; and, as Hurricane  Irma demonstrated, it is not the last. That is why we need to pass this  amendment, so that FEMA has the resources to assist States ahead of  time, U.S. territories, federally recognized Tribes, and local  communities in implementing sustained pre-disaster natural hazard  mitigation programs.   Pre-disaster mitigation funds help reduce overall risk to people and  structures from future disasters, raise public awareness, and reduce  future losses before disaster strikes. I might also mention, it may  deal with the issue of power loss ahead of time.   Mitigation planning is key to breaking the cycle of disaster damage  reconstruction and repeated damage. We needed it. We need more of it.   Madam Speaker, we do not need another 10,000 beds in ICE detention  centers, but we do need more than 10,000 beds in evacuation shelters.   We do not need to spend millions detaining law-abiding families. We  do need to invest in sheltering disaster victims.   This amendment will ensure we spend less on raids and roundups and  more on rescues.   Madam Speaker, we certainly do not need to spend $1.6 billion on a  wall to stem the hoard of bad hombres streaming across our southern  border that exists only in the imagination or paranoia. Those numbers  are down. Know the real immediate threat to the security of our  homeland.   Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill which will not  kill the bill or send it back to committee.   If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as  amended.   While this amendment will not kill the bill, it will save lives.   It does this by transferring $2.4 billion to the FEMA Pre-Disaster  Mitigation account, offset by eliminating the funding for the  President's border wall and new funds for ICE to be used for an  additional 10,000 detention beds.   When we listen to the better angels of our nature, we know in our  hearts this is the right and just--and the American--thing to do.   I was an eyewitness to the devastation inflicted on Southeast Texas  and Louisiana when struck on August 25, 2017 by Hurricane Harvey.   Our colleagues from the great State of Florida and the U.S. Virgin  Islands are bearing similar witness to the terrible destruction caused  earlier this week by Hurricane Irma.   Hurricane Irma has taken the lives of at least 75 persons to date,  including 32 in Florida, 5 in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 37 in the  Caribbean island nations of Barbuda, St. Maarten, Antigua, St. Kitts  and Nevis.   200,000 Floridians were housed in shelters as of Monday and 7.2  million homes and businesses are still without power.   Our hearts and prayers are with the victims of Hurricane Irma and all  Americans stand in solidarity with them and pledge to assist them in  the long and hard work of recovery and reconstruction.   Hurricane Harvey is a heart-breaking but also heartwarming story of  horror and heroism.   This epic storm dropped 21 trillion gallons of rainfall on Texas and  Louisiana, most of it on the Houston Metroplex.

More than 13,000 people were rescued in the Houston area by the U.S.  Coast Guard, state and local first responders, and civilian volunteers  risking danger to help their friends, neighbors, and persons they did  not even know.   One of those heroes was a Dreamer, Alonso Guillen, who came to Texas  from Mexico as a teenager, and who died when his boat capsized while he  was rescuing survivors of the flooding.   Another who gave his life in service to others was Sergeant Steve  Perez, a 34-year veteran of the Houston Police Department, who insisted  on reporting for duty early despite his beloved wife's pleas that he  stay home given the dangerous conditions outside.   That is who Texans are and this is what Americans do.   To date Hurricane Harvey has claimed the lives of more than 60  persons, including six members of the Saldivar family who perished in  Greens Bayou while trying to evacuate their flooded home and community.   Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Harvey was one of the worst, but not the  first, natural disasters to befall our country, and as Hurricane Irma  demonstrates, it is not the last.   And that is why we need to pass this amendment so that FEMA has the  resources needed to assist States, U.S. Territories, Federally- recognized tribes, and local communities in implementing sustained pre- disaster natural hazard mitigation programs.   Pre-Disaster Mitigation funds help reduce overall risk to people and  structures from future disasters and raise public awareness about  reducing future losses before disaster strikes.   Mitigation planning is key to breaking the cycle of disaster damage,  reconstruction, and repeated damage.   Mr. Speaker, we do not need another 10,000 beds in ICE detention  centers; but we do need more than 10,000 beds in evacuation shelters.   We do not need to spend millions detaining law-abiding families; we  do need to invest in sheltering disaster victims.   This amendment will ensure we spend less on raids and roundups and  more on rescues.   And Mr. Speaker, we certainly do not need to spend $1.6 billion on a  wall to stem the horde of bad hombres streaming across our southern  border that exists only in imagination or paranoia.   No, the real and immediate threat to the security of our homeland is  the destructive power of the apocalyptic invading armies of wind and  water, appearing in the form of hurricanes and floods.   We do not need to waste money building a wall to prevent river  crossings on the southern border.   We do need more pre-Disaster funding to help people get across the  rivers running through the streets of our cities and towns when  hurricanes strike unleashing floods.   Mr. Speaker, the choice now before the House is whether we should  have more beds in detention centers or more beds in evacuation  shelters.   Instead of the closed and angry fist of walls, roundups, and  detention, we should choose instead to extend an open and loving hand  to help the hopeless, homeless, and helpless.   In doing so, we reveal the true character of our nation and earn the  blessings of our Creator.   I urge all Members to support this motion to recommit.   I ask for support of the Jackson Lee amendment to provide for the  safety and security of the American people.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I am unable to vote as I am in Florida  assisting Floridians in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma.   Had I been present, I would have voted:   ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 526 (Jackson Lee Amendment No. 223).   ``Nay'' on rollcall No. 527 (MTR).   ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 528 (H.R. 3354).   ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 529 (H.R. 3284).                            ____________________
