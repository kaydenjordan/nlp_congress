 Mr. Speaker, I know that no one in this Chamber needs to be  reminded that we are here to represent people. In my community and  nationwide, many people have been facing unprecedented financial  hardship and personal struggles for a year now. Despite that fact, some  people in this town will grow louder and louder in saying that the  American Rescue Plan is too large and that after passing tax cuts for  the super-rich, we can't afford to come to the aid of everyday working  people and small business owners.   The truth is that we are in danger of doing too little, not too much.  As Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz wrote: ``Congress must  pass this legislation or risk an anemic and devastatingly incomplete  recovery.''   After the 2008 financial crash, Washington bailed out the largest  financial institutions without passing a large enough relief package.  The resulting recovery was weighted heavily against working people. We  cannot make that same mistake today.   Passing the American Rescue Plan means saving as many as 4 million  jobs and returning to full employment as quickly as possible. It means  setting up more vaccination sites in our communities.   Let's pass this bill this week and get it to the President's desk for  signature.                            ____________________
