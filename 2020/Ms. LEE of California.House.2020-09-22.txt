 Mr. Speaker, this pandemic has taken over  200,000 lives, bankrupted State and local governments, and destroyed  our economy, not to mention nearly 20 million people have lost their  jobs as a result of this devastating public health and economic crisis.  Communities of color have been hit the hardest.   My condolences go out to those who have lost loved ones.   Over 4 months ago, House Democrats passed the HEROES Act, which  reflects the needs of the American people and allocates the resources  to save lives and to boost the economy. It has been over 130 days since  we passed the HEROES Act.   Since that time, the other body and the White House have done nothing  to help the American people. Instead, this administration and Senate  Republicans muzzled scientists and refused to compromise.   Let me be clear: The White House intentionally downplayed the  severity of the virus, and now the COVID pandemic has taken lives that  could have been saved.   Time is of the essence. I urge my colleagues across the aisle to work  with Democrats to save lives and protect livelihoods now more than  ever.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I am disappointed that we have  to do this, pass a stop gap Continuing Resolution. But it must be done.  The alternative is to shut down the government while our people are  worried about their health, their jobs and their homes.   Under Chairwoman Lowey's leadership, the House did its job. We passed  ten appropriations bills this summer, doing our jobs to meet the needs  of the American people. We did this even in the face of a pandemic  which forced us to adopt novel ways of working. Meanwhile, the other  body has not marked up even one bill.   People across the country are waiting for their government to take  action. Action to fight the pandemic. Action to take belated action to  dismantle systemic racism in our society. Action to end endless wars.  Action just to do our most fundamental job of keeping the government  running.   I urge my colleagues to support this continuing resolution.
