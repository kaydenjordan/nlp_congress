 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, today, five American hostages are on  their way home from unjust detention in Iran. Unfortunately, the deal  that secured their release may very well be the latest example of  President Biden rewarding and incentivizing Tehran's bad behavior. For  the past 2\1/2\ years, the administration's weakness and desperation  have emboldened--emboldened--a massive state sponsor of terror and  would-be nuclear arm aggressor.   Take the $6 billion the United States has reportedly just released to  the Iranian regime. Administration officials have insisted that this  money is subject to strict oversight and may only be used for  humanitarian purposes.   Iran's President, on the other hand, understands that money is  fungible. He said:         Humanitarian means whatever the Iranian people needs . . .       and the needs of the Iranian people will be decided and       determined by the Iranian government.    Well, we know quite well that the Iranian people's needs and the  Iranian regime's priorities rarely overlap. For example, protesters  continue to take to the streets across Iran to denounce the regime 1  year after the so-called morality police killed a young woman for not  wearing her head scarf correctly. Brave Iranians are taking greater and  greater risks to speak up for freedom from the brutality of a corrupt,  theocratic regime.   Meanwhile, as the regime meets these protests at home with force, its  focus abroad remains on exporting repression, terror, and economic  interference throughout the region and beyond.   Tehran continues to accelerate its enrichment of weapons-grade  uranium and stonewall international inspectors seeking the truth about  Iran's weaponization work. Just last week, the regime barred several  U.N. inspectors from conducting scheduled oversight across the country.   The regime is racing to ramp up production of the weaponized drones  it uses against Arab and Israeli civilians to supply Russian violence  in Ukraine.   Iran-backed militia continue to threaten U.S. servicemembers in Iraq  and Syria. Tehran continues to funnel resources to terrorist proxies-- like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza--that attack Israel. And  the regime has even plotted to kill U.S. officials and dissidents here  on American soil.   And last week, the IRGC seized two more tanker ships in the Arabian  Gulf and detained their civilian crews, part of a longer campaign to  threaten freedom of navigation and the entire global economy. This  growing threat has led the U.S. military to deploy 3,000 additional  marines to the Red Sea and prepare to put U.S. personnel on commercial  vessels to try to deter Iranian aggression.   By every measure, Iran poses a greater threat to its neighbors and to  the United States than it did 2\1/2\ years ago. The Biden  administration's record of appeasement and squandered leverage has left  Americans less secure.   The urgent question now is when the President will decide to change  course because, so far, his administration's obsession with reviving a  flawed nuclear deal actually suggests otherwise.                               Border Security    Madam President, on another matter, on the Biden administration's  watch, America's southern border has  [[Page S4545]]  descended into humanitarian disaster. And across the country,  Democrats' open border policies have turned every State into a border  State.   The fentanyl trafficked across the southern border has become the  leading cause of death among Americans 18 to 45. Of the 2,135 overdose  deaths in my home State last year, fentanyl was the most prevalent drug  involved. And nationwide, synthetic opioids contributed to about 75,000  of the nearly 110,000 overdose deaths.   The painful ripple effects of Washington Democrats' failure to  address the border crisis extend even further. In major cities all  across the country, the flow of illegal migrants is testing the  patience of even the most liberal mayors.   The number of arrivals in New York City is now close to 10,000 a  month, and Mayor Adams has said that the city's response will cost $12  billion over the next 3 years if the flow continues at the same rate.  Being a sanctuary city is starting to come at a price.   Meanwhile, the Biden administration has continued to sit on resources  that were already paid for during the previous administration. The Army  Corps of Engineers is paying $160,000 per month to store more than  20,000 unused border wall panels that have already been paid for by the  taxpayers.   But instead of finally starting to enforce our immigration laws, the  Biden administration apparently wants to respond by gutting the Agency  tasked with doing so, Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   The junior Senator from Tennessee, Senator Hagerty, wrote recently  about how the administration's supplemental funding proposal included a  provision to redirect ICE funding toward paying for community-based  residential facilities, airplane tickets, and hotel rooms.   As our colleague put it:         This would effectively convert ICE from a law enforcement       agency into a U.S. travel agency for illegal aliens.    So Washington Democrats' neglect has shattered American border  security. Now, they want to make life even harder for men and women  working harder to clean up this mess. The American people need  security, not another attack on law enforcement.
