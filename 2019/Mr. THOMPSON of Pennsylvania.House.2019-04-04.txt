 Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, I signed the  discharge petition to force a vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors  Protection Act. 193 Members, including two Democrats, have already  signed it. A discharge petition has not received such overwhelming  support in the first 24 hours in at least 22 years.   I applaud Congresswoman Ann Wagner for reintroducing this bill and  Republican Whip   Steve Scalise for filing the discharge petition.   The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would require that a  child who is born alive after an attempted abortion receives treatment  and be transferred to a hospital. This legislation penalizes the  intentional killing of a child who is born alive.   Unfortunately, we have seen horrific actions in New York and Virginia  to allow late-term abortion. It is, essentially, the execution of a  defenseless child after birth.   Madam Speaker, this isn't abortion; this is infanticide. Any doctor  who would leave a child to die should face the full extent of the law.   Americans deserve to know whether their Representatives stand against  infanticide or not. I urge the House to act on this bill. I urge us to  choose life over murder.                            ____________________
