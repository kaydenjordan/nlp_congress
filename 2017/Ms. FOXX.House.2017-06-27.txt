He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart,  Combat Infantry Badge, and the Army Commendation Medal with one oak  leaf cluster. His prior awards and decorations included the Army  Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal with three oak clusters,  Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, the Global War  on Terrorism Medal, Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal, Army  Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, the NATO Medal, and the Expert  Infantry Badge.   Last week, hundreds of North Carolina residents gathered in Ashe  County to pay tribute to Sergeant Baldridge as he was laid to rest. We  should all take time to pause, reflect, and honor the sacrifices of  those like this young man from Youngsville, North Carolina, who have  given their lives in the pursuit of a more prosperous and free America.  May we endeavor to live worthy of their legacy and guard vigilantly the  history and stories of our fallen.                            ____________________
