 Mr. Speaker, I am  Greg Casar, and I represent the heart  of Texas.   Throughout my time in office, I have heard from and spoken with  military families about what their greatest needs are. The answer that  has most consistently come up isn't about the latest tanks or the  latest guns. It is childcare.   In fact, based on a 2021 survey from the Military Family Advisory  Network, they found that 78 percent of military families have found it  difficult to get childcare for their kids. This need is ever present in  San Antonio, Texas, Military City USA.   Military readiness means more than just stocking up on more and more  weapons and gadgets. It means investing in the people of the military.   Right now, the extreme rightwing is trying to bring forward a bill to  spend more and more money on weapons that the Pentagon hasn't even  asked for, and it happens nearly every year.   The NDAA, our annual defense spending bill, provides funds that the  Department of Defense is told to spend on obsolete weapons and  programs. That is why I am proposing an amendment to the NDAA,  alongside Congressman Castro, to provide adequate childcare for our  military families.                            ____________________
