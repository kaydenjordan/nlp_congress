 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in appreciation of the people  of Guam for their trust, support, and respect and for allowing me the  honor of representing Guam and their interests here in the Congress of  the United States for eight terms.   I also rise this final time in appreciation to my colleagues in this  wonderful institution, the U.S. House of Representatives, for their  support over the years as we have worked on many impactful issues for  the betterment of our constituents and our Nation.   It has been my honor to serve in Congress for the last 16 years, and  I leave here proud of what we have accomplished not just for Guam, but  for our  [[Page H10272]]  Nation and our allies in the Asia-Pacific region.   As the nonvoting delegate for 168,000 Americans who live on the  westernmost territory of the United States of America, I worked with my  congressional colleagues to support policies, programs, and legislation  that have benefited the people of Guam. I have also secured billions of  dollars in Federal investment in Guam and our people.   With the support of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we saw  the passage of landmark legislation for Guam, including passing war  reparations to recognize the survivors of the occupation of Guam during  World War II, enshrining the independence of Guam's judiciary as a  coequal branch of government, enhancing regional security with the  relocation of marines to Guam, holding the military accountable to its  responsibilities to Guam's civilian population, promoting Guam's  Chamorro culture, protecting our environment, and improving healthcare  for veterans and all Guam residents.   In just this last year, I have worked with entrepreneurs to jump- start the process for Guam to eventually become a commercial spaceport.  I have also engaged leaders in the renewable energy industry and  sponsored legislation passed unanimously by the House to develop  offshore wind energy that will benefit Guam's electricity needs for  decades to come.   We have strengthened relations with our neighbors in the Asia-Pacific  and enhanced tourism, Guam's largest nonmilitary industry and employer.   Finally, through engagement and cooperation with our regional allies,  we have enhanced the security of the Indo-Asia-Pacific region and our  national interests, countering growing threats and safeguarding against  rogue countries. These are just some of our successes.   My colleagues would often tease me by saying: ``Here comes Miss Guam.  What does she want now?'' While this was often said jokingly, and I  have always accepted this as good-natured humor, I hope that it speaks  to the dedication that I brought to effectively representing my  constituents as the first woman to serve as Guam's elected Delegate to  the United States Congress.   Mr. Speaker, Guam residents have no other voice or voting  representation in their Federal Government to champion their interests  and causes. Despite the successes we have had during my tenure, I  cannot leave without commenting on the disparity between the  Representatives from the 50 States and the Delegates who represent 4  million fellow Americans residing in the U.S. territories.   It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, that our country continues to  disenfranchise Americans in the territories merely because of where we  live. My constituents lack full voting representation in the House,  have no representation in the Senate, and are denied the right to vote  for the President of the United States; and yet we serve and sacrifice  at the highest rates in our military.   When I was first elected to Congress in 2002, one of my predecessors,  the late Congressman Ben Blaz, commented to me that, as Guam's  Delegate, I would be a Member of Congress but not one of its true  Members. I hope that we will continue to see our Nation strive for that  goal, and that includes giving full representation and voting rights to  our fellow Americans living in the territories and the District of  Columbia.   Mr. Speaker, while I am saddened for my congressional tenure to come  to a close, I leave proud of my work to advance Guam's interests and  thankful for the support and friendship of the colleagues with whom I  have served for these past 16 years. I am also eternally grateful to  the nearly 200 staffers and interns who have aided me throughout the  years in the congressional office.   I am especially appreciative for the staff who were with me during  this last year in Congress. In my D.C. office: Adam Carbullido, Rosanne  Mantanona, Howard Pangelinan, Edgar Yanger, Brandon Westling, Iain  Hart, and Katherine Lee. In my Guam district office: Jon Junior Calvo,  Kaye Lea Custodio, Amanda Shelton, Robert San Agustin, Audria-Marie  Lizama, and Diosdado Razon.   I would not have been successful without their dedication and  tireless support.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in appreciation of the people of Guam for  their trust, support, and respect and for allowing me the honor of  representing Guam and their interests here in the Congress of the  United States for eight terms.   I also rise, this final time, in appreciation to my colleagues in  this wonderful institution--the U.S. House of Representatives--for  their comradery, support, and collegiality over the years as we worked  on many impactful issues for the betterment of our constituents and our  nation.   It has been my honor to serve in Congress for the last 16 years, and  I leave here proud of what we have accomplished, not just for Guam, but  for our nation and our allies in the Asia-Pacific region.   These 16 years I have led, supported, or participated in the national  debates, discussions, and policy developments that have improved global  and national security, enhanced our economic and political wellbeing,  conserved our precious natural resources, and improved quality of life  for all Americans.   As the non-voting delegate for 168,000 Americans who live on the  western-most sovereign territory of the United States of America, I  worked with my Congressional colleagues to support policies, programs  and legislation that have benefitted the people of Guam. I have also  secured billions of dollars in federal investment in Guam and our  people.   With the support of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we saw  the passage of landmark legislation for Guam, including passing war  reparations to recognize the survivors of the Occupation of Guam during  World War II; enshrining the independence of Guam's judiciary as a co- equal branch of Government, enhancing regional security with the  relocation of Marines to Guam; holding the military accountable to its  responsibilities to Guam's civilian population, promoting Guam's  Chamorro culture, protecting our environment, and improving healthcare  for veterans and all Guam residents.   Some of our most exciting achievements are yet to be realized with  the groundwork we have undertaken to further the development of new  opportunities for economic development and self-sufficiency for Guam,  our national interests, and the region.   In just this last year, I have worked with entrepreneurs to jump  start the process for Guam to eventually become a commercial spaceport.   I have also engaged leaders in the renewable energy industry and  sponsored legislation passed unanimously by the House to develop  offshore wind energy that will benefit Guam's self-sufficiency,  sustainability, and electricity needs for decades to come.   We have strengthened relations with our neighbors in the Asia-Pacific  and enhanced tourism, Guam's largest non-military industry and  employer.   Finally, through engagement and cooperation with our regional allies,  we have enhanced the security of the Indo-Asia-Pacific region and our  national interests, countering growing threats and safeguarding against  rogue countries.   These are just some of our successes. My colleagues would often tease  me by saying, ``Here comes Miss Guam.''

When I was first elected to Congress in 2002, one of my predecessors,  the late Congressman Ben Blaz, commented to me that as Guam's Delegate,  I would be a Member of Congress, but not one of its Members.   I have been proud to stand alongside my colleagues--both Democrat and  Republican--all patriotic citizens doing their level best to reach what  our Constitution calls a more perfect union.   I hope that we will continue to see our nation strive for that goal,  and that includes giving full representation and voting rights to our  fellow Americans living in the territories and the District of  Columbia.
