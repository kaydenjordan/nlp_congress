 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an important historical  figure in the Sikh community on what will soon be the 550th anniversary  of the Sikh religion.   Guru Nanak was the founder of Sikhism, the fifth largest religion in  the world, but his story is largely unknown to the Western world.  [[Page H8148]]    Guru Nanak was born in November of 1469 in present-day Pakistan.  According to Sikh traditions, the birth and early years of his life  were marked with many events that demonstrated that he had been marked  by divine grace.   He traveled far and wide, teaching people the message of one  universal creator and that God is good and that God is everywhere. Guru  Nanak also preached the universal message of justice and equality for  all women's empowerment, service to others, and a devotion to nature  and the environment.   Every year, Sikh pilgrims travel to his birthplace to remember his  life and his message of love, compassion, and kindness, these values  that we hold true every day.   I know from personal experience in my interactions with the Sikh  leaders across my district and throughout this country that these  values are instilled in each and every one of us and them.    Unfortunately, one such Sikh leader tragically passed away a week  ago, and her loss is heavily felt by so many members, not only  throughout California, but in India.                       Honoring Jasbir ``Guddi'' Sidhu     Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate a beloved member of the  Sikh community in my home of Fresno, California: Ms. Jasbir ``Guddi''  Sidhu.   Guddi lived an admirable life and made so many, countless  contributions to our communities. For 25 years, she produced a weekly  television show and was a founding member of KBIF 900, a local radio  station.   Her weekend programming featured interviews with community members  and cultural figures. She was a role model and a leader to all,  especially young girls and women. It not only aired in Fresno, but also  halfway around the world, in India. It was also streamed by thousands  on social media.   Guddi was a member of numerous local organizations and worked hard to  preserve the Punjabi culture and Sikh religion for children and  families in her community and helped those assimilate who came from  Punjab.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the service  of Jasbir ``Guddi'' Sidhu, a beloved member of our community, who had a  passion for people and made a difference.                                 Syria Crisis     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to the recent  events transpiring in northern Syria.   Turkey's continuing actions against the Kurds in northern Syria is  not only appalling, but it is unjustifiable, and it is not right.   The Kurds have courageously fought side by side with our troops and  deserve better, losing over 10,000 of their soldiers in defeating ISIL  as the caliphate, but yet ISIL could come back. They are also guarding  thousands of ISIS prisoners.   The Kurds have been our partners. The United States must immediately  impose sanctions on Turkey for their irresponsible and outrageous  behavior.   This White House's actions, I believe, have made the situation  possible; and now Congress must act to confront this unfolding  humanitarian disaster, which is also a threat to our national security  and damaging to our international reputation.   I will be supporting bipartisan legislation to confront the  administration and Turkey on this matter later this week. I support  H.J. Res. 77, which expresses the Congress' opposition to the  administration's abandonment of our Kurdish allies.   Though Turkey is a NATO ally, we cannot stand by and let this happen  in the face of reckless and irresponsible behavior on Turkey's part.  And this isn't the first time Turkey has acted in this way.   This action has become necessary because of the unilateral actions  that the President took without consulting Congress or our European  allies. It makes no sense.   It is critical that we maintain our friendships and our alliances.  America needs to have our alliances. We need to have friends.   When there is no longer a priority for this administration to embark  upon maintaining our relationships with our allies--our friends--we go  down a perilous path, mark my words. The United States needs its  friends, and actions like this undermine our global image and risk us  being seen as an unreliable partner in international affairs. We don't  want to be seen as an unreliable partner in international affairs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in calling for  responsible leadership, on a bipartisan basis, on this issue.                            ____________________
