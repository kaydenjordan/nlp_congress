 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I thank Mr. McGovern for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Today, we consider H. Con. Res. 83 or, technically, we are  considering the rule to consider H. Con. Res. 83, a resolution to  remove the United States Armed Forces from hostilities in Iran.   But the thing is, we are not engaged in hostilities in Iran. Once  again, we are considering a measure that will have no force of law.  This is a nonbinding concurrent resolution.   There was some debate in the Rules Committee last night on whether a  concurrent resolution under the War Powers Resolution is, in fact,  nonbinding. But in the Senate, a joint resolution has been introduced,  making it likely that this House Concurrent Resolution will go no  further than the action today.   The Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war. The  Constitution also designates the President as the Commander in Chief of  the Armed Forces. This sets up a conflict. The courts have not  delineated the boundaries of these authorities or determined gaps  between them that would either deny power to a President or to the  Congress, one at the expense of the other.   In Federalist Number 69, Alexander Hamilton argued the President's  power resides only in the direction of the military as placed by law at  his command. Presidents have long argued that their role as Commander  in Chief, coupled with their inherent authority over foreign affairs,  grants them the power to engage the Armed Forces, short of war, as they  see fit.   Since the founding of our country, the Supreme Court has ruled both  that the President enjoys greater discretion when acting with respect  to matters of foreign affairs and, that absent an authorization of  action during wartime, any action by the President was void.   Despite the struggle to maintain the separation of powers with regard  to engaging our Armed Forces, the motivation underlying the inclusion  in the Constitution of these powers for both the President and the  Congress continues to this day: The desire to protect and defend the  United States, its persons, and its assets.   Congress passed the War Powers Resolution in 1973, largely in  response to the experiences in Korea and Vietnam. The War Powers  Resolution authorizes the engagement of the forces of the United States  in hostilities when: There is a declaration of war; or there exists a  specific statutory authorization; or a national emergency created by  attack upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its  Armed Forces.   To assess the current situation, let's examine what has led us to  this point.   In June of 2019, Iran shot down a surveillance aircraft that was  flying over international waters near the Strait of Hormuz. This was an  unmanned aerial drone.   At the time, President Trump was advised by his military advisers to  strike back, but the President opted not to strike back because it  would have resulted in Iranian casualties, and he felt he could not  justify creation of human casualties because of the loss of a machine.  I agree with the President in that decision. I think his restraint was  remarkable, but, certainly, exemplary.   In September of 2019, Iranian cruise missiles struck nearly 20  targets of critical energy infrastructure in Saudi Arabia. This  disrupted a significant portion of Saudi oil production.   In December of 2019, Iranian-backed forces in Iraq targeted military  facilities where United States forces were co-located.   On December 27, an Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, a U.S.-designated  foreign terrorist organization, attacked a base in northern Iraq, and  they killed a U.S. contractor and wounded four U.S. servicemembers.   The United States responded, and it launched a retaliatory air strike  in Iraq and Syria.   On January 2, 2020, acting on intelligence of imminent threat to  American interests, and in response to the persistent attack by  Iranian-backed entities, the United States military killed General  Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani was the long-time leader of the Iran  Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force.   The Iran Revolutionary Guard is a U.S.-designated terrorist  organization. It has been supporting proxy forces throughout the Middle  East and attacking United States interests and allies for over a  decade.   Soleimani previously operated under strict security but, in recent  years, he has moved much more freely and openly, believing that the  United States did not have the willpower to be able to attack him. His  atrocities include the deaths of hundreds of Americans and the  attempted assassination of a Saudi diplomat in the United States, among  other things.   President Obama's former Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary  Jeh Johnson, stated that General Soleimani was a legitimate military  target.   I do want to be clear. The last thing that I want to see and I  suspect anyone in this body wants to see is our men and women committed  to another conflict in the Middle East. We want those conflicts to end,  as does the President.   But, Madam Speaker, today the world is a safer place without General  Soleimani. And who would want him to come back?    Despite the disagreement in how further to engage in the Middle East,  in the country of Iran, be it militarily or diplomatically, the last  thing we should be doing is broadcasting our plans to the enemy.   By passing this War Powers Resolution, directing the President to  remove United States Armed Forces from hostilities with Iran, a point  that is, in itself in contention, we are effectively telling the  Iranian mullahs that it is okay to push forward with their aggressive  posturing. Rather than stating what the President cannot do, perhaps we  should be authorizing what the President can do.   Last night, in the Rules Committee, it became clear that both  Republicans and Democrats agree that the world is a safer place without  General Soleimani, and any war with Iran needs to be authorized by  Congress seemed to be general agreement.   Democrats want to maintain the separation of powers, as do I, but the  question is, to what extent are we jeopardizing our safety?   I believe Congress does need to authorize military action and  maintain the separation of powers as intended by the Founders, but we  don't need to broadcast it to the world.   While we may be divided on the need for this resolution, let us  recognize the privilege that we enjoy each and every day, being able to  stand in this House and debate these issues without fear of  [[Page H80]]  retribution of our government. Those protesters in Iran did not enjoy  that freedom. They cut off the internet and eliminated those  protesters. That is why you don't see them anymore.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to this rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, let me yield myself 30 seconds for the  purpose of response before I yield to Mr. Cole.   And my response would be, had the gentleman from Massachusetts  yielded to me for a question, my question was going to be, was he  asking for unanimous consent to change the concurrent resolution to a  joint resolution such that it could align and harmonize with the Senate  activity and then, therefore, maybe accomplish something. But he  didn't.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole), the ranking member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), a valuable member of the House Committee on  Rules.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott), a valuable member of the Armed Services  Committee.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire the amount of time  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), a valuable member of the House Committee on  Foreign Affairs.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to provide for immediate consideration of H. Res.  783, honoring the members of the military and intelligence community  for carrying out the mission that killed General Soleimani.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this  amendment into the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Crenshaw), my good friend, to explain the resolution.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger), a valuable member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee and the Committee on Armed Forces.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Waltz).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida an  additional 15 seconds.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I was in the class of Congress that was elected right  after September 11, 2001, that came into office in 2003.   After coming to office, through press reports and information in  various congressional hearings, we got information that Osama bin Laden  had declared war on the United States in 1997--I did not know that--and  that there had been actionable intelligence and Osama bin Laden could  have been taken out prior to the attack of September 11, 2001, but the  administration in the 1990s decided not to do so.   Now, yesterday, fast-forwarding to present time, we heard from  General Mark Milley clear, unambiguous intelligence indicating a  significant campaign of violence against the United States in the days,  weeks, and months that the administration would have been culpably  negligent if it did not act, all in regards to the killing of General  Soleimani.                                time  1345    The President wants to keep the country safe. The President showed  remarkable restraint, I thought, yesterday, and I thought the tone in  his address to the Nation yesterday was precisely the right tone.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a Statement of Administration  Policy.                     Statement of Administration Policy    H. Con. Res. 83--Directing the President Pursuant to Section 5(c) of   the War Powers Resolution to Terminate the Use of United States Armed  Forces to Engage in Hostilities in or Against Iran--Rep. Slotkin, D-MI,                             and 134 cosponsors         The Administration strongly opposes passage of H. Con. Res.       83, which purports to direct the President to terminate the       use of United States Armed Forces engaged in hostilities in       or against Iran or any part of its government or military       unless authorized by Congress.        At the President's direction, on January 2, the United       States military successfully executed a strike in Iraq that       killed Qassem Soleimani, the Commander of the Islamic       Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force, a designated foreign       terrorist organization. Soleimani was personally responsible       for terrible atrocities. He trained terrorist armies,       including Hezbollah, launching terror strikes against       civilian targets. He fueled bloody civil wars all across the       region. He directed and facilitated actions that viciously       wounded and murdered thousands of United States troops,       including by planting bombs that maim and dismember their       victims. In eliminating Soleimani from the battlefield, the       President took action to stop a war, not to start a war. He       took action to protect our diplomats, our service members,       our allies, and all Americans.        Although concurrent resolutions like H. Con. Res. 83 lack       the force of law under controlling Supreme Court precedent,       I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), it is nevertheless       important to highlight some of its deficiencies.        First, H. Con. Res. 83 is unnecessary because the military       actions to which it applies are already authorized by law,       including the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against       Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243) (``2002 AUMF'').       The 2002 AUMF provides specific statutory authorization to       engage in military action to ``defend the national security       of the United States against the continuing threat posed by       Iraq.'' Public Law 107-243, Sec. 3(a)(1). The United States       forces that have been threatened by Iranian and Iran-backed       attacks in Iraq are there to combat terrorist groups--such as       ISIS. Thus, in addition to acting in accordance with his       Constitutional authorities as Commander in Chief and Chief       Executive, the President also acted against Soleimani       pursuant to existing statutory authorization. The 2002 AUMF       has always been understood to authorize the use of force for,       among other purposes, addressing terrorist threats--like       Soleimani and the attacks he was planning and facilitating--      emanating from Iraq. This is consistent with actions taken by       previous Presidents pursuant to the 2002 AUMF. For example,       during the last administration, United States forces       frequently conducted operations in response to attacks and       threats by Iran-backed militias in Iraq under the authority       conferred by the 2002 AUMF. Moreover, the Administration's       engagement with Congress on this strike has been fully in       accordance with past precedent, including by providing       notification consistent with the War Powers Resolution and by       briefing Congressional leadership, the full membership of the       House and Senate, and appropriate staff.        Second, were provisions like those included in H. Con. Res.       83 to become law, they could undermine the President's       ability to defend United States forces and interests in the       region against ongoing threats from Iran and its proxies.       Iran has a long history of attacking United States and       coalition forces both directly and through its proxies,       including, most recently, by means of a January 7 missile       attack from Iran against United States forces stationed at       two bases in Iraq. Over the last several months, Soleimani       planned and supported these escalating attacks by Iranian-      directed Shia militia groups on coalition bases throughout       Iraq. He orchestrated the December 27, 2019 attack on an       Iraqi military base, which resulted in the death of a United       States citizen and badly wounded four United States service       members. Soleimani also approved the subsequent attack later       that month on the United States Embassy in Baghdad, which       turned violent and damaged the Embassy facility. At the time       of the January 2 strike, Soleimani was in Iraq in violation       of a United Nations Security Council travel ban and was       actively developing plans to imminently attack United States       diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the       region. Subsequently, Iran launched an attack against the       United States. Were Congress to attempt to compel the       President to adhere to a resolution like H. Con. Res. 83, it       could hinder the President's ability to protect United States       forces and interests in the region from the continued threat       posed by Iran and its proxies.        This concurrent resolution is misguided, and its adoption       by Congress could undermine the ability of the United States       to protect American citizens whom Iran continues to seek to       harm.     Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous  question, ``no'' vote on the rule, the underlying measure, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, this amendment would strike section 2 of  H.R. 535.   Section 2 of H.R. 535 requires the Environmental Protection Agency to  designate the chemicals PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act,  also known as the Superfund, and to do this within 1 year of enactment,  and requires a review of the entire PFAS chemical group within 5 years.   I believe this to be flawed for several reasons:   First and foremost, the Environmental Protection Agency is already  undergoing a thorough examination of the chemicals known as PFAS.  Section 2 circumvents the regulatory process and would deny any public  notice, any public comment, or any scientific study before deeming PFOA  and PFOS as hazardous chemicals under the Superfund.   Any substance designated as a hazardous substance under CERCLA  attaches strict, joint and several, and retroactive liability  conditions. If you had any stake in the production, any stake in the  ownership or cleanup of such a substance, that party might be liable  under the Superfund law. The public has a right to comment on the  impacts of such an important measure.   Second, section 2 is simply impractical. In the 40 years since the  passage of the Superfund bill, Congress has never specifically placed  individual chemicals or chemical groups into statute as hazardous  chemicals under this act.   In those 40 years, 800 chemicals have been added to this list through  the regulatory process. The Environmental Protection Agency is  currently aware of between 5,000 and possibly as many as 7,800 PFAS  chemicals. The problem is we don't know how many exist. The EPA would  not be able to properly evaluate the thousands of chemicals that make  up the PFAS in only 5 years.   PFAS chemicals must be properly assessed with the best science  possible. As currently written, section 2 of the legislation denies the  EPA the ability to properly and thoroughly evaluate these chemicals and  shuts out the public from commenting on the regulatory impacts,  including the potential future development of safer PFAS chemicals.   Madam Chair, for these reasons, I urge support of the amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Balderson).    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, PFAS chemicals must be properly assessed with the best  science possible. As currently written, section 2 of this legislation  denies the EPA the ability to properly and thoroughly evaluate these  chemicals. We are literally making the perfect the enemy of the good.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
