 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak out  against this attempt to remove the duly elected President of the United  States.   Impeachment is importantly established in our Constitution. The  impeachment of a President has only happened twice in our country's  243-year history. Yet, today, for highly political purposes, the House  majority is trying to remove President Trump from office based on  secondhand, indirect accounts.   The Articles of Impeachment we are voting on today offer no evidence  of a crime but, instead, are purposely broad to fit the majority's  narrative.   Less than 1 year until the next Presidential election, we are being  asked to override the choice of the American people. This lopsided,  hyperpartisan, biased impeachment process has been predetermined as an  outcome from the very beginning.   This is an unfortunate day in the history of our great country. We  must hope this political game does not set a precedent of which to  follow in the future.   Surely, there will be disagreements between the President and  Congress for many years to come. Instead of unnecessarily dividing our  country, as we are seeing today, we should be looking at ways to bring  our country together.
