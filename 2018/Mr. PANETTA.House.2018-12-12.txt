 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Conaway and Ranking Member  Peterson for their leadership during my time on the Agriculture  Committee, during our time putting this farm bill together.   As a proud member of the Agriculture Committee, as a proud member who  represents the salad bowl of the world, I am very proud to support H.R.  2, this farm bill, in 2018.   In my district on the central coast of California, this farm bill  will benefit our specialty crop industry by investing in mechanization  technology and expanding research opportunities.   It will help our organics industry with the certification process and  research by incorporating the OREI Act.   This bill invests in our future farmers, our young ranchers, and  veterans getting into agriculture.   It doesn't make any changes to SNAP without any evidence supporting  such changes for the people who need food the most.   Mr. Speaker, I am at the end of my first term in Congress, and I can  tell you this is the best job I have ever had, mainly because of the  Members of Congress I work with, mainly because of the Democrats and  Republicans I have worked with on this Agriculture Committee, including  its excellent staff.   So despite the fact that there were differences over this farm bill  at the beginning, and even though we are on the verge of a possible  shutdown, what gives me confidence in this job, what gives me  confidence in this body is this final version of this farm bill.   This is a bill that, although it started as a partisan product, it  ended as a bipartisan bill. It is a bill that is not based on ideology  and emotion; it is based on evidence. This is a bill that is not based  on party politics; it is based on people, not just people in  agriculture, but all of the people of this Nation.   That is why we all should be proud to support the Agriculture  Improvement Act of 2018 and vote ``yes'' on the final conference  report.
