 Mr. President, I rise today to join in the introduction  of the Reproductive Freedom for All Act, a bipartisan bill that would  ensure the right of women to make certain reproductive choices without  undue government interference.   I support a woman's right to have an abortion, and I believe that the  threshold question of whether or not abortion is legal needs to be  consistent at the national level. States can account for regional  differences with regulations like parental notification requirements,  but the basic right needs to be the same regardless of the State in  which a woman happens to reside.   In its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the  U.S. Supreme Court abandoned a nearly 50-year precedent that had been  reaffirmed and on which women had relied for decades. The Dobbs ruling  was, as the Chief Justice described it, a ``jolt'' to our legal system.  This action has further divided the country at a moment when now, more  than ever in modern times, we need the Court to demonstrate  consistency, predictability, and restraint.   Prior to the Court's decision in Dobbs, I introduced, with Senator  Murkowski, the Reproductive Choice Act to enact in to Federal law the  abortion rights established by Roe v. Wade and affirmed by Planned  Parenthood v. Casey.   In the wake of the Dobbs decision, I have worked with my colleagues  Senator Kaine, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Sinema in drafting a more  comprehensive, bipartisan bill that would codify the abortion rights  articulated by the Supreme Court in Roe, Casey and Whole Women's Health  v. Hellerstedt, as well as the contraception rights first articulated  in Griswold v. Connecticut and later clarified in Eisenstadt v. Baird  and Carey v. Population Services International.   Our legislation would enshrine important abortion and contraception  rights into Federal law without undercutting basic conscience  protections that have been in place for decade and that are relied upon  by healthcare practitioners who have religious objections.   Our goal with this legislation is to do what the Court should have  done--provide consistency in our laws that Americans have relied upon  for five decades regarding the ability to make certain reproductive  choices.   Mr. President, this bill maintains the pre-Dobbs status quo. In other  words, it would ensure that the legal framework in place before Dobbs  remains the law of the land. Our bill accomplishes this goal by  tracking the Supreme Court's language in the seminal cases I mentioned.   Specifically consistent with decades of Supreme Court jurisprudence,  the Reproductive Freedom for All Act provides that a State may not  impose an undue burden on the ability of a woman to choose whether or  not to ternate a pregnancy before fetal viability.   During this time Sates may enact reasonable regulations to further  the health or safety of a woman seeking to terminate a pregnancy,  unless such regulations impose an undue burden.   After fetal viability, a State may regulate or even proscribe the  ability of a woman to terminate her pregnancy but not when such a  termination is necessary to preserve the life or health of the woman.   Moreover, by codifying Griswold, Eisenstadt, and Carey, the bill  makes clear that a State cannot prohibit an individual from obtaining  or using contraceptives.   Finally the legislation specifically protects conscience protections  that have been relied upon by healthcare providers who have religious  objections.   Mr. President, the best path forward for our country is to maintain  the same legal framework that was in place just weeks ago before the  Supreme Court issued its ruling in Dobbs. Our bill would enshrine into  law the important protections articulated in the Supreme Court cases  that I mentioned without undercutting statutes that also have been in  place for decades.   I urge all of my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to join in the introduction  of the Reproductive Freedom for All Act, a bipartisan bill that would  ensure the right of women to make certain reproductive choices without  undue government interference.
