 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, as a Republican in Congress, I am proud of our  Republican congressional efforts creating the Medicare part D  prescription drug program for seniors which then-Leader Nancy Pelosi  and Democrats tried to kill. You may remember that Speaker Pelosi  famously predicted that creating the crucial part D prescription plan  for the elderly ``would end Medicare as we know it.''   Can you imagine how many seniors' lives would have been lost if she  had succeeded in stopping the affordable Medicare drug program 43  million seniors have come to depend on today?   We are in the middle of an unprecedented national pandemic. Americans  are worried about their health and their jobs. Yet here we go again in  the Democratic House, another partisan bill with no input from  Republicans but lots of input from campaign operatives and special  interest groups. The American people are sick and tired of this  partisanship.   To my Democratic colleagues and friends, I say: Stop playing  political games with healthcare.   Madam Speaker, this bill is dangerous to your health in three key  ways: It stops lifesaving cures from getting to the patients who need  them most. It blocks Americans from buying affordable, short-term  health plans that cover them in between jobs. And it threatens to slash  State support for Medicaid for the most vulnerable and poor. As if that  isn't enough, it doubles down on the most unpopular healthcare plan in  modern history: the Affordable Care Act.   Madam Speaker, you remember that disaster. It broke every promise  Democrats made to the American public.   Do you remember: If you like your healthcare plan you can keep it?  False.   If you like your doctors, you can keep them? False.   Your healthcare costs will go down by $2,500 a year? Big false.   No American making less than $250,000 a year will see a tax increase?  False.   ObamaCare won't add a dime to the Federal deficit? False.   By the way, it will add over $1.5 trillion in debt this decade.   Here we are battling the coronavirus and hoping against hope as  companies partnering with the government are racing heroically to bring  new treatments and medicines that will save our lives and prevent  Americans from being infected.   Yet today, House Democrats are unbelievably advancing a bill with  provisions that the Congressional Budget Office and the Council of  Economic Advisers predicts will stop as many as 100 lifesaving cures  from ever getting to the patients who need them most.   The California Life Sciences Association says that the Pelosi plan  for government setting medicine prices would mean nearly nine of ten  new drugs would never be made available--never--from their researchers  in small biotech companies. These are the medicines that could be the  answer to some of the most heartbreaking and devastating diseases-- including COVID-19--that our children, seniors, and families are  facing.   As this pandemic makes urgently clear, we need more cures, not fewer.  Fewer cures means more lives cut short. Yet leading Democrats shrugged  off these research experts and say: We are fine with that.   Although the Affordable Care Act has improved under President Trump-- no sabotage--prices went down in most States, insurance companies have  stabilized, and many families see more choices today. But it remains  fatally flawed.   Here is proof: two out of three Americans eligible for ObamaCare are  turning it down--two out of three. They say that it is healthcare they  don't want, they can't afford, and it doesn't work for them.    Unbelievably, Democrats are so hellbent on forcing Americans on to  the ACA, today they are threatening to slash State support for Medicaid  unless States buckle to expand ObamaCare.   Holding the poor hostage, threatening to defund the operations of  Medicaid at the State level? That is immoral. Maybe they don't remember  that the Supreme Court quickly struck down their last scheme to extort  States.   Finally, despite the claims they are expanding healthcare choice,  this misguided bill blocks Americans from buying legal, affordable,  short-term plans often used by small business workers and Americans who  are out of work or in between jobs. Yes, these health plans aren't for  everyone. But to the 3 million Americans with these lifesaving plans,  Democrats say: Tough. If you don't like your plan, or even if you do,  you can't keep it.  [[Page H2625]]    There is a better way than this dangerous, partisan waste of time.  Real people are hurting. We should work together in Congress to make  affordable, patient-centered healthcare a reality for Americans.   Last year Republicans proposed legislation that brought together  ideas and bills from Members of Congress from both parties to lower  drug prices and accelerate new cures. Healthcare policy fails when it  is partisan. We must work together now to make drugs more affordable,  to expand access to quality care, and, yes, to lower costs. This bill  doesn't achieve any of those goals. It is partisan business as usual  during a time when our Nation calls out for so much more.   I reserve the balance of my time, Madam Speaker.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), who is a key member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith), a leader in rural healthcare reform.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Reed), a key leader of the Committee on Ways and Means on  healthcare reform.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a veto threat from  President Trump that states the administration strongly opposes H.R.  1425, further demonstrating this bill has no chance of becoming law.                     Statement of Administration Policy   H.R. 1425--Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act--Rep.                       Craig, D-MN, and 61 cosponsors         The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R.       1425. This bill attempts to exploit the coronavirus pandemic       to resuscitate tired, partisan proposals that would send       hundreds of billions of dollars to insurance companies in       order to paper over serious flaws in Obamacare. Furthermore,       H.R. 1425 would pay for this bailout by imposing price       controls that undermine the American innovation the entire       globe is depending on to deliver the vaccines and       therapeutics needed to respond to the coronavirus.        Since the beginning of this crisis, the Administration has       taken a whole-of-America approach to fight the corona virus.       This includes a productive partnership with both houses of       Congress to respond to the healthcare needs of our citizens.       The Administration has delivered millions of pieces of       personal protective equipment to frontline healthcare       responders, surged hospital capacity, and dramatically scaled       up diagnostic and surveillance testing capabilities. The       Administration also launched Operation Warp Speed to       collaborate with the private sector to develop a coronavirus       vaccine, therapeutics, and diagnostics. Additionally, the       Administration is working to reimburse providers for corona       virus testing and treatment of uninsured Americans so they do       not have to worry about the financial implications of       obtaining these services.        All this was done while putting the country in the       strongest possible position to rebound from the most       significant economic challenge since the Great Depression.       Working with Congress, the Administration has delivered       financial relief directly to over 160 million Americans, over       4.5 million businesses and their employees, and over one       million healthcare providers.        Instead of building on these vital, bipartisan efforts,       H.R. 1425 reads as if the corona virus never emerged. It       repurposes failed proposals from years past that would       literally pay insurance companies more to hide the true cost       of Obamacare from consumers. Even the additional billions of       taxpayer funding is not enough to prop up Obamacare on its       own, thus H.R. 1425 goes out of its way to systematically       eliminate any competition by prohibiting more affordable       coverage options and the consideration of alternative       approaches by States. At the same time, the bill lacks any       provision to ensure the Federal Government adheres to the       long-held consensus to not fund abortion services or abortion       coverage.        To create a facade of ``paying'' for the revival of last       decade's most partisan project, Obamacare, H.R. 1425 invokes       another partisan misadventure reflected in provisions of H.R.       3. In its Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 3, the       Administration explained that these provisions would impose       price controls under the guise of ``negotiation'' that would       ultimately ``harm seniors and all who need lifesaving       medicines.'' In perhaps an indication of the intentions of       H.R. 1425, it does not even attempt to include those       provisions of H.R. 3 that had previously garnered bipartisan       support, such as establishing a cap on out-of-pocket expenses       for all beneficiaries in Medicare Part D and other       improvements to that program for seniors.        While any time is an inopportune time to dramatically       undermine the development of innovative medicines, H.R. 1425       is even more imprudent given the current focus on developing       vaccines and therapeutics rapidly to help America and the       world combat the coronavirus. To take such an action simply       to double down on the same expensive, inefficient, and       bureaucratic approach to health coverage that the American       people endured for the past decade makes it even more       misguided and counter to the most urgent needs of the       country.        If H.R. 1425 were resented to the President his advisors       would recommend that he veto the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Holding), a leading healthcare expert in the  Committee on Ways and Means.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I have here a host of letters in opposition to this dangerous  legislation, one signed by more than 40 State and regional life science  organizations and another signed by over 130 small biotech companies,  many of whom are currently working to develop COVID-19 therapies and  vaccines. In these letters, they emphasize that this bill will deter  badly needed investment that will harm their ability to manufacture and  produce therapies and cures for American families.   Madam Speaker, in the midst of a pandemic, we just heard a question:  Why do we oppose this bill? In the midst of a pandemic where countless  lives will depend upon the development of these new cures, this cannot  happen on our watch. We will not stand idly by.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the letters, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                                  October 16, 2019.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senate Majority Leader McConnell, Senate Democratic       Leader Schumer, House Speaker Pelosi, and House Republican       Leader McCarthy: As state and regional life sciences       organizations across the country, all dedicated to supporting       the development and delivery of innovative life-enhancing and       life-saving products, we write to express our strong concerns       about recent legislative proposals that seek to introduce       international reference pricing and foreign price controls as       a strategy to reduce prescription drug costs. We are gravely       concerned that such polices will consequentially threaten       patient access and choice and cede America's global       leadership in biomedical innovation.        At the outset, we underscore our appreciation for the       bipartisan and bicameral efforts underway to provide relief       to patients from unaffordable out-of-pocket costs for       prescription drugs. This is a critical challenge for our       nation, and we are committed to being  [[Page H2631]]       part of the solution to address it, while also ensuring that       incentives still exist to spawn future innovation. However,       we are deeply concerned by proposals by some in Congress to       introduce price controls, particularly foreign reference       pricing, into government and private healthcare programs.       These proposals are concerning for states and regions of the       country with established life sciences communities, as well       as for emerging biomedical innovation ecosystems working to       attract capital investment and support entrepreneurship to       build the companies and therapies of the future. Most       importantly, they would be devastating for those patients       hoping for medicines to treat serious, life-threatening       diseases.        For example, 96 percent of new cancer drugs are available       in the U.S., at an average delay of 3 months. By comparison,       Japanese patients have access to 50% of new medicines and       wait on average 23 months. German and Canadian patients wait       four times longer, French patients wait six times longer.       None of these countries even approach the access to new       therapies that our patients have. Should the U.S. implement       foreign price controls, patient choice and access to the full       range of life-saving therapies would undoubtedly be       threatened.        Proposals to implement foreign price controls also put at       risk the U.S.'s world-leading innovative biopharmaceutical       sector that has created nearly one million jobs across all 50       states and represents a large portion of our nation's Gross       Domestic Product (GDP)--generating an economic output of       approximately $1.3 trillion annually. As a sector that       already takes on extraordinary risks and significant       investments with the hope that a few will eventually become       the next life-saving treatment for patients, the looming       potential of foreign price controls brings a threat that       risks the support of future investment.        It is also important to remember that the overwhelming       majority--over 80 percent--of biopharmaceutical innovators in       the US are small, start-up, pre-revenue companies without a       single product yet on the market. A recent report by IQVIA       showed that emerging biopharmaceutical (EBP) companies       account for over 70 percent of the total late-stage R&D       pipeline and were responsible for almost two-thirds of the       patents for new drugs launched in 2018. These mostly pre-      revenue companies without a product on the market are the       ones to be most affected by fluctuations in investment caused       by the political and public policy environment.        The recent actions taken by the Administration and Congress       on drug pricing are seen as extremely threatening by the life       sciences sector, and we are therefore concerned that the       proposed foreign price controls policies will scare       investment away from life sciences investment, and towards       other industry sectors that pose far less risk. If price       controls as proposed are implemented it may reduce drug       pricing in the short term, but it will certainly result in       significantly reduced innovation and severely restricted       access to life-saving medicines.        On behalf of the US's innovative life sciences community,       we urge you to reject any efforts to undermine America's       global leadership in biomedical innovation through       international reference pricing or other price controls.       Patients deserve access to and choice of the lifesaving       therapies of today and tomorrow. As you move forward, we       stand ready to work with you to consider alternative       proposals that will propel American innovation forward and       deliver affordable, accessible and innovative therapies for       patients who need them.

Madam Speaker, just a quick fact check, because you know the  Republican Congress in 1996 enacted the first comprehensive protections  for preexisting conditions, which cover, today, 275 million Americans  who are not affected by the lawsuit. There is simply too much fear- mongering and bad information in this debate.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, Republicans support children, seniors, and patients  with preexisting conditions. A Republican Congress created the popular  Children's Health Insurance Program that millions of families rely on  today.   A Republican Congress created the prescription drug program and  Medicare to help seniors get the medicine they need, and every Democrat  and Speaker Pelosi tried to kill that bill.   A Republican Congress created the Medicare Advantage program that  serves 20 million seniors in America.   And a Republican Congress created the first law that established  protections for patients with preexisting conditions that covered 275  million Americans today regardless of this ACA lawsuit.   We want people to have access to quality, affordable healthcare that  fits their needs, not Speaker Pelosi's. We also support cures now for  serious and life-threatening diseases that plague so many families and  our loved ones. Eliminating the hope for those cures is why this bill  is just so dangerous.   Let me also be clear about what isn't in this bill, Madam Speaker. We  have heard a lot today from my friends on the other side of the aisle  bemoaning the Trump administration's effort to root out  unconstitutional laws while committing to protect people with  preexisting conditions.   The Democrats could end this uncertainty now. They are in charge of  the House. Bring to the floor a measure Republicans support that sever  the individual mandate from the rest of the ACA. Bring to the floor a  legislative fix for your unconstitutional law. Bring to the floor  certainty for all Americans, especially those with preexisting health  conditions.   But House Democrats won't do that. No, they find the political fear- mongering to be too potent an election-year weapon. So we continue this  charade.   Let me state it all again for all to hear: Republicans support  protections for those with preexisting conditions. We wrote the law  that protects 275 million Americans today. And we warned Democrats  about this unconstitutional law, and we knew it would get struck down  in court.   But we cannot have a healthy society, we cannot protect all  Americans, if we don't have access to lifesaving cures. As we continue  to fight COVID-19, what are you thinking? Why are we destroying the  incentives for new medicine and cures? We ought to be doing all we can  to accelerate medical innovation, not destroy it in this bill.   Democrats would force patients to choose between affordable medicines  and lifesaving cures for Alzheimer's ALS, Parkinson's, diabetes, or  cancer. That is a false choice. And we are not talking about just a few  cures for some very rare diseases, we are talking about up to 100  cures, dozens lost.   Our country is in a time of uncertainty. Millions are unemployed.  States still have deep restrictions in place. For folks who are relying  on short-term limited plans for this period of uncertainty, why do  Democrats propose to make their lives harder?   I oppose this dangerous bill and urge everyone to oppose it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
