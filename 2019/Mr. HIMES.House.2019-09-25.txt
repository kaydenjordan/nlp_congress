 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 577, I call up  the resolution (H. Res. 576) expressing the sense of the House of  Representatives with respect to the whistleblower complaint of August  12, 2019, made to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community,  and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the amended resolution, which  demands provision to the congressional intelligence committees of a  whistleblower complaint, which the Acting Director of National  Intelligence has withheld. The law, however, required the Acting DNI to  submit it to the committees.   This is a serious matter, Madam Speaker, for IC whistleblowing,  congressional oversight, and the rule of law.   Before turning to it, let me express my deep gratitude for the  actions of a courageous and anonymous individual in the intelligence  community. That person wanted to report urgent, credible allegations of  serious wrongdoing and did the right thing by acting in strict  accordance with proper whistleblower procedures. These permit  classified disclosures to be made to the intelligence committees while  protecting national security.   Using that mechanism, in August, the whistleblower made a complaint  to the inspector general of the intelligence community. According to  the Justice Department's legal opinion regarding the complaint, which  it today released to the public, the whistleblower's allegations  concerned the content of a telephone call between President Trump and a  foreign leader.   The inspector general determined the complaint to be urgent, meaning  that the matter met important statutory criteria, and that its  allegations appeared to be credible.   The inspector general, months later, would write that the complaint's  allegations not only fell ``within the DNI's jurisdiction,'' but that  they ``relate to one of the most important and significant  responsibilities to the American people.'' That is protecting the  United States from foreign interference in our elections.   In strict accordance with the statutory rules, the inspector general  passed the complaint and his determination to the Acting Director of  National Intelligence. The Acting Director was obligated to forward  this material to the congressional intelligence committees within 7  days of receipt, but, in contravention of the law, he refused to do  that.   There can be no misreading of the provision imposing that obligation.  It says that the DNI ``shall'' forward the materials to the House  intelligence committee and also to our colleagues at the Senate  intelligence committee.                                time  1445    ``Shall,'' of course, means ``shall.'' It does not mean ``can if you  want to.''   Despite this unambiguous, categorical directive, the Trump  administration interfered with the time-tested process for IC  whistleblowing. It would need to resist that process forcefully  because, as public reports have suggested, the complaint potentially  concerned the same craven abuse of power by President Trump which the  public learned about this morning.   I won't recite all the details of this sordid episode. But suffice it  to say that documents released today plainly show the President of the  United States shaking down his Ukrainian counterpart for a ``favor''-- an investigation by Ukraine's authorities, with close coordination by  Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr, into the son of former  Vice President Joe Biden, the former Vice President himself being a  candidate for the U.S. presidency.   So the administration got the Justice Department's Office of Legal  Counsel involved, it got the White House Counsel involved, and, without  invoking national security or making a claim of executive privilege, it  managed to get a staggeringly flawed legal opinion from the Department  of Justice.   The opinion's reasoning is specious on its face. According to the  Department of Justice, the whistleblower statute did not apply to the  complaint, and the complaint therefore did not have to be forwarded to  the committees because the complaint's allegations do not relate to an  urgent concern, meaning the funding, administration, or operation of an  intelligence activity under the DNI's authority and responsibility.   In this regard, the DOJ observed that the alleged conduct was  committed by the President, who is outside of and above the IC. I will  point out that that is irrelevant under the statute. All that is  required is that the allegation ``relate to'' an intelligence activity  within the DNI's purview.   The DOJ also faulted the IC IG, the inspector general, for not citing  a statute or policy that gave the DNI operational responsibility to  prevent foreign interference in our elections.   Think about that for a second. Have in mind what our country went  through in 2016 when Russia undertook covert as well as overt measures  to warp the U.S. Presidential election and to sow discord which the  Trump campaign welcomed with open arms.   With that recent history in mind, to say nothing of the rules on the  books, we can easily dispose of the claim that the intelligence  community, as captained by the acting DNI, has no operational role in  keeping adversary governments from meddling in our democratic  processes. That assertion is ignorant. It is wrong. And it bespeaks a  serious misunderstanding about the DNI's authorities and the activities  of the United States intelligence community.   The DOJ's cramped view would come as news to President Trump, I  suspect, given the executive order he issued in September of 2018  regarding foreign interference in our elections, which requires the  DNI, after every Federal election in this country, to assess whether  such interference has taken place and to report his assessment to the  rest of the executive branch. That sounds a lot like a serious role for  the DNI to me.   I imagine the Department of Justice's view would also come as a shock  to the acting DNI himself. After all, by statute the DNI is the head of  the U.S. intelligence community and the principal intelligence adviser  to the President and the National Security Council, among other things.  As the inspector general correctly noted, one mission of the  intelligence community, among its core missions, is to protect the  United States against hostile intelligence activities directed against  it. That would include any hostile foreign intelligence activities  associated with efforts by foreign adversaries to interfere in our  elections.   So I am stunned that the acting DNI would accept legal advice like  this,  [[Page H7922]]  which strains to minimize or ignore the functions and responsibilities  that the DNI carries out--or at least I hope--routinely.   I am also stunned that the ODNI would acquiesce in advice that, if  permitted to stand, would do such extraordinary damage. By conferring  on the DNI the discretion to opt out of what is plainly mandatory, the  Department of Justice neutered a statute governing intelligence  community whistleblowing; overturned years of consistent practice; and,  most damaging of all, called into doubt important protections from  reprisal on which this whistleblower relied and other lawful  whistleblowers in the IC have relied.   I can only imagine the chilling effect that the Department of  Justice's approach will have on lawful IC whistleblowing and thus on  the intelligence committees' ability to conduct oversight of  intelligence activities.   Madam Speaker, let me end with a note about the state of play, which  is fluid, to say the least. I understand that the executive branch may  make some of the whistleblower's materials available to the committee  this afternoon, but the details remain sketchy, and the committee may  not yet receive, in complete and unredacted form, all the information  that the acting DNI is obligated to furnish by law, and that we have  sought by subpoena. The committee will settle for nothing less.   However, the situation is resolved, Madam Speaker, the House has no  choice but to denounce the extraordinary lengths to which the White  House and Justice Department have gone to cover up and obstruct.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support the resolution, as amended. I urge  my colleagues to join me, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff), and I ask unanimous consent  that he control that time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining for  the majority.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Demings).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   It may turn out that this resolution is unnecessary. I understand  procedures are being made to provide the complaint, I hope, the full  whistleblower complaint, to the Congress and, specifically, to the  Intelligence Committee. If that is true, that is a good first step. It  is a step, of course, that is remedying the blatant violation of law  that this administration engaged in when they chose to stop the  transmittal of that complaint to the Congress.   But I do want to take this opportunity to just clear up some things  that were said, because these are serious matters, and it is important  that the American people understand the truth.   Mr. Scalise came before this body and ridiculed the majority, saying  that we had promised a quid pro quo, a statement that is, of course,  absurd on the face of it. We made no such promise. In fact, we have  spent the day explaining that a quid pro quo is not necessary for the  kind of extortion that is evident in the so-called transcript that we  received today.   Bribery requires a quid pro quo; if you do this, I will pay you that.  Extortion is simply saying you better do me a favor, or else.   So there was no promise of a quid pro quo. Neither is it necessary  for this behavior to be well beyond the pale.   And I would remind my friends in the minority that we did not bring  this moment upon the Congress. The inspector general came to this  Congress of his own volition and, I would add, at significant personal  risk, because of his concern over the actions of the administration.   It emerges today that the Acting DNI perhaps threatened to resign his  position unless the Department of Justice gave a legal justification  for his stance.   So we are not here because we want to be here. The Speaker of the  House, as every Member of this Chamber knows, has resisted, until  yesterday, even using the word impeachment because she is that focused  on the sentiment of the American people and the consequences of that  dramatic step.   So I do not want to hear from my friends in the minority that this  has been a train that we have been barreling down.   We are not here because we are happy. We are here because there is a  genuine threat to this republic and to this democracy. We were brought  here by members of the administration who raised their hand and said  something is not right.   So this resolution and its contents may be remedied later this  afternoon; I certainly hope so. But let's be clear about what really  happened and how we got here, because I suspect this is not the final  word in this discussion, and the American people deserve to know the  truth.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
