 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in  remembrance of the eighth anniversary of the Syrian conflict, which  resulted in the tragic loss of many human lives and the destabilization  of the entire region.   This is all because of the dictator Bashar Assad, who is unwilling to  step aside and heed the Syrian people's call for freedom. After  destroying Syria, Assad is now attempting to attract economic  investment. But in addition to killing over 400,000 Syrians of the  Muslim faith, Assad has also failed to protect the religious minority  of Christians in Syria.   Having personally met with the Syrian Christians for Peace, I have  heard firsthand how Assad repeatedly targeted Syria's most vulnerable  populations.   Few Christians continue to live in Assad's Syria, due to brutality by  pro-Assad militias. That is why we must support the Trump  administration's isolation of the regime and its allies in Tehran and  Moscow. That is why the Senate must follow the House and pass the  Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act.                            ____________________
