 SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, for more than 40  years, the Hyde amendment has prevented taxpayers from funding  abortions through government programs. Historically, it has been  included in annual spending bills by both parties. But recently,  Democrats voted to eliminate Hyde amendment protections. Even President  Biden previously said: ``Those of us who are opposed to abortion should  not be compelled to pay for them,'' but it would appear he and his  Democrat colleagues have abandoned this critical position.   With nearly 60 percent of Americans agreeing that taxpayer dollars  should not be used to fund abortion, we must stand for life.  Accordingly, I support H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion  Act.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and I ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
