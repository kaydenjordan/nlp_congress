 Madam Speaker, we stand here today with  another in a series of weekly messaging bills. I wonder what, next  week, we will deal with. I am sure it will be another whipsaw response  to the headlines of the day.   If you truly want to protect people with preexisting conditions, as  Republicans do, bring forth Mr. Walden's  [[Page H2964]]  bill. It has teeth. In the event that this lawsuit is upheld and the  Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional, it will protect people with  preexisting conditions.   The Speaker, Ms. Pelosi, a minute ago said that the Republicans'  position on healthcare was a joke. Well, I will tell you what is a  joke, and that is to call the Affordable Care Act successful.   The promises on which the Affordable Care Act were based were that we  would cover all Americans; that the premiums would go down; that if you  like your doctor, you could keep your doctor; and that if you like your  insurance policy, you could keep it.   Clearly, almost every existing insurance policy was declared invalid.  You could only keep your doctor if he is in your plan and your  hospital. Premiums have gone from an average of $225 in 2013, just  before the Affordable Care Act was enacted, to $475, average cost for  an individual policy today, almost a 250 percent increase.   What did we get for that?   Before the Affordable Care Act, 85 percent of Americans were covered.  Before the Affordable Care Act, 85 percent of Americans were covered.  At the peak, after the Affordable Care Act, last year, 91 percent of  the Americans were covered. We covered 6 percent more people, mostly  because we gave them insurance policies with the Medicare expansion. We  covered 6 percent more people.   But what was the cost of that? The 85 percent that were already  covered had to pay 250 percent more for their health insurance. That is  completely absurd.   And don't lecture me about people with preexisting conditions. I have  a son who had a congenital heart defect. I had a son who, as a 7-month- old child, was in a car wreck and had a brain injury, both preexisting  conditions.                                time  1500    Throughout their life, they were covered. For a brief period of time,  South Carolina, like almost every other State in the country, had  protections for preexisting conditions before the Affordable Care Act.  Under the health insurance pool in South Carolina, they had to pay 30  percent more.   It irritated me as a father that my children had to pay 30 percent  more for their health insurance, but guess what? Under the Affordable  Care Act, instead of having to pay 30 percent more, they have to pay  250 percent more and their deductibles have tripled.   You call that a success? In what world is that a success?   Republicans want to protect people with preexisting conditions. We  have voted repeatedly to do it. We have bills out there that will do  it.   Stop with the messaging, stop with the lies, and let's move forward  and do something that actually works. Let's move forward and protect  people with preexisting conditions in the event that this law is  declared unconstitutional.
