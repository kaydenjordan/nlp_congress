 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for yielding. I  want to say, first and foremost, I thank him for his consistent, loud,  smart, and well-reasoned comments on our open border and the impact on  our citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I too want to bring attention to this criminal issue.   I have this Sweet-N-Low packet that so many of us put in our coffee  in the morning, and that illustrates, Mr. Speaker, that that one amount  of sweetener, if it were fentanyl, would kill 500 Americans.   In Arkansas, fentanyl deaths are up 441 percent since 2015. Over 600  Arkansans have lost their lives. Every 5 minutes we lose a neighbor to  an accidental drug overdose. Just last year, as my friend from Texas  said, we lost over 100,000 Americans to accidental overdoses, which is  now the leading cause of death between the ages of 18 and 45. We were  here on this floor 3 years ago lamenting 55,000 Americans dying in 1  year--the same we lost in the entire Vietnam war--and now it is  100,000.   Fentanyl is directly responsible for 64 percent of those deaths, Mr.  Speaker, and a majority of that fentanyl within the United States comes  from our porous Southwest border--the border that the Biden  administration has continuously failed to secure--as it flows directly  into our communities.   Last year, enough fentanyl was interdicted--that is what we caught-- by our overworked Border Patrol to kill every American seven times  over. It isn't enough to confiscate it at the border. We need strong  leadership to discourage it from arriving in the first place, and we  can do that by permanently scheduling fentanyl as a schedule I  substance and increase the criminal penalties.    We need strong leadership and strong policies to secure our border  and respond to the illicit fentanyl that has been found in every street  drug. Until then, sadly, as noted by my friend from Texas, Americans  will continue to die at the hand of fentanyl.                             Cheering on Team USA     Mr. Speaker, as we cheer on Team USA this week and  celebrate our athletes participating in the 2022 winter games, it is  important we do not overlook the sins of the host nation, China.   China has carefully crafted their image to distract the world from  their blatant human rights abuses and their totalitarianism.  [[Page H1108]]    The International Olympic Committee has worked to portray China in a  positive light. The truth is, China is an authoritarian state set on  the destruction of anyone and anything that doesn't adhere to its world  view.   The Chinese Communist Party believes that its administrative control  over its people is the most effective form of governance. The Uyghurs  continue to face genocide and crimes against humanity. The people of  Hong Kong have seen the destruction of their liberal state. China seeks  to expand its influence in the world through its predatory lending and  its failed Belt and Road Initiative.   We can do better. We need American leadership to counter this.
