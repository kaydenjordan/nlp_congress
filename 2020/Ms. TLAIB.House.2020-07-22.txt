 Madam Speaker, I rise today to declare loudly and clearly  to every Muslim and every African person in Michigan's 13th District,  in America, and around the world that the United States House of  Representatives is taking action to end this administration's racist  ban.   Madam Speaker, I rise to send a message to marginalized communities  everywhere that, in repealing the Muslim and African ban, we are also  preventing discriminatory bans from ever happening again.   Madam Speaker, I rise as a mother of two wonderful Muslim-American  boys, Adam and Yousif, to say that Muslims and Muslim Americans are our  family members, our friends, and our neighbors--and, yes, they are  Members of Congress.   Madam Speaker, it appears that this White House might not like that  fact very much because this racist ban is a Federal endorsement of  anti-Muslim rhetoric and discrimination in our country, but today we  are coming together to finally put a stop to this.   End the Muslim and African ban.   End all discriminatory bans forever.
