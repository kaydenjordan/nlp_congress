 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Ohio  (Ms. Brown) for allowing me the opportunity to speak.   Madam Speaker, no human need is more important than health. Yet, no  need is more neglected by America than Black health.   There are two areas on which I am going to offer brief comments. The  first is maternal mortality. Among industrialized nations, the United  States has among the highest rates of maternal mortality.   The crisis of maternal health represents American exceptionalism in  the worst sense of the word. America is exceptionally cruel to Black  mothers, who, far too often, face fatal barriers to accessing maternal  care before, during, and after pregnancy. Although representing only 13  percent of the population, Black women account for nearly 40 percent of  maternal deaths.   There are racial disparities not only in maternal but also infant  mortality. The Black community has a maternal mortality rate and an  infant mortality rate that are more than double the mortality rates in  the White community.   No healthcare program is more critical to maternal health than  Medicaid, which pays 40 percent of births nationwide. Attempts by  Republican Governors to prevent Medicaid expansion has a  disproportionately destructive impact on Black maternal health.   What is most tragic is that most maternal deaths in America are  preventable and can be prevented with public investments like the Build  Back Better Act. The Build Back Better Act is so urgently needed  because it would bring a long-overdue expansion of Medicaid to every  corner of Black America.   The second topic is cancer. In 2022, more than 73,000 Black Americans  are expected to die from cancer. When it comes to most cancers, Black  Americans have the highest death rate as well as the shortest rate of  survival.   In the long run, we must develop a cure for cancer in keeping with  President Biden's unity agenda. But in the short run, we must double  down on early detection. We must invest in the development and  distribution of multi-cancer early detection tests.   Black Americans have a far lower likelihood of receiving early  detection cancer screening than White Americans. Early detection can  mean the difference between life and death. It can mean early  treatment, which can prevent cancer from metastasizing beyond the point  of no return.   Early cancer screenings and diagnoses are tragically less common in  the Black community than elsewhere in America. Even in cases where the  White community has a higher cancer incidence, the Black community will  nonetheless have higher cancer mortality because of racial disparities  in early cancer detection and diagnosis.   Expanding access to multi-cancer early detection tests would bring us  closer to closing the racial gap in early detection and in early  diagnosis, and in doing so, it would save lives.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the subject of this special  order.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________
