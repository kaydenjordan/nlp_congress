 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for next week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the  majority leader of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I share the gentleman's expression of  unified support with the people of Ukraine. Clearly, we stand with the  heroic people of Ukraine, President Zelensky, and the inspiration he  has been showing to the world, and the strong people of Ukraine.   What we are seeing from Russia is barbaric. One of my colleagues,  Representative Spartz, who actually was born in Ukraine, she has been  very outspoken about the genocide that is happening to the people of  Ukraine. As the gentleman mentioned, the resolution that we passed with  Mr. Meeks and Mrs. Spartz, it was bipartisan, and an overwhelming vote  of support standing with the people of Ukraine.   Clearly, they have asked for a number of very specific things: some  military equipment, supplies, as well as humanitarian relief. We need  to continue to push as hard as we can to make sure it is delivered  as expeditiously as possible as we watch continuous barbaric attacks,  raids, bombing, carpet bombing, cluster bombs, things that are illegal  under international law, yet Putin continues to commit these barbaric  crimes against the people of Ukraine. They are tough people, and they  are not going to give up their country. We need to do everything we can  to help them.    One other thing that was mentioned in this resolution because people,  obviously, want to know what they can do. There are a number of steps  that are being taken and there are other steps that we would also like  to see this Congress take. In the resolution there were two provisions  specifically that I wanted to bring up.   One of the resolution requests was that we--the United States  Congress--pledge support working with Europe and international partners  to bolster Europe's energy security and reduce its dependence on  Russian energy imports.   The resolution that we passed also goes on to say: We resolve that we  underscore the importance of maintaining United States' energy  independence for the benefit of the American people and United States'  allies. With that there was a piece of legislation that was just filed  earlier this week to do just that. H.R. 6858, offered by Mrs. McMorris  Rodgers and Mr. Westerman, the ranking members of the Energy and  Commerce Committee and the Natural Resources Committee, goes to the  heart of what we can do as a country and as a Congress to take leverage  away from Vladimir Putin as it relates to energy.   We can all see over the years how Europe has become very dependent on  Russian energy. They, unfortunately, get over 40 percent of their oil  from Russia. This is also putting billions of dollars in the pocket of  Vladimir Putin. When you look at the price of oil today, over $110 a  barrel, just look at the daily benefit that that gives to Vladimir  Putin. He is making over $700 million every single day selling oil to  the United States and Europe. Think about that.   Vladimir Putin is pocketing today over $700 million, and he is going  to get another $700 million tomorrow and another the day after by  selling his oil to the United States and to Europe. There are things we  can do to stop that. That is what H.R. 6858 goes to the heart of. Some  of those things are very specific.   President Biden, just a few weeks ago, put a complete freeze on all  oil and gas projects in America. All oil and gas projects. That means  we are not allowing the United States to provide for the resources of  our country and our allies. We used to be exporting oil to our allies  around the world, it is becoming harder to do that because those  policies by President Biden are shutting off American energy, and at  the same time President Biden was asking Vladimir Putin to produce more  oil for us.   There is no reason we should be asking Russia to do what we in  America can do, yet that is a policy that was put in place. President  Biden can reverse that today. I have called on President Biden to  reverse all of these specific actions today. This legislation would at  least show that Congress is ready to allow ourselves to be energy  independent so that we can take that leverage away from Putin. We can  take that $700 million away from Putin.                                time  1115    Obviously, there are a number of other things, just permits for  things like LNG--natural gas--Putin is supplying a tremendous amount of  natural gas to Europe. There are six projects right now sitting on the  Biden administration's desk to approve LNG permit applications for  major projects, multibillion-dollar, private-sector-funded projects in  America to allow us to ship natural gas to our European allies so they  don't need to get it from Putin. Not one of those permits has been  approved in over a year.   Same thing, permits for pipelines. It is not just the Keystone  pipeline. There are many other pipeline projects including two States  in the Northeast. In the United States, States like Massachusetts are  importing their oil from Vladimir Putin because they can't get it  through pipelines in America. This opens that up.   It does a number of other things to allow America to become energy  independent, but, more importantly, to take the leverage away from  Vladimir Putin that he has today that he is using to pocket over $700  million a day by selling his energy to us and Europe. I would love to  see that bill on the floor, and I think a lot of other people would,  too, to send a message to Putin that we are not going to be a part of  helping him finance this barbaric war on Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentleman if we could look at bringing  H.R. 6858 to the floor, have a full debate, and pass a strong piece of  legislation that would send a signal to our  [[Page H1286]]  friends around the world, surely to the people of Ukraine, but also to  Vladimir Putin that he is not going to be able to finance his war off  the backs of oil he is selling to the United States and Europe and  using that against the people of Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to gentleman.    Thirty million, I believe it is.    Mr. Speaker, there are many areas where we have been  unified in our response to Ukraine, but it is not unifying to say leave  Russia's oil off the table in terms of sanctions. That was left out by  President Biden. When he issued sanctions he specifically exempted  Russia's oil, and that is not unifying. There are a lot of people who  are angry about that because we are watching the amount of money that  Putin is putting in his pocket every day, and he is using that money.   So you take other sanctions, you take other things off the table, the  banking system might be hit hard, except if he is able to put $700  million--and it is probably closer to $1 billion a day now with this  higher price of oil because of what he has done and because of what our  country has done to take energy off the table.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    I appreciate that clarification because it is in  President Biden's set of sanctions that he specifically exempted  energy. Clearly, that is not unifying, even to us.   But it is the money that is still allowed to be flowing into Russia,  into Putin's pocket, to finance the war that many of us want to get at.   If H.R. 6858, after the gentleman looks at it, has some provisions  that we could work on, I think it would be very unifying to the country  to say we are finally going to confront what might be Vladimir Putin's  largest source of funding, and that is his oil exports to the United  States. It offends many, many people that, today, we are getting over  100,000 barrels every single day from Russia because we took things  like the Keystone pipeline off the table.   That would have brought us oil from Canada. Canada is a friend, by  the way. And it is not like the need and the demand just went away. The  demand is still there.   President Biden said no, we don't want Canadian oil. But it wasn't  because he didn't want any oil. He didn't say no, we don't want any  pipelines. He just said no to the Canada-to-America pipeline, but he  said yes to the Nord Stream 2, initially. But he also said to Vladimir  Putin: Would you produce more oil?   And let's keep in mind--I know there is this conversation about the  planet. Let's be honest about carbon emissions. Carbon is emitted all  around the globe. So if we shut down production in America, which has  been done--and it is not just on Federal lands where the President is  not issuing permits. He put a freeze just 2 weeks ago on all new  permits.   But it is also the banking system that he is using to go after oil  and gas companies, so there is no investment being made in America.  They are making investments, billions of dollars of investment, in  other countries. They are just not making it here in America because of  those policies.   Again, that just gives more leverage to Putin. We were paying less  than $2 per gallon under President Trump. I know the gentleman wanted  to bring up President Trump.   President Trump stood up to Putin, by the way. You didn't see an  invasion anywhere in Ukraine under President Trump. You surely did  under President Obama and Vice President Biden when Putin walked in and  took Crimea with no consequence. Afghanistan, the weakness that was  being showed clearly was being watched by Putin and Xi and other  adversaries as a preface to then go and start marshaling troops on the  Ukraine border.   President Trump didn't let that happen. He stood up to Putin and  pushed back on Putin. He also used energy as a weapon against our  enemies because we were producing enough to not only meet our needs but  to export to our friends around the world.   Surely, lower pricing was a benefit to Americans, but it also helped  our allies around the world. That has been taken off the table.   But let's talk about the carbon emission side because oil is being  produced. It is just that a lot of it isn't being produced here that  would otherwise be in the mix.   So if you look at, for example, Russian oil, Russia emits probably 40  percent more carbon to make the same oil that otherwise would be made  in the United States because we have better standards in America.   I know a lot of people love beating up on America. We do it better  than anybody else. Our technology is better than anybody else. In fact,  our technology for producing energy is the envy of the world. It should  be the model for the world because if we are not making it, Russia is  going to be making it.   Believe me, futures prices of oil have an impact on price today,  which is why, when President Biden walked in and shut the spigots off  in America--sure, there is production going on from previous leases  that happened under previous administrations, including President  Trump, that was driving the price down. But when he walked in day one  and said no to the Keystone pipeline--in other words, no to Canada's  oil but yes to Russia's oil--that had an impact on price.   When he said no to Federal drilling, which then he expanded to all  drilling, any new permits--sure, the stuff that is going on out there  is still going on, but there is no new investment being made in  America. It is being made in other countries, including Russia,  including OPEC nations. Because of that, they are able to control the  price because they are cartels.   We had literally taken the monopoly away from OPEC and Russia when we  were producing enough and using the resources of this great Nation, by  the way, in a much more energy efficient way than anywhere else in the  world. We were reducing carbon emissions in America while producing our  own energy, while manufacturing more in America. The more things are  shut down here, they are being made in other places, and those other  places emit more carbon.   China is building a coal plant probably every single week. China  emits more carbon, probably five times more carbon, to make many of the  same things we make in America.   So the less we make here, it is still being made; it is just being  made in other countries. They get the jobs, but they also emit more  carbon. So, as people talk about carbon emissions, don't leave that  point out because it is an important point.   Again, it was President Biden himself who asked Putin to produce more  oil, just last year. The oil produced in Russia has a higher carbon  price than made here in America.   And it makes us less secure. It makes Putin more strong. It gives him  hundreds of millions of dollars a day that we can take off the table.   I think that would be very unifying if we had that debate and said:  Can we get an agreement on some of these provisions that would actually  strengthen our country?   Even if Russian wasn't invading Ukraine, it would be smart American  policy. It would reduce carbon emissions. But especially considering  what is going on in Russia, this is much more pertinent today to have  this discussion. Again, I think it can be unifying.    Just because right now we may not see eye to eye, I think there is a  way to see eye to eye on this if we actually had that debate and looked  at it from a global perspective, not just in a silo in America because,  again, there is a global market for oil. Carbon emissions are global.  [[Page H1288]]    The countries that are taking the things away that we are shutting  down here in America emit more carbon. It is a fact. Why shouldn't we  be talking about that, too, and, frankly, taking away the leverage that  Putin would have?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    As we talk about this energy policy difference, again, I  do think it could be unifying. I do think we can get to a point where  we recognize some of the impediments that are real today. While the  President says Make It In America, there are things that President  Biden is doing that are blocking the ability for us to make it in  America.   Again, I have talked about some of the regulatory agencies that are  making it very hard even on some of those lands the gentleman  references that could be open for production where they can't because  they reinstated some of the things like WOTUS and some of the other  regulations that were removed so that States could look at the ability  to permit applications where now they are not able to do that, where  banking systems, through Treasury, through the SEC, are blocking  financial institutions or bullying financial institutions to not allow  investment by American banks into American production of energy.   It is real. It is going on. It is a problem. And it is why many of  those energy companies are making their billions of investments in  other countries right now.                                time  1145    Again, when you have John Kerry, the President's global warming czar,  just the other day saying he hopes Russia helps us with this.    Mr. Speaker, probably about 4 days ago, where he was  talking about getting energy production addressed and some other things  addressed. We shouldn't have a strategy that involves Russia helping us  right now or Putin helping us right now.   So don't give Vladimir Putin that leverage. He has leverage. While  Nord Stream 2 is blocked today, Nord Stream 1, the original Nord Stream  [[Page H1289]]  pipeline, is still operating, providing over 40 percent of Germany's  energy. That was what President Trump was critical of Merkel about, why  are you signing contracts that make your country more dependent on  Russia? He said that verbatim. He was right back then. Germany probably  wishes they wouldn't have done it today because they were hamstrung in  the beginning of this. They are now helping, but they are also  dependent on Russian oil.   We should be looking at things that we can do to not only wean  ourselves off of Russian oil but our allies around the world. There are  real specific things we can do and there are impediments in this  country today that exist that are unnecessary, that are hurting our  ability to shut down Russia's ability to use energy as leverage. They  are doing it right now. They are using it not only as leverage but as a  financing source. Putin still is pocketing over $700 million a day by  selling oil to Europe and America.   If there are things that we can come to an agreement on that would  address it, I think it would be important that we do it as fast as  possible to take away those points so that Putin has to think twice  about continuing what he is doing, this barbaric genocide that is  happening in Ukraine.   So just saying that while it might not be something we recognize as  unifying today, I think it could end up being something unifying in a  short period of time, if we can keep working through those differences.  I would just encourage that we try to do that.   If there is anything else on that, I would yield, but there is one  other issue I wanted to raise as well.   The Senate just a few days ago passed unanimously a resolution asking  to open up the Capitol again to the American people, our constituents,  who still are not able to come to the Capitol to visit with Members of  Congress, to sit in the gallery, to participate even in the State of  the Union. It was a unanimous resolution in the Senate.   There is a companion resolution by Congressman Steil that was filed,  H. Res. 961, that would do the same thing and express from the House  side what the Senate just expressed, that it is time to open the  Capitol to the public again. The Senate Republicans and Democrats came  to an agreement to do it. I would just ask that we do the same and show  the American people that the people's House is open to the people of  the Nation. If the Senate can come to an agreement on it--again, I  don't think there is anything controversial in the resolution, but I  would ask that we would bring that up as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, I have been very clear from  the very beginning, anyone who broke into this Capitol ought to be held  accountable and is being held accountable. More arrests have been made  than probably all of the cities where people were burning down cities  across America in the summer. That is something that ought to be  addressed, and the Democratic Party doesn't want to talk about that.  They just want to talk about January 6.   These resolutions are not about January 6. It is allowing the  American people to exercise their First Amendment right to come and  meet with their Members of Congress, which they are not able to do  right now.   If you look at that resolution, the head of the RNC even came out and  said that is not what they were referring to, what the gentleman just  alluded to. They said they were talking about the people who weren't  even in the District of Columbia on January 6 who are being targeted  right now. That is what they said that they were doing. Go take that up  with them.   I have been clear about what has happened to the people who broke  into this Capitol and that everybody who breaks the law ought to be  held accountable, not just the people who broke in here on January 6,  but also people who burned the cities down over the summer of 2020 who  haven't been held accountable. That is something that angers people all  over the country. They want to see the law equally carried out for  people who broke the law, no matter where they were, here or in cities  across America.   If you want to criticize one side of it, at least be willing to  criticize the other side of it, too. I surely have. I haven't heard it  from the other side. I would be more than happy to hear the gentleman  talk about people who were shooting at cops, killed cops, beat up  people in streets, burned down police stations, government buildings in  cities, took over cities, and haven't been held accountable. Shouldn't  they also be held accountable? I say both should be held accountable.  Does the gentleman agree with that?   And I yield to the gentleman.    Just again, we condemn violence of all kinds: Political  violence, people that just commit violence because they want to or they  think they can get away with it or they think somebody will bail them  out if they do it. But we should do it across the board, and the  punishment fits the crime. The laws are on the books. It is the  prosecutors who go after the people, and they are in some instances. It  should be in all instances.   I will continue to call it out on both sides. I would hope on the  other side we hear that as well, not just when they see it in one  place, but when they see it in all places, and I would hope we would  open up the people's House and get the Capitol back open to the  American people who want to and have a right to come and express their  views on issues.   They might want to send an email, they might want to make a phone  call, but they also might want to go to the office and sign that log  book and try to sit down either with the Member of Congress or their  staff to convey their feelings, and we just hope that happens. Again,  the Senate unanimously said they want that to happen. I would hope the  House would do it, too.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
