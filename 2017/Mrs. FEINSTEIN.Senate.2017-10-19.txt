 Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Rim of  the Valley Corridor Preservation Act. This legislation expands the  boundary of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to  provide surrounding communities much-needed additional access to nature  while maintaining private property rights and existing local land use  authorities.   This bill adds an additional 191,000 acres, known as the Rim of the  Valley Unit, to better protect natural resources and habitats, and  provide members of the local community with improved recreational and  educational opportunities.   This proposed expansion comes at the recommendation of the National  Park Service after a six-year special resource study of the area. The  study was directed by Congress in the Rim of the Valley Corridor Study  Act, passed in 2008. The National Park Service's recommendation takes  into account over 2,000 comments received from the public, elected  officials, local organizations, and other stakeholders.  [[Page S6646]]    This legislation will significantly expand outdoor recreational  opportunities for residents of Los Angeles County, one of the most  densely populated and park-poor areas in California.   In fact, 47% of Californians--that's six percent of the U.S.  population--live within two hours of the proposed expansion area.  Enlarging the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area will  provide these communities with increased access to public lands and a  boost to the local economy.   The proposed expansion will also protect valuable habitat for  endangered wildlife, such as the California red-legged frog. Other  species protected include mountain lions, bobcats, foxes, badgers,  coyotes, and deer.   Notably, the Rim of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act would only  allow the Department of the Interior to acquire non-Federal land within  the new boundaries through exchange, donation, or purchase from willing  sellers. This legislation will not create any additional liability or  restrictions for private property owners.   This bill enjoys the support of more than 50 local municipalities,  community groups, and elected officials. It is the product of true  public engagement in the legislative process.   I would like to thank my colleague, Representative Adam Schiff, for  introducing this legislation in the House.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the Rim of the  Valley Corridor Preservation Act.   Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Lee):   S. 1994. A bill to reduce recidivism and increase public safety, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
