 Mr. Speaker, last year, the American people embraced  the Democrats' For the People agenda: lower healthcare costs, raise  wages, and clean up corruption.   Americans hate corruption. They hate the idea that people are cutting  the line, breaking the rules, and getting ahead, cheating on the  system. They want to see us clean that up in Washington.   And they sent us last year with a very, very powerful message. Three  things, they said:   The first was: Make it so that I can get to the ballot box in America  without running an obstacle course. Make it easier to register and vote  in this country.   And in H.R. 1, the For the People Act, we did that. We put that  proposal forward to strengthen voting.   The second thing they said was: When you get to Washington, behave  yourselves. It is that simple. Be ethical, be accountable, and answer  to the people.   So we put ethics reforms into H.R. 1, the For the People Act.   The last thing they said was: When you get to Washington, don't get  tangled up in the money. Remember where you came from. Work for us, not  the special interests and the insiders and the lobbyists.   And we fixed that in H.R. 1. That was part of the For the People  agenda.                            ____________________
