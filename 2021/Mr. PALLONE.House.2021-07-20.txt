 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 535, I call up  the bill (H.R. 2668) to amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to  affirmatively confirm the authority of the Federal Trade Commission to  seek permanent injunctions and other equitable relief for violations of  any provision of law enforced by the Commission, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2668.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2668, the Consumer  Protection and Recovery Act.   This legislation is essential to protect consumers and honest  businesses across the country. It restores a critical tool of the  Federal Trade Commission to go to court to get victimized consumers  their money back and make lawbreakers return their illegal profits. The  tool is section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act.  [[Page H3731]]    For over 40 years, section 13(b) has been the FTC's primary and most  effective means to obtain relief for consumers and businesses. Over  just the last 5 years alone, the FTC returned over $11.2 billion to  nearly 10 million Americans who had been scammed.   As one example, the FTC used this authority to help relieve veterans  and servicemembers from crushing student debt after they were scammed  by the University of Phoenix and DeVry. The agency has also returned  money to seniors and other vulnerable groups often targeted by fraud.  None of this would have been possible without 13(b).   Congress must act now because, in April, the Supreme Court ruled that  13(b) did not allow the FTC to seek restitution for consumers. Instead,  the Court ruled that the FTC could only seek injunctions to stop bad  actors from violating the law. In the case before the Court, a criminal  payday lender was found to have defrauded consumers of $1.3 billion,  but that money could not legally be returned to the victims.   Without this legislation, that unjust result remains the law of the  land. That is why this legislation has such broad support, including  military and veterans groups, business organizations, consumer  advocates, unions, and the attorneys general of 28 States, including  both Republican- and Democratic-led States. That is why the FTC, during  both the Trump and Biden administrations, has repeatedly and  unanimously begged Congress to act to save the consumer protections  afforded by 13(b).   The opponents of the bill have misrepresented and mischaracterized  what this bill does, in my opinion, Mr. Speaker. The Consumer  Protection and Recovery Act simply restores the FTC's ability to seek  equitable monetary relief for violations of all the laws it enforces,  exactly as it has done for over 40 years.   Some say these authorities are ripe for abuse. But under this bill,  the FTC would not be able to bring more cases or enact more rules. The  bill does not allow for civil penalties, fines, or punitive damages.  Consumers can only get back what they lost, and lawbreakers only have  to give up their illegal profits.   Nothing in current law can replace the authorities that the FTC has  lost. The suggested alternative, section 19 of the FTC Act, does not  protect consumers in all cases and requires procedural hurdles that  take far too long for any meaningful relief, or any relief at all, to  reach our constituents.   This bill ensures consumers are not left holding the bag when bad  guys break the law. The money they get back allows hardworking families  to pay rent, feed their children, buy clothes, and make ends meet.   I thank Representative Cardenas for his leadership on this bill as  well as Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee Chair Jan  Schakowsky for all her hard work in helping us get this bill to the  floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to put their constituents  first and support the Consumer Protection and Recovery Act, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the chairman of our Consumer Protection and  Commerce Subcommittee. She has worked long and hard on this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Cardenas), the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Schrader).                                time  1715     Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon for the  question.  [[Page H3735]]    The intent of this bill is to restore the FTC's authority to secure  restitution not to pile penalties onto small businesses that make an  honest mistake.   We want to allow the FTC to ensure consumers who are harmed by a  violation of the law are made whole. So let me be clear. This bill does  not allow the FTC to impose civil penalties or punitive damages. It  only allows for equitable remedies, putting everything back the way it  was before the violation occurred.   When the FTC is going after truly bad actors who intentionally preyed  on consumers, it would need to use the authority under a different part  of its statute to seek penalties and also meet the burden of proof  required under that additional authority.   And another important point is that this bill actually protects  honest small businesses from having to compete against unscrupulous  companies that break the law to give themselves an unfair advantage. So  this bill gives the FTC back the tools it needs to ensure a level  playing field in the marketplace.   I thank the gentleman from Oregon for engaging on this bill and  working with us on our shared goal of protecting American consumers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Miss Rice).   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  2668, the Consumer Protection and Recovery Act.   This legislation would restore a key authority of the Federal Trade  Commission, which allows it to return money to consumers who have been  defrauded by scammers. The FTC has used this authority to protect  consumers for the past 40-plus years. It is often senior citizens,  veterans, and other vulnerable members of society who tend to be  victims of scams, that benefit most from the FTC's ability to return  money.   But as a result of the Supreme Court's decision, defrauded consumers  are no longer being protected. Instead, they are being left out in the  cold at one of the worst possible times.   Around 327,000 people have filed a fraud complaint linked to the  COVID-19 pandemic, according to FTC data. And those victims have lost a  combined $488 million. Scammers are taking advantage of the public  health crisis and the Court's decision is hampering the FTC's efforts  to combat this fraud.   That is why it is critical that we pass H.R. 2668 to restore the  FTC's authority to seek equitable relief by amending section 13(b) of  the Federal Trade Commission Act to provide the FTC with express  authority to obtain both injunctive and monetary equitable relief.   I thank my colleague on the Committee on Energy and Commerce,  Representative Cardenas, for introducing this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler), who is the chairman of the Committee on the  Judiciary, and I thank him, also, for working with us on this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), who is the chairman of the Judiciary  Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Porter), who is a strong advocate for consumers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, to go back to this bill, I know my colleague from  Illinois--who I like a lot--was talking about H.R. 1, but let's go back  to this bill.   I know that there have been a lot of statements on the other side of  the aisle about, why this bill? They didn't like the process; they  didn't like what we were doing. But, look, the bottom line is very  simple here. For many years, the FTC was going after bad actors and  those who were committing fraud and scamming consumers, and they were  basically getting the money back that was stolen from the consumers and  giving it back to those consumers in a form of restitution.   The Supreme Court ruled they couldn't continue to do that, not  because the Court thought it was a bad idea, but they just didn't think  the statutory language allowed it. And since that time, the FTC--both  under Democrat and Republican administrations--is asking us to restore  that ability of the FTC to seek restitution and give money back to the  consumers who were defrauded.                                time  1730    There is nothing else here. That is exactly what we are doing.  Nothing more.   I don't really understand the opposition that is coming from the  Republican side of the aisle because we are just making it possible for  the FTC to do its job effectively, which they were doing for so many  years when they recovered billions and billions of dollars for  consumers.   I would say look at the language, look at what we are actually doing  here, and please support this bill because this is good for everybody  in this country, regardless of whether they are Democrat or Republican,  or their ideology. This is not ideological. This is a practical way to  help the average person.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I yield back the balance of my time.
