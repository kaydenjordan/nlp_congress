 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 500, the  Financial Exploitation Prevention Act.   It is, indeed, a bipartisan bill that will help prevent seniors and  other vulnerable adults from becoming victims of fraud.   I thank Chairman McHenry for his very strong support on this  important legislation and the ranking member for working with us on  this legislation.   Financial exploitation of seniors and other vulnerable adults is a  serious and growing problem. Over the next 10-plus years, 10,000  Americans will turn 65 every day, with seniors making up 18 percent of  the Nation's population by 2030.   As more investors age into retirement, their risk of exploitation  increases. Sadly, about one in five senior investors falls prey to  financial fraud, and those investors lose an estimated $2.9 billion  annually in reported cases.                                time  1700    However, according to the National Adult Protective Services  Association, only 1 in 44 cases of financial abuse is ever even  reported.   Right now, approximately 44 percent of households headed by a baby  boomer and 30 percent of Silent Generation households own mutual funds.  My bill proposes a solution to fight elder abuse in the context of  mutual funds.   Since some mutual fund shareholder accounts are held directly with  the mutual fund and serviced by the fund's transfer agent, or direct- at-fund accounts, as they are known, the transfer agent is typically  responsible for opening and servicing the accounts, maintaining the  account records, and serving as the fund's point of contact for those  shareholders.   Under current law, when a fund's transfer agent suspects financial  exploitation in a direct-at-fund account, it cannot lawfully delay the  disbursement of redemption proceeds while an investigation occurs.   My legislation would codify both a FINRA and SEC issued no-action  letter from 2018 that permits a mutual fund and its transfer agent to  delay the redemption period of a security if they reasonably believe  that a request was made by exploiting seniors or other vulnerable  adults. It does not stop this trade from going through, it just takes a  pause while they check with that senior to make sure that there has not  been fraud or elder abuse anticipated.   This will provide our potentially vulnerable investors with an  important layer of investor protection to help make sure that they  receive the hard-earned savings that they have built up over the years.   Additionally, and importantly, my bill also requires the SEC to  report to Congress on additional potential legislative solutions for  further combating financial exploitation of seniors and vulnerable  adults.   Many of us have had the bittersweet experience of caring for a parent  or loved one as they grow older. This legislation will give our  constituents the peace of knowing that their loved ones are better  protected from fraud.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Financial  Exploitation Prevention Act.
