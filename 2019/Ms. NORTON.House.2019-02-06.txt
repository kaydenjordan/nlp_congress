 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 866) to provide a lactation room in public buildings.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 866         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness For Breastfeeding       Mothers Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. LACTATION ROOM IN PUBLIC BUILDINGS.         (a) Lactation Room in Public Buildings.--Chapter 33 of       title 40, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end       the following new section:       ``Sec. 3318. Lactation room in public buildings         ``(a) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) Appropriate authority.--The term `appropriate       authority' means the head of a Federal agency, the Architect       of the Capitol, or other official authority responsible for       the operation of a public building.        ``(2) Covered public building.--The term `covered public       building' means a public building (as defined in section       3301) that is open to the public and contains a public       restroom, and includes a building listed in section 6301 or       5101.        ``(3) Lactation room.--The term `lactation room' means a       hygienic place, other than a bathroom, that--        ``(A) is shielded from view;        ``(B) is free from intrusion; and        ``(C) contains a chair, a working surface, and, if the       public building is otherwise supplied with electricity, an       electrical outlet.        ``(b) Lactation Room Required.--Except as provided in       subsection (c), the appropriate authority of a covered public       building shall ensure that the building contains a lactation       room that is made available for use by members of the public       to express breast milk.        ``(c) Exceptions.--A covered public building may be       excluded from the requirement in subsection (b) at the       discretion of the appropriate authority if--        ``(1) the public building--        ``(A) does not contain a lactation room for employees who       work in the building; and        ``(B) does not have a room that could be repurposed as a       lactation room or a space that could be made private using       portable materials, at a reasonable cost; or        ``(2) new construction would be required to create a       lactation room in the public building and the cost of such       construction is unfeasible.        ``(d) No Unauthorized Entry.--Nothing in this section shall       be construed to authorize an individual to enter a public       building or portion thereof that the individual is not       otherwise authorized to enter.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 33 of title 40, United States Code, is       amended by inserting after the item related to section 3316       the following new item:  ``3318. Lactation room in public buildings.''.         (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall take effect 1 year after the date of the enactment of       this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 866.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of my bill, the Fairness For  Breastfeeding Mothers Act of 2019, a bill that would require buildings  that are either federally owned or leased to provide designated private  and hygienic lactation spaces for nursing mothers.   The House passed this bill by voice vote when I offered it last  Congress. The House also passed this bill in the 114th Congress as an  amendment to the Public Buildings Reform and Savings Act of 2016. I  appreciate the prior support of my colleagues, and I hope they will  join me today in support of this important legislation once again.   For years, Federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of  Agriculture and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have  encouraged breastfeeding. The benefits are so great that the Affordable  Care Act amended Federal law to require employers to provide a  designated, non-bathroom space for returning employees to pump breast  milk for their newborns, ensuring that new mothers would be able to  continue the essential practice even after returning to work.   My bill would extend this requirement to include not only employees,  but visitors and guests to Federal facilities across the Nation.  Actually, Federal facilities visited by millions of Americans and  others should lead the way.   My bill does not require the expenditure of Federal funds or require  space to be mandated. It would simply allow visitors to Federal  buildings to make use of spaces that are already available to Federal  employees or to access similar spaces within those buildings.   In Washington, D.C., alone, there are millions of tourists who visit  Federal sites, such as the Lincoln Memorial and the Smithsonian  Institution. Increasingly, families understand the unique benefits of  breastfeeding as encouraged by Federal agencies and programs, and  visitors to these buildings who have newborns and babies should have a  private space to breastfeed or pump.   The benefits of breastfeeding are well-documented. Breast milk  contains antibodies and hormones that boost babies' immune systems.  Studies have shown lower risks of asthma, diabetes, respiratory  infections, and other diseases among breastfed babies.                                time  1230    Breastfeeding also has benefits for nursing mothers, who, research  has shown, have lower risks of diabetes and certain forms of cancer.   Given the significant health benefits of breastfeeding for both baby  and mother already recognized in Federal policy, my bill is a logical  step to ensure that visitors to Federal sites have access to clean,  hygienic, and private spaces to nurse or pump.   It is also important to ensure that lactation spaces are accessible  to individuals with disabilities. While the Americans with Disabilities  Act does not apply to Federal buildings, the lactation spaces required  by my bill would be subject to a similar law, the Architectural  Barriers Act, which requires buildings and facilities that are  designed, built, or altered with Federal dollars or leased by Federal  agencies, to be accessible to individuals with disabilities whenever  possible.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, we have had this act come up in a  Republican House. It has now come up in a Democratic House. What more  do we need in order for it to be clear that this is, shall we say,  motherhood legislation and that the whole House is for it?   Madam Speaker, I have no remaining speakers, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 543) to require the Federal Railroad Administration to  provide appropriate congressional notice of comprehensive safety  assessments conducted with respect to intercity or commuter rail  passenger transportation.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 543         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. NOTICE OF COMPREHENSIVE SAFETY ASSESSMENTS.         (a) Initial Notice.--Not later than 10 business days after       the Federal Railroad Administration initiates a comprehensive       safety assessment of an entity providing regularly scheduled       intercity or commuter rail passenger transportation, the       Federal Railroad Administration shall notify in electronic       format the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of       the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce,       Science, and Transportation of the Senate, and each member of       Congress representing a State in which the service that is       the subject of the assessment being conducted is located, of       the initiation of that assessment.        (b) Findings.--Not later than 90 days after completion of a       comprehensive safety assessment described in subsection (a),       the Federal Railroad Administration shall transmit in       electronic format to the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the       Senate, and to each member of Congress representing a State       in which the service that is the subject of the assessment       being conducted is located, its findings of that assessment,       including identified defects and any recommendations.        (c) Definition.--For purpose of this section, the term       ``comprehensive safety assessment'' means a focused review of       the safety-related processes and procedures, compliance with       safety regulations and requirements, and overall safety       culture of an entity providing regularly scheduled intercity       or commuter rail passenger transportation.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 543.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, on the morning of September 29, 2016, a New Jersey  Transit train failed to stop, overrode a bumping post at the end of its  track, and struck a wall of the Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken, New  Jersey.   In the wake of this fatal accident, which killed a young mother and  injured 110 passengers and crew members, it was made public that the  Federal Railroad Administration had been conducting a so-called ``deep  audit'' of New Jersey Transit, which was prompted by an increase in  safety violations.   This bill requires that the FRA provide appropriate congressional  notice when the agency initiates and completes a comprehensive safety  assessment of an intercity or commuter rail passenger system.   It is important that Members of Congress are informed as soon as  Federal safety assessments are underway so that we may work on ways to  provide assistance and oversight for our districts' intercity or  commuter passenger rail services and inform our constituents of any  safety issues before accidents like what happened in Hoboken occur  again.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Sires), the sponsor of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, this bill, too, was considered in the  Republican House. We are considering it here in the Democratic House. I  certainly hope that the urgency of this bill is apparent.   I have no further speakers other than the gentleman from New Jersey,  who knows this issue perhaps best, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  [[Page H1373]]  bill (H.R. 831) to direct the Secretary of Transportation to request  nominations for and make determinations regarding roads to be  designated under the national scenic byways program, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                  H.R. 831         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Reviving America's Scenic       Byways Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. NATIONAL SCENIC BYWAYS PROGRAM.         (a) Request for Nominations.--Not later than 90 days after       the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of       Transportation shall issue a request for nominations with       respect to roads to be designated under the national scenic       byways program, as described in section 162(a) of title 23,       United States Code. The Secretary shall make the request for       nominations available on the appropriate website of the       Department of Transportation.        (b) Designation Determinations.--Not later than 1 year       after the date on which the request for nominations required       under subsection (a) is issued, the Secretary shall make       publicly available on the appropriate website of the       Department of Transportation a list specifying the roads,       nominated pursuant to such request, to be designated under       the national scenic byways program.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 831.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The National Scenic Byways Program was created in 1991 in the  Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act--ISTEA, as it was  called--and, since that time, has helped designate and provide funding  for 150 scenic roads across the country.   In the consolidation of Federal highways programs in MAP-21, which  was enacted in 2012, funding for a separate National Scenic Byways  Program was eliminated; however, the authority of the Department of  Transportation to continue to designate roads was retained.  Unfortunately, the Department of Transportation has not designated any  new scenic byways since the dedicated program was eliminated in 2012.   Madam Speaker, this legislation will ensure that there is a process  once again for States, Tribes, and Federal land management agencies to  request designations for roads that meet the scenic byways criteria.   I thank the sponsor of this legislation, Mr. Cicilline, who has  supported efforts to preserve the scenic beauty of our country's  natural and man-made environments as co-chair of the Congressional  America the Beautiful Caucus for introducing this legislation, and I  strongly support H.R. 831 and urge my colleagues to join in passing  this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), my good friend and the  sponsor of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, you see the bipartisan nature of this  bill, and it doesn't require us to appropriate any funds, but we can  imagine what States would do with this designation on their own.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 66) to establish the Route 66 Centennial Commission, to  direct the Secretary of Transportation to prepare a plan on the  preservation needs of Route 66, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   H.R. 66         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Route 66 Centennial       Commission Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Route 66 was the Nation's first all-paved highway under       the U.S. Highway System connecting the Midwest to California       and has played a major role in the history of the United       States.        (2) Route 66 was the symbol of opportunity to hundreds of       thousands of people seeking escape from the Dust Bowl in the       1930s, serving as a ``road to opportunity'' in the West and       providing employment during the Great Depression, as       thousands were put to work on road crews to pave the road.        (3) Route 66 was invaluable in transporting troops,       equipment, and supplies across the country to the West, where       the government established multiple industries and armed       force bases during World War II. Upon the conclusion of the       war in 1945, Route 66 was a key route taken by thousands of       troops as they returned home.        (4) Route 66 symbolized the Nation's positive outlook       during the postwar economic recovery in the 1950s and 1960s,       serving as an icon of free-spirited independence and linking       people across the United States. During this period, the       tourist industry along Route 66 grew tremendously, giving       rise to countless tourist courts, motels, service stations,       garages, and diners.        (5) Since June 27, 1985, when Route 66 was decommissioned       as a Federal highway, the popularity and mythical stature of       Route 66 has grown domestically and internationally, as the       road has experienced a rebirth of interest and support.        (6) The year 2026 will be the centennial anniversary of       Route 66, and a commission should be established to study and       recommend to Congress activities that are fitting and proper       to celebrate that anniversary in a manner that appropriately       honors America's Mother Road.       SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.         There is established a commission to be known as the Route       66 Centennial Commission (referred to in this Act as the       ``Commission'').       SEC. 4. DUTIES.         The Commission shall have the following duties:        (1) To study activities that may be carried out by the       Federal Government to determine whether the activities are       fitting and proper to honor Route 66 on the occasion of its       centennial anniversary, including any of the activities       described under section 8(b)(2)(B).        (2) To recommend to Congress the activities the Commission       considers most fitting and proper to honor Route 66 on such       occasion, to be carried out by the Department of       Transportation and any other entity or entities within the       Federal Government that the Commission considers most       appropriate to carry out such activities.        (3) To plan and host, in cooperation with such partners, a       conference on the U.S. Numbered Highway System, and assist in       the activities of such a conference.       SEC. 5.

SEC. 10. TERMINATION.         The Commission shall terminate not later than June 30,       2027.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 66.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 66. This bill  establishes a Route 66 Centennial Commission to develop and plan a  fitting celebration of the 100th anniversary of America's Mother Road,  as it is called.   U.S. Route 66 was established November 11, 1926. The 2,448-mile  highway originally ran from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles,  California, and passed through Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New  Mexico, and Arizona in between.   A precursor of the interstate system, this route was born out of the  need for greater connectivity in our Nation after the rise of  automobile ownership. Disparate segments of roads and paths were woven  into a cohesive highway that offered Americans unparalleled ease of  mobility.   The historic route has carried Americans of all stripes, from  migrants during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s to curious road trippers  following in the footsteps of Jack Kerouac.   While Route 66 became largely obsolete after completion of the  interstate system, it holds a unique place in our Nation's surface  transportation history. The story of Route 66 serves as an important  reminder as to why our interconnected system of roads is vital and why  we can never devolve to a piecemeal approach to surface transportation  policy.   This bipartisan bill is led by Representative Davis, the ranking  member of the Highways and Transit Subcommittee, and has bipartisan  cosponsorship among Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  members, including Representatives Napolitano and Lipinski, and I am  proud to be a cosponsor as well. I support H.R. 66 and urge my  colleagues join me in passing this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Napolitano), my good friend, who  is a Democratic cosponsor of this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I certainly associate myself with my colleague's  remarks on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I am accustomed to historic places in the District of  Columbia, because I represent the Nation's Capital. But I love the  notion of a historic road, to understand how we built our country.   I particularly think it is appropriate for us to be considering this  bill this year when we have to consider a new transportation bill. As  we consider the movement from east to west, this bill reminds us of how  we got there, and we can't let such historic places--in this case, a  road--just float from our memory. We have to do all we can to keep a  road like Route 66 alive, as we do here in the District of Columbia, to  keep the monuments a part of American history.   I certainly appreciate the opening remarks, as well, of our new  ranking member, Mr. Rodney Davis. Our Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee has been the most bipartisan committee in the entire  Congress, and with Mr. Davis as ranking member of the subcommittee, I  anticipate that it will continue to be.   Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers on my side, so I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
