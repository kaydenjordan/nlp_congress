 Madam Speaker, crisis after crisis after crisis.   We now know that over 2.1 million people have illegally entered this  country this year. That is 1.7 million who have been apprehended, the  highest number ever on record. And 400,000 additional gotaways that the  administration is now owning up to; yet we know nothing about them, we  know nothing about their intent for this country, we know nothing about  what they are doing.   And more fentanyl has been seized by CBP at our southern border to  kill seven times over every single American.   Even as migrant caravans with thousands of migrants march toward our  border, this administration continues to mislead and deny that we have  a crisis.   I am extremely concerned about who is facilitating these caravans and  what organizations are involved in the drug and human trafficking along  the way.   The blame for this crisis falls squarely on the Biden administration  and his open-border policies. Biden has abandoned Texans, and this  administration's blatant disregard and incompetence for border security  is endangering every single American. Let me again say that the  President is abandoning not just Texans, but every American.   This administration needs to get back to work, and I urge the  Democrats to come to the table.                            ____________________
