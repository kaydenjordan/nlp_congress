 Mr. President, in the last 6 years, Democrats have  filibustered 589 bills and nominations--589. That was their right as  the minority at the time. That right has been protected. It was their  right to demand that their voice be heard, but it seems like that was  then; this is now.   Two years ago, when Senator Tim Scott brought a serious policing  reform bill to the Senate floor to debate at a moment of national  debate on supporting law enforcement, Democrats filibustered that bill  and would not allow open debate on that bill.   Just last week--just last week--55 Senators voted for sanctions on  Russia as they surround the borders of Ukraine. Just last week, 55  Senators voted for that, but that wasn't enough, and the voice of the  minority was protected when Democrats blocked sanctions on Russia as  they threatened Ukraine. That was their right to do, but it seems like  that was then; this is now.   This letter in 2017 was sent. Twenty-seven Democratic Senators wrote  a letter to Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer asking that there be no  changes in the legislative filibuster, including this sentence that  they all wrote together:         We are mindful of the unique role the Senate plays in the       legislative process, and we are steadfastly committed to       ensuring that this great American institution continues to       serve as the world's greatest deliberative body. Therefore,       we are asking you to join us in opposing any effort to       curtail the existing rights and prerogatives of Senators to       engage in full, robust, and extended debate, as we consider       legislation before this body and in the future.    That was then; this is now.   Then-Senator Kamala Harris, Chris Coons, Patrick Leahy, Dianne  Feinstein, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Michael  Bennet, Joe Manchin, Angus King, Mark Warner, Bob Casey, Martin  Heinrich, Jeanne Shaheen, Sherrod Brown, Brian Schatz, Maria Cantwell,  Mazie Hirono, Jon Tester, Tom Carper, Maggie Hassan, Tammy Duckworth,  Tim Kaine, Jack Reed, Ed Markey, Debbie Stabenow, Sheldon Whitehouse,  and Bob Menendez all asked me to join them in opposing any effort to  curtail the existing rights and prerogatives of Senators to engage in  full, robust, and extended debate.   I will. I would be glad to join you in that because I believe this  body is a unique body in the world, just like you did in 2017. I don't  know what has changed. Debate is still debate. Difficult issues are  still difficult issues. And when my Democratic colleagues filibustered  almost 600 times in 6 years, it was their right, as it has been for two  centuries.   This is the one place in American Government where the voice of the  minority is heard--the one place. This is the one place where minority  opinions have to come to the forefront.   A discussion about changing the rules of the Senate with simple 51  votes and to be able to shift this to a body, on legislation, where  whoever is ahead on the football game gets to decide the rules for the  rest of the game is not really a set of rules at all, and it will fail  to protect the voice of the minority in America, this unique thing that  we have where even if you lost an election, you know at least your  voice can still be heard and you won't be run over.   A conversation that is happening in this body today to say we are  going to permanently block out the opinions of the minority in America  is a wrong decision, and I will join the 27 Democratic Senators who  asked me 4 years ago to join them in opposing that change because it is  the wrong direction.   I have enjoyed listening to some of the speeches--and I have listened  all day to speeches of my Democratic colleagues--about how broken the  Senate has become and about how it needs to be restored to its status  as the world's greatest deliberative body. I agree.   Senator Manchin, who just spoke before me, made that same challenge  to say: Let's do it. Let's actually engage in debate. Let's solve these  issues. Let's actually work behind the scenes. Let's not talk at each  other through the media; let's actually talk to each other. Let's close  the door and actually get a chance to be able to work through things  and be off the C-SPAN camera for a moment and not do the show. Let's  actually engage in real dialogue. Let's solve the issues.   That is what we are supposed to do. What we are not supposed to do is  to say: You know what, I don't want to do that kind of hard work behind  the scenes. I will just change the rules, blame it on you, and walk  away.   That is not what we are supposed to do as a Senate.   I have been told today that I refuse to stand on the side of  democracy. I  [[Page S317]]  was told by President Biden last week that I either stand with the  Republican Abraham Lincoln or the Democrat Jefferson Davis and I should  make my pick. Well, I would say, for me, personally, as a member of the  party of Lincoln, I probably stand with Abraham Lincoln.    I am concerned that my friends on the other side of the aisle--and I  do have many friends on the other side of the aisle. I am concerned  that somehow they have convinced themselves that when they filibuster,  it is righteous, but when I filibuster, it is evil and that this time  it is different. And somehow with the filibuster, we can change it a  little bit and only be a little bit pregnant, and it will all be fine.   I just don't think it is going to work that way, and I think a  century from now writers will look back on this day and will identify  what started the crack--when the Senate started to say: We no longer  are going to try. We are just going to become the House and run over  the minority, and the voice of the minority in America is no longer  going to count.   I stand on the side of the filibuster, like Senator Schumer did in  2017, when he stood right over there and looked in the eyes of Senator  McConnell and said, ``I hope the Republican leader and I can, in the  coming months, find a way to build a firewall around the legislative  filibuster, which is the most important distinction between the Senate  and the House. Without the 60-vote threshold . . . the Senate becomes a  majoritarian institution like the House, much more subject to the winds  of short-term electoral change. No Senator would like to see that  happen so let's find a way to further protect the 60-vote rule for  legislation.''   I stand with Senator Durbin when he said, ``I can tell you [ending  the legislative filibuster] would be the end of the Senate as it was  originally devised and created going back to our Founding Fathers. We  have to acknowledge our respect for the minority, [and] that is what  the Senate tries to do in its composition and its procedure.''   Listen, we disagree on some elements on this bill, and I have heard  the debate.   I will tell you, I have been outspoken to protect the rights of every  individual to vote in our State. I am proud of the voting laws in my  State. We have early voting. We have no-excuse absentee voting. We  engage people to be able to vote in every community, and we fight very  hard to be able to make sure that every place and every precinct has  the shortest line possible. That has been a big deal for our State for  a long time.   You go back to the 1965 Voting Rights Act and you look across the  South and the States that went under preclearance, my State was not one  of those because in my State, even at that time with Jim Crow laws, we  were protecting the rights of individuals to be able to vote, as it  should be.   But my State is being thrown under the bus currently. My State is  currently being accused by some of my colleagues as being a State that  is on the list of 34 evil States that have passed voter suppression  laws in this past year.   Do you know what my State's guilt is? We passed a law this past year  that said, if you are going to vote absentee by mail, you have to  request it 15 days before the election. We did that because the U.S.  Postal Service asked us to do that because the U.S. Postal Service said  if a ballot is going to be mailed out to somebody and get mailed back  in time and get counted, we need 2 weeks of time to do it, not 7 days.   By the way, my State is on the list of the 34 evil States doing voter  suppression, but the State of New York passed the exact same law, and  somehow, they are not on the evil list. But they also followed the  encouragement of the U.S. Postal Service to give 15 days for the ballot  to go out and to come back.   My fellow colleagues, that is not voter suppression, that is making  sure every vote counts--but somehow my State is on the list.   We do get a little frustrated when we get accused of being racist  when we disagree on some issues in this bill.   We have some disagreements on whether felons, as they walk out,  should be able to vote immediately. That has been State-to-State  decisions. I understand some States do that, some States do not. My  State hasn't voted for folks who are convicted sex offenders and  rapists and murderers, the day they walk out of the prison, to have  their voting rights returned. By the way, some of the folks on the  Democratic side of the aisle, your State has not either. This bill  changes that. Can we have an honest conversation about convicted  rapists walking out of prison and voting the next week, whether that is  something that should be restored right away--by the way, even during  their time of parole?   We have disagreements on voter ID. We have disagreements on same-day  registration. We apparently have disagreements on whether we should  have House candidates for Federal office get to take a salary from  Federal tax dollars while they are running for office and get a 6-to-1  match, where the 6 is the Federal dollars and the 1 is the private  dollars if you are running for the House of Representatives. No, I  don't think I am a racist because I disagree with whether House  candidates should be able to take a salary from Federal tax dollars  while they are running for office and get a 6-to-1 match, but that is  what I am being accused of consistently.   We have a disagreement on automatic registration of voters.  Apparently, there are some other disagreements because, even in the  bill itself, it gives a waiver for people who are illegally present in  the country who ``accidentally'' get registered to vote; that it gives  them some immunity in that process.   We have disagreement on how much control unelected folks are going to  have on redistricting.   We just have disagreements on these things. Can we not have  disagreements and debate these things out and not be called a racist in  the process; that you are joining with Jefferson Davis if you disagree  whether House Members should be paid while they are running for office  out of Federal tax dollars?    I don't think this is about voting rights anymore. I think this has  become about power.   I don't have any doubt that we need to protect the voting rights of  every single individual. That is why I am grateful the 1965 Voting  Rights Act is there. But I want to make sure that we are protecting our  Republic and that we stay engaged in what it takes to actually guard,  day-to-day, how we vote, how we make decisions, and that we admit there  are differences in voting between Alaska, Oklahoma, and New York.   Now, again, we disagree on some things, and there are some things in  this bill that even some of the folks in this room, their own States  don't agree with. The State of New York doesn't allow same-day  registration. In fact, they just voted on that in November and voted it  down. The people of New York said: We don't want to do that.   The State of New York doesn't allow no-excuse absentee ballots. My  State does. We have done that for years. The State of New York doesn't  allow people to bring food and water to people in line. The State of  New York requires people to request an absentee ballot to do it 15 days  before the election, exactly like my State does.   Listen, let's debate the issues. Let's take the time needed to  resolve it, and let's actually resolve it.   We talked a lot about division and things that are hard. If you don't  mind me taking a bit of a detour, there are things that we agree and  disagree on, some of them profoundly. One of them, I want to mention as  well.   You know, this week would have been Betty White's 100th birthday. You  talk about America's sweetheart. I can't find a soul who doesn't like  Betty White. If you find somebody who doesn't like Betty White, will  you let me know who that is because that is one hard heart.   Everyone loves Betty White.   Betty White spent 70-plus years raising money in support of the  Humane Society--overwhelming support, millions of dollars that she  raised for the Humane Society, and there was broad support for puppies  and kittens. So I can just ask the question: Who disagrees with Betty  White, puppies, and kittens? See, we have got common ground already.   But it is interesting to me, and I am astounded at times, how we see  some things so similar and some things so different--hard issues at  times.   Let me give you a Rorschach test. Can I do that? You know a Rorschach  [[Page S318]]  test, the ink blot? Let me give you a Rorschach test.   What do you see in that picture? I see a child when I look at it.  That looks a lot like a baby to me. Now, you may look at it and say,  ``I don't see it. I see a castle or I see clouds,'' but in this  particular Rorschach test, it happens to be a modern sonogram of a  child.   Why do I bring this up? Why do I bring this to the floor today?   It is fascinating to me on the debate today that as a Republican I  can be accused over and over of not caring about the challenges of  voting in America, when I would be willing to ask the question: Does  this child get to vote 18 years from now or does she get disposed of?  What happens to her?   I do believe every life matters, no matter how old or how young, how  small or how big, regardless of race or color or national origin or sex  or ability. All people have inherent value. All people have worth and  all should be protected in America. This is the United States of  America.   And that child matters. Forty-nine years ago, the Roe v. Wade  decision was made. It is coming up this Friday, the 49th anniversary,  actually. That is why I bring it up.   There will be tens of thousands of students out for the March for  Life. It will be an absolutely spectacular and beautiful display of  dignity and value of every single human life.   In 1973, just a few months after that decision was handed down,  Nellie Gray and some other pro-life leaders like the Knights of  Columbus and other groups--they decided that one way they could  continue the national dialogue about children was the March for Life  until Roe v. Wade was overturned. And I am going to march again with  them this year, and it will be freezing cold again this year, like it  usually is in late January.   A lot has changed since 1973. Times have changed the conversation on  abortion. Where it used to focus on cells and tissue and viability, now  science recognizes that babies can feel pain, have a beating heart.  That child already has fingerprints, in fact. By that age right there.  It already has fingerprints.   By conception, that child has DNA that is different than the mom's  and different than the dad's. Every single person in this room was once  in your mom's womb, and the only difference between you now and you  then is time. That is it.   And I will be very blunt, my greatest hope is that, after 49 years,  this will be the last March for Life in a Roe v. Wade America; that  this will return back to the States to be able to make decisions.   In my State, we will step up to this Rorschach test, and we will say,  ``That looks like a baby to me,'' and we will start protecting the  value of every single child.   We have brought bills to this floor that have been filibustered,  bills on conscience protection, just giving the rights of a nurse--of a  nurse--who told her employer, ``I don't want to perform abortions. I  have a conscience issue with that,'' and then was hired, and later, her  hospital said, ``You have to participate in this abortion.''   We have laws in America that protect that. They just have no teeth at  all. So individuals do get forced into performing abortions against  their conscience. We brought that to the floor, but it got  filibustered.   We brought to the floor the protections of children in the womb who  have Down syndrome; that they couldn't be aborted simply because they  have Down syndrome, but guess what. That got filibustered and blocked.   We brought bills to the floor saying that if a child was born alive  in a botched abortion, they had to get medical care, but it got  filibustered and blocked.   By the way, I wish the people in this room had the opportunity to  meet some of the folks whom I have had the opportunity to be able to  meet who are abortion survivors because I hear from people all the  time: That never happens. That never happens. I would like you to meet  some of them who literally survived a botched abortion, that they were  delivered alive and someone in the room took them to the hospital in  their own vehicle, usually, and they survived.   I wish you had the opportunity to be able to sit down with Dr. Alveda  King. The daughter of Dr. King is a great civil rights leader, and,  yes, it is the niece of that Dr. King you are thinking of, who is an  outspoken proponent for life and speaks often of grace to people.   I wish we had the opportunity to be able to talk more about chemical  abortions and what is actually happening in that industry, where people  are literally being mailed drugs from all over the world to be able to  perform abortions at their homes or in their dorm rooms or hotel rooms,  where this child is being delivered into a toilet and flushed; about  how we have a much larger incidence of deaths of moms in chemical  abortions than there is in surgical abortions; and about the statistics  that have been kept, which, by the way, were blocked from being kept  and are other than just deaths. From 2007 to 2017, there were 3,800  what they call adverse events from chemical abortions that had  occurred.   Why do I bring all of this up?   I bring it up because this week, we are going to remember 49 years of  Roe v. Wade, and we are going to start a dialogue in the days ahead  about how States are going to handle life and what that Rorschach test  is. Is that a baby or a tissue? We will have to face that reality.   I bring it up because it is a rare moment for us to have a real,  bipartisan conversation today. As the body knows, it is not often we  all sit in our chairs and actually talk to each other. We typically  talk to each other through the media rather than talk to each other in  here.   I brought it up because the conversation about her has been  filibustered over and over and over and over again, and we don't get to  have a real debate about her. We just move on.   When do we get to have a conversation about her--that is, a real  dialogue--and determine what direction we go as a nation? For her sake,  I hope it is soon because she matters.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.    Mr. President, I thank my friend, through the Chair,  the Senator from Virginia, for the engagement. We will continue to be  able to engage and be able to talk through this.   Part of our challenge on dealing with this dialogue today is none of  our side has actually seen the proposal tonight. It is a secret  proposal that is coming out that all the conversation is that this  restores the talking filibuster.   We are like: Really? What does it say?   Then, in the next, I guess, couple of hours, there is going to be a  proposal pop and say, ``Here it is; we are changing the rules of the  Senate with a 51 vote,'' when we haven't even had the opportunity to  even see it.   So we talk about trying to be able to bring dialogue and debate on  all of these things. That is not dialogue and debate on the rules. That  is trying to ram through a change with a straight 51 that none of us  have even seen.   And as we go through this, you had mentioned before the letter that  is out there. You are correct. I read through the letter. I have  definitely read through the whole letter, but I could have also brought  a bunch of quotes from folks that I see all around the room that make  statements like, ``I will never change the legislative filibuster,''  or, ``I am 100 percent opposed  [[Page S322]]  to changing the legislative filibuster,'' or, ``We should not change  the filibuster using the nuclear option.''   So there were lots of other quotes from lots of other interviews  because, obviously, around 2017, when the letter came out, there was  lots of media that asked point-blank: What do you mean by that?   And so there is a lot of clarification with it. So you are right. I  read the letter, and it has the vague language. But I could have read  lots of quotes that we have that were very, very specific on it.   At the end of the day, if we are going to solve the issues in the  Senate, we are going to have to actually work together to be able to  solve the issues. What makes this the greatest deliberative body is not  that 51 can do what they want. What will make it the greatest  deliberative body is when we have to actually talk to each other.   When I was elected in 2014, most of the phone calls that came to me  personally between November and January were some of you who called me  and said: My name is . . . . We are going to disagree on a lot of  things, but let's start working now on what we will agree on.   If we start doing away with these rules and just move it to a 51  basis, those conversations end and it is not a deliberative body.  Suddenly, it is a ``we can get what we want with 51'' body. That is the  House. That is why we bring it up.   I yield the floor.
