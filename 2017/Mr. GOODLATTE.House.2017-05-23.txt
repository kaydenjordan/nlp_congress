(2) An assessment of obstacles that continue to prevent       Federal prosecutors and Federal courts from ordering       restitution.        (3) An assessment of whether the asset forfeiture       provisions in the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of       2015 and the amendments made by that Act have helped increase       requests to transfer forfeited proceeds for restitution,       including how many requests have been made and how many of       those requests have been approved, and whether United States       Attorneys offices are properly informed about requesting       transfers.        (4) An assessment of how establishing trauma-informed,       victim-centered investigative and prosecutorial procedures       can help improve mandatory restitution orders, including by       encouraging victims of trafficking to cooperate in criminal       cases, equipping victims of trafficking with proper       assistance during criminal proceedings, and helping victims       of trafficking secure mandatory restitution.        (5) The annual number and percentage of Federal cases       related to human trafficking, separating sex trafficking and       labor trafficking, during the period beginning on June 1,       2015, and ending on the date of the enactment of this Act, in       which restitution was ordered, and the amount of restitution       ordered in each case.

SEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS ENCOURAGING STATES TO ADOPT                     PROTECTIONS FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING.         Congress recognizes and applauds the State legislative       bodies that have taken tremendous steps to adopt protections       and services for victims of trafficking. Congress encourages       States to do the following:        (1) Uphold the basic rights and dignity of human       trafficking survivors.        (2) Adopt a survivor-centered approach to addressing human       trafficking that ensures the safety, confidentiality, and       well-being of victims of trafficking, while recognizing       symptoms of trauma and coping mechanisms that may impact       victims' interactions with law enforcement, the justice       system, and service providers.        (3) Implement screening mechanisms for all children       entering child welfare services, the juvenile justice system,       or the criminal justice system to identify child victims of       trafficking and connect them with appropriate services,       including appropriate housing and services from trained       trauma-informed care service providers, and to try to       identify foreign nationals who may be victims of trafficking.        (4) Ensure that child victims of trafficking are provided       with a range of protections, including access to child       welfare services, trauma-informed programming, and the same       legal rights afforded to other children who experience sexual       abuse, rape, or incest, including ensuring that--        (A) criminals who exploit child victims of sex trafficking,       including offenders who purchase, solicit, or obtain a child       for purposes of engaging in a commercial sex act, face       serious penalties and sentences under sex trafficking laws,       and are not given lesser sentences; and        (B) child victims of trafficking are never referred to as       ``child prostitutes'' or ``underage sex workers'' in law or       official documents and proceedings.        (5) Develop a 24-hour emergency response plan to provide       victims trafficking with immediate protection and support       when they are first identified, which may include physically       moving victims of trafficking to a place of safety, attending       to the immediate  [[Page H4486]]       medical and emotional needs of survivors, assessing whether       survivors are under risk for harm, retaliation, or       intimidation, and directly connecting survivors with victim       advocates, housing, and service providers.        (6) Adopt protections for victims of trafficking that       include the right--        (A) to be treated as a victim of crime and afforded       justice, respect, and dignity;        (B) to protection if the victim's safety is at risk or if       there is danger of harm, retaliation, or recapture by the       trafficker;        (C) to comprehensive trauma-informed, long-term, culturally       competent care and healing services oriented toward       emotional, psychological, and family healing;        (D) to evidence-based screening and assessment tools,       treatment plans, and therapy to address traumatic stress and       associated mental health symptoms;        (E) to safe and effective emergency and long-term housing;       education, vocational, and job assistance and training;       mentoring programs; language assistance; drug and substance       abuse services; and legal services;        (F) for child sex trafficking victims to be treated as       children in need of child protective services and to be       served through the child welfare system, where appropriate,       in place of the juvenile justice system;        (G) for all victims of trafficking, including United States       citizens, lawful permanent residents, and foreign nationals,       to be eligible for services;        (H) to have convictions and adjudications related to       prostitution and nonviolent offenses vacated and such records       cleared and expunged if offenses were committed as a direct       result of the victim being trafficked, and protection for       foreign nationals from being removed, being determined to be       inadmissible, or losing any immigration benefit because of       such conviction or arrests;        (I) to the same type of court procedures and legal       protections accessible to victims of sexual assault, rape,       child sexual abuse, or incest, including the right to not be       treated as a criminal; and        (J) to retain all rights regardless of whether the crime       has been reported to law enforcement.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 2473, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2473, the Put Trafficking  Victims First Act of 2017, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Human trafficking has plagued communities and neighborhoods across  America. Victims have endured horrific trauma, violence, and  reoccurring abuse. As a result, there is a tremendous need for expanded  victim services, improved data on the prevalence and trends of human  trafficking, and effective mechanisms to identify and rescue  trafficking victims.   H.R. 2473 takes reasonable steps to increase victim services while  improving upon the tools already available to combat human trafficking.  The bill directs the Attorney General to provide a report on the  effectiveness of State safe harbor laws to ensure these laws are based  upon a survivor-centered approach.   In addition to the report, the bill instructs States to recognize  coping mechanisms and the symptoms of trauma as local law enforcement  interacts with victims of human trafficking.   Furthermore, the legislation provides for increased training and  technical assistance for State and Federal agencies, prosecutors, and  law enforcement on how to take a victim-centered approach to preventing  human trafficking. This provision promotes evidence-based training in  order to improve the physical and mental health services provided to  victims.   The bill's focus on supporting victims continues as H.R. 2473  instructs the National Institute of Justice to establish detailed  methodologies to review the modern trends and detail the prevalence of  human trafficking throughout the United States. The survey will not  only assess how victims of trafficking are accessing services, but, in  addition, help estimate the prevalence of human trafficking in the  United States.   Moreover, H.R. 2473 will provide assistance to trafficking victims  seeking restitution, many of whom still face many obstacles in Federal  court. The bill directs the Attorney General to report on efforts to  increase mandatory restitution for victims by providing Congress with  data involving the number of Federal cases related to human trafficking  in which restitution was ordered, as well as the participation rate of  victims in trafficking criminal proceedings.   Finally, the bill expresses the sense of Congress that States should  implement trauma-informed, victim-centered care for all trafficking  victims.   Mr. Speaker, Congress' intent is clear: Protecting victims from the  heinous crime of human trafficking is of utmost concern. I commend the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner) for introducing this important  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or rejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on       this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 2473 in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,                                                          Chairman.

Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), a member of the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this fine  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H4489]]
