 Madam Speaker, let me start with a few facts.   One: The Leahy Law prohibits the United States from giving military  assistance to foreign security forces that commit gross violations of  human rights.   Two: The State Department determines whether there have been gross  violations of human rights based in part on information from the  Department of Defense.   Three: That process is only as good as the information coming in.  Without that information, we don't cut off funding, and taxpayer  dollars can go to foreign military units that commit rape, murder,  torture, and other gross violations of human rights.   When our servicemembers have information on such abuses, they have an  obligation to report it to their chain of command, but that is not  technically true for Defense Department contractors. That is a problem.  In fact, that is a big problem because contractors are a huge part of  our military presence around the world. They make up more than half of  DOD personnel in Iraq.   At the end of the war in Afghanistan, they outnumbered U.S. troops 17  to 1. And there have been repeated allegations of contractors who  failed to report gross violations of human rights, from sexual abuse of  young boys in Afghanistan to the torture of prisoners in Yemen.   In December 2019, Congress required the Pentagon to update the  relevant policies and regulations. Section 888 of that year's Defense  bill required specific guidance to Defense contractors on reporting  gross violations of human rights.   Section 888 said to the Pentagon very simply: Put this duty to report  human rights violations in your contracts. Include rules about  reporting gross violations of human rights and put them right next to  the rules for accounting, for purchasing equipment, and for  subcontracting.   How has this been working? Not at all.   And why is that?   It is because the Department of Defense has apparently decided it is  better to see no evil and hear no evil when Defense contractors witness  gross violations of human rights.   The requirements in section 888 are currently 469 days overdue.   Madam Speaker, 204 days ago, my colleagues wrote to the Pentagon  asking for an update; 97 days ago, the Pentagon sent a response that is  best described with language that is prohibited on the House floor.   The Pentagon's response provided no updates on time, no procedures  for reporting gross violations of human rights, and provided none of  the other information required under the law that Congress passed. This  is completely unacceptable, and what it suggests is that neither human  rights nor Congressional oversight are priorities for the Department of  Defense.   I urge Secretary Austin and General Milley to find out what is going  on with section 888 of the fiscal year 2020 NDAA and fix whatever  problems within their departments have led to this unacceptable delay.   This week, Secretary Austin and General Milley testified under oath  that we are going to learn the lessons of the war in Afghanistan. The  need for strong, clear procedures for contractors to report gross  violations of human rights is one of those lessons. It should be an  easy one to learn.                                Voting Rights    Ms. PORTER: The right to vote is fundamental. Any threat to any  American at the ballot box is a threat to every American's right to  representative government.    It is the duty of the Federal Government to protect our Nation's  democracy. We need to expand opportunities to vote, especially for  young people, people of color, workers with atypical hours, and people  with disabilities. We need to crack down on gerrymandering so that  voters choose their leaders instead of leaders choosing their voters.  We need to modernize voter registration, reform our broken campaign  finance system, and prevent election subversion.   This is not a partisan issue. Every American, regardless of who they  vote for or whether they even vote, deserves a government that works  for them. And that cannot happen when the bedrock of our democracy, the  right to vote, is undermined.   In the House, I proudly voted for H.R. 1, the For the People Act, and  H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advance Act to safeguard our  democracy. But until the President signs democracy protection into law,  the work is not done. I will keep fighting for our democracy.                            ____________________
