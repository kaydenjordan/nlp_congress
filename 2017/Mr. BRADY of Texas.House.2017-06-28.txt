 Mr. Speaker, on rollcall no. 336, I was  unavoidably detained to cast my vote in time. Had I been present, I  would have voted ``no.''   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote
