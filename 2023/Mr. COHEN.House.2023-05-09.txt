 Mr. Speaker, this weekend, I had the honor of going to  Kyiv, Ukraine, with the chairman of the Helsinki Commission,   Joe  Wilson. I am the ranking member.   Our commission is responsible for the security and cooperation of  governments in Europe. The sovereign country of Ukraine is threatened  in every part of the Helsinki Accords which created our organization.  All violations were committed by Russia, which is a member of the group  but not a participating member in terms of following its precepts.   The Ukrainian people are courageous and show great valor. They have  defeated the Russians in every military aspect that exists except for  airpower. The Russians have the sky.   Our allies and our country must do all we can to get Ukraine  sufficient additional weapons to protect the skies, to protect their  soldiers, to protect democracy, to protect freedom, and to protect the  rule of law in that country and in the rest of Europe because Putin  will not stop at Ukraine.   ``Slava Ukraini.'' ``Glory to Ukraine.''                            ____________________
