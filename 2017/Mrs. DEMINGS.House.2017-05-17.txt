 Mr. Speaker, during National Police Week, it is  important we continue to remember the brave men and women who were  killed while protecting us.   Last year, 145 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of  duty. One of these officers, Lesley Zerebny, 27 years old, was an  officer with the Palm Springs Police Department. She was responding to  a domestic disturbance call when she was gunned down. She was killed  just days after returning from maternity leave and left behind a 4- month-old daughter.   Her fellow officer, Jose Gilbert Vega, was also murdered in the  shooting. A devoted father, Vega was just days away from retiring.   Of the officers killed last year, 10 were State troopers. One of them  was Trooper Timothy Pratt of the New York State Police. Trooper Pratt  was struck by a car as he was on the side of the road assisting a  stopped vehicle. Pratt had 30 years on the job.   Our law enforcement officers don't know what they will encounter when  they respond to any call. We applaud them for the bravery and courage  they display in the face of danger. Mr. Speaker, let us not forget  their sacrifices.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, one of my greatest honors was serving as a  police officer in Orlando for 27 years. My husband is a sheriff in  Orange County, and he has been serving for 35 years in law enforcement.  But today I am here to talk about how we can better take care of our  law enforcement officers as they continue to take care of us.   Our law enforcement officers are called to some of the most horrific  situations and run into harm's way to protect us and our families every  day. Almost a year ago, officers responded to the Pulse nightclub  shooting, known now as the site of the deadliest mass shooting in our  Nation's history: 49 persons lost their lives that night and more were  severely injured.   Imagine the scene as the officers responded. One officer said one  thing he will never forget is hearing the sound of the cellphones  ringing as loved ones called the victims, but, of course, the victims  could not answer.   During the most dangerous and most tragic of circumstances, our law  enforcement officers may appear superhuman, but they are only human,  and responding to scenes like this--or any other horrific scene--no one  can really prepare for that. It is just one example of what our  officers face.   I believe we have a responsibility to our first responders. That is  why I am very proud to cosponsor H.R. 2228, the Law Enforcement Mental  Health and Wellness Act of 2017, with my good friend Susan Brooks from  Indiana. The bill would direct the Departments of Justice, Defense, and  Veterans Affairs, as you have heard, to share best practices that can  help law enforcement officers in tragic situations.   I am so proud to share this legislation with my good friend and urge  other colleagues within Congress to join us to make this vision a  reality. Mr. Speaker, we must do everything we can to protect the men  and women who keep our cities, our towns, and our communities safe.   Again, I thank the sheriff so much for his service, and I thank the  gentleman for helping us to honor the men and women who are so  deserving of this honor.
