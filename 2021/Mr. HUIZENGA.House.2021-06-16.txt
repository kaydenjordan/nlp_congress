 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend, Sheriff  Kim Cole of Mason County in Michigan. He was named Michigan Sheriffs'  Association Sheriff of the Year this past week.   This award recognizes the sheriff who has made outstanding  contributions to law enforcement and the criminal justice profession,  demonstrates exceptional service to their community, and has  contributed to the betterment of the Michigan Sheriffs' Association.   Kim Cole was first elected sheriff in 2012 and is currently serving  in his third term. He started at the Mason County Sheriff's Office as a  reserve deputy, and then was hired by the Mason County Sheriff's Office  as a full-time deputy in 1985. He was then promoted to sergeant in  1993.   What is interesting, Mr. Speaker, is that Cole's great-great  grandfather, Henry Cole, served as one of Mason County's first  sheriffs.   Now, Kim will be the first one to tell you that you are only as good  as the people you surround yourself with, and he is extremely proud of  all of those who he serves with.   Kim leads with integrity, courage, fortitude, and compassion, and has  a passion to serve his community.   Kim Cole, I want to say thank you. Mason County is a better place to  work, live, and raise a family because of you.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am opposed to this bill, and I rise in opposition to H.R. 1187.   Mr. Speaker, today, my Democrat colleagues, once again, are seeking  to hijack our securities laws to push leftwing political and social  agendas, despite dressing it up as investor protection.   Make no mistake, this bill will increase costs on publicly owned  companies, discourage private companies from going public; and,  frankly, could encourage not only private companies to stay private,  but even have and entice public companies to go back to being private  companies.   This is going to result in fewer investment opportunities for  everyday American investors, also known as our constituents, who are  saving for retirement, a college education or simply looking to just  build a better life.   In short, this bill will increase the number of government-directed,  mandatory disclosure requirements on publicly traded companies, which  will increase compliance costs on companies and divert company  resources that could have been used to create more jobs.   Now, to be fair, this is a job-creation bill. However, the only jobs  created by this bill will be for a special tranche of attorneys,  corporate compliance coordinators, and the occasional scientist; not  exactly what an economist would call productive-types of jobs.   Under this bill, public companies would be required to disclose:   Environmental, social, and governance issues, as well as climate  risk. These metrics would be set by the Securities and Exchange  Commission, not Congress;   Descriptions of any expenditure for political activities and  donations to political candidates or trade organizations by executives,  these are duplicative of existing requirements, for example;   The ratio between the pay raise percentage of the company's  executives and the pay raise percentage of the company's median  employee. This is, in some ways, duplicative of the mandatory CEO pay  ratio disclosure that Democrats put into the Dodd-Frank Act, which  itself is an especially useless metric; country-by-country tax and  financial reports from multinational enterprises. This will upend the  current country-by-country tax reporting rules overseen by the IRS.    Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. My friends across the aisle are using  the Federal securities laws to implement their partisan wish list of  social policy priorities. They are doing it through mandatory  disclosure regimes that are, at best, tangentially related to actual  investment decisions.   To be clear, if information presents a material investment risk to a  publicly traded company, the company is--wait for this--already  required to disclose it. That information is out there for those  companies that have material risk.   Materiality has been, and continues to be, the touchstone of our  public company disclosure regime for more than eight decades and has  actually even been affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. It has held the  test of time, and we simply cannot just discard it to appeal to the  Democrats' progressive agenda.   Our capital markets are the best in the world in no small part  because materiality is the basis of our disclosure regime here in the  United States, yet my Democrat friends, apparently, want to throw it  all away for the sake of appealing to leftwing stakeholders.   Additionally, H.R. 1187 will greatly expand the SEC's jurisdiction by  requiring the SEC to promulgate disclosures on environmental, climate  change, political spending, tax reporting, and foreign policy issues,  among others.   This is not the sweet spot for the SEC. It does not have the  experience in any of these issues, and is not the appropriate entity  for determining these metrics or industry standards, nor is the  Securities and Exchange Commission the appropriate entity to review and  enforce such disclosures.   The SEC knows how to regulate materiality. That is their expertise.  They are not climatologists or climate scientists. They are not  election law experts. And they most certainly do not know international  tax law. That is the purview of the EPA, NOAA, the FEC, and the IRS.   Furthermore, smaller public companies will bear the burden of  additional compliance costs. This bill fails to account for the impact  it will have on smaller businesses and companies, especially those who  are looking to go public. Or maybe I should say, were looking to go  public. They certainly do not have the infrastructure or resources to  spend on fixed costs of compliance like this.   H.R. 1187 will result in fewer investment opportunities for American  investors. It will discourage private companies from going public and  encourage public companies to go private to avoid these burdensome new  nonmaterial and useless disclosure requirements.   Sadly, this will hurt the everyday investors, our constituents, that  the Democrats claim they want to help. In other words, this bill stands  to harm everyone saving for retirement, a college education, or just  looking to build a better life.   This is just a bad bill, and I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 1187.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), a leader on this issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), who has been an outstanding voice on these  particular issues.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following  letters, a June 14 letter from the National Association of  Manufacturers, a June 15 letter from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and  a June 16 letter from the American Securities Association, all in  opposition to this bill.                                             National Association of                                                   Manufacturers,                                                       June 14, 2021      House of Representatives,       Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Association       of Manufacturers, I write to express opposition to H.R. 1187,       the Corporate Governance Improvement and Investor Protection       Act.        Manufacturers are taking the lead in innovating solutions       to climate change, ensuring clean air and water, and       enhancing diversity and inclusion--and, importantly, in       providing information about this critical work to their       investors. Public company reporting related to climate change       and other environmental, social, and governance topics should       allow for principles-based disclosure of financially material       information relevant to these efforts. The NAM is concerned       that the ESG Disclosure Simplification Act, the Shareholder       Political Transparency Act, the Greater Accountability in Pay       Act, and the Climate Risk Disclosure Act would impose       disclosure mandates that focus on costly one-size-fits-all       metrics rather than material, decision-useful information for       investors.  [[Page H2838]]         Similarly, the Disclosure of Tax Havens and Offshoring Act       would impose a significant compliance burden--while also       risking exposure of valuable and proprietary data--by       requiring public reporting of country-by-country tax       information by U.S. companies. The United States' support for       Action 13 of the OECD/G20's BEPS country-by-country reporting       initiative was based on the requirement that these reports,       which are exchanged between the IRS and other tax       authorities, would remain confidential.        The NAM is engaging with the Securities and Exchange       Commission as it considers ways to enhance the comparability       of climate and ESG information disclosed by publicly traded       companies. Manufacturers are hopeful that any new climate or       ESG reporting framework will be flexible, principles-based,       and materiality-driven while providing clarity to publicly       traded companies and supporting their efforts to furnish       material information to investors in a comparable manner. We       encourage Congress to provide appropriate oversight of the       SEC's ongoing work without mandating a one-size-fits-all       approach.            Sincerely,                                                   Chris Netram,                                            Vice President, Tax and       Domestic Economic Policy.                                   ____                                         U.S. Chamber of Commerce,                                      Washington, DC, June 15, 2021.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The       U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly opposes H.R. 1187, the       ``Corporate Governance Improvement and Investor Protection       Act.'' While some of the underlying goals of H.R. 1187 are       laudable, the bill would likely result in significant costs       for Main Street investors and it would fail to achieve its       stated objectives. The Chamber will consider including votes       on this legislation in our ``How They Voted'' scorecard.        Over the last several years, the Chamber has worked closely       with stakeholders to promote a corporate disclosure framework       for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. This       framework acknowledges the inherently complex nature of these       issues and allows companies to disclose industry specific       information. We believe this approach would help ensure       investors receive material, decision-useful information while       eliminating the cost of burdensome and impractical mandates.        By contrast, H.R. 1187 would result in an unworkable, one-      size-fits-all disclosure regime for public companies on ESG       issues including climate change, executive compensation, and       pay practices. This misguided approach would impose enormous       compliance costs on public companies. It would be especially       harmful to small issuers and emerging growth companies (EGCs)       without the same compliance resources as large companies.       H.R. 1187 would create yet another barrier to going public in       the United States, thus removing opportunities for retail       investors to build wealth and contribute to the economy.        Pursuant to the Supreme Court's landmark decision on       materiality in 1976 (TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.),       companies today are already required to disclose material       information related to climate change and ESG. H.R. 1187       could veer away from this traditional standard for disclosure       that has served as a centerpiece of America's well-      functioning capital markets for decades. In that decision,       the Court rejected the idea that a fact is material if it       ``might'' be important to an investor, and explained that in       formulating a materiality standard, it sought to avoid a       scenario in which investors would be overwhelmed ``in an       avalanche of trivial information--a result that is hardly       conducive to informed decision making.'' This legislation is       incompatible with Justice Marshall's opinion on materiality--      a standard that is recognized by SEC Chair Gary Gensler.        In addition, the Chamber has supported previous versions of       legislation introduced by Representative Gregory Meeks on       disclosure of corporate board diversity, which have garnered       bipartisan support. The Chamber believes this legislation       should be considered separately. It is regrettable that       Representative Meek's thoughtful legislation has been       included in this flawed H.R. 1187.        The Chamber opposes H.R. 1187, the ``Corporate Governance       Improvement and Investor Protection Act,'' and urges you to       vote against this legislation.            Sincerely,      Jack Howard.                                   ____                                  American Securities Association,                                      Washington, DC, June 16, 2021.      Re H.R. 1187, the Corporate Governance Improvement and           Investor Protection Act of 2021.       Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, and members of the       House of Representatives: The American Securities Association       (ASA) provides this letter regarding H.R. 1187, the       ``Corporate Governance Improvement and Investor Protection       Act of 2021,'' which is scheduled to be considered by the       House of Representatives this week. For multiple reasons set       forth below, ASA must oppose H.R. 1187 and we urge members to       vote against the bill.                              Political Spending         H.R. 1187 includes a section that would force corporations       to disclose their political activities. Moving forward with a       policy intended to stifle protected speech suggests this bill       is less about providing investors with useful information,       and more about silencing political opponents. Enacting       policies to erect barriers for companies to engage in the       political process on policy issues that are fundamental to       their business violates the First Amendment.        The ASA strongly opposes this legislation.        Given that companies are already required to disclose their       political contributions and lobbying activity, we fail to see       what value duplicative regulation in this instance would add.       We also question how the information required by this bill       could possibly meet the test of ``materiality'' when       comparing the actual dollar amounts associated with a public       company's political activities to the total revenue of the       company.        We note that a study found the market's perception of a       company's value based on its stock prices is not related to a       corporation's decision to either engage in or refrain from       corporate political speech. Shareholders of public companies       also seem to understand this as large majorities have       consistently rejected activist shareholder proposals in this       area. In short, the owners of the company do not believe       management's political spending impacts a company's value or       its financial performance. While these facts may be       inconvenient, they should not be dismissed lightly.        As important, this section of the bill seems to run afoul       of the First Amendment because some provisions could have a       chilling effect on free speech. Certain politicians have       already made it clear that this disclosure will be used to       target companies who engage in the political process or       choose to support certain organizations. This would allow the       securities laws to be used as a public relations tool to       silence political opposition. Congress should respect the       First Amendment rights of all Americans and vote this bill       down.          Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity Amendment         The ASA appreciates that Congress will be considering, as       an amendment to H.R. 1187, this bipartisan legislation to       inform investors about the diversity of public company       directors. ASA members have long recognized the benefits of       workforce inclusion and have taken actionable steps to hire       and train individuals of all backgrounds. The boards and       workforce of ASA members reflect this view. We believe the       best way to build a sustainable economy is though inclusion.        While ASA supports the Improving Corporate Governance       Through Diversity Act, in April we recommended a number of       changes to strengthen the bill prior to its markup by the       Financial Services Committee. We continue to believe the       diversity criteria should be expanded to include individuals       of diverse viewpoints and diverse professional/educational       backgrounds. The inclusion of individuals of different       genders, races, ethnicities, viewpoints, and experiences is       necessary to achieve the policy goals Congress rightly seeks       to achieve.        Congress should refrain from adopting policies that would       promote boards composed of a club of individuals whose       experience tracks a certain managerial/educational path or       requires adherence to a particular point of view. Today, more       than ever, public companies need the benefit of hearing from       individuals with different experiences who will question and       engage with executives about the appropriate direction and       decision-making of public companies. Unfortunately, changes       to reflect this important priority have not been made to the       underlying legislation.                        Rep. Hill Amendment--SEC Study         The ASA supports the approach taken by Representative       Hill's amendment, which would require the SEC to study the       inconsistencies and differences between ESG reporting       frameworks prior to mandating new disclosures for public       companies.        To date, the SEC has failed to conduct such a study. As a       result, the Commission has no way to know how current ESG       disclosure practices already inform investors, or what       specific areas could be improved upon to ensure companies       only disclose material information. This study would lead to       a more targeted approach that would mitigate unnecessary       compliance costs and protect investors from unworkable       mandates.                          Mandatory ESG Disclosures         The ASA letter to the Financial Services Committee in April       outlined a number of recommendations and concerns we had with       a series of ESG-related bills that were marked up by the       Committee. Unfortunately, none of those concerns or questions       have been answered.        In that letter, we noted the following:        ESG disclosure mandates would create an unequal and unfair       playing field for American businesses vis-a-vis Chinese       companies;        Businesses would spend an enormous amount of time and       resources reorienting their compliance systems to comply with       ESG mandates at a time when policymakers should want       companies to be focused on hiring to help the American       economy recover;        Company management should be permitted to determine what is       `material' to its business using its own business judgment--      just as management is now permitted to do for other risks       that companies face;  [[Page H2839]]         Judgements about material disclosure can be challenged by       investors or the SEC in court, which provides an important       check that incentivizes companies to provide accurate and       full disclosure. This process is not broken, and we see no       reason to change it in this instance;        The costs of one-size-fits-all disclosure cannot be       justified;        The beneficiaries of a prescriptive one-size-fits-all ESG       disclosure regime would be an entrenched professional class       on Wall Street of well-heeled corporate attorneys, auditors,       mega-asset managers, proxy advisors, index providers,       standard setters and investment banks. This begs the       question: why is Congress using climate change as a reason to       adopt policies that will transfer money from the public       companies owned by America's mom-and-pop investors directly       to the Wall Street-industrial-complex? Retirees, working       families, and those investing for a better future should have       an answer to that question before the bill moves forward;        The bill imposes a significant cost burden on small       companies and undermines capital formation, which is one part       of the SEC's three-part mission. Imposing these costs on       small, emerging growth, and mid-sized companies will only       serve to further entrench the large and mega-cap companies in       our markets who can easily absorb them. We question why       Congress would adopt a policy that tips the scales in favor       of the same companies that many in this body believe are       using their market power to harm consumers and distort our       political economy; and        An unintended loophole will exempt Chinese companies in       indexes from this disclosure. This will unfairly disadvantage       American companies and deprive mom-and-pop investors of       disclosure about Communist China's emission of greenhouse       gases, or whether any CCP-controlled Chinese company is       involved in commission of crimes against humanity and       genocide that Congress.                                  Conclusion         While ASA opposes this bill, we will continue to engage       with members and the SEC to preserve our current disclosure       system which ensures investors are provided with material       information, including information that falls into the bucket       of ESG. H.R. 1187 frustrates this goal, and therefore, we       urge members to oppose it.            Sincerely,                                       Christopher A. Iacovella,                                            Chief Executive Officer,                                   American Securities Association.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Donalds), who is a new Member to this House Chamber and an  outstanding Member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Donalds).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from  The Wall Street Journal dated from 2018, ``California Public Employees  Vote Against Pension-Fund Activism.''               [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 18, 2018]       California Public Employees Vote Against Pension-Fund Activism                            (By Paul S. Atkins)         Playing politics with other people's savings is never       popular.        The California Public Employees' Retirement System this       month said no thank you to pension-fund activism. Government       workers unseated Priya Mathur, the sitting Calpers president.       She was defeated by Jason Perez, a police-union official who       criticized Ms. Mathur's focus on environmental, social and       governance investing, or ESG. Mr. Perez emphasizes the       agency's fiduciary duty to maximize investor returns.        Calpers represents almost two million California public       employees, retirees and families. Yet it mostly makes       headlines for its activism, such as divestiture from the       tobacco industry. ``It's been used more as a political-action       committee than a retirement fund,'' said Mr. Perez. ``I think       the public agency [employees] are just sick of the       shenanigans.''        Americans have always invested to achieve personal goals,       such as saving for a house or their kids' college tuition.       Some find that an ESG or issue-specific approach to investing       accords with their personal philosophies. There is nothing       wrong with people investing their own money however they       like. But Calpers has a fiduciary duty to California public       employees, who rely on it for retirement security.        Hester Peirce, a commissioner of the Securities and       Exchange Commission, recently observed, ``When a pension-fund       manager is making the decision to pursue her moral goals at       the risk of financial return, the manager is putting other       people's retirements at risk.'' The danger for Calpers is       real: In 2016 a consultant found that the fund's       beneficiaries missed up to $3 billion in investment gains       from 2001-14. The reason? A divestiture from tobacco holdings       for political purposes.        All this happens as Calpers remain underfunded. Worse, its       beneficiaries are stuck. They are locked into the system and       cannot vote with their feet.        While Calpers beneficiaries are demanding a renewed focus       on returns, activists continue to work other channels to       impose  [[Page H2840]]       agenda-driven requirements on public companies. Sen.       Elizabeth Warren last month unveiled a bill that would direct       the SEC to mandate that all public companies disclose fossil-      fuel use and greenhouse-gas emissions. This month a petition       signed by 17 law professors and institutional investors,       including Calpers, asked the SEC to develop mandatory rules       for public companies to disclose ESG information.        The petition argues that since there are already so many       requests to the SEC for issue-specific disclosures human-      capital management, climate, tax, human rights, pay ratios by       sex, and political spending--the agency should impose a       broader ESG disclosure framework. The laundry list of       possible disclosures underscores the problem. Requiring       companies to account for an ever-changing list of hard-to-      quantify social issues distracts from disclosure's real,       statutory purpose: giving the reasonable investor material       information he needs to make investing decisions.        These proposals always tout purported benefits to       investors, but mandatory disclosure of additional immaterial       information would be harmful. In a 2013 speech, former SEC       Chairman Mary Jo White decried the ``information overload''       in already bloated annual reports that obscures pertinent       disclosures for investors amid a sea of extraneous       information. She summarized: ``What some investors might want       may not be what reasonable investors need.'' Translation:       More information is not necessarily better information.        Mandating politicized corporate disclosures doesn't align       with the SEC's mission to protect investors and facilitate       capital formation. Instead, it would divert resources away       from business operations and growth. It is simply an attempt       to shame public companies into compliance with activists'       demands.        As Mr. Perez put it, criticizing a proposal to divest from       some gun retailers earlier this year: ``This is nothing more       than a political ploy.'' His push to prioritize performance       over politics clearly resonated with California public       employees; lawmakers and pension-fund managers should take       note.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Rose), and I thank him for his work on the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, could I inquire as to the remaining time  on each side?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Fitzgerald).    Mr. Speaker, just a point of information for the chair  from California: We have one more speaker, and I will be prepared to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Barr).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I  want to make sure we are clear not only with my colleagues but to those  who may be listening and watching today.   Our side of the aisle has a couple of problems with this legislation  today. First and foremost is the structure; next is the content; and  then third, we have to question motivation.   What is the problem with the structure?   My friend from Connecticut talked about an issue that we have a lot  of agreement on, and I say to him: Amen, hallelujah, let's talk about  cybersecurity. Let's talk about how corporations are going to be held  responsible for that.   However, my colleague from Iowa is talking about corporate tax law  and country-by-country tax reporting. Now, that might be a good issue,  but it is the wrong committee. I wondered to myself if Chairman  Dingell, who chaired the Ways and Means Committee for a few decades,  and my colleague from Michigan, would have allowed this committee  mission creep. Actually, I don't wonder. I know exactly what he would  have said: Hell, no. This is in my committee.    This issue is in the wrong committee, and Financial Services is not  the right and proper place to be doing that.   Let's look at the content of these bills. We are not debating  climate, and we are not debating these social issues that need to be  addressed. We are debating who is responsible for enforcing these. We  are not debating the failures and flaws of humans. We are questioning  who should be the enforcer of these regulations and if they are  equipped to do so.   Now, not that long ago, before defunding the police was a popular  item to discuss, the SEC was commonly called on all sides the cop on  the beat. They were the cops on the beat who were the enforcers. They  were the ones who were coming along and saying: We are going to make  sure that there is no fraud as we protect investors; we are going to  make sure that we have efficient markets; and we are going to make sure  that we are building capital.   Here is the problem: They are not prepared and equipped to do so.   Don't take my word for it. Let's look at President Obama's head of  the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mary Jo White, who said: ``When  disclosure gets to be too much or strays from its core purposes, it can  lead to `information overload,' a phenomenon in which ever-increasing  amounts of disclosure make it difficult for investors to focus on the  information that is material and most relevant to their decisionmaking  as investors in our financial markets. To safeguard the benefits of  this `signature mandate,' the SEC needs to maintain the ability to  exercise its own independent judgment and expertise when deciding  whether and how best to impose new disclosure requirements.''   She also said at one point that the Securities and Exchange  Commission was not prepared to do enforcement on areas that they had no  expertise. She was referring to conflict minerals. That was also part  of the Dodd-Frank Act.   So, we have a number of issues that are in this content. Earlier, my  colleague, the chair from California, submitted a letter from CalPERS  in support of this. Earlier, just prior to that, I had submitted an  article from The Wall Street Journal where CalPERS had actually had a  massive regime change--this was in 2018--regarding this pension fund  activism.   At the time, Mr. Perez, who was elected as the president of CalPERS,  said:         CalPERS has been used more as a political action committee       than a retirement fund. I think the public agency employees       are just sick of the shenanigans.    Hester Peirce, a Commissioner with the Securities and Exchange  Commission, recently observed: ``When a pension fund manager is making  the decision to pursue her moral goals at the risk of financial return,  the manager is putting other people's retirements at risk.''   She was referring to the person whom Mr. Perez had beaten in that  election.   The danger is real. In 2016, a consultant found that the CalPERS fund  beneficiaries missed up to $3 billion in investment gains from 2001 to  2014. The reason? A divestiture of tobacco holdings for political  purposes.   I wonder if this might be why some of the motivation for those on the  other side, that they want to cover themselves. They want to make sure  they are not open to the liability of retirees or others with a  fiduciary being held responsible for bad decisionmaking when they use  these amorphous, nondefined issues to make political statements rather  than investment choices.   Madam Speaker, at the end of the day, what we have here is a problem  not just of the issues but of the enforcement. I believe that if we are  asking the ``cop on the beat,'' the Securities and Exchange Commission,  to do a job that is up to the streets and maintenance department, then  no one could expect that they are prepared for that. How can we expect  that they are going to be able to do this?   With that, and including my opening statement where we looked at the  disincentive to make sure there are more investment opportunities for  everyday investors--our constituents--I must remain opposed to H.R.  1187.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendments  en bloc, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, let's be honest. If the original bill wasn't bad  enough, Democrats' en bloc amendments complete the picture. With this  amendment, Democrats are packaging even more non-investment-relevant  social priorities that only serve to feed protesters and dissidents  with information to be used in naming and shaming companies.   I had mentioned earlier that in some of the bills in this package, we  have some potential impossibility of working with each other. There are  others that don't belong in our committee.  [[Page H2851]]  Then there are other bills that don't make sense if we really, truly  are trying to protect investors from fraud and trying to build capital  in our country, which is the directive of the Securities and Exchange  Commission.   Let's look at some of the specific information companies would be  required to disclose under these amendments and how it benefits  everyday investors.   Take the workforce and human capital management disclosure amendment,  for example. How exactly is a company supposed to measure and disclose,  in a comprehensible and comparable manner, ``employee engagement'' and  ``alignment with business strategy''?   Additionally, how does disclosing the company's policies relating to  ``freedom of association and work-life balance initiatives'' help  everyday investors evaluate the risks of investing in that company?   My friends on the other side have been pretty adamantly opposed to  Robinhood, but those who are looking to use Robinhood might actually  like that work-life balance. That is kind of millennial type of  language that is being used in here.   This amendment might as well require companies to disclose their  policy on dogs in the office and whether their canine coworkers are  purebreds or mixed breed types of rescue dogs. This doesn't have  relevance and materiality to investors.   It is also worth highlighting an amendment that requires American  companies to disclose whether the company or an affiliate of the  company directly or indirectly engaged with an entity or the affiliate  of an entity regarding the importation of not only goods from the  Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region but also goods that have materials  originally sourced from the XUAR.   Well, this is a redo from last Congress, and now that Democrats have  one-party control, their motives are clear. The bill requires companies  to show if their affiliates are indirectly engaged with affiliates of  certain companies.   To put it simply, American companies would be required to disclose  unknowable information and face securities fraud charges for any  misstatements or omissions.   Now, let's not have any doubt: This side of the aisle has been  highlighting the Uighur situation for a very long time through bills,  through amendments, through sanctions, advocating those and holding  China and the CCP responsible.   But, again, under this legislation, they will violate the law for  trying to disclose unknowable information.   Why would a company want to go public under that regime? And how does  disclosing such indecipherable information help everyday investors make  more informed investment decisions?   Now, just to make sure my Democrat friends don't twist my words, like  I said, I very much care about the Chinese Communist Party's human  rights abuses. We need to be focused on that. I think many of the  underlying concerns that motivate this legislation and amendment are  important. But the public company disclosure regime is simply the wrong  vehicle for addressing those concerns.   The SEC's mission is to: one, protect investors from fraud; two,  maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and, three, facilitate  capital formation. These packages of bills do not do that, and nothing  in the SEC's mission looks remotely like enforcing foreign policy goals  or labor law.   Mary Jo White had pointed that out regarding the conflict minerals  portion of the Dodd-Frank law. Once again, Democrats are more than  comfortable with shoving the SEC into subject matter areas where they  have zero expertise rather than getting the policy right.   There are real downsides to this approach my colleagues are taking.  Mandatory disclosure increases compliance costs. The more complicated  and technical the information required to be reported in disclosures,  the more specialized the attorneys and compliance experts a company  needs to adhere to a law.   If I need to spell that out for you, that is money that companies  cannot spend on its workforce and investing in their business, in  equipment, and in their wages, or returning money to everyday investors  who have invested in those companies.    Moreover, just to be clear, because my Democrat friends keep talking  about how badly investors want this information, under the disclosure  requirements in these amendments, everyday investors aren't the ones  who benefit. Social activists, as well as compliance professionals-- that is, lawyers and accountants--are the ones who will reap the  biggest reward under these amendments.   We are helping the elite workforce with the bill and these  amendments. Instead of helping investors participate in our capital  markets and helping American workers, these amendments will leave  everyday investors buried in disclosures that are, at most,  tangentially related to investment.   Meanwhile, smaller public companies with shoestring compliance  budgets will have to delay raising wages for workers in order to  reallocate that capital to hiring more lawyers.   At its core, this amendment just heightens the key problem with the  original bill. The additional disclosures will disincentivize private  companies from going public, which will inhibit everyday investors, our  constituents, from participating in our capital markets and will limit  their choices of public companies to invest in.   Let's not eliminate access and opportunities to everyday investors,  especially when rich investors will still have access to investing in  companies that have gone private or stayed private in response to these  amendments.   I think that is one of the things, Madam Speaker, that is getting  lost in this. Those that have will continue to have those options.  Those that are trying to build a future are going to get frozen out  once again.   For that reason, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume to close.   Madam Speaker, this was claimed earlier by one of the authors that  investors wanted this information, I believe was the quote.   Well, I ask the question: If investors want this information, as  claimed, then they can bring a vote to the shareholders to require  these disclosures. Evidence, Madam Speaker, would dictate and show that  precious few of these types of issues have actually been brought to  shareholder meetings, where they are voted on. In the rare times that  they have, even fewer have actually been approved.   So, no, investors don't look at this information. They don't want  this information, and they don't view it as material to the investment  decisions that they are making.   So you have to ask the question, then: Who is requiring or requesting  this information? I suspect it is more about appeasing social  activists. It is not about the workers and it is certainly not about  the investors. This is about making sure that the virtue signaling that  is required in today's corporate world--may I add, for large  corporations, because there are plenty of small and medium-sized, even  publicly traded companies that are bucking this.   But for these large corporations who have massive, massive compliance  departments that are chock-full of attorneys, chock-full of CPAs and  others that are going to work through this, and they are going to hire  their friends in the consulting world to make sure that they are  dotting the I's and crossing the T's, that is who it is really about.   Sadly, unfortunately, who ultimately ends up losing in that equation  is the worker and the investor, our constituents.   Madam Speaker, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment, although I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the goals of this amendment,  and I applaud my colleague from Washington. We should be concerned  about the effects of this bill and ESG reporting on small businesses,  and I would say that this is a step in the right direction.   However, I don't believe this amendment actually goes far enough. The  ranking member of the full committee submitted an amendment to the  Rules Committee that would have exempted small businesses from the  onerous and unnecessary requirements of this bill, and, sadly, that  amendment was not made in order. I think that may have achieved the  same goal in a certainly much more clear manner for the author.   This bill will be particularly burdensome on small businesses that  don't have the resources to pay all the expenses associated with  complying with these disclosures, such as lawyers, accountants, and  other ESG consultants.   I know the chairwoman had mentioned that somehow my statements  earlier and the statements of my colleagues were supportive of large  business and their support of this. It is actually the exact opposite.  I could really care less what the Fortune 50 think about this.   I am concerned about that bottom 50. I am worried about those up-and- coming companies that are going to have those precious resources sucked  into more compliance that, again, does not have relevance or  materiality to investors, nor is it actually requested by investors.   But this bill is a prime example of Wall Street versus Main Street,  and I commend my colleague for fighting for Main Street with this  amendment.   I am prepared to accept this amendment because I hope it will help  small businesses.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to support this amendment, and  I am happy to accept it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
