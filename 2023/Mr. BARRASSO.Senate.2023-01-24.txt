 I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk  about the need for more American energy.   We are approaching the end of January. Winter storms have been  covering the country from Colorado to Connecticut. We are seeing it  everywhere: Temperatures drop. Energy prices go up. In a typical year,  cold actually kills more Americans than extreme heat. This winter,  millions of families are in danger of being left out in the cold  because of the cost of energy. We know that more than 20 million  households in America, right now, have fallen behind on their ability  to pay their energy bills.   Record-high inflation has robbed the American people of more than  $10,000 for each and every family since Joe Biden has become President.  Just look at what people were paying for things before he came into  office and what they are paying today. As a result, people are able to  save less, and they are having to pay more. We know that about two out  of three American households are living paycheck to paycheck. Personal  savings in this country is now at a record low; household debt is at a  record high. People are having to borrow more money and put things on  the credit card at higher and higher interest rates.   At the same time, energy prices are dramatically higher than they  were the day Joe Biden took office. The cost of heating oil is up by  two-thirds. Natural gas is higher now than in a long time. Electricity  is up by 20 cents on the dollar. As a result, there is actually the  risk of people having their energy and their electricity shut off this  winter. Some are doing it voluntarily because they don't want the big  bill that is going to come.   It is hard to believe that it is happening here in the wealthiest  country in the world. We have enough energy to keep every American warm  this winter. Some of it, they won't let us get out of the ground, but  we have it. So it is an absolute disgrace, with the energy resources we  have in this country, that Americans are facing brownouts and blackouts  from an energy standpoint because of the Biden administration's radical  climate policies. Millions and millions of Americans are living with  financial fear and with massive frustration at this administration for  ignoring the needs of the people.   So what are the Democrats doing about it? Nothing. Joe Biden actually  sold some of our emergency Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China. You  wouldn't believe that; yet it happened. Our petroleum reserve is for  America. It is for emergencies. It is for natural disasters. It is for  war. It is not for China.   This week, I am introducing legislation to make sure this never  happens again. The House has already passed this legislation. The vote  was completely bipartisan, more than 100 Democrats voted for it in the  House. There is no reason it shouldn't be bipartisan here in the Senate  as well.   So I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in this  effort. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is for us. It is not for our  enemies.   Joe Biden has promised to use our tax dollars--I mean, it is  astonishing. He went to the United Nations and said he was going to  give $11 billion a year to the United Nations for climate reparations-- for energy we have used--giving away American dollars when Americans  can't afford to pay for energy costs here at home. Why is he doing it?  If you listen to his speech, it is because he wants to say he is sorry.  That is what we have, a President who wants to apologize once again for  America. He wants us to feel guilty about the fact that we have built  the strongest economy in the world by  [[Page S76]]  using oil, gas, coal--all of the energy resources that we have in this  country.   The American people have nothing to apologize for. Joe Biden is  wrong. We shouldn't apologize for being an energy superpower. We  shouldn't apologize for using our energy resources. If he wants to  apologize, he ought to be apologizing to the people of the United  States for the policies he has put in place that have driven up costs  and caused pain for families all across America. He should apologize  for raising taxes on American energy. He should apologize for wasting  tax dollars.   The Secretary of Energy--his Secretary of Energy--has given more than  $200 million in loans to companies in China. The Secretary of the  Treasury is going to China soon. She met with China's Vice Premier  recently in Switzerland. According to the Treasury Department, she  agreed to ``enhance cooperation [with China] on climate finance . . .  as well as support for . . . developing countries in their clean energy  transitions''--in other words, more American taxpayer dollars for other  people in other countries.   Again, the excuse for all of this is climate.   The Democrats in Washington are utterly obsessed with the green  dreams of the coastal elites who run the Democratic Party, who call the  tune. Again and again, the Democrats side with the climate elites over  the common folks. I hear it in Wyoming. I hear it no matter where I  travel in the country. The Democrats are offering working families  nothing more than higher taxes and higher prices, and they continue to  raise taxes.   The Democrats just threatened to ban natural gas stoves. Nearly half  of the homes in America use natural gas. This is the administration--a  nominee by the President. That is what he said. He didn't say it once.  He said it repeatedly. The Democrats also just raised taxes on coal by  more than $1 billion.   So what happens with all of these new taxes? They get handed down to  working families in Wyoming and across America. What happens with  higher taxes? It means higher prices and higher energy costs.   Janet Yellen is flying around the world and offering more of our tax  dollars to these other countries. Last week, there was a large Democrat  political rally held in Switzerland, at a place called Davos. The  masters of the universe flew to Switzerland for the World Economic  Forum.   From the television reports and the news reports, much of the  conversation was about climate. The President's energy/climate czar,  John Kerry, was there. He gave a speech. You talk about somebody with  smug superiority; he just thinks he knows better than anybody else.   Here is what he said. This is from John Kerry:         It's extraordinary that we, a select group of human beings       . . . are able to talk about saving the planet.    Thank you, John Kerry. You are going to save us all. I can hardly  wait.   He added:         If you say that to most people, they think you're just a       crazy, tree-hugging, lefty, liberal do-gooder . . . but       that's where we are.    Well, John Kerry, you are right. Most people--certainly, anybody in  Wyoming--who would listen to you would say you are just a crazy, tree- hugging, lefty, liberal do-gooder. That is who we have got from the  President of the United States doing his climate bidding in  Switzerland. This is exactly what people think about John Kerry and the  climate crisis and the positions of this administration.   As if one failed Presidential nominee and candidate weren't  embarrassing enough, then we had a real Vice President who came to  speak, a former Vice President named Al Gore. Anyone watching Al Gore  speak would say that, basically, he descended into an unhinged rant.  About what? Well, climate of course. That is all he ever rants about.  The former Democrat Senator and Vice President said we are ``boiling  the oceans.'' That is what we are doing, apparently, he said, if we  don't obey his energy policies. Well, I am sure he and John Kerry have  great times together. ``Boiling the oceans.'' He even said we are  creating what he called ``rain bombs.''   He wants to save the planet as well, and I would say: What planet is  he on? That is what we are seeing coming out of this administration as  their voice on the world stage.   When it comes to energy, what are the Democrats offering? A  fairytale, a fantasy, and a fraud. That is what we hear from the  Democrats. The Democrats' green dreams are causing nightmares for  working families, who have to pay for all of this. The only green thing  about the Democrats' energy agenda is how much green it costs American  families.   John Kerry said it himself. He said:         How do we get there?    And he said:         Money, money, money.    That is his answer--American money, American dollars--and he is going  to save the planet.   Europe has already tried its own Green New Deal. It has been a  disaster for the working people of those countries. We can't let that  happen here. We just cannot.   The International Energy Agency projects a record high demand for oil  later this year. This is at a time when Joe Biden is making us keep it  in the ground. Wyoming is the energy breadbasket of the Nation. We have  it. It is affordable. It is available. It is reliable. That is not good  enough for Joe Biden. No. He wants to go to Iran, go to Venezuela, go  to Saudi Arabia, with hat in hand, and beg them to produce more and  send it here. It is interesting listening to the climate elites as they  are fixated on renewable energy regardless of the costs and regardless  of the consequences.   The Democrats need to stop this science fiction. It is long past time  for America to unleash our energy and stop this foolishness coming from  the administration that has us buying energy from our enemies instead  of selling it to our friends. We have an abundance of American energy,  and the Democrats want to keep it buried in the ground. For every  American family who is struggling to make ends meet and is falling  further behind because of the inflation caused by the Democrats'  spending, it is time to unleash American energy right now.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Rubio):   S. 41.
