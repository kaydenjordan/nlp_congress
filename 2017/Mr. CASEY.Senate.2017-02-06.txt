 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I rise to speak this afternoon about the  nomination of Betsy DeVos to be Secretary of Education. I know we will  have had some time later today and even tonight, but I wanted to review  some of the concerns I have about her nomination in the allotted time  that I will have--I guess about 15 minutes.   The first concern I have is a broad concern that I think is shared by  a number of Senators on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee. The ranking member, Senator Murray, is here with us on the  floor, and I am grateful for her leadership on this nomination debate,  as well as many other issues.   I guess the broad concern I have is Betsy DeVos's commitment to  public education. I come from a State where we have had a tradition of  public education since about the 1830s. I am fairly certain--I will  stand corrected--but Pennsylvania might have been the first State to  have public education as far back as the 1830s. It is part of the  bedrock of the foundation of our State.   Still, today, 92 percent of Pennsylvania students attend a  traditional public school. We have charter schools. We have roughly 175  or so, but all of those charter schools in Pennsylvania have to be, by  statute, public nonprofit entities. Public charter schools are what we  have in Pennsylvania. We don't have for-profit private sector charter  schools. It is not allowed by law.   There are some limited circumstances when one entity could affiliate  with a for-profit entity, but we have nothing like what Mrs. DeVos has  supported in Michigan and across the country. For a Senator from  Pennsylvania to be questioning a nominee for Secretary of Education  about for-profit charter schools is unusual because we don't have that  entity in Pennsylvania.   My concern is substantial--and I will develop this later--about her  commitment to public education. In fact, in my meeting with Mrs. DeVos,  because of my concerns, I said something very simple, but I said it for  a reason, to remind her about her obligation if she were to be  confirmed. I said: You will not be the Secretary of private education;  you are going to be the Secretary of Education, and for most of the  country, that means traditional public schools, and I hope you  understand that.   That is a broad concern that I have, and I will talk more about it.  My line of questioning the day of our hearing--I should say the evening  of our hearing--focused on campus sexual assault; and that, of course,  is an area of urgent concern for a lot of people here, a lot of members  of the United States. It is also of greater concern now because of her  nomination. What do I mean by that?   Let me walk through how I got to my questions with her. We know the  Department of Justice tells us that college women are twice as likely  to be sexually assaulted than robbed in the time they are in college.  This is a number that comes from the Centers for Disease Control. We  also know that one in five college students experience attempted or  completed sexual assault while they are in college.   This is a direct threat to young women all across the country, and I  think we have only begun as a country--as a nation, I should say--to  begin to take steps to combat sexual assault, to insist that colleges  and universities do more to insist that everyone in the education  field, every person on a college campus assumes some level of  responsibility.   One of the reasons we can start down that path and begin to be  certain that we are at least beginning to wrestle with this problem and  give young women on our campuses more protection is because of recent  legislation. We are not done. We have a lot more to do, but I will  highlight one bill that I led the fight on--the Campus Sexual Violence  Elimination Act, known as Campus SaVE. That became law in 2013, when we  were reauthorizing--a fancy Washington word for doing it again or  improving the law--the Violence Against Women Act. I was glad we were  able to take a substantial step to tackle this horrific problem of  sexual assault on campus.   That legislation was followed by regulations. If I could summarize  them, that law and the regulations that followed made sure that  colleges and universities have clear guidelines, that victims know what  their rights are, that victims know where to turn in the event of an  assault, that we do a lot more on prevention, that bystanders can no  longer be inactive, that they have to be trained and prepared to help,  and that the entire college campus is focused on preventing sexual  assault and then making sure, in the aftermath of an assault, it is  dealt with appropriately.   This legislation has helped campus communities respond to not only  sexual assault but domestic assault, dating violence, as well as  stalking. It does give students and employees the opportunity to do  more than has been done on college campuses.   When I was questioning Mrs. DeVos, I asked her if she would commit to  upholding title IX, the nondiscrimination statute that includes  important protections against sexual assault. I asked her very  specifically about the Department of Education's Office for Civil  Rights, which had issued guidance in 2011 that advises institutions of  higher education to use the so-called preponderance of the evidence  standard for campus conduct proceedings. Some may be familiar with that  standard. It is a standard that we have used in our jurisprudence for  civil cases across the country. You don't have to prove, nor should a  victim of sexual assault on campus have to prove by the higher  standard; say clear and convincing is a higher standard or beyond a  reasonable doubt is a criminal standard. What the Department of  Education said to the university campuses across the country is, the  standard you should use is preponderance of the evidence. They based  that determination after consulting with experts and advocates  [[Page S692]]  across the country. That is the state of law currently, the guidance  from the Department of Education about that evidentiary standard, my  legislation Campus SaVE, and that is where we are now.    I simply asked Mrs. DeVos whether or not she would commit to  enforcing current law and abiding by the 2011 Department of Education  guidance. Her response was that it would be premature--I am using her  word ``premature''--to make that kind of commitment. I was stunned by  that answer. Why would it be premature to say you are going to enforce  current law? Why would it be premature to say that you can't make a  commitment to insisting upon an evidentiary standard that is in place  right now? That made no sense to me, and I don't think it made any  sense to people across the country who have been working on this  problem and trying to get the attention of the Senate and the House and  any administration for years, if not for decades.   We finally arrived at a place where we are at long last dealing with  sexual assault in a very aggressive and appropriate and fair manner.  Now we have a nominee who says she is not sure whether she can commit  to that. That gave me great pause and is one of the reasons I don't  support her nomination. I have several reasons. I know I am running low  on time, but I will wrap up this portion in a moment.   Another area of concern is the answers to questions she gave with  regard to specific questions about students with disabilities. This was  a set of questions asked by a number of Senators, but I will try to  summarize it this way. She seemed to have a lack of knowledge, an  apparent and I think obvious lack of knowledge, about basic Federal  law, a law that was passed decades ago, the Individuals with  Disabilities Education Act. She didn't seem to know that was a Federal  statute. She seemed to assert that somehow States could decide whether  to enforce the policy that undergirded that Federal law. That, of  course, is not the case. It is Federal law, and we have to make sure  individuals--in this case, students with disabilities--get the rights  they are accorded by virtue of that law. Her lack of knowledge in this  area was of concern, but maybe even greater concern was a lack of--or  seeming lack of, in my judgment--determination to once again enforce  this law, to make sure that on her watch the law that would protect  students with disabilities would be enforced to the full extent of the  law and nothing less. She didn't seem to be willing to commit to that  or didn't seem to have the kind of commitment I would expect from a  Secretary of Education.   What we would all expect, Democrats and Republicans, I would hope, is  a Secretary of Education who is a champion for public schools, is a  champion for those children in public schools, will fight battles and  urge States to make the investments in public education, would urge the  Congress to make investments in public education, in early learning,  and all of the concerns we have about lack of funding in public  education.   I would hope both parties would want a Secretary of Education who is  a champion for students with disabilities, who would be a champion for  those who are victims of sexual assault on our college campuses.  Unfortunately, because of a series of questions posed both at the  hearing and in written questions that were submitted for the record--to  which Mrs. DeVos gave written answers--I see that basic commitment  lacking. For that and many reasons which we will develop a little later  tonight, I will be voting no on her confirmation vote.   I appreciate this opportunity to share some of my thoughts and hope  to be back later this evening.   I yield the floor.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I rise this now-early morning, on a new  day, to talk about this nomination, which has been the subject of so  much debate, so much contention and, I believe, so much concern across  the country and in my home State of Pennsylvania.   I spoke earlier today of some of the basic history of my State that  principally involves public education. In the 1830s--the early 1830s,  to be exact--a debate started in Pennsylvania about public education,  the culmination of which led to the enactment under State law of the  Free School Act in 1834 in Pennsylvania. We have had a bedrock  foundation of free public education all these generations. It is part  of who we are as a State.   In our Commonwealth, even today with all of the changes in education  and all of the change in policy over time, we are still a State where  92 percent of our schoolchildren are educated in public schools. That  is the State we are. We don't have any for-profit charter schools, and  that has been the subject of debate in this nomination.   We have, by law, public nonprofit entities as charter schools. It is  a significant point of difference between what is law in Pennsylvania  and what is part of our education traditions and what the nominee has  stood for in her time as a private citizen. We will get to that a  little bit later.   I wanted to start tonight with a basic assessment, and then I will go  through a series of issues. The basic assessment and determination that  I have made is that I should vote against the nomination of Betsy DeVos  to be the next U.S. Secretary of Education. The principle reason for  that is her views on public education--what I believe to be a lack of  total commitment to public education and what that would mean for the  country.   I have heard from people across my State--urban and rural, suburban,  Democrats, Republicans, all kinds of people--who have spoken with one  voice against this nomination. That is one of the factors that I have  to consider when making a decision, but even I could not have imagined  the scope of that response from people across Pennsylvania.   I know we still have a number of hours left before the vote, but, to  date, if you count all of the contacts that have been made with my  office--or I should say offices in Pennsylvania and here in  Washington--it is over 100,000 contacts, whether made by telephone or  email or by letter or otherwise.   I have been in the U.S. Senate for more than 10 years now. This is my  11th year. No nomination has even approached that number of contacts  from individuals who felt that they had to speak up and speak out,  literally, in the context of a nomination.   I wanted to start with one particular issue and develop it rather  fully; that is, the issue of sexual assault on our campuses. This is  the line of questioning that I pursued with Mrs. DeVos when she came  before the HELP Committee--the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee--just a couple of days ago.   I want to start with the stark reality of sexual assault on college  and university campuses across the country. Here is what the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention tell us: One in five women on  college campuses experience attempted or completed sexual assault--one  in five. That is an abomination. That is a stain on our country. That  is something we should not allow to continue.   In the last couple of years, we have just begun to tackle that  horrific problem, that insult, that outrage for young women and their  families all across the country. We passed legislation that I will talk  about in a moment, but this is a matter, I believe, of basic justice.   Hundreds of years ago, St. Augustine said: ``Without justice, what  are kingdoms but great bands of robbers?'' If we don't get serious  about this problem--the problem of sexual assault and what happens to  young women on our college campuses--we are robbing them of basic  justice. We are robbing them of an opportunity to get a higher  education.   In many instances, because of that assault, that young woman's life  is destroyed or largely compromised or harmed in some fashion.  Sometimes she cannot finish her higher education, so she is robbed of  that opportunity because the rest of us didn't do enough to prevent  that assault.   When we remember those words of Augustine about a basic definition of  justice, we should remember and decide whether we are doing enough to  prevent her from being robbed of her dignity, robbed of her safety,  robbed of the ability to move forward with public education, and, of  course, robbed from her basic pursuit of happiness as a young person on  a college campus who should have a reasonable expectation of safety and  security.   Too often, the college or the university has failed her. Often--too  often, I should say--our society has failed her. This is a serious  issue. As I said, some young women never recover, and others struggle  for the rest of their lives.   Let me say this about the young men who engage in this kind of  conduct: Any young man who engages in this kind of conduct on a college  campus is a coward, and we should call them on it. They are cowards.  They should be brought to justice--swift and certain justice--when they  engage in this kind of a crime. It is happening too often on our  college campuses.  [[Page S764]]    As we seek to hold these young men fully accountable for sexual  assault on college campuses, we better have a Secretary of Education  who is fully committed--fully committed--to making sure that we are  holding these students accountable. That is the least we can expect  from a Secretary of Education and from a President and an executive  branch and a Congress of both parties and both Houses that are  committed to protecting young women on our campuses.   What have we done about it? First of all, we haven't done enough.  That is the basic foundation of what I will say, but we have made some  progress the last couple of years. I introduced legislation a couple of  years ago, the Campus SaVE Act, known more fully as the Campus Sexual  Violence Elimination Act. That became law in 2013 as part of the  reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.   As the process works around here, you pass a law in 2013 and the  regulatory process starts. The regulations didn't go into effect until  the summer of 2015. We are into our second college school year of those  regulations being part of our law.   Here is what they do, and I will summarize my legislation in short  order. Basically, what Campus SaVE does is two or three things: One is  make sure that we are taking steps--and colleges and universities are  required to take steps pursuant to this law--to bring about strategies  of prevention so that we are doing everything we can on that campus to  prevent these kinds of assaults.   Second, we want to make sure that more and more students and faculty  and administration are aware of the problem. It is everyone's problem.  It is not just the problem of that victim, not just the problem for  young women. It is everybody's problem. If you are a young man on the  campus, you can't just be a bystander. You have to be a bystander who  does something about this problem. If you are in the college  administration or otherwise, you have to be part of the solution.   We passed legislation, got the regulations in effect, and now  colleges and universities have to abide by them. This act is now  helping improve how campus communities at large respond to sexual  assault, to domestic violence in those circumstances, to dating  violence. That is a third category.   The fourth category is stalking.   All of those circumstances are covered. All of that behavior by a  college student is covered. We want to make sure that institutions have  clearly defined policies, and they let the victim know way ahead of  time that she has not just rights but she also has opportunities to  pursue justice in more ways than one. She can leave that campus and  seek the help of local law enforcement if she wants to.   She has to be informed of her right to do that. If she wants to go to  a court and seek a protective order, not only must the college tell her  about that right, but the college or university has to help her do it.  Also, of course, there are the procedures for conducting hearings in a  fair and appropriate manner.   We have a long way to go to hold perpetrators accountable. There is  still more work to do on that. Too many young men over many generations  have been protected in one way or another. Some institution, some  individual on the campus or off the campus has protected them and swept  these issues and these crimes under the rug.   We are going to continue to work on this issue, but that leads me to  the nominee for Secretary of Education. I asked Betsy DeVos in the  hearing if she would commit to upholding title IX, which is a  nondiscrimination statute that includes important protections against  sexual assault. Specifically, I asked her to uphold the guidance from  2011 of the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, which  advises institutions of higher education to use the preponderance of  the evidence standard for campus conduct proceedings.   Some people know the difference between one level of evidentiary  standards versus others. They made a determination that preponderance  of the evidence was the right standard. I asked her a very specific  question as to whether she would uphold that basic evidentiary  standard, and she said it was ``premature to make such a commitment.''   I also asked her whether she would enforce the law as it relates to  sexual assault, and she didn't seem to believe that she had to answer  that question in a manner that would be give us confidence that she  would uphold the law.   To say that it is premature to answer questions like that, instead of  saying ``Yes, it is my duty as Secretary of Education to uphold the  law, to enforce the law, to hold perpetrators accountable, to protect  victims''--if she had said that, and then said ``Well, but I will have  to review some of these policies,'' that would be different. She just  said that it was premature to make a commitment.   She has a duty--not a duty that she can escape if she were to be  Secretary of Education--to uphold the law to protect victims. I believe  that the Secretary of Education not only must comply with the law, but  the Secretary of Education as it relates to those victims on college  campuses or potential victims has to be, in my judgment, not just an  advocate but an unyielding advocate, a determined advocate, a champion  for those students to substantially reduce the likelihood that we are  going to continue to see one in five women being victims of sexual  assault on our college campuses.   To say that her answer alarmed both survivors and the great advocates  who have been in the trenches helping those survivors for years is an  understatement. I will just read two reactions.   One survivor, Jess Davidson, wrote an open letter to Mrs. DeVos as  part of a ``Dear Betsy'' campaign. She said:         I haven't always felt that I had the space or safety to       tell my story and stand up for survivors. However, I was       lucky enough to attend college under a government       administration that fought for survivors of sexual assault.        It was only because committed government leaders believed       that it was important to uphold Title IX and address campus       sexual violence that I was able to overcome what happened to       me.    Later in her letter, Jess Davidson said:         Ms. DeVos, certainly my education, if not my life, was       saved by committed leaders standing up and fighting for the       rights of survivors of sexual assault. So today I am writing       you to ask, that if confirmed, you do the same.    Jess goes on from there. She says:         Because if survivors do not feel their government is       fighting for them, they won't speak up. I almost didn't.    That is one survivor telling us how difficult it was for her to speak  out or to speak up about this issue because of the pain and the horror  that she lived through. Mrs. DeVos may not have to answer my questions  fully, as much as I pursue an answer, but she does have to answer the  questions of those survivors like Jess and so many others because if  she is confirmed as Secretary of Education, she is not some independent  operator. She is a servant of the people. The people are her boss. Jess  is her boss. If she is confirmed, she better understand that she is a  public servant. The private sector would be in the rear-view mirror.  You can't treat people the way that she might have treated people up to  this point in time.   She is a servant of the people if she is confirmed, and she better  have an answer for Jess every day that she is on the job if she is  confirmed.   Another survivor, Sofie, works for an organization called End Rape on  Campus. She wrote:         Our country has finally begun to shatter the silence on       sexual violence, and survivors nationwide are refusing to go       back to how things were before. Students, parents, and       survivors nationwide deserve to know whether Betsy DeVos is       truly committed to keeping all students safe in school.       Betsy, we are counting on you.    Betsy DeVos, if she is confirmed as Secretary of Education, has to  answer those questions that Jess posed, that Sofie posed, and so many  others. She may try to avoid questions posed to her by Senators or by  the media, but she has a sacred duty that she cannot escape to give  answers to these survivors and to the advocates who so bravely support  them day in and day out, year in and year out. It is about time the  Congress of the United States did a lot more to support these victims  as well.   Maintaining protections for victims of campus sexual assault is not  part of some negotiation. This has to be mandatory work that we do  together. In reference to her answer to my question  [[Page S765]]  about it being premature to commit to enforcing a law on sexual assault  and fully embracing the guidance that the Department put forth in  2011--and by the way, the same guidance put forth in the Bush  administration--if she is going to change that guidance on the  evidentiary standard, thereby making it harder for victims and better  for the perpetrator, by the way, when you raise the standard of  evidence, she better have a good explanation for that.   She will have to have a good explanation for the victims and the  survivors as to why she changed a policy that has been in place for two  administrations, not just one, two--a Republican administration and a  Democratic administration.   I would apply the same test to the entire administration. Now the  Trump administration has an obligation, as well, not just Mrs. DeVos if  she were to be confirmed. They must commit as an administration to keep  strong campus sexual assault protections in place and not go back to  the dark days when this scourge was not a priority--not a priority here  in Washington and not a priority on college and university campuses  across the country.   If they want to fight on this, I am ready to fight for a long time  against anyone who is going to try to weaken these protections. We are  not going to allow this administration or any Secretary of Education to  turn back the clock and allow young men to continue to prey upon young  women with impunity and without consequence as they often have been  able to do over the years.   Let me move to a second issue--students with disabilities. It is  often overlooked in our debates about education. We have debates about  funding, debates about philosophy, debates about who has the best idea,  and sometimes we forget students with disabilities, who have a right  under Federal law to have the opportunity for a full education, an  appropriate education. Ensuring that all students receive high-quality  education is absolutely critical, and it is something that is  particularly important for students with disabilities and their  families.   In my judgment, Mrs. DeVos displayed a total lack of knowledge  regarding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. That is a  1975 law. The so-called IDEA is four decades old, and its predecessor  was the so-entitled Education for All Handicapped Children Act, the old  version of it many years ago. Together they have been the bedrock civil  rights and education laws that guarantee that students with  disabilities receive the same educational opportunities as their peers  who do not have a disability.   According to the Department of Education, prior to 1975--prior to  IDEA--U.S. schools educated only one in five children with disabilities  and many States have laws excluding students, including those who are  deaf, blind, and emotionally disturbed or intellectually impaired.   Since the passage 40 years ago of IDEA, the vast majority of children  with disabilities are now educated in public schools with their peers.  We know that high school graduation rates are higher today than they  have ever been. Students with disabilities are going on to higher  education in greater numbers.   In the last two decades, reading and math scores on the National  Assessment of Educational Progress have increased substantially. We  have seen this from the beginnings of the debate in Pennsylvania. Way  back in 1971, the PARC vs. Pennsylvania case--PARC standing for the  acronym P-A-R-C, one of the cases that helped establish the right of  all children to have an appropriate public education. We know that in  the hearing, Senator Kaine from Virginia asked Mrs. DeVos whether all  schools that have received Federal funding should have to meet the  requirements of IDEA. She said: ``I think that's a matter that is best  left to the States.''   That is obviously the wrong answer when you are talking about a  Federal statute. States don't have an option of not complying with  Federal law. Given the opportunity to clarify her answer, Mrs. DeVos  continued to insist that States should be able to determine whether  they provide services to students with disabilities.   Let me say it plainly. That is dead wrong. That is unambiguously,  definitively wrong. States can't decide not to comply with the IDEA-- the law that 4 years ago enshrined that basic right for students with  disabilities to get an appropriate education. I hope by now, on the eve  of her confirmation vote, that she has done some studying and learned  that IDEA is the law of the land. If she wants to change it, she better  line up votes in the House and the Senate to overturn the law that made  sure that students with disabilities have those basic guarantees.   Once again, the best words are from people who write to us and  contact us about these issues.   Kristin, who is from Southeastern Pennsylvania, wrote the following  with regard to her son:         Being parents of a high-functioning autistic child, we       value and cherish our public school system. In fact, our       public school experience has been life changing for our son.       He's getting a great education, and has made remarkable       strides. He not only benefits from the resources, caring       attention provided by teachers, administrators, assistants       and school staff and an Individualized Education Plan--      accommodations afforded by IDEA that private schools can       simply ignore, and charter schools do a poor job of meeting--      but he has also had the opportunity to meet all sorts of       kids. I am proud and thrilled that his small group of friends       include kids whose parents were born in other countries or       who practice other religions. This is the benefit of a       quality, well-funded, public school education; an informed       citizenry and an introduction to the cultures and       perspectives beyond our own neighborhoods.    No one has said it better, in my judgment, than Kristin, about the  value of public education; the value of that public school to her son  who has autism, but he is a high-functioning autistic child. The vistas  of opportunities for learning that have been opened to that child  because of that school and because of the IDEA that helps that child  with a disability--any kind of disability--to get an appropriate  education under our system--and a lot of that started way back in the  1830s in Pennsylvania when the Free Schools Act was passed.   So, again, I say very directly to Mrs. DeVos as a nominee and if she  is confirmed as the Secretary of Education, that Mrs. DeVos must  guarantee Kristin and her son that she will support public schools and  children with disabilities without exceptions, not with equivocation,  not with some bizarre, erroneous argument about what States might want  to do but full commitment, full compliance with the IDEA, full  compliance with the law as it relates to any child with a disability.  She has an obligation once she takes the oath of office, a sworn duty  as a servant of taxpayers, as a servant of those parents like Kristin,  to make sure she meets Kristin's expectations, not the expectations of  a President and not the expectations of insiders here in Washington.  She has to answer to the expectations of Kristin and taxpayers like her  and her son. So she has a heavy burden of proof based upon her  testimony to date.   Mr. President, I am going to move to another topic, a topic that has  been the subject of much attention lately, but frankly not enough  attention over many years. It is an issue that affects all kinds of  children in our schools at various ages and at various circumstances. I  am talking about bullying, something that sometimes people in my  generation somehow conclude has always been a problem and is just a  continuing problem from one generation to the next. They are wrong on  the facts. It is a much worse problem today than it has ever been, and  that is largely caused by the failure to deal with it. It is also  caused by the ability of the bully to follow the bullied student home  and to torment them and sometimes to aggravate other bullies around  them to torment them all day long in school and at home all through the  night, day after day, week after week.   In addition to ensuring equal protection of students with  disabilities as we just talked about, I am also concerned that Mrs.  DeVos will not be fully committed to enforcing civil rights protections  for students, including those who identify as LGBTQ.   This is obviously connected as well to the issue of bullying, because  often the most likely victims of bullying, we know, are LGBT students  and students with disabilities. It affects all students. There is no  question about that. But there are too many stories and too many  newspaper stories, in particular,  [[Page S766]]  about someone who was bullied persistently over time. That has led to  suicides and lead to some terribly tragic outcomes for students and  their families.   Bullying, when you think about it--or I should say, when we consider  the tolerance we have built up, I guess, over years to allow bullying  to continue--in many ways is the ultimate betrayal of our kids. We say  to our kids: Go to school. You have to go to school and stay in class  and pay attention and do your homework and study hard for quizzes and  tests. If you do that, you are going to progress and you are going to  be a person who has opportunities in the world. But you have to stay in  school and you have to concentrate on your work.   It is the ultimate betrayal for us as parents, as a society, to tell  that to a child, and then we put them in schools where the efforts  against bullying are not a priority. So it is a real betrayal of our  children to send them to schools and then not protect so many of them  from bullying. So in so many ways, as adults, we fail our kids when we  allow that to happen.   For many LGBTQ students, schools are anything but safe. The Centers  for Disease Control in 2016 put out a report called the ``Youth Risk  Behavior Surveillance'' annual report, which looks at the health and  well-being of our 9th through 12th grade students. Students who  identify as gay are almost twice as likely to have been threatened or  injured by a knife or a weapon on school property--twice as likely.   Students who identify as gay are almost three times more likely to  stay home from school because of safety concerns. Sixty percent of  students identifying as gay had felt so sad and hopeless almost every  day for 2 or more weeks in a row that they had stopped doing usual  activities.   Finally, the most sobering of all, the rate of suicide attempts is  four times greater. Let me say that again. Suicide attempts are four  times greater for young people who happen to be gay, and two times  greater for young people that are questioning than that of a straight  young person. With the advent of text messaging and social media and  social networking, many children find they cannot escape the harassment  even as they go home at night.   It follows them from the moment they wake until the moment they go to  sleep. I will give you one example from Pennsylvania, right in the  heartland of our State, Snyder County. You can't get much more small  town and emblematic of the rural and smalltown communities in our State  than a county like Snyder County.   The story of Brandon Bitner, a teenager from that part of the State,  in central Pennsylvania, is a chilling reminder of the horror--the  absolute horror--of bullying. This is what one news account wrote:         Brandon Bitner, 14 years old, of Mount Pleasant Mills, PA,       walked 13 miles from his home early Friday morning in       November of 2010 to a business intersection and threw himself       in front of an oncoming tractor-trailer, after leaving a       suicide note at his home. There seems to be little doubt in       students' mind why Brandon did what he did. ``It was because       of bullying,'' this friend wrote to the Daily Item, a paper       in central Pennsylvania. It was because of bullying. ``It was       not about race or gender, but they bullied him for his sexual       preferences, the way he dressed. Which,'' she said, ``they       wrongly accused him of.''    We know that Brandon's suicide note reportedly explained that he was  constantly bullied at Midd-West High School in Middleburg, which is  also Snyder County, where he was a freshman. Bullies allegedly called  Brandon names. He stated in the note that a humiliating event in school  this past week was ``the straw that broke the camel's back.'' Brandon  was an accomplished violinist, having been a member of the Susquehanna  Youth Orchestra in 2009.   That is smalltown Pennsylvania, Snyder County, right in the middle of  our State. So you have a 14-year-old who is driven to suicide because  of bullying--persistent, pernicious, violent, evil bullying--that drove  him to throw himself in front of a tractor-trailer 13 miles from his  home.   Now, we know that laws cannot wipe out human behavior or the darkness  of human nature sometimes. While we do have Federal laws that promote  school safety, there is currently nothing in place to comprehensively  address issues of bullying and harassment. It is critical that anti- bullying and harassment laws and policies enumerate or list  characteristics that are most frequently the subject of bullying and  harassment, such as race, color, natural origin, sex, sexual  orientation, gender identity or expression, disability and religion-- sometimes known in the law as protected classes.   It is important that in any bullying policies, those categories are  so enumerated. This is the most effective strategy for preventing and  prohibiting both bullying and harassment. Research shows the  effectiveness of these policies, and even the American Bar Association  agreed, passing a resolution unanimously in 2011 supporting enumerated  protections, not vague references to protecting young people from  bullying but very specific enumerated policies.   Now, we have made progress in developing legislation, but we have not  gotten the support we need to get it passed. We tried this during the  debate on the Every Student Succeeds Act, which, as many of you know,  is the reauthorization and the many changes made to the No Child Left  Behind legislation. But we did not get this policy as part of that. So  we have a ways to go.   Now, I had hoped that the next Secretary of Education would be  interested in tackling these issues. While Mrs. DeVos has expressed a  desire to work on preventing bullying, her record and financial giving  seem to suggest otherwise, especially as it relates to LGBTQ students.   Mrs. DeVos and her family's foundations have given millions of  dollars to organizations that are expressly opposed to this work--much  of the funding coming from the Edgar and Elsa Prince Foundation, which  is one of her family foundations. So, in other words, she is supporting  groups that do not want to pass anti-bullying legislation that  enumerates the protected groups of students.   I think that is a big mistake. I think it is wrong. We will continue  to fight them. But I hope that those donations that the family  foundations have made will not prohibit her from taking strong action  against bullying as Secretary of Education. Once again, I will say it:  When she becomes Secretary of Education--if she is confirmed--she is no  longer a private citizen engaged in fights about ideology or fights  about policy or fights about politics. She is a servant of the people  if she is going to be Secretary of Education.   So I would hope she would rethink that original predisposition to be  against those policies. I will move on because I know we are limited in  our time.   Now, I wanted to conclude with a couple of remarks about questions  regarding ethics and potential conflicts of interest, because that  seems to be a persistent theme with regard to a number of the  nominations.   We know that a lot of questions have been asked lately of Mrs. DeVos.  I wanted to review some of those. There are at least potential  conflicts of interest if she became Secretary of Education. We know  that we have a tradition not only here in Washington in the Federal  Government, but it was very much a part of State government in  Pennsylvania when I served there. It is part of the tradition in our  State that we opt on the side of more transparency for candidates and  for public officials about disclosure of information, especially  information that could compromise an individual in public office--tax  returns, for example, when people run for office. Providing Mrs.  DeVos's tax returns would be a small price to pay to become Secretary  of Education as part of that transparency. It would also go a long way  to ease the public's discomfort around some of the potential conflicts  of interest in the assets and family trusts that DeVos will be  retaining if she were to be confirmed.   The letter of agreement between Betsy DeVos and the Office of  Government Ethics is necessary but not sufficient to alleviate her and  her family's financial conflicts of interest. The HELP Committee has  always used its own requirements for vetting a nominee, which are and  always have been a step beyond those gathered by the Office of  Government Ethics.   The committee requires full disclosure of all assets over $1,000 in  the two-  [[Page S767]]  part committee questionnaire required by the committee rules. So there  is a lot more to do. I know we are running out of time. There is a lot  more to do, I believe, in terms of her fully disclosing information  about her family's or her own financial transactions, what stakes they  will maintain in some of these entities if she were to be confirmed.   This is not about probing someone who has a lot of personal assets  and is wealthy. This is about the taxpayers' right to know what their  Secretary of Education, or even a nominee for this job, has in her  portfolio and her family.   So I will conclude with this. Our children and our families and our  taxpayers deserve a Secretary of Education who is fully committed to  being a champion for public schools and public education.   I will harken back to what Kristin said in part of the letter I read:  Their public school experience has been ``life-changing.'' They ``value  and cherish our public school system.'' I hope that Betsy DeVos, if she  were to be confirmed, would value and cherish public education and make  it a live-changing experience for every student in those public  schools.   For the many reasons I have outlined, I will vote against her  nomination tomorrow.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.    Would you agree with me that the problem, and       that's an understatement in my judgment, that the problem of       sexual assault on college campuses is a significant [one]       that we should take action on?        Mrs. DeVOS. Senator, thank you for that question. I agree       with you that sexual assault in any form or in any place is a       problem.         I ask you, would you uphold the 2011 Title IX       guidance as it relates to sexual assault on campus?        Mrs. DeVOS. Senator, I know that there's a lot of       conflicting ideas and opinions around that guidance, and if       confirmed I would work with you.    And so on.   My concerns about Mrs. DeVos go to policy, to preparation, but most  of all to a basic understanding of what public education is about. It  goes to a basic commitment to the mission of public education.   Every Senator's office has phones ringing off the hook with people  telling us that Mrs. DeVos is not the right choice. So, to my  Republican colleagues, you don't have to take my word for it; you don't  have to take the word of the other 49 Senators who know that Mrs. DeVos  will not be the leader of the Department of Education that we all need.  You only have to take the word of the people in your own State and the  groups whom we look to and trust when it comes to our country's  education system. These are the people whom we are here to serve. They  are the parents, the grandparents, the teachers, the faculty, the  school board members, and the students who count on us to make the  right decision.   We may not agree on who would make the perfect Secretary of  Education, but we can agree that people across the country are speaking  out against Mrs. DeVos, and it is up to us to listen. I will be voting  no on her nomination, and I ask Republicans to follow the advice of  their constituents and join me.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Zach Ormsby of  my staff be granted floor privileges for the duration of the  consideration of the DeVos nomination.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Paul). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I want to outline a number of concerns that  I have this morning about Senator Sessions' nomination to be the next  Attorney General. I will try to keep it to a short list. I have limited  time this morning. But I wanted to start with the voting rights issue.   In our State of Pennsylvania, we have a long history of litigation  and battles about the right to vote. And when the Supreme Court  decision in Shelby v. Holder was issued a couple of years ago, folks in  the Senate took one, two, or three different positions. The position  that I took was one of disagreement with the basic holding of Shelby v.  Holder, which in my judgment gutted the Voting Rights Act's  requirements that certain States and certain jurisdictions with  histories of discrimination seek what is called preclearance from the  Federal government before changing voting rules. That was a substantial  change from the policies that had been in place for years.   Since the Shelby decision, more than half of the so-called  preclearance States have implemented restrictive voting laws--some as  soon as the very next day after the decision was handed down. And over  800 polling places in preclearance States alone have been closed since  the decision. So on this issue, it is a basic difference of opinion.   I think Shelby was decided the wrong way, and Senator Sessions  believes it was decided the right way. That is a fundamental  disagreement. I have real concerns about an Attorney General who would  have that position or that point of view on that case. I don't know for  sure what he would do as Attorney General. I can't predict that, but I  can certainly raise concerns about that decision.   When you think about what led to decisions like that over time, it is  hard to encapsulate when you are speaking on the Senate floor all of  the misery, all of the suffering, all of the trauma to individuals, all  of the trauma that our country endured first to get the right to vote  for every American and then to enforce the law and to make it real.  There is no way--if I had 9 hours on the floor, I probably couldn't  encapsulate or do justice to all of that work. So it is a fundamental  divide, a fundamental debate about voting rights.   As someone who represents Pennsylvania, we have a particular interest  in the issue of voter ID laws. They are the kinds of laws that follow  the Shelby decision. Some of them predated Shelby. But we had a major  debate in Pennsylvania back in 2012, where the Pennsylvania General  Assembly passed--meaning the House and Senate passed--and the Governor  signed into law a voter ID law. Then litigation commenced and went all  the way through the court system in Pennsylvania. The final decision  was that the law was struck down. The voter ID law was struck down, so  it is a major point of contention in Pennsylvania.   Over time, some have asserted that there is widespread voter fraud.  We have heard that even more recently. I am still waiting for the  evidence of that, but that is certainly an issue that we will continue  to debate here in Washington.   I think the last thing we need in the United States of America is  more restrictive voter ID laws. We should be hoping we can expand the  opportunity for people to vote. Where there are barriers erected, knock  them down. Where there are impediments to the right to vote, push  through them or put in place strategies to overcome them.   Again, I think that is just the basic difference between Senator  Sessions and me, in terms of our approach to voter ID laws. We had a  searing experience in Pennsylvania, which left a lasting impression on  the people of our State.   Another issue, which I think is of critical importance in every  administration at every time, but maybe ever more so today with regard  to this new administration: The administration now is in a major  litigation battle regarding what has been described as a travel ban. It  is probably shorthand, but that is my best description of it. It has  been a matter that has been litigated in several U.S. Federal district  courts, and now it is in front of an appellate court. Who knows, the  next step after this may be the U.S. Supreme Court. I raise that not to  debate the substance of it; we can do that for a long while, I guess,  but I raise it on the question of independence.   There are certain jobs in government--I had one of them in State  government. I was elected as a State auditor general in Pennsylvania. I  served two terms. In that job, for example, at the State level, the  most important quality or metric by which you are judged is your  independence. You are either independent or not. And if you are  independent, you can do auditing investigations that demonstrate that  independence. Then you are doing what the people expect.   At the Federal level, even though the Attorney General is appointed  by a President, I also believe the Attorney General has to demonstrate  independence every day, in every decision, in every interaction with  our government or with citizens across the country. I hope that Jeff  Sessions can do that, were he to be confirmed. I have some doubts, not  only based upon the recent campaign statements made, but I also have  some significant concerns in light of what has happened recently.   I would hope, and I think every American has a reasonable  expectation, that any Attorney General will be totally independent when  it comes to basic questions of law and justice, even if they agree with  the President on a number of issues. I have some doubts in the case of  this nominee.   So independence is a significant concern across the country. We have  had a long debate in this country. Part of it, I think, came to closure  a couple of years ago in the Supreme Court with regard to marriage  equality. That worked its way through the courts, as well. I was in  support of, and happy about, the decision the Supreme Court made on  marriage equality.   It is another basic difference that I have with the nominee for  Attorney General. Once again, I think that is one of those basic issues  that divides the parties. It doesn't mean you can't work together. It  doesn't mean you can't have a good relationship. But I would hope that  the Attorney General of the United States, of either party, would make  sure that decision as it relates to marriage equality would be enforced  and that it would be the subject of some praise or at least some  rhetorical support for the outcome in that case.   I think the country took a step in the right direction, where every  American, whether they are gay or lesbian or bisexual or transgender,  was finally accorded the full measure of respect, the full measure of  inclusion, when it came to the issue of marriage. That is another basic  disagreement that we have.   We don't know what the outcome of this confirmation vote will be. I  think we have some sense of it, but regardless of the final outcome,  these differences will remain. We have to be honest about basic,  fundamental differences, and that is one of the reasons we have a  confirmation process. That is why we have advice and consent. That is  why we have hearings and hundreds, if not thousands, of questions  because each of these nominees is granted enormous power. In some  instances--unlike Senator Sessions--but  [[Page S908]]  in some instances, they are appointed to positions where they will have  substantial impact on people's lives for years. Tens of millions of  Americans' lives will be impacted by their decisions, so they should  have to go through a thorough vetting process and a very rigorous  ultimate confirmation process because they are being accorded great  power, and they are servants of the people. They have to remember that  is what their job is: to be servants.   I know some want to shorten or truncate or make easier this path to  confirmation for all of these Cabinet nomination positions. I think the  people expect a thorough vetting, and we are still in the midst of that  with regard to several of these positions.   So I just wanted to outline my objections--or I should say  disagreements with--Senator Sessions. I will be voting no on his  nomination.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
