 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the west  Michiganders who are asking and begging Congress to finally act on the  uniquely American gun violence epidemic.   As a mother and a lawmaker, I simply cannot sit by and let our kids  be senselessly killed in their classrooms and our communities any  longer. It is just too much.   Gun violence has become the number one cause of death for kids in the  United States. Not drug overdoses, not car accidents. Gun violence.   Earlier this year, the entire State of Michigan watched in horror as  the Michigan State University campus was on lockdown during a mass  shooting. Three students died and five were injured. The reverberating  impacts were felt around the entire State and the entire country. The  effects of this trauma linger.   This is now the reality for our children and young adults, but it  doesn't have to be.   I stand here on the floor today with my sons watching on, urging my  Republican colleagues to take commonsense action. We can and must come  together to close loopholes in the law, ensure universal background  checks, and keep guns out of the hands of those that should not have  them.   I stand ready with my fellow task force members to do the work to  protect our kids, schools, families, and communities across the  country. It is time our Republican colleagues join us.
