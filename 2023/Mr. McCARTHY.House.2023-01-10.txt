 Mr. Speaker, one of the greatest worries about the  future is that we fall behind Communist China. The fact of the matter  is the danger posed by our dependence on China is dire.   We spent decades passing policies that welcomed China into the global  system. In return, China has exported oppression, aggression, and anti- Americanism. Today, the power of its military and economy are growing  at the expense of freedom and democracy worldwide.   It didn't start under this administration, but the current  administration has clearly made it worse. Their policies have weakened  our economy and made us more vulnerable to the threats of the CCP.   But here is the good news: There is bipartisan consensus that the era  of trusting Communist China is over.   I listened to my friend, the gentleman across the aisle, I listened  to your points, to your concerns. Do not be concerned. Those are my  same concerns as well, and they will not take place.   I will tell the gentleman where the idea of all this was created. It  was on a codel to Normandy. I was there with then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi  celebrating the 75th anniversary of D-day. As you walked those hallowed  grounds of the crosses and the Stars of David of these young American  men, and you wondered: What could have been done for that day to have  never taken place?                                time  1230    It dawned on me in that moment in time there was an opportunity that  instead of American Government not speaking with one voice--these  different messages we have been providing--perhaps we could have a  bipartisan committee that could look at all aspects, from economics  when we fell into COVID and not knowing whether we could have our  medical supplies because China controlled so much.   We learned of the farmland they are buying today and the stealing of  our intellectual property.   But we weaken ourselves when we fight about which way to do it.   Wouldn't it be better if we all came together?   For 9 months we worked on that, and we did get an agreement that we  were going to start a bipartisan task force. We even had The Washington  Post  [[Page H124]]  come in and interview the Members who were going to be on it, but,  unfortunately, the night before, the then-majority party pulled back.   Mr. Speaker, you have my word and my commitment that this is not a  partisan committee. This will be a bipartisan committee. It is my hope,  my desire, and my wish that we speak with one voice and that we focus  on the challenges that we have of how do we bring our jobs back from  China to America?   How do we secure our intellectual property?   How do we make sure our farmland is protected?   All of that would be brought up within this committee. The threat is  too great for us to bicker with ourselves. The future should be  determined by us.   I have heard my colleagues on both sides say that the threat posed by  Communist China is serious. I fully agree. This is an issue that  transcends our political parties, and creating the select committee on  China is our best avenue for addressing it.   If we want to end our dependence on China, then this committee will  investigate it.   If we want to protect our national security, then this committee will  work to do that.   If we want to stop the theft of intellectual property and bring  supply chains back to America, then this committee will work to make it  happen.   If we are worried about Chinese propaganda in our schools and  lobbying efforts in Washington, then this committee will shine a bright  light on it.   If we are outraged that the CCP is buying American farmland, then  this committee will work to stop it--but to stop it with one voice.   It is not one party saying it. It is America united determining our  own future.   If we want to stop trillions of American dollars from financing  Communist genocide and military modernization, then the committee will  work to prevent it--including by investigating how ESG benefits the  CCP.   The select committee on China will create the plan that will take us  where we really need to go. It will get us all on the same page and  move us in the right direction. Members of the select committee will  work closely with their colleagues on every committee to get the job  done.   Is it partisan?   Absolutely not.   To my friend across the aisle, if at any time on the five items you  listed that you feel something is challenging those, then you come to  me because that is not the intent, and that is not what I will put up  with.   I sat with the new leader of the Democrats, and I told him early on  what this committee will be and whom we will be putting on it. We want  serious lawmakers. This isn't for somebody to go in and be viral  because they want to make some point. This is to work together as one  Congress where one of our greatest challenges for the future is that no  longer will we be dependent upon China and no longer will we be as  vulnerable.   America will be stronger and dependent upon ourselves, and we will do  this together. That is what the American people expect.   I want this committee to last beyond who is in the majority and never  ever be decided that this is a partisan committee.   The gentleman has my commitment.   If at any time I feel that whoever the leader on the other side puts  on this committee was trying to make it partisan, I told him I would  approach him.   Let's start with the right philosophy and with the right goals in  mind, and let's work together to make it happen.   The chairman will be   Mike Gallagher. This is a man who has  sacrificed a lot. This is a man who is focused and studied. This is a  man who is not going to be partisan. We want the very best ideas. It  doesn't matter where they come from. At the end of the day, we don't  need a majority and minority report. We just need one philosophy with  one principle, and America will be stronger for the future to come.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his support. I appreciate it.
