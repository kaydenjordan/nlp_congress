 Mr. Speaker, Operation Warp Speed moves  us closer to a cure for COVID-19. Thanks to President Trump, the  administration, and the private sector, a viable vaccine is now within  reach.   Operation Warp Speed has proceeded at an unprecedented pace, and it  reflects a profound level of urgency. It is a direct reflection of  President Trump's commitment to protecting the American people.   Taxpayers at the Federal level have committed over $10 billion to  support the development of a vaccine, and the private sector has  stepped up to meet this challenge head-on.   Keep in mind that many vaccines and their subsequent clinical trials  can take many years to complete. Without a doubt, we are closer to  eradicating COVID-19 thanks to Operation Warp Speed.                     Progrowth Policies Benefit Americans     Mr. Speaker, in a recent report released  by the U.S. Census, it was revealed that the median household income in  the United States rose by 6.8 percent in 2019. I want to repeat that.  The median household income in the United States rose by 6.8 percent in  2019.   This was the highest annual increase on record, and it is all thanks  to the commonsense, progrowth policies that are being led by President  Trump and congressional Republicans.   Not surprisingly, household incomes also grew 50 percent faster last  year than the entire 8 years of the Obama administration.   The good news doesn't stop there. New small business applications  increased twice as much in President Trump's first 2 years in office  versus President Obama's last 2.   Mr. Speaker, it is quite evident that progrowth policies are the  difference between inflating government bureaucracy and empowering  American families. It is just that simple.   Mr. Speaker, on September 23, there was an article in The Washington  Times titled ``Trump creates jobs. Biden destroys them. It's not  complicated,'' and I include in the Record the article.       Trump creates jobs. Biden destroys them. It's not complicated.         Trump's record proves that he knows how to create a strong       economy.        Donald Trump has proven that he knows what it takes to       create jobs on a massive scale and ensure that prosperity is       shared by all Americans. Democrat presidential nominee Joe       Biden doesn't even know how many letters are in the word       ``jobs.''        President Trump's record proves that he knows how to create       a strong and growing economy that generates enormous       opportunity for all Americans to succeed. Prior to the       artificial contraction caused by the coronavirus pandemic,       the national unemployment rate had been consistently hovering       at a 50-year low, and joblessness had reached the lowest       level ever recorded for both black and Hispanic workers.        The president's pro-growth economic policies played a major       role in creating the strongest economy in history, which was       a particularly impressive feat after eight years of       stagnation under the Obama-Biden administration. The 2017 Tax       Cuts and Jobs Act, for example, cut taxes for every income       bracket, particularly benefitting middle-income Americans.       The tax bill also created Opportunity Zones, driving tens of       billions of dollars in new investment to historically       underdeveloped communities in every state, providing jobs,       housing, and infrastructure necessary to revive those       communities.        Mr. Trump's emphasis on targeted deregulation has also made       it easier and more efficient to create jobs and start new       business ventures in this country.In 2012, halfway through       the Obama-Biden era, federal regulations were placing a       massive burden on the small businesses that account for       almost half of all jobs in this country, costing an average       of $11,724 each year in regulatory compliance costs for each       new employee they hired. The Trump administration slashed       tens of billions of dollars worth of harmful, job-killing       regulations, saving American households over $3,000 per year       on average. Mr. Biden, however, is vowing to undo these       effective policies and replace them with even more crippling       taxes and regulations than before, particularly on middle-      income Americans. His proposals to eliminate entire       industries such as fracking and increase the federal minimum       wage to $15 per hour would be a blow to small- and medium-      sized businesses that are only just getting back on their       feet after months of pandemic-related lockdowns.        We don't have to take him at his word, though. Mr. Biden, a       career politician who has spent nearly half a century in       Washington, has a long history of supporting job-killing       policies such as the North American Free Trade Agreement       (NAFTA), which cost Americans over a million jobs. Mr. Biden       also supported normalizing trade relations  [[Page H4892]]       with China, paving the way for the repressive communist       country to secure membership in the World Trade Organization       (WTO), leading to the loss of over 60,000 American factories       and millions more blue collar jobs.        The former vice president clearly has no idea how to manage       an economy, and his extensive record of bungling the job as       both a senator and vice president proves it. Under the Obama-      Biden administration's job-killing policies, the American       middle class experienced a double-whammy in the aftermath of       the Great Recession, contributing to this country's slowest       economic recovery since World War II.        While Mr. Biden was still struggling to pinpoint just how       many letters are in the word ``jobs,'' former President Obama       entrusted him to manage the administration's economic       recovery agenda--and it turned out to be a miserable failure.       President Trump turned things around in a hurry once he took       office, and he's already working the same magic as he       orchestrates a ``V-shaped'' recovery from the artificial       coronavirus downturn. Results matter, and Donald Trump is the       only candidate with a proven track record of delivering the       sort of results the American people need.                            ____________________
