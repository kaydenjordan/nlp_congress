 Mr. Speaker, many of you do know, and maybe some of you  don't know, that I grew up in a family trucking business. I know how  important transportation workers are and how important they are to the  American people.   In the past few months, we have seen our Nation's truck drivers,  maintenance crews, public transit workers, and other essential  employees step up and deliver the goods. It is our duty to support them  and ensure that, while they do their jobs, they are kept safe and they  can do their jobs effectively. Unfortunately, this legislation falls  far short on that goal.   Instead of adequately investing in our Nation's roads and bridges, or  better conditions for our truckers and motorists, the Speaker and her  allies chose to double down on their liberal Green New Deal wish list.   And instead of working together in a bipartisan manner, which has  always been done--at least over the last 15 to 20 years, from what I  understand--they forced it through the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee on a party-line vote.   With this legislation, my colleagues on the other side are saying  that, when it comes to our Nation's infrastructure, it is quite  literally my way or the highway. That, I believe, is a dangerous route  to take, and I think that the American people will wake up to the fact,  with these continuing partisan games on something that is so important  that has been done in a bipartisan manner before, that, finally, they  will speak up and say that they have had enough, because many of us  have.
