 Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman from New Mexico said that  the border is not threatening to  [[Page H4285]]  us, that those who would cross our border illegally carry with them  their laughter and poetry.   Unfortunately, laughter and poetry is not the only thing they are  bringing. On the edges of that laughter, they are carrying COVID, more  and more of them, unable to be tested, screened, vaccinated because so  many are being invited across our border illegally it is straining the  flow.   In their poetry, they are carrying the rhymes of MS-13; and in their  bags, they are carrying too much fentanyl, too much death for our  fellow Americans.   I listened carefully as the gentlewoman from Washington smeared our  CBP officers as racist, which is quite something considering how many  of them are non-White.   I spent time with them recently. My colleague who is with me this  evening, Congresswoman Greene, spent time with many of our CBP officers  recently, and they are patriotic Americans who deserve better from  every Member of Congress than they just heard.   The gentlewoman from Washington also talked about her visit to a  Federal detention facility under President Trump. Imagine that. A  Republican President, a Democrat Congresswoman, and a desire to oversee  and inspect the operations of our government. I am glad that Ms.  Jayapal, the gentlewoman from Washington, was afforded that  opportunity.   But, unfortunately, today I was not. Congresswoman Greene was not.  Congressman Gohmert, Congressman Gosar. We were labeled trespassers by  Federal employees of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.   Now, there is a great deal I want to discuss about the need for  oversight with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, specific circumstances  regarding January 6 detainees, but before having that thorough  discussion, I would yield to my colleague, the gentlewoman from Georgia  (Mrs. Greene) to offer any remarks regarding the mischaracterizations  of our brave Border Patrol officers and the crisis at our border that  Democrats would ignore as they create a pathway for citizenship for  people who did not come here legally. I yield to the gentlewoman.    I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. We have an  obligation here to approach issues in a bipartisan fashion when it is  opportune.   On the issue of prison reform, Republicans and Democrats joined  together to pass the First Step Act. It was, in fact, the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Jeffries) who led the Democrat effort in that  endeavor.   The essence of that is equality and access to information. Republican  administrations shouldn't bar Democrats from being able to have  reasonable observations of the ongoing workings of our government and,  similarly, the Biden government should not have the opportunity to  exclude Republicans.   It begs the question why were we there. Following January 6, which  was not a good day for our country, which included violence that all of  us condemn, there has been an unprecedented targeting of Americans who  have a particular viewpoint.    Their bank records are turned over to Federal authorities by  financial institutions they thought they could trust. They have seen  themselves ripped from their bed at night, pulled out of their places  of employment, harassed, questioned.   Many of these people were not even in Washington, D.C. on January 6,  but maybe they forwarded the wrong e-mail or liked the wrong photo or  shared the wrong meme.   What is happening in America where we take these exquisite national  security authorities and we turn them inward on our own people?   We have two principal areas of concern. First, are the January 6  detainees given access to evidence? We don't prejudge for a moment the  innocence or guilt of anyone beyond the American principle that  everyone is innocent until proven guilty.   But access to exculpatory evidence could show interesting things. It  could show that there was a difference between those who believed they  were being part of a fully peaceful endeavor and those who might have  been animating violence.   The 14,000 hours of tape could also show us who was animating that  violence, whether they were connected in any way, directed in any way  by Federal agencies.   It raises great suspicion that we are not able to get access to this  information as Members of Congress. It raises even more suspicion that  people deprived of their liberty right now, in the absence of any  conviction, cannot get that very information.   The second category of concern deals with the treatment of people in  our Federal facilities. As Congresswoman Greene and I arrived at the  Federal facility in Washington today, we did not prejudge whether all  of the people in that facility were January 6 detainees or might have  been there for some other reason.   I often find on a congressional delegation you learn a lot maybe that  you didn't particularly even show up to learn by virtue of having boots  on the ground and having that real-time, effective, roll-up-your- sleeves style of oversight.   We have heard unconfirmed reports of beatings, of deprivation of  access to nutrition, to religious services, to counsel. As I stand here  today on the floor, I am embarrassed to have to admit to my  constituents, I don't know the answers to those questions because the  Attorney General won't answer them.   He won't show up in the Judiciary Committee for an oversight hearing.  He won't show up to the Oversight Committee. When we show up at the  [[Page H4286]]  Department of Justice, he won't answer our questions, and when we show  up at the Federal Bureau of Prisons, instead of giving answers, instead  of providing a tour, which is exactly what Republican and Democrat  administrations have done in years past, they said we were the problem.   It begs the question, why would people charged with misdemeanors be  held in a Federal facility if otherwise that same Federal indexing  would result in release with the bail system or on someone's own  recognizance or with supervised release.   Congresswoman Greene, here's my concern and hypothesis that I hope  isn't true, that this Biden government wants so badly to have the  specter of January 6 function as some sort of basis to continue  targeting our fellow Americans that they would use people as political  props, that they would deviate from otherwise standard practices in  sentencing and in pretrial behavior so that they can continue this  fiction that somehow we are under this grave national security threat  from MAGA or white supremacy or America First or whatever the new smear  of the day is.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia for the purpose of engaging  in a colloquy with me.   Congresswoman, do you have a perspective on why the Department of  Justice and the Federal Bureau of Prisons seem so willing to deviate  from their normal practices with these otherwise pedestrian crimes in  the instances of people who did not engage in violence?    I thank the gentlewoman for yielding back. I am unaware of  any such charge. The charges that concern me most are the charges that  are misdemeanor in nature that would normally result in a very quick  pass through the criminal justice system, and then having someone go on  with their lives.   Those charges are resulting in enhanced confinement, conditions that  are not observable, and civil rights that are not identifiable when we  are inquisitive to the United States Department of Justice.   The gentlewoman from Georgia compares, perhaps improperly, the BLM  riots of the past summer with the circumstances of January 6. I mean,  dozens of people died as a result of the BLM riots. This was not the  case at the Capitol. We are not for violence of any kind.   There are plenty of places in the world, like Cuba, where political  violence is necessary. By the way, the very same BLM crowd that was  burning down America, that was calling this Nation racist, they have  totally embraced the Cuban regime. So I guess socialism runs thicker  than politics, runs thicker than blood, for sure.   So with the Department of Justice under, frankly, both President  Trump and President Biden unwilling to treat the BLM terrorism for what  it was, to then turn on people who potentially were not violent,  charging them, holding them, depriving them of the normal array of  civil rights that we would afford any American, it does make it harder  to make the American case to the world.   We have already seen global leaders suggest that whatever their human  rights violations, hey, America's got folks from January 6 locked up,  so Vladimir Putin can kill his enemies, so other despots can justify  the horrendous things they do to their people.   In the words of one of our late, great chairmen in this body, we are  better than this. We should be better than this.   But we did not find better today. Today we found a Federal Government  that was arrogant and recalcitrant.                                time  2015    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. Greene)  to perhaps opine on the conditions we think people might be suffering  based on the attitude we encountered today.    And speaking of not caring, would the gentlewoman reflect  on her concern about showing up at the Department of Justice and being  deprived of access even to the lobby for a meeting with a senior  official like the Attorney General.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. Greene).    Madam Speaker, at this time I seek unanimous consent that  all Members participating in this Special Order may have 5 legislative  days to revise and extend their remarks and submit extraneous material.    Madam Speaker, I believe this brings us to the conclusion  of our Special Order time. I thank my colleagues for participating. I  vow that we will continue to press these questions and to demand  accountability and transparency from an administration that seems out  of control.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
