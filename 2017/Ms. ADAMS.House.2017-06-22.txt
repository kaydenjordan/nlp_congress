 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Since coming to Congress, I have visited with business leaders across  my district, such as Cindy, the plant manager at Train in Charlotte,  and educators at local colleges like Central Piedmont Community  College. Each stressed the importance of educating our workforce to  fill existing available jobs and to train for jobs of the future.   We must close the skills gap through innovation and work-based  learning opportunities such as those provided through the Strengthening  Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act.   CTE improves collaboration between secondary and postsecondary  schools, employers, industry, and community partners, giving students,  regardless of their background, access to quality job training and the  opportunity to earn well-paying jobs without having to complete a 4- year degree. This training is critical to closing the opportunity gap  that exists in communities like mine in Mecklenburg County.   IBM, which employs more than 1,300 people in the 12th District, wrote  to me just last week to remind us that jobs in growing technology  fields demand candidates with high-tech skills that don't always  require a traditional degree.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in reauthorizing CTE to  continue modernizing today's workforce training and securing America's  future.
