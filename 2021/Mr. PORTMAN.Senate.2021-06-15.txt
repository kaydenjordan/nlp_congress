 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  achievements of a friend of mine and a great Ohioan, John Payiavlas,  who recently celebrated his 90th birthday.   John was born in 1931 to Greek immigrants Anthony and Paraskevi  Payiavlas in Warren, Oh. At the age of 20, he was drafted into the U.S.  Army and underwent basic training at Fort Riley in Kansas. In 1952, he  was deployed to South Korea, where he joined U.N. forces in supporting  South Korea as part of Fox Company, 7th Regiment, 3rd Infantry  Division. He later transferred to the Greek Expeditionary Force  Batallion--one of four Greek Americans to serve in this batallion--and  was awarded the Commander's Silver Cross of Valour for his exemplary  service. He was honorably discharged in 1953 as sergeant first class.   John and his wife Marisa, who this year will celebrate their 65th  wedding anniversary, were married 3 years after John returned home to  Ohio from the service. In 1960, John purchased a small company called  Automatic Vendors, which later became a multimillion-dollar corporation  known as AVI Foodsystems. Since its inception, AVI has served customers  in more than 6,500 locations across the United States and has become  the largest independently owned and operated contract food service  company in the Nation. Currently, the company provides vending,  institutional dining, and coffee service operations to companies across  America.   Today, John Payiavlas runs the company alongside his children,  Anthony and Patrice Kouvas. The Payiavlas family has made tremendous  contributions to their community, including a generous gift of $500,000  to Youngstown State University for their new sports media center. In  2006, John and his wife were honored with the Cleveland Clinic's  Distinguished Fellow Award for their support of the clinic's  initiatives, such as the Heart and Vascular Institute, the Taussig  Cancer Center, and the Glickman Urological Institute.   John Payiavlas has received numerous accolades for his  accomplishments. In 2000, John was inducted into the Business Hall of  Fame of Northeast Ohio's Inside Business Magazine. In 2016, he was  honored for his service in the Korean war with the Washington Oxi Day  Foundation's Jaharis Service Award. In addition, John holds the highest  honor in all Christendom for a lay person as an Archon Depoutatos of  the Ecumenical Patriarchate, which dates back to the fourth century in  the Greek Orthodox Church. The service and achievements of John  Payiavlas extend well beyond the State of Ohio, and I applaud the  lasting impact his success will have on our future generations.                            ____________________
