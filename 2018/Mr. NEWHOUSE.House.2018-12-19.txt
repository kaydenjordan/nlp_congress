 Mr. Speaker, I thank the good gentleman from California  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of my legislation, H.R.  6652, to transfer Bureau of Reclamation works to the Kennewick  Irrigation District.   As many of my colleagues know far too well, communities across the  Western United States too often are faced with the detrimental impacts  of droughts and water shortages. Water providers across central  Washington and across the West face numerous challenges to supply  water, including growing demand, aging infrastructure, and changing  precipitation patterns.   By transferring the Bureau of Reclamation works to a local entity,  like the Kennewick Irrigation District, water suppliers can better  manage critical water resources and empower water managers to be as  responsive, efficient, and innovative as possible in serving their  community.   In addition to transferring the works, the legislation before us will  provide for reduced Federal liabilities and, with the Kennewick  Irrigation District prepaying for the works, there is an additional  cost-savings benefit to the Federal Government.   I thank the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee in the House,  Chairman Bishop, for moving this legislation forward, which truly is a  win-win for local water providers, the Federal Government, and  taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, I also thank Mr. Bill Ball, the staff director  of the Subcommittee on Water, Power, and Oceans, for his tremendous  work at the committee; and a personal shout-out to one of my office  staff members, Travis Martinez, for his work.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation on  final passage, and I look forward to the Senate moving swiftly to get  this legislation to the President's desk.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life, service,  and spirit of my friend, Fredi Simpson. Fredi was well known and  admired in central Washington. She was filled with passion and  dedicated her time to improving her community and lending a helping  hand to whomever was in need. She was a dear friend of mine, and I will  miss her very much.   Dedicated to the conservative cause, Fredi's engagement in politics  was inspiring to everyone around her. She served as a mentor to young  people and encouraged them to get involved at the local, State, and  national levels.   As national committeewoman, she represented Washington State with  infectious enthusiasm and deep integrity. She traveled across our great  State and the entire country leaving a positive impression on everyone  she met.   So, today, I reflect on my own joyful memories with Fredi, and I find  peace in knowing she is at rest and reunited with God.   My prayers go out for her husband Bruce, her son Kane, and all her  loved ones, and I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating her  wonderful life.   Fredi, we will miss you.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
