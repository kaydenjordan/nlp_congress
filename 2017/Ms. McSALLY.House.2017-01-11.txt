 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize two southern Arizona  young women for their achievements and for serving as role models in  their communities. Macy Maine, a senior at Buena High School, and  Hannah Mason, a senior at Pusch Ridge Christian Academy, were recently  given the 2016 Brilliant, Beautiful and Bold Role Model Award from the  Girls Rule Foundation. The award recognizes only a handful of young  women across the State who are making a difference.   Macy was given the award for her active engagement in the community.  She represented her high school as an American Legion Auxiliary Arizona  Girls State delegate, is an All-American cheerleader, and represented  her city at the Power Up Teen Leadership Conference. She is a frequent  volunteer and hopes to enter public service.   Hannah has been a selfless leader for her family and community. After  a car accident took the life of her father and severely injured her  older sister, Hannah stepped up to care for her family. She helped her  sister through multiple surgeries while continuing to excel at school  and remain active in the community. She hopes to enter medical school  one day.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate both Macy and Hannah for being  inspirational role models to their peers and wish them the best of luck  as they continue to pursue their dreams.                            ____________________
