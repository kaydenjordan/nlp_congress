 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I wanted to just literally pop into the  discussion here this morning. There is a great deal going on here in  the Capitol.   The discussions on the bipartisan infrastructure bill are continuing  in a good, productive way, and we are hopeful we will be able to move  to that great deal of work that has gone on by folks on both sides  working in extraordinary good faith.   And to be able to proceed on this matter, I think, will be an  important policy initiative but also good for our process in this body                            ____________________     Mr. President, I don't come here this morning to speak  to that at this moment but to just give a strong Alaska ``attagirl''  shout-out to Lydia Jacoby.   A few days ago, most people outside of the State of Alaska had  probably never heard of Lydia, 17 years old, from Seward, AK. Seward is  a pretty small community in the south central part of the State. It is  a coastal community. It is a fishing community. It is a hard-working  community.   Lydia is a typical high school student at Seward High School, except  she is a swimmer, and is she an extraordinary swimmer. To see the news  the other night of her gold, of her unexpected and spectacular win, was  a moment of pride for all Alaskans, a moment of pride for Americans  that just makes your heart swell. So I wanted to come to the floor and  share that.   I actually was able to start my morning off early, but in a good way,  by being able to call Lydia--she is over in Japan, obviously--and to  speak with her directly and offer my congratulations. Mr. President,  you can tell when people are grinning ear to ear, even though you are  separated by thousands of miles and you are talking over a telephone.  This morning, Lydia Jacoby was grinning ear to ear as I was sharing my  words of congratulations and she, just her exuberance and delight for  being able to represent the United States at these Olympics in this  way.   We are extraordinarily proud. Lydia has put Seward and certainly  Seward High School on the map. Folks are coming up to me saying: Gosh,  I didn't realize you didn't have Olympic-meter swimming pools in most  of your communities. Well, that is true. Lydia did some training that I  think most would say: It is going to be a long, hard slog to get to any  Olympics.   I think the dedication of this young woman has certainly played out.  The support that she has received from her parents over the years, the  support she has received from her community, is an example of just  good, strong Alaska roots: everybody working hard and just doing your  best on a daily basis.   Lydia Jacoby has absolutely done her best. She set the gold standard,  and we are just extraordinarily proud of this young Alaskan woman.                            ____________________
