 Madam Speaker, ahead of Trans Day of  Visibility, I rise in honor of a community that is being forced to  fight for its very existence. I rise in honor of trans voices that  deserve to be heard, not silenced and not criminalized. I rise in honor  of trans joy that deserves to be celebrated, not eradicated. I rise  with unconditional love for my trans daughter, Riley. I rise in  solidarity with every trans American seeking nothing less than their  inalienable right to the pursuit of happiness.   To stand in the way of that right is to stand against our most basic  American values, but that is exactly what MAGA extremists are doing  across this country--on school boards, in State capitals, and here in  the Halls of Congress.   Elected officials are using their power to undermine the freedoms and  human dignity of trans Americans, and they are waging an especially  vicious crusade on our kids.   These attacks make me all the more grateful for the unconditional  love that Mimi and Joe Lemay of Massachusetts have for their son,  Jacob. Mimi and Joe have faced vitriol and cruelty from rightwing  extremists, all because they heard, accepted, and embraced Jacob when  he told them he is a boy.    A few years ago, Mimi shared a letter she wrote to her son, and I  would like to offer a few of her moving words: ``You have at the age of  9 years accomplished what many adults couldn't in a lifetime. In your  courageous visibility, you have changed the course of your own history.  You have turned strangers into allies and allies into advocates.  Layered in my pride is my concern for you. I know your strength, but I  also know how determined the forces are that have pitted themselves  against you. The politicians and preachers who would rather see you  languish in a dark closet than watch you engage the world as you do,  cultivating joy and love wherever you go.''   Madam Speaker, Jacob's courage demonstrates a profound strength.  Let's show that strength the respect it demands. Let's reject the  forces of opposition and bigotry. Let's celebrate the bravery and  beauty of our trans community. Let's follow Jacob's example and  cultivate joy and love wherever we go.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member for  yielding me time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the majority's polluters over  people act, a massive handout to some of the world's most profitable  and most powerful corporations.   It is a Big Oil giveaway that would hike the deficit instead of  helping families, instead of protecting our planet, and instead of  lowering costs for consumers and slashing energy bills.   Republicans seem to have just one priority, and that is helping the  rich get richer. Through price gouging and war profiteering, Big Oil  has doubled their profits to record levels. They are hoarding millions  of acres of our public land, and they are using these unprecedented  resources to line their pockets.   Exxon just announced $35 billion in stock buybacks, and Chevron  shareholders are pocketing $75 billion.   Yet, what is the Republican plan? It is to triple down on allegiance  to Big Oil, give away more Federal land, invite more offshore drilling,  unleash more pollution into our water and our air and our land, and  leave the taxpayers footing the bill.   Climate change is here. We don't have time to wait. Americans know  that securing our future means investing in clean energy.   Families know their health depends on it; economists know our  prosperity depends on it; and the Pentagon knows our national security  depends on it. It is only MAGA Republicans who don't understand our  future depends on a thriving clean energy economy.   Last year, we proudly enacted the largest climate investment in  history, and now we are proudly voting ``no'' on the polluters over  people act.
