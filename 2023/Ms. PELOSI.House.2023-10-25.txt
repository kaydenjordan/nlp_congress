 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution  to support one of our closest allies in the world and partners, Israel,  as she defends herself against terrorist attacks.   I thank Chairman McCaul for his leadership in bringing this to the  floor. I also thank Chairman McCaul as well as Ranking Member Meeks for  their leadership and working together, crafting this resounding  statement of support, and doing so in a unifying, bipartisan way.   Mr. Speaker, on October 7, we watched in horror as Hamas terrorists  unleashed a brutal assault on Israel's families and slaughtered so  many. We have gone into some detail about the brutality of it all. It  is brutality outside the circle of civilized human behavior. The  attacks were horrible.   With this resolution, the United States Congress resoundingly  declares our support for Israel, not with revenge but with justice,  that justice will be done.   While doing so, we continue to remain concerned about the  humanitarian situation in Gaza, with civilians caught in the middle of  the war. I echo Secretary Blinken's call for a humanitarian pause so  that innocent lives can be saved.   Mr. Speaker, 80 years ago, on the floor of this House, my father,  Thomas D'Alesandro, as a Member of Congress from Maryland, called upon  the Roosevelt administration to support the establishment of the State  of Israel in what was known as Palestine at the time. He was early in  calling for that, so it is in my DNA to protect that State of Israel.   Hamas is dedicated to the destruction of the State of Israel. Hamas  has been declared a terrorist organization by the United States. Hamas  must be destroyed, but in destroying them, we must protect the children  in Gaza. They use them as shields. We want to protect them.   This resolution, with overwhelming bipartisan support on the floor of  the House, is so necessary. I urge a unanimous vote and thank the  chairman and ranking member for their leadership.
