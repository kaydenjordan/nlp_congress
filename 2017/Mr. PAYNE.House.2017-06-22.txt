 Mr. Speaker, Senate Republicans have negotiated their  TrumpCare bill in the dark, and that is just where it should have  stayed. And just wait until the CBO score comes out next week.   Knowing that this bill will cause immeasurable harm to millions of  American families who will lose their coverage and protections while  facing higher costs, I do not understand how anyone could support it.   We constantly hear from our Republican colleagues that TrumpCare  keeps their promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act. So you keep that  misguided promise, but at what cost?   We are talking about the lives of real people, millions of real  people. Aren't they worth more than just a tax cut for the rich?   Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to scrap this disastrous  bill. Let's work together to improve the Affordable Care Act and not  destroy it.                            ____________________
