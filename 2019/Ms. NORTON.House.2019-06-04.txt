 Mr. Speaker, the treatment of the Dreamers, brought to  this country by their parents and others with unsettled status, is un- American and must be set right by the rational process outlined by H.R.  6, the American Dream and Promise Act of 2019. The Dreamers have come  to symbolize the entire group of individuals who have been left in the  shadows, where they experience the fear of the hunted. The Dreamers  have lived among us for almost their entire lives. I have invited  Dreamers who live in the District of Columbia to a public meeting to  talk about their lives. They are fulfilling their own dreams going to  college and working in good jobs.   The shame of our failure to permanently settle the Dreamers question  will not go away as long as we leave them and others living without  settled legal status twisting in the wind. H.R. 6 does not pretend to  settle this issue. Rather, it establishes a path to citizenship not  only for Dreamers but also for Temporary Protected Status and Deferred  Enforced Departure holders.   Never before in American history have we left any group of people in  our country in legal limbo. H.R. 6 presents the ordered and predictable  process this issue has long needed. These issues and these people will  not go away. The House has an obligation to use our new majority to set  this issue on the path to resolution.
