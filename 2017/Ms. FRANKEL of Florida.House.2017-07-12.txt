 Mr. Speaker, I also give my thanks to Mr.  Royce; Mr. Smith; and my colleague, Ms. Bass, for their leadership. I  am very proud to be part of this bipartisan act to stop what we call  modern-day slavery of men, women, and children.   Human trafficking is a global crisis of epic proportions. After drug  trafficking, it is the number two criminal enterprise on Earth. Yes, it  happens right here in our own backyard.   Recently, I met Shandra. She is a mother; a college graduate; and  formerly a banker in Indonesia, until a financial crisis hit. Looking  for a better life for her family, she came legally to the United  States, taking what she thought was a job in the hospitality industry.  The minute she landed in the United States of America, her hopes turned  into a living hell. It is hard to put what happened to her in words.   Shandra's new employer held her by force. With threats of violence,  he drugged her and sold her into prostitution day after day, for years.  Finally, after multiple attempts to escape, she actually climbed  through a bathroom window and went to safety.   Mr. Speaker, shockingly, as we speak here in this room today, there  are millions of innocent victims like Shandra who are held in some form  of cruel servitude. Our effort today will save lives and prevent  horrific suffering. I am proud to be part of these efforts.
