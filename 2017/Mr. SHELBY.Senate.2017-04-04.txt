 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I wish to address the Senate for a few  minutes about the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch, which is the topic  of the day and has been the topic for weeks. It probably has been said,  but I am going to go through some of it again.   Judge Gorsuch is a native of Denver, CO, where he currently resides  with his  [[Page S2399]]  wife Louise and their two daughters. He is currently 49 years old.   I want to talk about some of his credentials. Judge Gorsuch received  his bachelor of arts degree from Columbia University in 1988, his juris  doctor from Harvard Law School in 1991, and a doctorate in legal  philosophy from Oxford University in the UK in 2004.   At Columbia, he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, a Truman scholar at  Harvard Law School, and a Marshall scholar at Oxford.   Following law school, Judge Gorsuch served as a law clerk to Federal  appellate judge David Sentelle and then to Justice Byron White of the  U.S. Supreme Court and Associate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy of the  Supreme Court.   In 1995, Judge Gorsuch entered private practice as an associate of  Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel, and he was elected partner  in that law firm in 1998. His practice focused on general litigation in  both trial and appellate matters.   Judge Gorsuch left private practice in 2005 to serve as the Principal  Deputy to the Associate Attorney General at the Justice Department in  Washington.   President George W. Bush nominated Judge Gorsuch to the Tenth Circuit  Court of Appeals, located in Denver, on May 10, 2006. He was confirmed  in the Senate by a voice vote on July 20, 2006.   We talk about qualifications for judges. I want to share some of his.  Judge Gorsuch has served over a decade on the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the Tenth Circuit. He has an outstanding judicial record that speaks  for itself. He has participated in over 2,700 appeals on the Tenth  Circuit, and 97 percent of them have been unanimously decided. In those  cases, he was in the majority 99 percent of the time.   Of the approximately 800 opinions he authored on the Tenth Circuit,  98 percent of his opinions were unanimous, even on a circuit where 7  out of the 12 active judges were appointed by Democratic Presidents.  His opinions on the Tenth Circuit have the lowest rate of dissenting  judges at 1.5 percent. That is unheard of. Out of the eight cases he  has decided that were reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court, seven were  affirmed and one was vacated.   Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in  2006 was met without opposition, and he was confirmed by voice vote.   Notably, Senators serving during this time include a lot of my former  colleagues: then-Senator Barack Obama, Senator Joe Biden, Senator  Hillary Clinton, Senator John Kerry, Senator Harry Reid, and 12 other  current sitting Democratic Senators in this body, including the  minority leader, Chuck Schumer.   In March, the American Bar Association, ABA, unanimously gave Judge  Gorsuch a ``well qualified'' rating, their highest possible mark.  Minority Leader Schumer and Senator Leahy have both previously referred  to the ABA as the ``gold standard by which judicial candidates are  judged.''   In the area of jurisprudence, Judge Gorsuch has a mainstream judicial  philosophy, which he clearly articulated during the Senate Judiciary's  confirmation hearing.   I believe his record is unequivocal in that he believes judicial  decisions should be based on the law and the Constitution and not  personal policy preferences. He has a deep commitment to the  Constitution and its protections established by our Founding Fathers,  including the separation of powers, federalism, and the Bill of Rights.  Judge Gorsuch's decisions demonstrate that he consistently applies the  law as it is written, fairly and equally to all individuals.   Additional information about Judge Gorsuch: The American people  deserve to have their voices heard in selecting Justice Scalia's  replacement. This is what we are doing.   Some of my colleagues intend to oppose Judge Gorsuch based solely on  the fact that they disagree with the outcome of the Presidential  election.   During President Trump's campaign last year, he clearly defined the  type of Justice he wished to nominate to the current vacancy. He even  published, as you will recall, a list of 21 judges who possessed what  he believed are the necessary qualifications to serve on the U.S.  Supreme Court.   Following Judge Gorsuch's nomination, he sat for over 20 hours of  questioning in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in the Senate-- the longest hearing of any 21st-century nominee. Additionally, he was  given 299 questions for the record by my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle. This also is the most in recent Supreme Court  confirmation history.   Simply put, I believe this is the most open and transparent process  in choosing a Supreme Court nominee ever conducted by an  administration. By filibustering this nomination, some of my colleagues  are breaking a nearly 230-year tradition of approving Supreme Court  nominees by a simple-majority vote.   I believe the American people spoke clearly when they elected  President Trump. I believe this is the American people's seat, and I  believe Judge Gorsuch is an exceptional choice for the Supreme Court.  He deserves an up-or-down vote, and that is why I believe we are  getting ready in the next few hours to confirm him.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, on April 6, 2017, the Joint Committee of  Congress on the Library organized, elected a chairman, a vice chairman,  and adopted committee rules for the 115th Congress.

Pursuant to rule  XXVI, paragraph 2, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I ask unanimous  consent that a copy of the committee rules be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   Rules of Procedure of the Joint Committee of Congress on the Library--                              115th Congress                      Title I--Meetings of the Committee         1.

In addition, the committee staff       will email or telephone reminders of committee meetings to       all members of the committee or to the appropriate staff       assistants in their offices.        4. A copy of the committee's intended agenda enumerating       separate items of committee business will normally be sent to       all members of the committee by the staff director at least 1       day in advance of all meetings. This does not preclude any       member of the committee from raising appropriate non-agenda       topics.        5. Any witness who is to appear before the committee in any       hearing shall file with the clerk of the committee at least 3       business days before the date of his or her appearance, a       written statement of his or her proposed testimony and an       executive summary thereof, in such form as the Chairman may       direct, unless the Chairman waived such a requirement for       good cause.                              Title II--Quorums         1. Pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(1) of rule XXVI of the       Standing Rules, 4 members of the committee shall constitute a       quorum.        2.

Voting in the committee on any issue will normally be by       voice vote.        2. If a third of the members present so demand, a recorded       vote will be taken on any question by roll call.

The results of the roll call votes taken in any meeting       upon a measure, or any amendment thereto, shall be stated in       the committee report on that measure unless previously       announced by the committee, and such report or announcement       shall include a tabulation of the votes cast in favor and the       votes cast in opposition to each measure and amendment by       each member of the committee. (Paragraph 7(b) and (c) of rule       XXVI of the Standing Rules.)        4. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all measures and       matters before the committee. However, the vote of the       committee to report a measure or matters shall require the       concurrence of a majority of the members of the committee who       are physically present at the time of the vote. Proxies will       be allowed in such cases solely for the purpose of recording       a member's position on the question and then only in those       instances when the absentee committee member has been       informed of the question and has affirmatively requested that       he be recorded.
