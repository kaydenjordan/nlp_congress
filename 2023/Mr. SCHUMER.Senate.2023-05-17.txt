 Yesterday, I joined Congressional leaders to meet with  President Biden for a good meeting about this year's spending  priorities while also affirming the need to protect the full faith and  credit of the United States. The meeting was the most positive we have  had. There was goodwill, an openness to work together, and it was a  promising step forward.   Everyone agreed to a few important points: We must work to take  default off the table, and a bipartisan bill in each Chamber that can  get enough votes to pass in each Chamber is the best solution for  averting default.   Bipartisanship is needed. It is the only way to go. It is the only  way we have solved these problems in the past. No bill premised on  brinksmanship or hostage-taking can pass through both the House and  Senate, and the other side recognized that today.   Instead, we must focus on a bipartisan bill that can get the votes to  actually become law. We still have a lot more work to do between now  and the day we bring the legislation to the floor, but yesterday's  meeting was a promising step in the right direction.   Now, I asked the Speaker if he agreed that this needed to be a  bipartisan process, and he said yes. Again, this, I believe, is a  promising step in the right direction. Nobody will get everything they  want in these discussions, and I hope nobody--nobody--draws redlines in  the sand.   Nobody should ever use default as a hostage, where they say, ``Unless  you do this, we will default,'' because the consequences would be  disastrous. Bipartisanship was the key to averting default under Trump.  It is the key to averting default under President Biden, and it will be  the key to averting default before June 1.   I am hopeful we can reach an agreement as soon as possible.  Defaulting on the debt would be the worst--the worst--outcome for this  country, as I have outlined repeatedly in speeches in this body. There  is no need--none--to subject the American people to the anguish of  default, and I am glad both sides are making a good effort, for now, of  removing default from the table.
