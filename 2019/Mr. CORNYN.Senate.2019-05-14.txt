 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time  during recess, adjournment, morning business, and leader remarks count  postcloture on the Lee nomination.    Mr. President, over the years, I have spent a great deal  of time on the Senate floor highlighting the evolving challenges along  our southern border.   My home State of Texas shares a 1,200-mile common border with Mexico,  so any major shift in terms of who or what is arriving at the border is  felt quickly by my constituents and by my State. In recent months, I  have heard from the Border Patrol, local officials, nongovernmental  organizations, community leaders, businesses of every size, and just  average citizens alike about how the situation today is far more  challenging than it has ever been before.   In the past, the number of illegal border crossings have fluctuated  by varying degrees, but now we have seen a complete shift not only in  number but also in the ``who'' of those crossing. While we used to see  single adults from Mexico, that is simply not the case anymore. There  is no new net migration from Mexico, we are told. As Border Patrol  Chief Carla Provost highlighted in a hearing last week, 68 percent of  those apprehended are now families or unaccompanied children, and that  is on purpose. The human smugglers have figured out what our laws are  and how to exploit them in order to successfully place people in the  United States by overwhelming our system. The 68 percent of families or  unaccompanied children amounts to roughly 293,000 apprehensions so far  this fiscal year--293,000. What is more, 70 percent of the  unaccompanied children and families are occurring in just two Border  Patrol sectors, the El Paso sector and the Rio Grande Valley sector,  making the State of Texas and its border communities the hardest hit.   The vast majority of those crossing aren't from Mexico. They are  coming from Mexico, but they are actually coming through Mexico. So far  this fiscal year, 74 percent of the Border Patrol's apprehensions along  the southern border are people from Guatemala, Honduras, and El  Salvador--what is called the Northern Triangle. This means that in 7  months, nearly 341,000 people from the Northern Triangle of Central  America made the decision to leave their homes and to make a dangerous  journey in the hands of a human smuggler to illegally enter the United  States. Here is another shocking statistic, Acting Secretary of the  Department of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan recently noted that  Guatemala and Honduras have seen more than 1 percent of their total  population migrate to the United States in the first 7 months of this  fiscal year--more than 1 percent of their entire population.   While it is abundantly clear that the mass movement of people across  our border is a problem that must be addressed, it is an understatement  to say that Members of the Senate disagree on what a solution looks  like. We spent a lot of time debating the semantics of the entire  situation without making any real progress. I believe our strategy to  alleviate this humanitarian crisis hinges on three important steps:   First, we need stronger physical security at the border. The experts  have told us that means three things: barriers and, in-hard-to-control  places, people--that is law enforcement--and technology. That is what  our frontline officers and agents need to do their jobs, and that is  what we should provide.   Secondly, we need to provide Immigration and Customs Enforcement and  Customs and Border Patrol with the authorities--that means the laws-- they need in order to effectively do their job. That includes closing  the loopholes that are being exploited by the human smugglers and the  illegal immigrants entering the country because they have figured out  how to game the system. They know our laws better than most Americans  do.   Both of these are what are called pull factors--what attract people  to come to the United States illegally. They are gaps in our physical  security and legal system that encourage Central American migrants to  make the dangerous journey north because their chances of making their  way into the interior of our country are pretty high.    There is a critical third step here. We also need to eliminate the  push factors. That is what is driving people from Central America on  that dangerous road north through Mexico into the United States. The  reason so many of these families are leaving their home countries in  the first place boils down to poverty and violence. We know these three  countries in the Northern Triangle are plagued by crime, corruption,  and a lack of economic opportunities. Sometimes it is difficult for  Americans to grasp the deep-seated nature of these problems and why it  is so tough to resolve them because it is such a far cry from what most  have experienced here at home.   In October of 2018, the International Organization for Migration  conducted a survey of a group of Salvadoran migrants who banded  together as a caravan to make the journey north. It found that 52  percent of the people who were coming from El Salvador cited economic  opportunity as their motive for leaving the region, 18 percent cited  violence and insecurity, 2 percent said they wanted to unify their  families, and 28 percent cited some combination of these factors. Now,  this may not be the case for migrants from each country, but it paints  a broad picture of how these challenges are affecting them.   We must help these countries address their problems, but we can't do  it for them. Looking at South America and the successful efforts we  have had to help countries rebuild themselves into successful economies  with security for their people, there is one that stands out the most,  and that is Colombia. What is different about Colombia from the rest of  these countries is we had, one, a bipartisan plan that was applied over  many years by both Republican and Democratic administrations. We also  had a strong partner, a leader, President Uribe in Colombia, which is  something we are missing in Central America. Then we had a plan, as the  name Plan Colombia suggests, so we knew what we were doing, and we knew  how to measure success. We don't have any of these things now as part  of our effort to help the Central American countries help themselves.   Having said that, I think that is a challenge we need to rise to, to  find a way of helping these countries create economic opportunities and  security for their people so we can help relieve some of the strain on  our own border.   This morning, my colleague from Delaware, Senator Carper, and I  participated in a discussion by the Bush  [[Page S2801]]  Center and the Atlantic Council on how to promote economic growth in  the Northern Triangle. I think it is very helpful for these think tanks  to gather experts and come up with proposals we can consider and then  vote on. Frankly, it is very hard for Congress--we don't have really  the bandwidth to come up with proposals from the start, so it is  helpful to have smart people from around the country, experts, who can  help advise us.   We know this: One of the most fundamental problems standing in the  way of prosperity for Central America is the security crisis. Because  of endemic corruption and powerful criminal organizations, a genuine  rule of law is missing in these countries and has been for generations.  We have had some successes partnering with our closest neighbor in this  crisis, Mexico, and I believe we can continue to build upon some of the  programs we already have in place there. For example, the United States  has partnered with Mexico in recent years through programs like the  Merida Initiative to combat drug trafficking, transnational organized  crime, and money laundering. There is a need for increased security  cooperation and burden sharing to lessen the regional insecurity and  damage caused by the growing influence of cartels, gangs, and  transnational criminal organizations. We have directed funds toward  strengthening communities and empowering the Mexican criminal justice  system and judicial system to help combat the rampant culture of  impunity that exists in Mexico, and I believe we have made some  marginal gains, although there is a lot of work that needs to be done.  We have also shared intelligence and cooperated in providing various  forms of security.   The Bureau of International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement  continues to work to develop programs to combat international narcotics  and crime, especially in Central America, but U.S. funding for this  program in Mexico has stagnated. Additional aid for this program would  combat transnational criminal organizations, improve drug interdiction,  and train Mexican law enforcement and judicial personnel.   Moving forward, we should begin to look at the effectiveness of these  existing programs so we can take full advantage of the work they do and  ensure they are modernized to confront the evolving epidemic. It is  nearly impossible to determine how or if this money is benefiting the  people hit hardest by this crime and corruption, and that needs to  change. It is no news that the Trump administration has recently  announced its decision to suspend aid to Central America. While I  believe aid to these countries is important in providing any semblance  of long-term stability, I also think it is important to fundamentally  examine where this money is going, what we are trying to achieve, and  how effective these programs are at achieving that goal. That seems  pretty simple, pretty straightforward, but we actually don't have a  plan, and we don't have any metrics to measure our progress.   We know the problem is getting worse because the number of people  showing up on our border just continues to increase.   If we are going to ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill, we  have a fiduciary duty to them to make sure the money is going to be  well spent in pursuit of American interests. We can't do that right  now.   Every dollar should be responsibly spent on initiatives to strengthen  security cooperation, improve governance, enhance public security, and  promote prosperity through pro-growth reforms.   If that is not the case, then we need to take a hard look at how we  can improve our foreign aid program.   We need to provide the resources and training to help Central  American countries stabilize their governments and their economies.  But, again, we can't do this for them. We can't want an outcome more  than they do. They need to want this. They need to provide the  leadership to be a partner with us to help execute an agreed-upon  common plan, and then we need to be able to show the American taxpayers  that their money is being well spent because we are making measurable  progress.   When the people begin to see the opportunity and safety in their home  countries, making a long migration northward becomes less of a  necessity.   I hope we can have these continued discussions here in Congress over  the coming months. But even more than that, I hope we can focus on this  as a problem that needs to be solved--one that is above politics and  beyond politics and one that really threatens the security and safety  of our own country because not only do we know that migrants come to  the United States fleeing poverty and violence, but we also know these  same criminal organizations transmit drugs into the United States. They  move people for human trafficking and sex slavery, and this is a  challenge for our country, as well as the entire region.   We can do this if we will simply focus on it and work together on  this as a problem to be solved. But, again, we can't do this for these  countries in Central America.   I think President Trump was correct to suspend the money we are  spending there until we actually have a plan and a willing partner to  work with to implement and execute this plan in a way that can  demonstrate measurable progress.   We have a model in Colombia where this has worked in the past, but  around the world where the United States is engaged in nation building,  there are not a lot of models for success. There are a lot of examples  of failure because of the complexity and difficulty of this, but this  is something that should be getting our attention and something that  should be a priority for all of us.
