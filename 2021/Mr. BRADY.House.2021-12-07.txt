 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, today ought to be a rare day for bipartisanship on  behalf of patients and healthcare providers across America. Sadly, it  is another day for Democrats' partisanship.   Providing needed funding for Medicare providers, our local doctors  and hospitals, especially as we recover from the pandemic, is just  common sense. We should be on the same page. In fact, we were, as early  as a few hours ago, when Republicans also introduced legislation to  help our healthcare providers.   Instead, Democrats have decided to push a very partisan agenda that  has led to crisis after crisis, including the one we addressed today.   Our border communities are overwhelmed. Bidenflation is robbing  American paychecks. The President has mishandled the economy so badly,  he is already nearly a million jobs short of his promises from his last  $2 trillion spending binge.   Now, patients and doctors are being held hostage to pave the way for  trillions of more reckless spending that most Americans don't even  want.   Regrettably, Democrats are politicizing needed funding for Americans'  healthcare with a poison pill that provides a process for lifting the  debt ceiling, absolutely unrelated, and using patients and access to  local doctors as leverage to increase the national debt on our children  and grandchildren.   Last month, knowing this was coming, Republicans on the Ways and  Means Committee called for a hearing, a bipartisan hearing, to address  the issues around our doctors and our healthcare providers and  reimbursement.   In a letter, we wrote to our Democrat colleagues, who we believed  shared the same concerns, and said: ``If the stability of healthcare  providers is, in fact, still a priority for you,'' let's hold a hearing  so that we can discuss a legislative solution going forward to maintain  patient access to our local providers.   Instead, once again, my Democrat colleagues are choosing to go it  alone because seemingly they are obsessed with spending taxpayer  dollars wastefully.   We know there is bipartisan support for doctors. We should do a  standalone bill. But the truth is, House Republicans can't support  using patients and access to local doctors as leverage to increase the  national debt on our children.   We know there is bipartisan support for providers, and we know this  could stand alone as a bill. Unfortunately, this is not the path the  Democrats have chosen.   Make no mistake: This debt ceiling is being lifted to pay for  trillions of wasteful socialist spending. This debt ceiling limit is  increased until 2023, all to accommodate trillions of wasteful  spending, and Americans know it.   The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has noted that  President Biden's Build Back Better bill would cost nearly $5 trillion,  while the President and others continue to claim falsely that this  costs zero dollars.   Unfortunately for the President and the taxpayers who will have to  foot the bill, The Washington Post fact checker found this claim false  and misleading. They said it ``would take some dubious gimmicks that  help disguise the true cost of President Biden's agenda,'' and these  gimmicks are just to justify paying for absolute waste.   Democrats give away hundreds of billions of dollars to special  interests and the wealthy, literally sending government checks to the  top 1 percent and the biggest corporations.  [[Page H6931]]    Democrats protect so-called green companies from their new minimum  tax. Wealthy individuals with up to $500,000 in income every year enjoy  their own green welfare, including a $12,500 check from single moms and  working Americans so they can buy the wealthy a luxury electric  vehicle.   Democrats force the 90 percent of Americans who don't join a union to  subsidize the few who do. Democrats provide loopholes and tax cuts for  special interests like trial lawyers.   Democrats would increase the $10,000 SALT cap, providing wealthy  taxpayers with a windfall of a quarter of a trillion dollars to help  the wealthy.   Two out of three millionaires get a tax cut. One out of three middle- class families get a tax hike. Where are their priorities?   Democrats' tax and spending spree will more than double Americans'  chances of being audited as it targets lower- and middle-income earners  to make sure they pay their ``fair share.''   This proposal and that proposal will lead to an additional 1.2  million IRS audits each year focused on the middle class, and we will  see $200 billion of new taxes on our Main Street small businesses.   What does it mean for Americans? More than double the chance of being  audited, and not just for the rich.   Americans ought to take a step back and see what we are doing tonight  as shameful. That is exactly what it is.   Democrats are threatening to hold up payments for our local doctors  and healthcare providers, as they fight out of the pandemic, so  Democrats can pay for measures they claim we need because of the  pandemic.   We have gone from never letting a crisis go to waste to never letting  a crisis get in the way of waste.   This debt ceiling crisis didn't have to happen this way. House  Democrats have known this day was coming for 2 years, but they never  bothered to pass a budget, never passed appropriations bills, and  failed to have any bipartisan discussion. Here we are at the last  minute.   Madam Speaker, commonsense Americans will not let their doctors and  healthcare providers be held hostage to this debt ceiling crisis. We  strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith), the Republican leader of the Select Revenue  Measures Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Smith), the Republican leader of the Budget Committee and  a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), leader of the Republican Doctors Caucus who worked  to put these solutions together.    Madam Speaker, may I ask, is the gentleman prepared to  close?    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   The claim we just heard, that only Democrats want to prevent these  cuts to our local doctors and hospitals, is just nonsense. Democrats  and Republicans have worked hard together to extend the moratorium on  the sequester cuts on our providers, our doctors and hospitals; to  provide a 3 percent payment increase for our physicians; to make sure,  in the administration's proposals, to help increase reimbursement for  primary care physicians. You don't cut the payment for specialty  doctors, many of whom were hurt so hard during COVID.   We also worked with our Democrat colleagues to delay for a year the  proposed cuts by this administration on our labs and our oncologists,  and we worked together to make sure other cuts didn't occur.   All that bipartisanship was all on track up until a few hours ago  when my Democrat colleagues decided they would hold this hostage, hold  the healthcare reimbursements for doctors and hospitals hostage for  their debt ceiling crisis that they created.   It really is, I think, in a day and age where we have seen this one- party rule for an entire year, the arrogance of this power going to  their heads. It is unfortunate that they couldn't continue to work just  a few hours longer together with Republicans to provide help to our  physicians, hospitals, and providers.    This bill ought to be a stand-alone bill. We should never hold them  hostage for our colleagues' spending spree and socialist agenda.  Unfortunately, that is what our Democrat colleagues have done today.   We have introduced legislation as Republicans that mirrors our  Democrat colleagues because we believe so strongly together.  Unfortunately, one-party rule tore this apart.   That is why the American public is going to return the majority of  this House to Republicans in the next election and why President  Biden's approval ratings are at a terribly low rate, a disapproval rate  of 57 percent. It is unfortunate. We ought to be working together on  that.    I would be glad to yield 15 seconds to the gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time. Our colleagues have  known for 2 years this debt ceiling was here, never passed a budget,  never passed an appropriations bill. They let this crisis occur and  built it time after time after time when we could easily have come  together.   By the way, our Democrat colleagues hold the House; they hold the  Senate; they hold the White House. They have the power to pass the debt  ceiling, and they have had that for the entire year.   To my Democrat friends, you can try to sell this snake oil all you  want, but the truth of the matter is, you wrecked a bipartisan  agreement for your debt ceiling crisis. That is what we are voting on  today.   Republicans support help for healthcare providers. We will not allow  them to be held hostage to this debt ceiling crisis.   Madam Speaker, I urge strong opposition to this bill and urge my  Democrat colleagues to someday work with us. Let's work together on  these issues. I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  2000     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
