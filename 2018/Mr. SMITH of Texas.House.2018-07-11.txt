 Mr. Speaker, Gallup recently polled Americans on  their perceptions of bias, inaccuracy, and misinformation in news  reporting. Their survey found:   Sixty-two percent said the news they read in newspapers, see on  television, or hear on the radio is biased;   Forty-four percent believe the news they read in newspapers, see on  television, or hear on the radio is inaccurate;   More than a third described the news they see on these channels as  misinformation--false or inaccurate information that is presented as if  it were true. In other words, fake news.   The same poll found 8 out of 10 adults feel angry or bothered by  seeing biased information.   It is obvious that the news media have abandoned objective, fact- based reporting and are instead promoting a liberal agenda. Their news  reports only tell one side of the story: their side. Until the news  media returns to objective reporting, Americans will continue to view  them skeptically.                            ____________________
