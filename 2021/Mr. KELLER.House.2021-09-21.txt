 Madam Speaker, later this afternoon the House is set to  consider a continuing resolution on the Federal budget. Instead of  taking time to hold meaningful discussions about budget offsets and  reforms, Speaker Pelosi released bill text less than 24 hours before  the scheduled vote.   Make no mistake, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats have no interest  in reining in Washington's outrageous spending or addressing our  national debt, now well over $28 trillion, which our children and  grandchildren will have to repay.   Earlier this year, House Democrats rammed through a partisan  appropriations package that cracked the door open for their far left  priorities. Today, they are blowing the hinges off that door and  setting the stage for their $3.5 trillion tax-and-spend package, which  will devastate America's families and send the skyrocketing inflation  soaring to even greater heights.   That is not responsible. That is not good governance, and it is  certainly not good stewardship of Americans' taxpayer dollars.                            ____________________
