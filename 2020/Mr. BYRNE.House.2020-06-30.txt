 Mr. Speaker, this weekend America will celebrate its 244th  [[Page H2676]]  birthday. Unfortunately, we do so in a time of pandemic, a struggling  economy, and violent protests. But it is still our birthday, and we  should both commemorate and celebrate it.   We usually do a good job in our celebration, although this year will  be different since social distancing means we will be in smaller  groups, and public fireworks displays have been canceled. I suspect  most of us will find a way to gather with family and close friends to  cook out and show the red, white, and blue.   But a commemoration is more than that. Merriam-Webster defines  ``commemorate'' as ``to call to remembrance'' or ``to serve as a  memorial of.'' How many of us will stop and remember what it meant for  the Second Continental Congress to not only declare our independence  from Britain, but also to state our reasons for doing so in majestic  language positing the highest ideals?   Let me make a suggestion: This Fourth, get a copy of the Declaration  and read it. My extended family and friends usually get together and  have several of us read the various portions of the Declaration out  loud and then we talk about its meaning. It doesn't take much time, and  we always experience a renewed appreciation for the gift that is our  country. This year we will do it virtually, in smaller groups.   The Declaration was meant to be read out loud. Indeed, on July 4,  Congress not only voted to accept it but also provided for its  distribution to the States and to the Continental Army.   On July 6, John Hancock as president of Congress, sent letters to the  States and to General Washington enclosing broadsides of the  Declaration requesting that they have it ``proclaimed.'' It was read  out loud to celebrations in dozens of cities and towns in July and  August and to the Continental Army on July 9 as it prepared for the  British invasion of New York.   To some extent these events were meant to inform and inspire the  people of a newly independent Nation. But then, and now, the  Declaration is a defining document. It not only said we were an  independent Nation, but also who we aspire to be. Freedom and equality  were to be at the heart of the Nation's character. And the rights  stated in the Declaration, life, liberty, and the pursuit of the  happiness, are clearly labeled gifts from God himself to all of us.   The story of our country is really the unfolding of the efforts to  live up to these aspirations. President Lincoln used it as a primary  basis for arguing against slavery, as in the Gettysburg Address where  he famously said: ``Four score and 7 years ago our Fathers brought  forth, on this continent, a new Nation, conceived in liberty, and  dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.'' As a  result of the Civil War these ideals were enshrined in the 13th, 14th,  and 15th Amendments to the Constitution.   Martin Luther King used it in his 1963 ``I Have A Dream'' speech,  referring to the Declaration and to the Constitution as a promissory  note to all Americans, which he and others of the civil rights movement  called upon the Nation to honor. As a result of the movement, Congress  passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act and in 1965 the Voting Rights Act.   I know it is fashionable now among our Nation's elites to view  America as evil from our birth, evil in our institutions, and evil in  our character. That view is a myth untethered to the reality of our  history. This myth is just a false preamble to lay the groundwork for  their efforts to radically reorganize our society and have government  run every detail of our lives all the while piling tax upon tax upon  us. Isn't this type of government what caused the Founders to declare  independence in the first place? These elites call themselves  ``progressive,'' but their plan is actually a regression to a  tyrannical central government taxing us against our will.   Despite our faults, some of which have been grievous, we are a Nation  established upon the highest ideals which has the strength of its  character and institutions to self-correct as we strive toward those  ideals. Our history repeatedly demonstrates that is who we are.   David McCullough, the Pulitzer Prize winning author and historian,  several years ago told a gathering of those of us in Congress that  Americans would be more hopeful if we only knew our history. How true.  Complicated and contradictory, yes, but it is also a history of  spectacular success and of a major force for good here and abroad.   So this week let's celebrate and commemorate who we are. Let's pause  in the middle of our present troubles to renew our pride as Americans  and draw lessons from our founding and history for the resolution of  the issues of the day. And let us, like our Founders, ``mutually pledge  to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.''                            ____________________
