 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Byrne) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule,  which provides for consideration of two deeply flawed pieces of  legislation.   H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017, is yet  another attempt by this Republican majority to prioritize corporate  profits over ensuring people have access to safe and clean drinking  water.   This bill would not only threaten our clean water, it would also  undermine States' rights and Tribal rights by prioritizing power  generation above all else when deciding whether to grant or extend a  license to operate a hydropower project.   Simply put, this bill puts profits ahead of the public interest. By  giving a rubber stamp commission more power than other expert agencies,  the bill rigs the process in favor of power producers at the expense of  States, Tribes, and our environment.   This bill prioritizes profits over clean water and healthy fisheries  and should be strongly defeated. Protecting our families and our  environment should always be our first priority.   In another giveaway to corporate interests, House Republicans are  also bringing to the floor this week H.R. 3441, the so-called Save  Local Business Act, under the false claim that it eliminates  uncertainty for workers and protects small businesses.   The truth is a very different story, Mr. Speaker. Joint employment  standards ensure workers can hold employers accountable for violating  wage and hour laws, child labor, or refusing to collectively bargain.  This bill represents a significant and dangerous break from that  standard and would undermine the rights of American workers.   This legislation rewards companies that rent employees from staffing  agencies instead of hiring them directly, and allows them to evade  responsibility for upholding the rights of those employees, even though  they profit from their work.   This bill is not about helping workers or small businesses. This is  all about giving powerful companies even more power over their  employees.   But, Mr. Speaker, what is just as troubling as the content of the  underlying bills is the process Speaker Ryan and his Republican  leadership team routinely use to call up this terrible legislation.   Today we are considering the 49th completely closed rule of the 115th  Congress. That is right. Today House Republicans are breaking their own  record for the most closed session of Congress in history. It is  astounding. This is something you would celebrate in Putin's Russia,  not here in the United States.   Since he first took the gavel in 2015, Speaker Ryan has continue to  shamelessly break his promise to allow a fair and open legislative  process here in this House.   In Speaker Ryan's first speech as Speaker in October of 2015, he  said: ``We need to let every Member contribute. . . . Open up the  process. Let people participate. A neglected minority will gum up the  works. A respected minority will work in good faith. Instead of trying  to stop the majority, they might try to become the majority.''   Speaker Ryan and I disagree on a great many issues, but I strongly  agree with what he said in that 2015 speech. We do need to let every  Member contribute and open up the process here in the House. We do need  the majority party to respect the minority party so we can actually  work together on bipartisan solutions.   But in the 2 years since Speaker Ryan took the gavel, he has, sadly,  failed to deliver on his commitment to open up the legislative process.  Things have only gotten worse. In fact, Speaker Ryan is the only  Speaker who has not allowed a truly open rule to give Members the  opportunity and the chance to do what their constituents sent them here  to do and to offer different perspectives and ideas on how to improve  legislation.   With each new closed rule they bring to the floor, shutting out  amendments from both Democrats and Republicans, the cynical hypocrisy  grows louder and louder. Instead of the people's House, this has,  sadly, become ``only the people who agree with Paul Ryan's House.''   I guess my question for the Speaker would be: Did you mean any of  what you said? Did you forget all those promises you made? Or did you  have absolutely no intention of keeping those promises once you were in  power?''   Every single Member of this House of Representatives was elected to  represent the people of their district, but  [[Page H8537]]  we cannot do that if the party in the majority blatantly uses strong- arm tactics like these that prevent us from doing our jobs.   In 2015, Speaker Ryan also said: ``We need to return to regular  order. We are the body closest to the people. Every 2 years, we face  the voters. . . . We represent them. We are supposed to study up and do  the homework that they cannot do. So when we do not follow regular  order--when we rush to pass bills a lot of us do not understand--we are  not doing our job. Only a fully functioning House can truly represent  the people.''   Where do I begin?   Literally just a few months ago, Speaker Ryan and the Republican  leaders of this House were recklessly steamrolling their healthcare  bill to the House floor without holding anything close to the number of  hearings that we held when the Affordable Care Act was passed.   Instead, they led a haphazard process where the bill was drafted in  secret behind closed doors--locked doors--without any input from rank  and file Members of Congress and the American people. Mr. Speaker, that  is not regular order. That is unconscionable. That disrespects this  House.   Today, when asked by a reporter about this record-breaking closed  process, Speaker Ryan responded: ``Absolutely we have an open  process.''   Really?   Let's review his record this Congress: Zero open rules--zero. Forty- nine completely closed rules.   Open process?   Open process my foot, Mr. Speaker.   I guess in the age of Donald Trump, words simply don't matter  anymore. Black is white, up is down, open is closed, and politicians  can say whatever they think sounds good and they think they can get  away with it--facts be damned.   If Speaker Ryan were serious about a fair and open process, he would  not turn this House into a rubber stamp for Donald Trump. He would let  us be the independent voice the people of our districts elected us to  be. He would not routinely shut out the voices of Democrats and  Republicans. He would let this House actually debate the serious  legislation and issues that come before us.                                time  1245    With one closed rule after another on each bill that comes to the  floor, Speaker Ryan has completely shut out both Democrats and rank- and-file Republicans, routinely blocking amendments we offer.   This is not how the Congress is supposed to work. Our constituents  deserve a Congress that actually debates the bills that will affect  their lives. They deserve better.   I refuse to sit by while the Republican leadership makes a mockery of  this House. American voices will not be silenced.   The Speaker may grant promises of openness, inclusiveness, and  regular order, but we just lived through the most closed year in the  history of this institution, and the year isn't even over yet, Mr.  Speaker.   Republicans ought to remember that they will not always be in the  majority. I don't think a Democratic majority could be this bad on  basic process, even if we tried. But any Member who votes for this  record-breaking closed rule today had better not have crocodile tears  for regular order and openness when they find themselves in the  minority some day in the future. Anyone who supports 49 closed rules  and zero open rules in a single year loses all credibility on the issue  of openness.   My Republican friends should be ashamed--ashamed--of diminishing this  House and diminishing its Members and their thoughtful ideas. I urge  Democrats and Republicans to take a stand and vote ``no'' on this  closed rule.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thought I had heard everything. The gentleman from  Alabama got up and said how proud he is of the Rules Committee and of  the process in this House. Oh, my God. The fact that the gentleman  would get up and say that with a straight face, you take my breath  away. It is unbelievable.   Today, we are considering our 49th closed rule of the 115th Congress,  officially making this the most closed session in Congress in history,  and the gentleman is proud of that.   More than half of the rules Republicans have reported out of the  Rules Committee have not allowed any amendments. That means that no  Member, Democrat or Republican, can offer their ideas on the House  floor.   The gentleman says: Well, we want to prevent killer amendments from  being made in order. So all the Republicans that offer amendments to  the Rules Committee have killer amendments? It is ridiculous to say  that about the Democratic amendments.   In total, just so the gentleman understands this, in total, the Rules  Committee has blocked more than 1,300 amendments this year. That is  1,300. They are all killer amendments? They are all not deserving of a  debate in the people's House?   They blocked 1,300 amendments, including 955 Democratic amendments.  You blocked 260 Republican amendments and 121 bipartisan amendments.   Blocking these amendments has a very real impact. A bad process  produces bad policy. Shutting out input from the vast majority of  Members, both Democrats and Republicans, may make it easier for you to  jam your agenda through the House, but that speed comes at the expense  of the policy itself.   When you block amendments, you are shutting down debate on incredibly  important issues, issues that this House of Representatives should be  debating and voting on.   Here are a few examples of germane amendments that the majority  didn't think were worthy of a debate and an up-or-down vote in the  House. These were totally in order.   There is my bipartisan amendment to require a Presidential  determination and congressional action to increase troop levels in  Afghanistan. With the longest war in American history, I thought maybe  it was worth some debate, but the Rules Committee said no to that.   Also, a bipartisan amendment to phase out the 2001 Authorization for  Use of Military Force, they blocked that.   Also, an amendment to ensure that the U.S. doesn't withdraw from the  Paris climate agreement--I know my Republican friends think climate  change is a hoax. They don't believe in science. But, you know what?  You ought to have the guts to debate it. But you blocked it.   You blocked an amendment for funding for troops in Syria.   You blocked an amendment to create the National Russian Threat  Response Center.   The list goes on and on and on.   These aren't killer amendments. These are important issues that get  blocked time and time again. These issues are at the very core of our  responsibilities here in Congress, and you blocked them from even being  considered by the full House.   In this Congress, the majority has blocked over 1,300 amendments from  coming to the floor. You are proud of that? That is disgraceful.   I truly hope that breaking the closed rule record is a wake-up call  and that some of you over there will decide to do things a little bit  differently around here and a little bit better around here, starting  next week with your tax bill, but I am not going to hold by breath.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Ellison).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota  (Mr. Ellison) for a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Signatory Wall and Ceiling Contractors Alliance, which says that this  legislation would not benefit small businesses that create good jobs.  It actually would place such employers at a permanent competitive  disadvantage to unscrupulous companies that seek to thrive solely at  the expense of the workers and taxpayer-funded social safety net  programs.                                                  Signatory Wall and                                    Ceiling Contractors Alliance,                                    Saint Paul, MN, October 5, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Leader Pelosi: I am writing on behalf       of the Signatory Wall and Ceiling Contractors Alliance       (SWACCA) to express our strong opposition to H.R. 3441, the       ``Save Local Business Act.'' This legislation will not       benefit honest small businesses that create good jobs with       family-sustaining wages and benefits. It will actually place       such employers at a permanent competitive disadvantage to       unscrupulous companies that seek to thrive solely at the       expense of their workers and taxpayer-funded social safety-      net programs.        SWACCA is a national alliance of wall and ceiling       contractors committed to working in partnership with our       workers and our customers to provide the highest-quality,       most efficient construction services. Through the superior       training, skill, and efficiency of our workers SWACCA       contractors are able to provide both cost-effective       construction services and middle class jobs with health and       retirement benefits. Our organization prides itself on       representing companies that accept responsibility for paying       fair wages, abiding by health and safety standards, workers       compensation laws, and unemployment insurance requirements.        Unfortunately, however, we increasingly find ourselves       bidding against companies that seek to compete solely on the       basis of labor costs. They do so by relieving themselves of       the traditional obligations associated with being an       employer. The news is littered with examples of contractors       who have sought to reduce costs by willfully violating the       laws governing minimum wage, overtime, workers compensation       unemployment insurance, and workplace safety protections. The       key to this disturbing business model is a cadre of labor       brokers who claim to provide a company with an entire       workforce that follows them to job after job. It is a       workforce that the actual wall or ceiling contractor controls       as a practical matter, but for which it takes no legal       responsibility. In this model workers receive no benefits,       are rarely covered by workers compensation or unemployment       insurance, and are frequently not paid in compliance with       federal and state wage laws. The joint employment doctrine is       an important means for forcing these unscrupulous contractors       to compete on a level playing field and to be held       accountable for the unlawful treatment of the workers they       utilize.        As an association representing large, medium, and small       businesses, we oppose H.R. 3441 because it proposes a       radical, unprecedented re-definition of joint employment       under both the FLSA and the NLRA that goes far beyond       reversing the standard articulated by the NLRB in Browning-      Ferris or retuning to any concept of joint employment that       has ever existed under the FLSA since the Act's passage. H.R.       3441's radical and unprecedented redefinition of joint       employment would proliferate the use of fly-by-night labor       brokers by ensuring that no contractor using a workforce       provided by a labor broker would ever be deemed a joint       employer. This is because the bill precludes a finding of       joint employment unless a company controls each ``of the       essential terms  [[Page H8540]]       and conditions of employment (including hiring employees,       discharging employee, determining individual employee rates       of pay and benefits, day-to-day supervision of employees,       assigning individual work schedules, positions and tasks, and       administering employee discipline)''. H.R. 3441 goes further       by expressly countenancing a company using labor brokers       retaining control of the essential aspects of the workers'       employment in a ``limited and routine manner'' without facing       any risk of being a joint employer.        Simply put, H.R. 3441 would create a standard that would       surely accelerate a race to the bottom in the construction       industry and many other sectors of the economy. It would       further tilt the field of competition against honest, ethical       businesses. Any concerns about the prior administration's       recently-rescinded interpretative guidance on joint       employment under the FLSA or the NLRB's joint employment       doctrine enunciated in Browning-Ferris can be addressed in a       far more responsible manner. Make no mistake, H.R. 3441 does       not return the law to any prior precedents or standards. It       creates a radical, new standard. This standard will help       unethical employers get rich not be creating more value, but       instead by ensuring their ability to treat American workers       as a permanent pool of low-wage, subcontracted labor that has       neither benefits nor any meaningful recourse against them       under our nation's labor and employment laws.        On behalf of the membership of SWACCA, thank you in advance       for your attention to our concerns about this legislation.       Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any       questions or require additional information.            Sincerely,                                                   Timothy J. Wies,                                                         President.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to go back to this point I have been making about  how this is now officially the most closed Congress in history, and I  think people need to keep that in mind before they vote for this rule.   But the gentleman from Alabama, again--I guess in this age of Trump,  I mean, you can twist things all kinds of different ways, you know-- bragged about all this great bipartisanship here. In that number that  he was referring to, a number of bills that were supported in a  bipartisan way, a big chunk of them are things like naming post  offices, suspension bills that are not controversial, Hats Off to  Teachers Day, those types of bills.   But on major legislation, whether it is healthcare or whether it is  this crummy tax bill that they are going to be bringing up, this place  is polarized because they block out any competing ideas.   Let me again reiterate for my colleagues: the Rules Committee has  blocked more than 1,300 amendments this year. That is just this year  alone.   Now, I already mentioned amendments on the AUMF, climate change,  Afghanistan, and more. I think those are important subjects. But the  Members offering these amendments, I think, no matter what you believe  about these amendments, deserve the right to be heard by the whole  House and to receive an up-or-down vote.   But here are a few more examples of the germane amendments that my  friends on the Republican side on the Rules Committee blocked under the  closed and structured rules. They blocked an amendment to prohibit the  repeal of DACA.   You know, I mean, 800,000 people's lives now are in the balance  because of Donald Trump rescinding the protection for these DREAMers,  and he said: Congress, you do it. You fix it.   Well, we tried to bring an amendment to the floor to have a debate  and fix it, and if my Republican friends don't want to vote for it,  they can vote ``no.'' But they blocked it. They blocked an amendment to  bar funds from being spent on this stupid, idiotic wall that the  President seems enamored with along our border. They blocked an  amendment to increase funding to fight rural domestic violence and  child abuse. They blocked several amendments to ensure the Trump family  doesn't profit off the Presidency, and we all know that they are, but  we can't even have that debate.   They blocked an amendment to protect asylum seekers and human  trafficking victims, and they blocked an amendment to ensure victims of  incest can have access to abortion care. I can go on and on and on. I  mean, they blocked Congressman Grothman's budget amendment twice. He is  a Republican. It was germane. He even testified before the Rules  Committee, but you blocked it.   Last week, you blocked Representative Jimmy Duncan's amendment to  allow doctors to practice medicine out of State on a volunteer basis.  Germane. It may be a good idea. It deserves to be debated. You blocked  it.   Is that a poison pill? Is that what the gentleman was referring to?  You know, process matters, and it matters for this reason, because when  you have a lousy process, you end up with a lousy product.   I know it is not sexy to talk about process, you know, but it is  important. It is important that we do our jobs, we debate these issues,  and that we listen to Democrats and Republicans, you know, come before  us with ideas: some we may agree with, some we may not, but let's have  that debate. What is wrong with that? Why is that such a radical idea  in this place? To get up and say I am proud of this; I am proud that we  are now the most closed Congress in the history of our country? That is  something to be proud of?   I think that is something to be ashamed of. I think it diminishes  this House of Representatives, and it diminishes every single member of  this House, Democrats and Republicans alike.   This is supposed to be a deliberative body. Let's deliberate. Let's  not negotiate things in the back room and then rush it to the floor and  demand an up-or-down vote. You know, you don't have a monopoly on good  ideas, and there are people in your own party who have some good ideas,  too, and I think we have good ideas as well. And if you want  bipartisanship, true bipartisanship, and you want to end the  polarization, open the process a little bit. That would be helpful.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is right, we can work together and come  together in a bipartisan way to pass a post office bill, to name a post  office after somebody, but my friends didn't think it was important to  come together and work with us on improving the Affordable Care Act,  totally cut out of the process.   I am willing to bet that when the tax bill comes up, the tax bill  that is going  [[Page H8541]]  to give wealthy people a big tax break and raise taxes on a lot of  middle-income families, that will be a very closed process as well. So  yeah, you know, Hats Off to Teachers Day, naming post offices, stuff  that, I mean, Western civilization, as we know it, doesn't hinge upon,  yeah, there is lot of bipartisanship here.   We had a couple of bills yesterday that passed unanimously. I mean,  we had votes on them. They were noncontroversial. But when it comes to  anything really meaningful, there is no bipartisanship, and there is no  openness here.   Again, let me repeat, so my colleagues understand this. This is the  most closed session of Congress ever in history, and the year is not  even over yet. Today, we are considering the 49th closed rule of the  115th Congress, officially making it the most closed session of  Congress in history. More than half of the rules the Republicans have  reported out of the Rules Committee have not allowed any amendments.  They have blocked over 1,300 amendments.   Speaker Ryan now is the only speaker who has not allowed an open  rule. Speakers Boehner, Pelosi, Hastert, and Gingrich all allowed some  open rules. This is the first time we never had one.   Mr. Speaker, again, I would say to my colleagues, process matters,  and this is really a sad day for this House, for this institution, and  I hope my Republican friends think about it a little bit because you  are doing great damage to this institution, and that makes me very sad.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to remind my colleagues as well that the  bill that the gentleman from Alabama is talking about, his bill, when  it--in the Rules Committee last night, the Rules Committee thought it  was appropriate to block three germane amendments from the ranking  member of the Education and the Workforce Committee. I mean, that is  the process that we are dealing with here.   The ranking member of that committee does not have the opportunity to  bring his ideas to the floor and debate them and get a vote up or down  on it. That is not right, and the Rules Committee, unfortunately, is  becoming a place where democracy goes to die, where every good idea is  routinely shot down, and it has to stop.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask my colleagues to defeat the previous  question. And I want to say to my colleagues that, a month ago, I stood  at this very podium, following our Nation's deadliest mass shooting in  Las Vegas, asking my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that  we can begin to study gun violence.                                time  1315    Now I stand here again, after yet another unthinkable tragedy,  begging my colleagues to allow us to take this small first step  following Sunday's deadly mass shooting at First Baptist Church in  Texas.   Twenty-six people in that church lost their lives to gun violence,  and that is from one single shooting. On an average day, 93 Americans  are killed with guns.   I would like to ask my colleagues again: What will it take?   If the deaths of those children in Sandy Hook Elementary School  weren't enough for Congress to take action, if the 49 lives lost in  Orlando weren't enough, if the 58 lives lost in Las Vegas weren't  enough, and if the 26 lives lost in Texas on Sunday aren't enough, then  nothing may ever be enough for Congress to have the courage to do the  right thing.   But I am hoping that is not true. Today we can decide to take the  first step in fighting gun violence with one vote. If we defeat the  previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.  Res. 367, which would establish the Select Committee on Gun Violence  Prevention.   It is time that we start having serious discussions about this  problem. Moments of silence and calls for prayer are not enough. We  have been doing that. It is time for us to get serious.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are bringing to the floor two bills today that I  think are bad bills. But, nonetheless, they represent the thinking of  the Republicans who are in charge of this Congress.   What is particularly distressing to me is that, on one of those  measures, it is being brought to the floor under a completely closed  process.   As I mentioned, last night, the ranking member of the Education and  the Workforce Committee came before the Rules Committee to offer three  germane amendments, and the Rules Committee said: No, you don't have  the right to have a debate on your ideas, even though they are  perfectly germane, on the House floor.   I think that is lousy. As a result, we come today and we make  history. This is now officially the most closed Congress ever in the  history of our country. My friends on the other side of the aisle are  getting up and talking about how proud they are. They talk about  bipartisanship. What they don't tell you is that most of the  bipartisanship are on things that really don't mean a lot: naming of  post offices and bills that pass by 435-0. On big things, on important  issues, they block us. I mentioned some of the things they blocked.   I know a lot of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle care deeply  about the DREAMers, since Donald Trump decided to throw their fates  into the balance. They want to do something to help these young people,  many of whom came when they were 1 year old or 2 years old and know no  other country as their home but this country. We tried to fix that  legislatively, as the President said he wanted us to do, and the  Republican majority blocked us. They blocked us.   We tried to offer an amendment again to say let's not invest a  gazillion dollars on a border wall. Let's invest in our people. Let's  build up our infrastructure. Let's construct the finest railway system  in the United States--in the world--over the next decade. They blocked  us.   We had an amendment to increase funding to fight rural domestic  violence and child abuse, and they blocked us.   We had an amendment to say we need to ensure that this culture of  corruption that we see in the White House doesn't grow any bigger, that  the Trump family doesn't benefit from the taxpayers, they don't benefit  financially from the taxpayers, and we were blocked on that as well.   Then we have been blocked on amendments to debate these wars that  have gone on for years and years. The war in Afghanistan is endless. It  is the longest war in American history. We can't have a debate on the  floor. We are  [[Page H8542]]  told that it is not appropriate and that it is not the right time.   The bottom line is, what my friends on the other side of the aisle  are doing is they are running this place in a very authoritarian way,  basically saying: It is our way, and that is it. It is our way or the  highway, and you don't matter.   Well, we have had enough. We have had enough of being shut out, and  we are not going to shut up. We are not going to sit by and allow this  pattern of closed rules and closed processes to continue without a  protest. This is a serious matter.   For the Speaker of the House in his press conference today to get up  and say, ``Oh, we have a very open house,'' I mean, where is he living?   That does not reflect the reality. Maybe Donald Trump can say those  kind of things that don't reflect reality, but the Speaker of the House  ought to know that today, under his leadership, this has become the  most closed House ever, and it diminishes this institution and it  diminishes every single Member of this institution.   So vote ``no'' on this rule. I urge my Republican friends, who care  about process, who want this place to be more deliberative, to vote  ``no.'' Send a message to your leadership that you have had enough.   If you want more bipartisan legislation, if you want a less polarized  Congress, then open the process up a little bit. I have news for you,  if you do, maybe the popularity of Congress will go up a little bit. I  think we are at, like, 12 or 13 percent now. Maybe that might get you  up to 15 or 16 percent. But it is the right thing to do.   This is not the way we are supposed to run a legislative body. When  you do it this way, you end up with lousy legislation. Your healthcare  bill was a disaster. It reflected no input from anybody. Thank God the  Senate said no to it. We see the same thing going on with the tax bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question so maybe we can bring up a little bit of a debate on the need  for a select committee to study gun violence. But, please, vote ``no''  on this. Please send a message to the Republican leadership that enough  is enough and we are tired of these closed rules.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
