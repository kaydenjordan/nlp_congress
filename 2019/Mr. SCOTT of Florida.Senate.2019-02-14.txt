 Madam President, I thank my colleague Senator  Rubio for standing with me to remember the victims and their families  on this tragic anniversary and for his unwavering commitment to school  safety.   Alyssa Alhadeff, Scott Beigel, Martin Duque Anguiano, Nicholas  Dworet, Aaron Feis, Jaime Guttenberg, Chris Hixon, Luke Hoyer, Cara  Loughran, Gina Montalto, Joaquin Oliver, Alaina Petty, Meadow Pollack,  Helena Ramsay, Alex Schachter, Carmen Schentrup, Peter Wang--one year  ago today, these 17 souls were taken from us in a brutal act of  violence. They were sons and daughters, brothers and sisters; they were  students and athletes and musicians and teachers. Not a day goes that I  don't think about that day and the amazing people who were snuffed out  by the deranged actions of a madman.   Over the course of the last year, I have spent countless hours with  the families of the victims. Unfortunately, I wish we had never met  like this. They have been partners in our efforts to ensure that this  never happens again. We worked together, along with educators, mental  health professionals, and law enforcement, to pass the Marjory Stoneman  Douglas High School Public Safety Act, to make sure our State does  everything in its power to prevent tragedies like this from happening  again.   Today, the State of Florida stands united with heavy hearts. Nothing  we say here today can bring back the lives that were lost. Nothing we  do can replace the angels of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who  were taken from us too soon. But we must never forget them. We must  honor their memory every day, and we must rededicate ourselves to the  goal of ending violence in our schools.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader
