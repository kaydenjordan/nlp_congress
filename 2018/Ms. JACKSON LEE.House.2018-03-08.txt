 Mr. Speaker, on March 5 and March 6, 2018, I was  unavoidably detained attending to representation duties, and I would  like to indicate how I would have voted had I been present.   On rollcall vote No. 92, I would have voted ``aye.''   On rollcall vote No. 93, I would have voted ``aye.''   On rollcall vote No. 94, I would have voted ``aye.''   On rollcall vote No. 95, H.R. 4607, the Comprehensive Regulatory  Review Act, I would have voted ``no.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may  hereafter be considered to be the primary sponsor of H.R. 40, the  Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African- Americans Act, and H.R. 1498, the End Racial Profiling Act, bills  originally introduced by Representative Conyers of Michigan, for the  purposes of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to  clause 7 of rule XII.    Mr. Speaker, I could not help, as I listened to the  colloquy of my two friends, to recognize that the key element is saving  lives, saving lives from the pillage and the murderous acts that are  done with guns.   The NICS fix is crucial. The banning bump stocks is crucial. The  expanded waiting period is crucial, and banning of AR-15s.   But if we can move the issue of the NICS fix, if we can move the  issue of expanded background checks, we can lose the taint of not doing  anything since Las Vegas, not doing anything since Sandy Hook, Mother  Emanuel, or, tragically, Florida. It is imperative that we save lives.   Now, let me speak very clearly to DACA.   I invite my ICE officers to stand with me on Sunday in Houston and  tell my thousands of DACA young people that they will not raid their  homes, they will not jeopardize their lives, and that they are, in  fact, statused individuals who can go about their daily business. Join  me Sunday and announce it to them.   And I ask ICE officers to join the Members of Congress across the  Nation, because these young people are scared to death, and I would ask  that we recognize that.   Mr. Speaker, I intend to honor the late Council Member Larry Green  with a statement in the Record acknowledging the very fact of his great  leadership and the fact that he has passed.                            ____________________
