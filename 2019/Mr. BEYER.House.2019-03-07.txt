 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I am very pleased  to be able to offer this amendment with my good friend from the First  District of North Carolina,  Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lofgren).    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Madam Chair, I want to say that all we are doing is giving  the Appropriations Committee the flexibility to do this. We are going  to spend over $700 billion on defense for people fighting for our  democracy. We can spend a tiny, tiny fraction of that to make sure that  American citizens understand what they are fighting for. This is a  really important thing.   By the way, it is never an attack on teachers. Every teacher I have  talked to would like more resources so they can do their job more  effectively.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
