 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today deeply concerned that this body is  scheduling a vote on what will likely be the most expensive spending  package in the history of the United States without knowing the true  cost of that package.   Our own House rules, House rule XIII, requires us to wait for a score  from the Congressional Budget Office before voting on a budget bill,  and the budget reconciliation and Impoundment Control Act of 1974  requires the CBO to issue that score. But unfortunately, we are rushing  through this vote without even knowing the true cost of the bill.   Last week, I led a group of almost half of the House of  Representatives in sending a letter to the Speaker urging her not to  vote on this bill until its true costs are known. I am sure most  Americans saw the President of the United States go on television two  weeks ago and tell the American public that this spending bill will not  add a single dollar to the national deficit. And our response to that  is, if that is the case, Mr. President, prove it. Prove it by waiting  for the CBO to issue a score on that bill.   The reason why we are so concerned about this issue is that any  economist will tell you that deficit government spending is dangerously  inflationary, and we are already seeing the highest inflation in the  United States in over 40 years.   Folks in my district are paying over $20 more today to fill the  gasoline tank on their cars just to go to work than they were just a  year ago. This inflation is hurting everyday Americans and it will hurt  them more if this bill spends more than it takes in in taxes, and every  indication is that it will.   Madam Speaker, I urge this body to wait for the Congressional Budget  Office to score this bill before voting on it. It is the responsible  thing to do. Anything less would be an abdication of our responsibility  to the people that we represent.
