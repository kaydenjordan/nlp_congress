 Mr. Speaker, I rise to address a drafting error in this  bill.   The stated goal of H.R. 22 is to prevent aid to China and lower U.S.  energy costs. As written, it is going to have the opposite effect.   Run the math. In 2022, the SPR released about 210 million barrels of  oil. Most of that was consumed domestically, a small fraction was  exported, and a smaller fraction may have gone to China. During the  same period of time, domestic oil producers exported more than 10 times  that volume, so roughly 100 times the volume that was exported from  that portion of our SPR that happens to be above ground.   So the failure to include U.S. producers in the export prohibition  means that this bill will do nothing to limit Chinese access to  American oil. But since the SPR releases--as the majority notes--do  reduce oil prices, curtailing our ability to use that tool will drive  prices up and transfer wealth from U.S. consumers to U.S. producers in  places like Bakersfield, California, as they sell higher priced oil to  China.   Now, I cannot imagine that the Speaker intended to enrich his  neighbors so that they could profit from Chinese oil sales, so I would  encourage him to vote ``no.''   I would also encourage anyone who seeks to prioritize United States  access to United States energy to oppose until we can make the  necessary corrections to this bill.
