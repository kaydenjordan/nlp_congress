 I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, Mr. Speaker, and I  rise in opposition to this resolution.   It seems to allow Democrats on the Judiciary Committee to go to  essentially whatever court they want to get a court order to get  whatever documents they want--even grand jury documents and those that  relate to our national security--all because they don't want, or are  afraid to, really, hold Attorney General Barr or former White House  Counsel Don McGahn in contempt of Congress, just as they are afraid to  institute impeachment proceedings against President Trump or accept the  fact that the Mueller investigation found that there was no collusion  and Attorney General Barr found no obstruction.   They just can't get it through their heads that that is the case, and  they don't want to focus on the real issue threatening our democracy  which is that Russia actually attempted to interfere in our national  elections back in 2016 while Barack Obama--not Donald Trump--was  President, and the Obama administration did absolutely nothing about  that.   They really don't seem too concerned that the Russians or another  foreign entity might attempt to do so again in 2020. That is what they  ought to be using their oversight powers--very powerful things the  power that the majority has--they ought to be using it about that, not  this charade.                                time  1515    How many documents have the Democrats requested that relate to  Russian interference in our elections? None. How many hearings? Zip.  How many Obama-administration officials and others connected to  Russia's efforts have they subpoenaed to testify before the Judiciary  Committee? Zero.   By continuing with this fake impeachment, the Democrats are doing the  American public a disservice. My Democratic colleagues ought to be  embarrassed.
