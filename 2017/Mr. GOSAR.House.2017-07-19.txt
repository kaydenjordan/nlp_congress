 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2910,  legislation sponsored by my friend and Western Caucus member, Bill  Flores.   One area of wide bipartisan agreement is the need to support critical  infrastructure in the United States. This bill presents an important  opportunity to deliver on our commitment to modernize infrastructure,  grow the economy, and support safe, reliable American-made energy.   By improving agency and industry coordination, we can provide more  certainty regarding the timeframe and procedures of the pipeline review  process. By making these improvements, we will ensure that the energy  we produce right here in America can be transported in the safest  possible manner.   If my colleagues are truly serious about protecting the environment,  we should be promoting American-made energy, where we know it will be  produced in adherence to the highest environmental and safety  standards.   This bill does exactly that by making the improvements necessary to  modernize our pipeline approval process. These improvements are  necessary to match the advancements in shale gas technology and  increased demand for safe, reliable, and domestically-sourced energy.   While roads and bridges often get the most attention when we talk  about the need for updated infrastructure, modern pipelines and other  energy infrastructure are sorely needed to support our economy and  power our homes and businesses.   Promoting efficient and comprehensive cooperation within our  regulatory process is an effort that is not only bipartisan, but plain  common sense.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas for sponsoring this  much-needed legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of  this commonsense bill.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2883,  the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act, introduced by my  friend and Western Caucus member Markwayne Mullin.   H.R. 2883 streamlines the permitting process for pipelines and  electricity transmission equipment that crosses the United States'  international borders.   Energy trade between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada is nearly a $150  billion business that provides significant benefits to America. This  bill will prevent another Keystone XL-like delay and takes politics out  of the decisionmaking process.   Cross-border oil and gas pipelines and cross-border electric  transmission facilities should not be held up by government  bureaucracies. Without this legislation, important projects that  provide benefits to our economy will continue to incur unnecessary  delays and government red tape.   Edison Electric Institute supports H.R. 2883, stating:         Timely decisions for the sifting and permitting of energy       infrastructure are essential to building more resilient       infrastructure that electric companies need to deliver       reliable, affordable, safe, and increasingly clean energy to       Americans.    The National Taxpayers Union supports the bill, stating:         This legislation would streamline the archaic cross-border       permitting process for energy facilities that stretch across       the borders we share with Mexico and Canada.    The current Presidential permit regime is far from clear and can  leave projects in regulatory limbo for years to come. Creating a  consolidated and standardized approval process would increase the  congressional accountability provided for in Article I, section 8 of  the Constitution.   The bill requires a full environmental review and complies with NEPA.  This legislation makes so much sense that even labor unions support it.  Let's fulfill our constitutional obligations, streamline important  energy infrastructure projects, and advance a true all-of-the-above  energy strategy.   I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for sponsoring this much-needed  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this  commonsense bill.
