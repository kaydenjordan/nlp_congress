 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the HEROES Act.   COVID-19 has ravaged communities, businesses, and families. We will  be reeling from the economic aftershocks of the coronavirus for many  months to come.   The HEROES Act will provide desperately needed relief to stabilize  our fragile economy and protect essential workers.   It will put us on the right path to economic recovery, a recovery  that reduces food insecurity, compensates essential workers for risking  their lives to do their jobs, and help to prevent counties and  municipalities from having to lay off the workers that we rely on the  most.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the HEROES Act. Let's support  our heroes.
