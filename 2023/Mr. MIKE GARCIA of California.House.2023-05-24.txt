 Madam Chair, for too long, a lack of  national leadership has forced law enforcement into navigating this  [[Page H2585]]  fentanyl crisis without the proper tools or a defined mission. The HALT  Fentanyl Act would provide both the tools and the mission by  permanently classifying fentanyl analogues as schedule I narcotics.  This bill, which I have long supported, will mitigate this crisis by  empowering police to use every tool available to get the traffickers of  poison off the streets and put them in jail.   Sell fentanyl, go to jail. Poison kids, go to jail. If you don't want  to go to jail, don't sell fentanyl and don't poison our kids.   Right now we are failing as a Nation. We are failing to recognize the  severity of this crisis, failing to hold China and dealers accountable  for their role, and we are failing to protect the people who most need  it, our children.   We have lost young Americans with bright futures like Daniel Puerta  from my district who was a year away from graduating when he was  poisoned by a counterfeit pill sold over Snapchat. For Daniel's memory  and the memory of countless others, we must act.   Madam Chair, I urge support of this bill. One last thing, 30 times  the number of people who died on 9/11 last year died of fentanyl  poisoning.
