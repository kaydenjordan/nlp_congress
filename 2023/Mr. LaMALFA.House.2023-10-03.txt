 Mr. Speaker, we are in perilous times as a Nation due to  the  [[Page H4960]]  weakness we have been projecting in the last 2\1/2\ years from our  leadership.   What do we see? When you have a vacuum like that--we know the  terminology ``nature abhors a vacuum''--China is all too eager to step  in and move in and replace us in that regard. We are seeing that with  the undermining of our currency around the world. We see it with the  BRICS group trying to go on its own where the American currency for  many, many years has been the standard.   Now, we don't have a birthright to that. We don't have a birthright  as the United States for being number one in anything, but I think we  can agree that we would be stronger as a country, as well as with our  good intentions as a people, that the United States is well positioned  to continue to be the light of the world that it is capable of being.   With bad leadership, with poor leadership, we allow others to come in  and replace us in that role. China is seeking to do so on so many  things, like manufacturing and food. That is what I would like to talk  about today: food production.   At the same time as western countries are saying we need to blame  agriculture for climate change, which basically means CO2  production, I would remind you once again, carbon dioxide is only .04  percent of our atmosphere. All the hysteria over that is that it is  somehow going to be the end of us as a people, the end of the Earth; it  has only grown a minute amount.   They would have us cut one-third of agriculture in this country. John  Kerry, the so-called czar, as he flies in his private jet to yet  another fancy event in Davos to talk about climate change, along with  hundreds of other private jets, would have us cut one-third of our  agriculture in this country.   You see that happening in Europe. You see the Dutch farmers valiantly  fighting back against their oppressive government where they are  wanting to put a bunch of their land out of business. Holland reclaimed  a bunch of land from the ocean via those polders, via those levees they  used to push back the ocean and made prime farmland out of that. You  have extremists trying to push them out. You see Ireland a while back  deciding they need to cull about 30 percent, maybe a third of their  dairy herd because dairies make CO2 and methane gas and  such.   There was a time in this country where we had way, way more buffalo  on the plains than we do have currently with beef and dairy cattle.  That is an interesting stat. It isn't about the animals burping or  whatever.   As we see the U.S., due to bad policy, to poor leadership, being  displaced in that area, do we really want to become dependent even more  so on China and a cartel they might be in with Russia and other  alliances they have with Iran, to be more and more dependent on them?  We are already dependent on them for 90 percent of our pharmaceuticals,  and so much of our manufactured products. Do you want to do that to  agriculture, too? It makes no sense.   You see what is happening in my home State of California, where  California produces so many of these great crops here. Ninety-plus  percent that Americans rely on comes from California. We saw just last  year, in 2022, that due to the decisions made by the Bureau of  Reclamation and others, and the environmental groups, the water got cut  off from Shasta Dam and other Federal project water to much of  agriculture.   We saw just an example of rice, for example. Normally, about half a  million acres of rice are grown in California. They cut that number in  half to 250,000. Do you know how devastating that is to communities  when you have that and other crops just wiped away because of  mismanagement of our water supply during a drought period?   There is still plenty of water that hits California, plenty of  snowpack. We were certainly blessed with a lot this year that made  things good for the 2023 crops. We are still having a decent carryover,  it looks like. As we watch, they are going to fritter the water away at  this time of year, as they have to lower the lakes to have a flood  control level, conservation level. Indeed, the water that could be used  for other things is just now going out to the ocean as so much of it  is. It is a water-management issue. It is a leadership issue.   Where is this food going to come from? They want to continue to take  dams out. I heard a colleague here yesterday say, well, these dams  haven't been maintained over the years. Well, that is purposeful. If  the government doesn't put forward the dollars and the effort and the  permitting process to maintain and keep dams upgraded, yeah, after 40  years they can deteriorate. Then someone decides, well, it is going to  be too expensive to revamp the dam, to bring it up to spec, so let's go  ahead and tear it out. That is what they want to begin with.   Where is our food going to come from if we don't have the dams, the  water storage, our hydroelectric power, all of those things? It makes  no sense what we are doing.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, National Clean Energy week just passed by.  It should be a time to recognize the various forms of clean energy  available to all of us.   Unfortunately, one form continues to be taken not as seriously and,  in many cases, undermined, and that would be hydroelectric power, which  has so many benefits. Yet hydroelectric dams across this country,  including one in the Klamath area of my district, are being torn out  because of an environmental agenda that isn't even true.   Others are on the hit list, like up in the State of Washington, by  their environmental extremists. As policy leaders and consumers push  for a more green future, hydropower should be part of that solution as  a lot of the needed infrastructure already exists, as well as nuclear  power.   Why are we seeing dams that supply low-cost renewable energy that  have already existed for over a century being decommissioned?   Because here is the trick: You make it where it is almost impossible  to do the maintenance and upgrades to that infrastructure so that over  time it becomes too expensive now to continue to have those dams and  they are old relics that need to be taken out. That is the trick.   Indeed, had we maintained them and kept them in place, we wouldn't  have this economic crossroads to deal with. We need to preserve our  dams and keep hydroelectric power as a cornerstone of our power grid.                            ____________________
