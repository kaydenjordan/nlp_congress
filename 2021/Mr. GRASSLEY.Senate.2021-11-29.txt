 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, today I am going to highlight a new  Hunter Biden record that I have recently made public.   Before I get to that point, I am going to take a trip down memory  lane--yes, down memory lane.   On September 23, 2020, Senator Johnson and I released our ``Biden  Report,'' as it has been called. That report focused on questionable  financial transactions between the Biden family and foreign,  government-linked individuals.   On November 18, 2020, we released a supplemental to that report. I am  going to read several statements from the media and my Democratic  colleagues about our report.   So, to start with, on September 23, 2020, a New York Times article by  Nicholas Fandos described it in two ways: ``lack of meaningful new  information'' and ``overlap with a Russian disinformation campaign.''   And the then-Democratic minority leader was quoted in the same  article  [[Page S8770]]  and said the report read ``as if Putin wrote it, not United States  senators.''   A September 23, 2020, Salon article by Igor Derysh quoted a  Democratic Senator saying that the report was the culmination of a  ``sham investigation.'' In that article, the same Democratic Senator  described our investigation as being ``rooted in disinformation'' from  Russian operatives.   Separately, a Democratic Senator also said about our report: ``Bottom  line: The Johnson-Grassley investigation is baseless. It's laundering  Russian propaganda for circulation in the U.S.''   In a September 23, 2020, CBS article by Melissa Quinn, another  Democratic Senator said about our report, meaning the Johnson-Grassley  report: ``The chairmen have amplified a known Russian attack on our  election,'' and ``It is unconscionable that the chairmen are continuing  to advance false information intended to undermine our democratic  process at the expense of bipartisan work that we should be doing to  protect our national security.''   That same CBS article said that our report ``reveals little new  information.''   And one Washington Post columnist, Josh Rogin, said: ``Even after  accepting disinformation from Russian agents, Johnson and Grassley  couldn't come up with anything new or interesting on Hunter Biden.''   So understand this: Week after week, month after month, year after  year, the media and my Democratic colleagues falsely attacked our  investigation with reckless disregard for the truth. I have spoken at  length on the Senate floor rebutting all these false charges with  example after example. I did so on May 11, 2021; March 18, 2021;  December 14, 2020; December 10, 2020; October 19, 2020; and September  29, 2020.   Well, on November 15, this year, Senator Johnson and I publicly  released a record that I placed in part on this poster next to me, and  I will get to this in a minute. The full document illustrates an  assignment and assumption of business interests.   The part next to me is a signature block in unaltered form, including  one typographical error. The signature block includes Hunter Biden, two  of his companies, and individuals connected to the communist Chinese  regime. These are the main companies that Hunter Biden and his  associates used to funnel money all over the world: Hudson West III,  Hudson V, and then the other ones are ColdHarbour Capital and Owasco.  Owasco is Hunter Biden's firm that was the recipient of millions of  dollars from questionable financial transactions.   Gongwen Dong was the right-hand man for the owner of a company called  CEFC China Energy Company. Mervyn Yan was his associate. CEFC was an  arm of the Chinese Government. Hunter Biden was a close business  partner of these men and their companies. Therefore, this signature  block shows a direct financial and legal relationship between Hunter  Biden and individuals connected to the communist regime.   Now, these are the same folks and companies that we discussed at  length in our September 2020 report. This new document is yet another  record that substantiates our report that we issued September 2020-- that same report that the media and my Democratic colleagues said was  based on Russian disinformation.   So I now say to the media and I now say to my Democratic colleagues  who said our report was Russian disinformation, this question: Is this  signature block Russian disinformation? Are the names of these  companies Russian disinformation? Is this document disinformation?   No. This is a legitimate record that my staff uncovered, and it  didn't come from the Hunter Biden laptop. This is the same type of  record that Senator Johnson and I based our report several months ago  on.   To my Democratic colleagues who falsely smeared our report: You are  in the majority. You are now committee chairs, and you have  jurisdiction over these matters. So I want to challenge you to use the  same effort and energy that you exerted in the Trump-Russia  investigation to expose the extensive ties between the Chinese regime  and members of the Biden family.   I think I speak with some credibility on this point because you know  there was a President Trump, and at the time there was a President  Trump, I investigated Donald Trump, Jr., on things that were  appropriate at that time to ask legitimate questions about in the  constitutional role of congressional oversight.                                  Education    Madam President, on another matter--and this will be my last  statement for the day--I have always been a critic of one-size-fits-all  government, and there are few places where this is more inappropriate  than education. Each child is different, and if we offer a cookie- cutter, assembly-line education, it will hurt all students.   Whether we are talking about students with gifts and talents or those  with learning disabilities, students with unique learning needs must  have teachers trained to address their way of learning. It may seem  like common sense to say that, that students benefit when their  education is tailored to their individual needs. Any parent can tell  you that. You can't expect all students to learn at the same speed and  depth in every subject.   Unfortunately, those like outgoing New York Mayor de Blasio want to  scrap programs for gifted students. Citing the fact that White and  Asian students were overperforming compared to students from other  ethnic categories, de Blasio tried to end the city's program.   His focus on maintaining equality of outcomes by preventing any  students from excelling is a misguided policy. It would have the  perverse effect of reducing opportunity for the very students who need  it most, including historically disadvantaged minority groups.   Now, we all know that wealthy families can afford to put their kids  in private schools or pay for services outside of the schools. It is  those students who aren't as well off who need access to services to  address their unique learning needs. Families from less advantaged  backgrounds are not helped by limiting opportunities for all students  in public schools. They are the ones who have the most to lose when  public schools cancel needed services.   Thankfully, the incoming New York mayor recognizes the importance of  gifted and talented programming and has pledged to keep it.   I introduced the TALENT Act to address these unique needs of gifted  and talented students and ensure that they don't slip through the  cracks. Thankfully, much of this bill was included in Every Child  Achieves in the year 2015. But I am also a strong supporter of Javits  Gifted and Talented Education. This is the only dedicated Federal  program to develop and help teachers implement teaching methods that  meet the needs of gifted students, and it is targeted specifically to  disadvantaged gifted students.   Thankfully, my State of Iowa is a leader in this area. Iowa law  requires gifted education services for kids who need to be challenged.  This applies to all students, whether or not they can afford private  schools. Iowa has recognized that we should aim to challenge kids with  gifts and talents and give them the resources they need to excel. We  should help all students achieve their potential, not try in vain to  find one identical education for every kid.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
