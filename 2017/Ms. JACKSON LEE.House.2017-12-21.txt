 Mr. Speaker, this has been a painful season for so  many of us, from California to Texas to Florida, Louisiana, to Puerto  Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and so I am still here begging my  colleagues for those who are begging in Texas.   Right now, my local officials are letting my constituents from  Kashmere Gardens share in the public view how desperate they are for  housing money. So this CR and this emergency supplemental should be  separated. But the CR, on the other hand, should be funding CHIP  completely. And DACA, the DREAMers, should be protected completely.   I introduced a bill when Hurricane Harvey came for $164 billion. That  is where we should be, and I know that because of the sacrifice and  loss and devastation. But also, a DREAMer lost his life trying to  rescue my constituents, so, you see, we have a situation that should be  corrected across the board. Fix the DREAMers, but provide for the  hurricane victims.   I will say that we are going to keep on pushing beyond the $81  billion. I am glad the $1 billion that I pushed for for small  businesses is in this bill.    Mr. Speaker, we have 300,000 homes underwater.  Puerto Rico has no lights in homes; U.S. Virgin Islands, none, no  homes. Key West still needs debris picked up.   What my constituents are saying is, because the lights are out, we  are forgotten; because DREAMers don't have rights, they are forgotten.   So I am not going to stand here and ignore our children, 9 million of  them who need CHIP, or our DREAMers. But I am also going to say that,  whatever is in this for us, which is not a lot, I am going to keep  pushing and fighting for my constituents. And the money that we are  getting, get it to us now--now.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the Rule, and H.R.  4667, one of the two underlying bills made in order.   H.R. 4667 provides $81 billion in aid to respond to the damage caused  by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and the wildfires in California.   I thank the Speaker and Rules Committee Chairman Sessions for acting  favorably upon my request to bring this emergency disaster supplemental  to the floor for debate and vote as a stand-alone measure.   Ever since the widespread and catastrophic destruction of Hurricane  Harvey, I have been working closely with the Texas Governor and the  Hurricane Harvey Taskforce to secure the help necessary for the region  to rebuild.   I have witnessed firsthand the pain of storm-weary Houstonians who  lost their homes, their belongings, and in many cases their jobs.   They are struggling and hurting.   So this is personal to me.   The amount of funding provided in the disaster relief package is very  disappointing because it is not nearly sufficient to ameliorate the  suffering still being experienced by the people of the communities in  the areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.   Congress has had more than three months to develop an aid package  that is commensurate to the challenge faced by the affected states and  territories in rebuilding their devastated communities.   Much of this time has been squandered by the Republican congressional  leadership's all-consuming focus on ramming through the Republican Tax  Scam legislation that gives 83 percent of its benefits to the top 1  percent, raises taxes on working and middle-class families, takes away  health insurance from 13 million Americans, explodes the deficit by  $1.5 trillion and the national debt by $1.7 trillion, and will be paid  for by 5.4 trillion in cuts to vital programs Americans depend on,  including an imminent $25 billion reduction in Medicare funding.   Mr. Speaker, on September 6, 2017, ten days after Hurricane Harvey  struck and joined by 44 of our colleagues, I introduced H.R. 3686, the  ``Hurricane Harvey Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2017,'' which  provides $174 billion in disaster relief for the areas affected by  Hurricane Harvey, the worst superstorm ever to strike the mainland  United States.   The $174 billion in funding provided by H.R. 3686 represents a  comprehensive response commensurate to the challenge; specifically, my  legislation provides relief in the following amounts:   1. Housing and Community Development Fund: $50 billion   2. FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $35 billion   3. Army Corps of Engineers--Construction: $15 billion   4. Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies: $13 billion   5. Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program: $33 billion   6. Small Business Disaster Loans Program: $2 billion   7. Emergency Conservation Activities: $650 million   8. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: $321 million   9. National Aeronautics and Space Administration: $50 million   10. Legal Services Corporation: $10 million   11. Army National Guard: $10 million   12. Army Corps of Engineers--Civil Investigations: $150 million   13. Coast Guard: $450 million   14. National Park Service Historic Preservation Fund: $800 million   15. EPA Environmental Programs and Management: $2.5 billion   16. EPA Hazardous Substance Superfund: $7 million   17. Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund: $15 million   18. State and Tribal Assistance Grants: $600 million   19. Employment and Training Services: $100 million   20. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund: $2.5 billion   21. Airport and Airway Trust Fund: $90 million   22. Federal-Aid Highways Emergency Relief Program: $6.5 billion   And that is just for Texas and the areas affected by Hurricane  Harvey; the damage wrought by Hurricane Irma in Florida, and Hurricane  Maria in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands was nearly as great in  dollar terms and equal in the level of misery and suffering inflicted  on the residents.   Mr. Speaker, on September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall in  Puerto Rico, along the southeastern coast, near the small town of  Yabucoa.   The devastation wrought on that beautiful Caribbean oasis and its 3.5  million inhabitants, our fellow citizens of the United States, is  unimaginable, except perhaps to those of us who have lived through and  survived similar natural disasters, like Hurricanes Harvey and Katrina.   At least 48 people have died as a result of the storm as rescue and  recovery operations proceed, a number likely to rise, especially with  so many elderly, sick, and very young persons at risk.   Much of Puerto Rico's population is still without potable drinking  water and large swaths of the population still lack electrical power.   Hurricane Maria destroyed 80 percent of Puerto Rico's agricultural  industry, including banana, plantain and coffee crops, which translates  into lost income of approximately $780 million.   On August 30, 2017, Hurricane Irma struck, inflicting horrific damage  on the U.S. Virgin Islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John, the  Caribbean nations of Barbuda, St. Maarten, Cuba, and Anguilla, before  making landfall in the Florida Keys.   In Florida alone, 6.4 million people were told to evacuate to safety,  leading to days of jammed highways and frantic searches for gasoline  amid one of the nation's largest ever emergency evacuations.   At least 124 persons are known to have lost their lives in Hurricane  Irma, more than  [[Page H10358]]  200,000 Floridians took refuge in shelters, and nearly 6.5 million  homes and businesses were without power.   Mr. Speaker, we do not yet know the full extent of the damage and  devastation suffered by our fellows Americans in Florida, the U.S.  Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and  Maria.   But what we do know is that the costs of recovery and reconstruction  will be extensive, best estimates place the cost in the range of $50- $100 billion.   This puts in perspective the inadequacy of the amount of disaster  relief provided under H.R. 4667 and why more, much more, must be done.   Mr. Speaker, right now, at this very moment, approximately 300,000  Texans--in Port Arthur, in Port Aransas, in Houston and Harris County-- remain homeless or are living in substandard homes with blue tarp roofs  and infected with mold.   Today, residents of the Cashmere Gardens community are meeting with  local government officials to highlight their plight and those of other  residents in the northeastern part of Houston.   They are angry and frustrated and anxious, and who can blame them?   Mr. Speaker, this is personal to them; and it is personal to me.   That is why right now my highest priority is to ensure that funding  that has been made available expeditiously gets in the hands of local  governments so that relief can deliver the resources and services so  desperately needed.   And I will be working with the Texas General Land Office and HUD  Secretary Carson to relieve the emergency housing crisis in my  congressional district and state.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the bipartisan leadership of both  Chambers, and my colleagues in the Texas congressional delegation for  their diligence and commitment in bringing this package to the floor  for debate and vote.   I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey, and Speaker  Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi, and their Senate counterparts for  the work that has been done thus far and for their assistance in the  work that lies ahead.   I also thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey, and T- HUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Diaz-Balart, and Energy and  Water Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Simpson and Ranking Member  Kaptur for including in the legislation before us the following  beneficial measures that I requested, including:   1. Authority to establish and implement a $1 billion pilot program to  provide small business disaster recovery grants, modeled on H.R. 3930,  the ``Hurricane Harvey Small Business Recovery Grants Act,''  legislation I introduced on October 3, 2017 and co-sponsored by 16 of  our colleagues.   2. $75 million for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Investigations  account, which is to be used in areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey,  Irma, and Maria, and can be used to finance the $3 million Houston-Area  Watershed Assessment Study I have worked to secure and previously  approved by the House.   3. The bill also includes helpful legislative language to ensure that  in awarding CDBG-Disaster Relief funds to states, the Secretary of HUD  should to the maximum extent practicable award grants to units of local  government and public housing authorities that have the financial and  administrative capacity to manage a grant awarded under the program.   Let me describe briefly some of the major provisions contained in the  Disaster Relief Supplemental:   1. FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $27.5 billion to provide critical  funding to assist the ongoing federal disaster response. Allows up to  $4 billion to be provided for Community Disaster Loans (CDLs).   2. Community Development Block Grants Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR):  $26.1 billion for housing and infrastructure needs, $13.56 billion for  grants to states, tribes, and territories for unmet housing needs and  business losses.   3. $12.5 billion for mitigation efforts to help communities protect  against future disasters.   4. This funding can provide for housing elevation, buyouts in the  flood plain, water/sewer infrastructure enhancements, public  infrastructure hardening (e.g. stormproofing public buildings).   5. Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief: $1.4 billion to  address all current damages to federal highways caused by designated  disasters.   6. $12.11 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers to repair existing  damages by natural disasters and for studies and projects to reduce the  risk of future natural disasters, $75 million to expedite studies to  help mitigate future disaster damage.   7. 2.9 billion to help displaced students get back to school. Funding  can be used for both public and private schools.   8. $3.8 billion for agriculture assistance.   9. $1.66 billion for Small Business Administration Disaster Loans to  assist small businesses and homeowners repair or replace real estate,  personal property, machinery and equipment, and inventory and business  assets.   Mr. Speaker, there is much more work to be done in my city of  Houston, and across the areas affected by the terrible, awesome storm  that will be forever known simply as Hurricane Harvey, and by  Hurricanes Irma and Maria.   That is why I am disappointed that only $81 billion is being provided  at this time.   That is why it must be emphasized and understood that this can only  be understood as a partial response because much more funding will be  needed to provide our fellow Americans in Texas, Florida, Louisiana,  Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands the help and support they need  to restore their communities to their previous greatness.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 670 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:         Sec. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''  [[Page H10359]]         In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1766, the Sexual Assault  Forensic Evidence Reporting Act of 2017. This bipartisan legislation  passed the Senate on October 23, 2017.   I am glad that this House is moving this legislation, because it is  about children. It is about the scourge that children, women, and  others find themselves victims of--sexual assault.   S. 1766 will reauthorize the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of  2000 through the year 2022, by amending the language in section 2(c)(4)  of 34 U.S.C. 40701(c)(4).   Furthermore, this legislation also amends other sections of the DNA  Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2004 by ensuring that role of forensic  nurses pertains to both adult and pediatric care.   The SAFER Act also amends this statute by making a provision after  ``elder abuse'' for the need of nurse examiners, particularly where  there is the need for pediatric sexual assault nurse examiners,  including such nurse examiners working in the multidisciplinary  setting, in responding to abuse of both children and adolescents.   Finally, this legislation will sunset through 2023 by amending the  SAFER Act. The SAFER Act is a critical program, administered by the  U.S. Department of Justice, that allows:   Local law enforcement programs to obtain funding for programs to  reduce the rape kit backlog in communities across the country;   Victims of sexual assault get justice more quickly than in the past;   Thirty-five percent of funds available under the Debbie Smith Act for  grants to local law enforcement agencies to focus more resources on  rape kit testing;   Five to seven percent of the Debbie Smith Act funding to be used by  local jurisdictions to conduct 1-year audits of untested sexual assault  evidence to identify serious areas of backlog; and  [[Page H10363]]    Forensic testing to be done by both pediatric and adult sexual  assault nurse examiners.   This is a very important measure that will address the large volume  of cases that fester due to the excessive backlog in our processing of  rape kits.   According to the National Institute of Justice, a multidisciplinary,  victim-centered approach and standardized, efficient evidence  processing in sexual assault cases are the focus of its new report.   The report, ``National Best Practices for Sexual Assault Kits,''  outlines 35 suggestions for laboratories and law enforcement to improve  their sexual assault investigations, tackling issues such as evidence  collection, storage, and maintenance; backlog tracking and processing;  victim advocacy and notification; and sensitivity to trauma in sexual  assault victims.   A working group--consisting of victims and victim advocates, sexual  assault nurse examiners and medical examiners, forensic laboratories,  law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and members of the judiciary-- developed the suggestions over a 2-year period following the Sexual  Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting Act of 2013, the SAFER Act, a  component of the Violence Against Women Act. We will soon reauthorize  the Violence Against Women Act, and we will be happy to have this  expansion included in this.   A victim-centered approach is the focus on the needs and the concerns  of a victim to ensure the passionate and sensitive delivery of services  in a nonjudgmental manner. A trauma-informed approach considers the  impact of trauma and victim safety considerations.    Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Texas, Congressman Poe, and my  colleague from New York, Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney, have worked  on a number of these issues, and also Senator Cornyn, because this is a  very important step. I remember the days, in our respective  jurisdictions, that we had a mounting backlog of rape kits. Do you know  what that means, Mr. Speaker? Women and children do not get either  their day in court or do not get justice.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that this is a timely and very important  legislative initiative.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, to my good friend from Texas, I am just a measure above  your lost voice. I am suffering from somewhat of the same thing, but I  have a little bit of a voice, so I can say thank you, again, for your  very hard work on this legislation as a former judge in Harris County  on the criminal bench. I know you saw injustices because rape kits had  not been processed.   I believe, as the chair and co-chair of the Congressional Children's  Caucus and the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism,  Homeland Security, and Investigations, that we went through this as  well. I was very pleased that the Justice Department understood the  importance of grants to help our local law enforcement, but, more  importantly, that the Judiciary Committee understood the importance of  this legislation to really move forward to process kits.   Can you imagine, Mr. Speaker, children having a backlog of kits that  have been subjected to sexual assault--the most dastardly act and  violence--not only against adults, but against children, like 3-month- olds, or toddlers, by sick people who sexually assault them.   So the development and implementation of policies and procedures by  the National Institutes of Health leads to more timely submission of  evidence to forensic laboratories, enhances communications and  investigative procedures, promotes better informed prosecutorial  decisionmaking, and, as my friend said, it helps the accused and the  accuser. These approaches are the most important because they get  victim participation.   Victims of sexual assault require justice that is swift, thorough,  and expedient so they may begin to heal and attempt to put the pieces  of their lives back together. They deserve the best efforts of law  enforcement to help them along the way.   When Houston was trying to rebuild its rape testing structure, we  utilized the FBI. And I want to take a moment to thank the FBI for its  deep abiding integrity and honesty and how it comes to the rescue of so  many jurisdictions, local law enforcement. Let us be very clear on how  important it is to maintain the integrity and the respect for the FBI,  as opposed to demeaning the FBI. Today, on the floor of the House, I  want to thank them for their service.   So this legislation would reauthorize the SAFER Act, provide funding  to conduct 1-year audits of untested sexual assault evidence, and  ensure that law enforcement agencies across the country are trained and  armed with the skills and tools they require to stand against sexual  assault and stand for those individuals who might be victimized.   The SAFER Act would also ensure that forensic nurses are eligible for  training under the program. These professionals are indispensable. Our  citizens deserve to be protected and remain free from harm. Our  children, women, and men, who are sexually assaulted, deserve to be  protected, but their cases must move expeditiously.  [[Page H10364]]    Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important legislation, as we continue to stand for victims and against  the viciousness of sexual crimes of any kind, protect them, and bring  the perpetrators to justice. I ask for a ``yes'' vote for this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1766, the ``Sexual Assault  Forensic Evidence Reporting'' or the (SAFER) Act of 2017.''   This bipartisan legislation passed the Senate October 23, 2017.   S. 1766 will reauthorize the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of  2000 through the year 2022, by amending the language in section 2(c)(4)  of the (34 U.S.C. 40701(c)(4)).   Furthermore, this legislation also amends Section 304(c)(2) of the  DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2004 (34 U.S.C. 40723(c)(2)) by  ensuring that role of forensic nurses pertains to both adult and  pediatric care.   The SAFER Act also amends this statute by making a provision after  ``elder abuse'' for the need of nurse examiners, particularly, where  there is the need for pediatric sexual assault nurse examiners,  including such nurse examiners working in the multidisciplinary  setting, in responding to abuse of both children and adolescents''.   Finally, this legislation will sunset through 2023 by amending  Section 1006 of the SAFER Act of 2013 (34 U.S.C. 40701 note).   The SAFER Act is a critical program administered by the U.S.  Department of Justice that allows:   Local law enforcement programs to obtain funding for programs to  reduce the rape kit backlog in communities across the country.   Victims of sexual assault get justice more quickly than in the past.   35% of funds available under the Debbie Smith Act for grants to local  law enforcement agencies to focus more resources on rape kit testing.   5%-7% of the Debbie Smith Act funding to be used by local  jurisdictions to conduct one-year audits of untested sexual assault  evidence to identify serious areas of backlog.   Forensic testing to be done by both pediatric and adult sexual  assault nurse examiners.   This is a very important measure that will address the large volume  of cases that fester due to the excessive back log in our processing of  rape kits.   According to the National Institute of Justice, a multidisciplinary,  victim-centered approach and standardized, efficient evidence  processing in sexual assault cases are the focus of its new report.   The report, National Best Practices for Sexual Assault Kits, outlines  35 suggestions for laboratories and law enforcement to improve their  sexual assault investigations, tackling issues such as evidence  collection, storage and maintenance; backlog tracking & processing;  victim advocacy and notification; and sensitivity to trauma in sexual  assault victims.   A working group--consisting of victims and victim advocates, sexual  assault nurse examiners and medical examiners, forensic laboratories,  law enforcement agencies, prosecutors and members of the judiciary-- developed the suggestions over a two-year period following the Sexual  Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting (SAFER) Act of 2013, a component of  the Violence Against Women Act.   A victim centered approach is the focus on the needs and concerns of  a victim to ensure the compassionate and sensitive delivery of services  in a nonjudgmental manner. A trauma-informed approach considers the  impact of trauma and victim safety considerations.   Utilizing both approaches in the development and implementation of  policies and procedures leads to more timely submission of evidence to  forensic laboratories, enhances communications and investigative  procedures, promotes better informed prosecutorial decision-making, and  ultimately may reduce re-traumatization of victims by the criminal  justice system.   In fact, these approaches are more likely to increase victim  participation and thereby, support more complete investigations,  increasing the overall likelihood of successful prosecutions.''   For these reasons, I support this bill.   Victims of sexual assault require justice that is swift, thorough,  and expedient, so that they may begin to heal and attempt to put the  pieces of their lives back together. They deserve the best efforts of  law enforcement to help them along the way.   This legislation would reauthorize the SAFER Act, provide funding to  conduct one-year audits of untested sexual assault evidence, and ensure  that law enforcement agencies across the country are trained and armed  with the skills and tools they require to stand against sexual assault,  and stand for those individuals who might be victimized.   The SAFER Act would also ensure that forensic nurses are eligible for  training under the program. These professionals perform indispensable  functions within the investigation of sexual abuse cases. They also  provide specialized care and attention to children, youth, and the  elderly, who are sexually abused. This legislation would help local  authorities make certain that state and local forensic nurses are fully  capable of providing such an important service to child victims.   Our citizens deserve to be protected and remain free from harm. We  have a responsibility to do all that we can during those unfortunate  times where one of them might be victimized.   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important legislation as we continue to stand for victims and against  sexual crimes of any kind.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  New York; I want to thank the chairman; but I do want to take a moment  and particularly thank the gentlewoman from New York for the kindness  that she showed the first victims of this horrific hurricane season.   I remember coming back to Congress in the immediacy of Hurricane  Harvey. Many don't know, but I left my home in a firetruck--not out of  desperation, but to go where my constituents were--and spent the rest  of the time with 14,000 homeless evacuees in a shelter that had been  set up immediately with concern about the city of Houston.   We had meetings starting at 6 a.m. In the evening, as the waters  started moving in different communities and different communities  became flooded, we  [[Page H10388]]  could see evacuees carrying their only belongings--pillows, just a  paper bag--flooding into the George R. Brown Convention Center.   This is serious for me.   I remember seeing elderly persons being evacuated after the Addicks  Reservoir, Barker Reservoir was released and family members standing on  what was now the shore waiting for those loved ones. I know the family  and went to the funerals of the six family members who died in Greens  Bayou in my congressional district.   I introduced a bill, H.R. 3686, which the gentlewoman from New York  was quite interested in. It was for $174 billion. If we had that amount  now, I would be more than happy to share that with Puerto Rico and the  Virgin Islands.   We don't have that. And I am extremely disappointed that we have $81  billion, not because of the lack of the hard work of those who worked  on the Appropriations Committee, because I know they wanted to do more,  but there were other distractions--like a $1.4 trillion tax cut.                                time  1515     I want to thank my Texas colleagues. We worked  together, and I truly appreciate that and will thank them for it.   Today, I indicated that I have constituents who are down testifying  in Houston about their devastation, so I want to make this point. First  of all, I fought very hard for a $1 billion grant program for small  businesses. I want to tell my constituents it is in, and I want to tell  the State of Texas they have to put that in their application that they  want to give small businesses grants and not loans.   There is $12 billion in CDBG programs. I want to make sure that the  State works with us to ensure that the elderly, the people who have no  resources, families that have no resources have their homes rebuilt or  they have their homes fixed.   I want to make sure that the watershed study comes under section  title IV, that the Army Corps is listening, that the watershed program  that I have passed in two sessions to study the bayous, as to why  Greens Bayou and Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou and Halls Bayou  flood, and why people lose their lives. I want that watershed done, and  the Army Corps of Engineers, I hope, will listen.   There is a lot of work left to be done. We have got to get more  money. And I am glad that Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are  in, but you can count on me, Texas, and count on me, Puerto Rico and  the U.S. Virgin Islands and Florida. We will fight into the new year to  ensure that we get more funding. But these items have to be considered.  We fought hard for them.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R. 4667, ``Making Further  Supplemental Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2017.''   H.R. 4667, provides $81 billion in aid to respond to the damage  caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and the wildfires in California.   I thank the Speaker and Rules Committee Chairman Sessions for acting  favorably upon my request to bring this emergency disaster supplemental  to the floor for debate and vote as a stand-alone measure.   But the fact remains that the amount of funding provided in the  disaster relief package is very disappointing because it is not nearly  sufficient to ameliorate the suffering still being experienced by the  people of the communities in the areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey,  Irma, and Maria.   Congress has had more than three months to develop an aid package  that it is commensurate to the challenge faced by the affected states  and territories in rebuilding their devastated communities.   Much of this time has been squandered by the Republican congressional  leadership all-consuming focus on ramming through the Republican Tax  Scam legislation that gives 83 percent of its benefits to the top 1  percent, raises taxes on working and middle-class families, takes away  health insurance from 13 million Americans, explodes the deficit by  $1.5 trillion and the national debt by $1.7 trillion, and will be paid  for by 5.4 trillion in cuts to vital programs Americans depend on,  including an imminent $25 billion reduction in Medicare funding.   Mr. Speaker, on September 6, 2017, ten days after Hurricane Harvey  struck and joined by 44 of our colleagues, I introduced H.R. 3686, the  ``Hurricane Harvey Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2017,'' which  provides $174 billion in disaster relief for the areas affected by  Hurricane Harvey, the worst superstorm ever to strike the mainland  United States.   The $174 billion in funding provided by H.R. 3686 represents a  comprehensive response commensurate to the challenge; specifically my  legislation provides relief in the following amounts:   1. Housing and Community Development Fund: $50 billion   2. FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $35 billion   3. Army Corps of Engineers--Construction: $15 billion   4. Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies: $13 billion   5. Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program: $33 billion   6. Small Business Disaster Loans Program: $2 billion   7. Emergency Conservation Activities: $650 million   8. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: $321 million   9. National Aeronautics and Space Administration: $50 million   10. Legal Services Corporation: $10 million   11. Army National Guard: $10 million   12. Army Corps of Engineers--Civil Investigations: $150 million   13. Coast Guard: $450 million   14. National Park Service Historic Preservation Fund: $800 million   15. EPA Environmental Programs and Management: $2.5 billion   16. EPA Hazardous Substance Superfund: $7 million   17. Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund: $15 million   18. State and Tribal Assistance Grants: $600 million   19. Employment and Training Services: $100 million   20. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund: $2.5 billion   21. Airport and Airway Trust Fund: $90 million   22. Federal-Aid Highways Emergency Relief Program: $6.5 billion   And that is just for Texas and the areas affected by Hurricane  Harvey; the damage wrought by Hurricane Irma in Florida, and Hurricane  Maria in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands was nearly as great in  dollar terms and equal in the level of misery and suffering inflicted  on the residents.   Mr. Speaker, on September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall in  Puerto Rico, along the southeastern coast, near the small town of  Yabucoa.   The devastation wrought on that beautiful Caribbean oasis and its 3.5  million inhabitants, our fellow citizens of the United States, is  unimaginable, except perhaps to those of us who have lived through and  survived similar natural disasters, like Hurricanes Harvey and Katrina.   At least 48 people have died as a result of the storm as rescue and  recovery operations proceed, a number likely to rise, especially with  so many elderly, sick, and very young persons at risk.   Much of Puerto Rico's population is still without potable drinking  water and large swaths of the population still lack electrical power.   Hurricane Maria destroyed 80 percent of Puerto Rico's agricultural  industry, including banana, plantain and coffee crops, which translates  into lost income of approximately $780 million.   On August 30, 2017, Hurricane Irma struck, inflicting horrific damage  on the U.S. Virgin Islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John, the  Caribbean nations of Barbuda, St. Maarten, Cuba, and Anguilla, before  making landfall in the Florida Keys.   In Florida alone, 6.4 million people told to evacuate to safety,  leading to days of jammed highways and frantic searches for gasoline  amid one of the nation's largest ever emergency evacuations.   At least 124 persons are known to have lost their lives in Hurricane  Irma, more than 200,000 Floridians took refuge in shelters, and nearly  6.5 million homes and businesses were without power.   Mr. Speaker, we do not yet know the full extent of the damage and  devastation suffered by our fellows Americans in Florida, the U.S.  Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and  Maria.   But what we do know is that the costs of recovery and reconstruction  will be extensive, best estimates place the cost in the range of $50- $100 billion.   This puts in perspective the inadequacy of the amount of disaster  relief provided under H.R. 4667 and why more, much more, must be done.   Mr. Speaker, right now, at this very moment, approximately 300,000  Texans--in Port Arthur, in Port Aransas, in Houston and Harris County-- remain homeless or are living in substandard homes with blue tarp roofs  and infected with mold.  [[Page H10389]]    Today, residents of the Cashmere Gardens community are meeting with  local government officials to highlight their plight and those of other  residents in the northeastern part of Houston.   They are angry and frustrated and anxious, and who can blame them?   Mr. Speaker, this is personal to them; and it is personal to me.   That is why right now my highest priority is to ensure that funding  that has been made available expeditiously gets in the hands of local  governments so that relief can be deliver the resources and services so  desperately needed.   And I will be working with the Texas General Land Office and HUD  Secretary Carson to relieve the emergency housing crisis in my  congressional district and state.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the bipartisan leadership of both  chambers, and my colleagues in the Texas congressional delegation for  their diligence and commitment in bringing this package to the floor  for debate and vote.   I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey, and Speaker  Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi, and their Senate counterparts for  the work that has been done thus far and for their assistance in the  work that lies ahead.   I also thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey, and T- HUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Diaz-Balart, and Energy and  Water Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Simpson and Ranking Member  Kaptur for including in the legislation before us the following  beneficial measures that I requested, including:   1. Authority to establish an implement a $1 billion pilot program to  provides small business disaster recovery grants, modeled on H.R. 3930,  the ``Hurricane Harvey Small Business Recovery Grants Act,''  legislation I introduced on October 3, 2017 and co-sponsored by 16 of  our colleagues.   2. $75 million for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Investigations  account, which is to be used in areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey,  Irma, and Maria, and can be used to finance the $3 million Houston-Area  Watershed Assessment Study I have worked to secure and previously  approved by the House.   3. The bill also includes helpful legislative language to ensure that  in awarding CDBG-Disaster Relief funds to states, the Secretary of HUD  should to the maximum extent practicable award grants to units of local  government and public housing authorities that have the financial and  administrative capacity to manage a grant awarded under the program.   Let me describe briefly some of the major provisions contained in the  Disaster Relief Supplemental:   1. FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $27.5 billion to provide critical  funding to assist the ongoing federal disaster response. allows up to  $4 billion to be provided for Community Disaster Loans (CDLs).   2. Community Development Block Grants Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR):  $26.1 billion for housing and infrastructure needs. $13.56 billion for  grants to states, tribes, and territories for unmet housing needs and  business losses.   3. $12.5 billion for mitigation efforts to help communities protect  against future disasters.   4. This funding can provide for housing elevation, buyouts in the  flood plain, water/sewer infrastructure enhancements, public  infrastructure hardening (e.g. storm proofing public buildings).   5. Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief: $1.4 billion to  address all current damages to federal highways caused by designated  disasters   6. $12.11 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers to repair existing  damages by natural disasters and for studies and projects to reduce the  risk of future natural disasters, $75 million to expedite studies to  help mitigate future disaster damage.   7. 2.9 billion to help displaced students get back to school. funding  can be used for both public and private schools   8. $3.8 billion for agriculture assistance.   9. $1.66 billion for Small Business Administration Disaster Loans to  assist small businesses and homeowners repair or replace real estate,  personal property, machinery and equipment, and inventory and business  assets.   Mr. Speaker, there is much more work to be done in my city of  Houston, and across the areas affected by the terrible, awesome storm  that will be forever known simply as Hurricane Harvey, and by  Hurricanes Irma and Maria.   That is why I am disappointed that only $81 billion is being provided  at this time.   That is why it must be emphasized and understood that this can only  be understood as a partial response because much more funding will be  needed to provide our fellow Americans in Texas, Florida, Louisiana,  Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands the help and support they need  to restore their communities to their previous greatness.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about H.R. 1370,  ``Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign Authorization Act of  2017'' [Further Continuing Resolution].   This resolution is an imperfect vehicle for appropriations for FY  2018, because it does not reflect an effort to include bipartisan  solutions to remaining Democratic priorities.   H.R. 1370 not only fails to address remaining unsolved issues, but it  also fails to fund the government through the end of FY 2018.   Republicans have not consulted Democrats on anything that is included  in this year-end legislation, accordingly the majority should not  expect Democrats to vote on a bill that does not include the following  priorities:   A bipartisan, long-term reauthorization of the Children's Health  Insurance Program (CHIP):   CHIP, which provides health coverage to 9 million children, expired  nearly three months ago.   Republicans have only put forward legislation that cuts other  critical health programs, an unacceptable trade-off.   States have already begun taking steps to shut down their CHIP  programs, and I will not vote for a Continuing Resolution (CR) that  prevents children from obtaining health coverage.   Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program:   According to a report by the Center for American Progress, 122  DREAMers are losing their protection every single day that Congress  fails to act.   Disaster aid:   My district--Houston, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are  short-changed in the supplemental proposed by the majority.   Among other glaring omissions, the Republican supplemental fails to  include funding for their Medicaid programs, which are facing  unprecedented demands following these ruinous hurricanes.   An agreement to lift the Budget Control Act (BCA) spending caps:   In the three months since a CR was passed in September, Republicans  have not worked on a budget agreement that ensures Congress can  adequately fund defense and nondefense priorities and adhere to the  principle of parity between defense and non-defense spending.   H.R. 1370 would provide $4.5 billion in emergency funding for the  Department of Defense, as requested by the Trump administration on  November 6.   Most of that money is allocated for missile defense programs  primarily targeting North Korea, an area that President Trump has  failed to approach diplomatically and instead, has resorted to  inflammatory threats, tweets, and other non-presidential approaches  typical of this administration.   In contrast, H.R. 1370 would provide a mere four-week extension of  current funding for domestic needs.   This continuing resolution would force both parties to revisit the  domestic programs in January.   Mr. Speaker, I will not accept this scheme and I highlight the  importance of parity between defense and domestic programs in order to  provide adequate funds for veterans' health, a pension bailout, opioid- fighting programs, and medical research.   Another major concern of this bill includes the unrevised extension  of government surveillance powers; Congress has yet to agree on a  proper revision of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Act.   Section 702 of FISA was intended to be revised this month; however,  the majority has failed to address that issue, adding one more  unresolved priority to the list of neglected legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that we have again been placed in the  position of having to fund the government through the device of a  continuing resolution rather than through the normal appropriations  process of considering and voting on separate spending bills usually  reported by the Committee on Appropriations.   The reason for this last minute resolution is due to the Republican  leadership being solely focused on cutting taxes on the wealthy rather  than coming up with a plan to keep the government open and serving its  citizens.   Republicans control the House, Senate, and the White House--they  should have the votes to pass a CR on their own if they refuse to  compromise with Democrats.   The government shutdown of 2013, which was manufactured by the  Republican majority lasted 16 days and cost taxpayers $24 billion.   The enormous harm and disruption of the lives of federal employees  and the people they serve, however, was irreparable.   As I stated, Mr. Speaker, this Continuing Resolution is not perfect  and it only funds the government until January 19, 2018.   As seasoned Members of Congress, we have been in this challenging  position before.   But working together in a spirit of goodwill, bipartisanship, and  realism, I believe we can reach a long-term agreement that will avert a  shutdown of government operations and the disruption a shutdown causes  to the lives of millions of Americans who depend upon federal programs  to do their jobs, educate their kids, care for their parents, and  contribute to their communities.   Our constituents look to the Congress and the President to make  responsible choices and decisions to keep the nation safe, the economy  prosperous, and to make necessary and prudent investments in education,  healthcare and research, transportation and infrastructure, economic  development, science, the arts and humanities, and the environment.   This is, after all, just another way of saying that the American  people expect their leaders in Washington be guided by the  Constitution's Preamble and pursue policies and provide the resources  that will:       establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for       the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure       the blessings of liberty.    The funding priorities that have been floated by the Trump  Administration fail this essential test of leadership because they are  irresponsible, impracticable, unrealistic, and, in many respects,  insensitive or indifferent to the deleterious impact they will have on  the lives of real people living in the real world.   They do not command majority support in the Congress or of the  public.   To win such support, I believe that it is essential that any  subsequent continuing resolution or omnibus appropriations bill  achieves the following goals and objectives:   ``To establish justice'' and ``To promote the general welfare'':   1. Full funding for the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights  Division and the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights so that  they have funds needed to enforce laws protecting civil rights, voting  rights, and prosecuting hate crimes.   2. Fully funds community development block grants and low income  housing programs in urban and rural communities.   3. Fully funds the Legal Services Corporation so that working and  low-income persons who lack an army of lobbyists to represent them in  Washington will at least have the assistance of counsel to defend their  legal rights in courts of law.   4. Fully funds programs providing food assistance to housebound  seniors, such as Meals on Wheels.   5. Fully funds programs that provide students from low and moderate- income families access to affordable access to higher education and  provides students with special needs the support needed to receive the  free appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive  environment (LRE) guaranteed by the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act (IDEA Act).   6. Fully funds before and after school programs and other student  enrichment programs that help students succeed.   7. Fully funds programs that make federal housing safer through  energy efficient heating and cooling systems.   8. Preserves tax credit programs that help revitalize low income  communities.   9. Fully funds the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of  Energy programs developing the next generation of clean energy and  transportation technologies.   ``Provide for the common defense'':   1. Provides robust funding for the Department of State and USAID to  advance national security interests in places like Iraq and Afghanistan  and to end violent conflicts in trouble spots which could threaten the  security interests of the United States.   2. Provides adequate funding for United Nations peacekeeping missions  throughout the world and distribution of food aid to people in  developing and famine stricken countries, such as South Sudan, Somalia,  Yemen, and Nigeria.   ``To ensure domestic tranquility'':   1. Fully funds cost-sharing reduction subsidies, or CSRs, to  compensate insurers for reducing deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums  for low-income customers on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.   2. Protects the adequacy, solvency, and integrity of the Medicare and  Medicaid programs, which provide health sustaining support for 70  million Americans.   3. Fully funds the National Institutes of Health research programs so  that patient access to lifesaving treatments is not delayed.   4. Does not convert funding for the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention into block grants which would hindering the nation's ability  to respond swiftly and effectively to public health crises like Ebola,  Zika, and HIV/AIDS.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that if all members of the House and Senate  work together, we can reach agreement on an appropriate budget  framework that that invests in the American  [[Page H10403]]  people, preserves our national security, and keeps faith with the  values that have served our nation well and made the United States the  leading nation on earth.
