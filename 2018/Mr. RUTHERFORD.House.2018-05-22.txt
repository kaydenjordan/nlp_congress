 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Officer Lance Whitaker, who was killed in the early morning hours on  May 15, 2018, while responding to a police call for service.   Officer Whitaker began his law enforcement career with the Atlantic  Beach Police Department in Florida. He then joined the Jacksonville  Sheriff's Office and has since served the city of Jacksonville  faithfully for 17 years.   Officer Whitaker was known among his fellow officers for his kind  heart, and he had a very contagious smile. It was clear to those around  him that he loved his job and he believed in what he was doing.   Outside of work, Officer Whitaker was known as a proud father and  family man. He is survived by his 14-year-old son, Cade Whitaker.   Just 3 weeks ago, I attended the rededication of the Fallen Officers  Memorial Wall in Jacksonville, where we had the chance to remember and  celebrate the lives of 61 men who have died protecting our city.  Tragically, another name now must be added to that wall.   Today, I join the northeast Florida community to mourn the loss of  Officer Whitaker. His service to the First Coast will never be  forgotten, and my thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends,  and all of the JSO family, and I thank them for their sacrifice on  behalf of a grateful city.   Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: ``The purpose of life is not to be  happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to  have it make some difference that you lived and lived well.''   Officer Whitaker lived well. He did his job honorably and  compassionately. He dedicated his life to his community, and he made a  difference in the lives of many. Officer Whitaker lived his life well.        Recognizing River City Science Academy for Outstanding Success     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate River City  Science Academy of Jacksonville, Florida, for winning the State  championship in the Science Olympiad and for their excellent  representation in the national competition that took place in Fort  Collins, Colorado, on May 19, 2018. This remarkable achievement was the  first time a school from Duval County has won the State competition,  and I couldn't be more proud of the students, teachers, and parents who  came together to achieve this outstanding victory.   My district is home to some of the brightest students in the country,  and the academic excellence of the River City Science Academy is just  more proof of the robust STEM programs that we facilitate back home.   STEM education is so important in a highly competitive,  technologically driven economy, and I am thankful for the educators who  dedicate their lives to training the next scientists, mathematicians,  and engineers.   Congratulations once again to the River City Science Academy for  leading the way, and I look forward to hearing of their many successes  in the years to come.                            ____________________
