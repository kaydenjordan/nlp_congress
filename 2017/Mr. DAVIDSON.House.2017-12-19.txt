 Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to join Mr. Luetkemeyer in  supporting his bill. I am so encouraged that this is a bipartisan bill.   Listening to the Members opposed, I am concerned that the bill is  being highly mischaracterized. It occurred to me that when the Member  opposed mentioned that 97 percent of banks would not be affected by  this, that it automatically excludes 97 percent of banks from being  affected by this.   Mr. Luetkemeyer doesn't pick a number and say big is bad. He says:  Let's judge the bank by its behavior, not by the size of its balance  sheet.   This is a rational, measured approach, and that is why it has drawn  bipartisan support. It is focused on solving the problem, not driving  regulatory burdens.   Let me explain that the SIFI designation is an arbitrary number, and  it subjects banks with $50 billion or more in assets to the same  standards as trillion-dollar globally important financial banks.   So a bank with $51 billion would be regulated the same way as  JPMorgan Chase, for example.  [[Page H10228]]    Even former Chair Barney Frank, as has been mentioned, seized the  problem. Janet Yellen seized the problem.   People look at it and say: What can be a solution?   The Federal Reserve has seen a possible solution as judging the  character of the business activity. Mr. Luetkemeyer's bill firmly  addresses that.   A simple asset threshold captures numerous banks that are widely  perceived to be no threat to financial stability. It also distorts  growth decisions.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).
