 Mr. Speaker, I enlisted in the United States Army after  high school and arrived in West Germany in the spring of 1989. The Cold  War was at fever pitch, and at the Brandenburg Gate, President Reagan  famously said, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.''   On 9 November 1989, the East German people finally tore down their  own wall; not Gorbachev, not America, not the West, but the people  trapped on the other side of that wall.   I was there that Thanksgiving in the heart of Berlin when I met with  people experiencing their first hours of freedom. One man asked me,  ``Is it like this everywhere?'' I thought he meant like Berlin, a big  city. I am from western Ohio and a small town. He corrected me. He  said, No, the stores are open at night, and there is fresh milk and  everyone can go in?   He had been told a lie that we were poorer in the West than they  were, that only the elites could buy things, like the Communist Party  officials.   He was not alone. The wall had separated their Communists from our  freedom and free markets. The flood of people was to the land of  opportunity, not to the failed ideas of Marx and Lenin.   The United States of America is worth saving. To do that, we must  defend freedom and defeat socialism.
