 Madam Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 190th  anniversary  [[Page H1537]]  of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, the first treaty between the  United States and Thailand.   In fact, the historic agreement is distinguished as the first treaty  between the United States and any Asian country.   Since its establishment, the relationship and cooperation between our  two nations has thrived, providing benefits to both of our economies  and national security.   That is why earlier this month I introduced the bipartisan resolution  reaffirming our gratitude for our partnership and our continued  commitment to building our friendship.   As we celebrate the anniversary of the historic treaty of 1833, let  us also reaffirm our efforts to strengthen our strategic partnerships,  promote democracy, and secure our interests in Asia and around the  world.                            ____________________
