 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the  life, love, and special friendship of Ron Rice.   He had a heart as big as the Texas Panhandle, and he was a friend as  faithful as the west Texas sunrise. His signature contagious laugh can  be heard from heaven even in this day of profound grief.   But Uncle Ronnie, Joy, Tracey, Darren, and Rusty know what the  Scripture tells us and what God promises: that to be absent from the  body as a child of God is to be present with the Lord. So on this day,  Mr. Speaker, we don't grieve as the world grieves. As the Scripture  says, we should be pitied among all men if our hope is in this fallen  world. No, sir. We rally around the Rice family today. We join them in  thanking God and worshiping and praising God because Ron is home with  his Lord and Savior, Jesus, in eternal happiness, joy unspeakable, and  peace everlasting.   God bless the Rice family.   Guns up, Ron. You got the best seat in the House.                            Reducing National Debt     Mr. Speaker, Admiral Mullen was asked at a hearing  what he thought the greatest threat to national security was. His  response was powerful, simple, and very clear. He said the greatest  threat to our national security is our national debt. I would add that  it is not just a threat to our security, but it is a threat to our  prosperity; it is a threat to the blessings of liberty and opportunity  for our children; and it is a threat to domestic tranquility.   There is not a greater threat that looms larger on the horizon. There  is not a greater challenge in this 21st century and for my generation  than the potential and the prospects of a sovereign debt crisis.   We have no doubt experienced an unprecedented public health and  economic disaster as a result of the pandemic. But if we don't commit  to reducing our national debt, we will indeed face a crisis far graver  than what could come out of this pandemic.   We have experienced the largest generational retirement in history,  runaway healthcare costs, and record spending. Discretionary,  nondefense, and defense spending all have amassed a whopping $1  trillion in debt. This is pre-COVID. That is $1 trillion in annual  deficit spending, spending $1 trillion more on our Nation's priorities  and our budget over what we have to spend.   We have done that year in and year out, to the tune now of a $23- trillion debt and climbing. This is pre-COVID, I want to remind you,  Mr. Speaker.   Prior to COVID and the trillions of dollars that we are spending, we  were  [[Page H3699]]  on course to spend more to service our debt to bondholders like China  than all of our national defense combined in less than 10 years.   Now, the CBO has projected that we will add almost $4 trillion to our  national debt by the end of this fiscal year. As a result, we put  ourselves in a very, very tenuous position. We will exceed, Mr.  Speaker, our debt per the size of our economy as it was in World War  II, which was the largest debt position we ever held. We will set a  very dangerous precedent for the next generation. We will put them in a  very, very bad position.   So, Scott Peters and I got 30 Democrats and 30 Republicans, and we  picked a few budget reforms that would put us in a place and force  Congress to reduce our debt and hand this country in a better fiscal  position to our children.   We sent a letter with these three initiatives and reforms to our  leadership. We are imploring all of our colleagues and leadership from  both Houses: Please seize this opportunity to include these budget  process reforms so that, when we get through this crisis, we won't have  to endure the ultimate crisis.   We will not, Mr. Speaker, be able to bail out of that, print money,  or borrow enough. It will be a disaster of epic proportions, so I  implore my colleagues to please support budget process reforms in this  next COVID legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, we are here as lovers of liberty, as  patriots, as people concerned about the future of our country, just  citizen legislators, people who have children and grandchildren and who  want our posterity to inherit the blessings of liberty and all of the  opportunities this great Nation has afforded not only myself and my  colleagues, but all Americans.   America is a great nation, and God has truly blessed America. America  has been a blessing to the world, and as President Trump has said, we  must keep America great.   It is not just what that statement means to our citizens and to our  children and the next generation of Americans; it is what America means  and what this great experiment at liberty and democracy means for the  entire world.   Mr. Speaker, we are going to talk about the substance of that  greatness, the true substance of it.   I would suggest that what makes America great is the American people  and the values, the beliefs--what defines us--our culture, what we  esteem.   That is what we must remember as we legislate, as we lead and  represent our citizens throughout this great land, that what makes  America great and what will keep America great are America's values. We  must defend them. We must promote them.                                time  1945    We must fight for a future that has those values of faith, In God We  Trust, one Nation under the sovereignty of God, with a firm belief, as  John Adams says, that the Constitution is only good for a moral and  religious people, for example.   He understood that, at the foundation of this great country, that we  would only be able to persist, and we have only persisted as the  longest democracy in the history of the world because we bow the knee  to our sovereign God, who, as Ben Franklin said, if a sparrow cannot  fall to the ground apart from His will, then a Nation cannot rise apart  from it. And I would submit that this great Nation cannot persist  without that.   We recognize that you can pass all the laws you want and, certainly,  laws have their place in civil order, and the enforcement of those laws  are critical for the domestic tranquility of our country. But you are  not going to change anyone's heart through passing laws.   And John Adams and our Founders understood that if this republic  would continue for generations it would be because we always remembered  that above and beyond passing good laws and making good policy is that  we would recognize that we have a higher accountability, and that  accountability is Almighty God, that same God whose providential hand  was with this Nation from the very beginning and, I pray, will continue  with all of us, on both sides of the aisle.   Every person that swears an oath and has the good fortune and  privilege of serving, I pray God's gracious and providential hand will  continue to guide us in the challenges that we face today.   We have our 21st century challenges, just like every generation has  and, I would submit, we must return to what made this country great.   Tonight, we are going to reflect on America's values, America's  culture, and America's heritage, and why it matters to fight and defend  those values.   I have dear friends who are much more articulate, Mr. Speaker, than I  am on this, and they speak from the heart. They speak with personal  conviction. They ran for office to serve, and to strive for a more  perfect union, and to hand this country better than we found it to  their children and grandchildren.   One of those individuals is Ralph Norman, from the great State of  South Carolina, a businessman who decided that he would make tremendous  sacrifice. He has got a beautiful and big family, and he said this is  the best way he can love his grandchildren is to love his country  through service and through making it better by passing the right laws  and upholding the right values.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I consider him  a great friend. As he spoke, I was thinking about the statement that  Alexis de Tocqueville made that, I think, truly hits at the heart of  this experiment that has persisted as the greatest beacon of liberty in  all the land and, I mean, in all the globe, and that is America is  great because America is good. And part of our goodness is civil  discourse and debate.    Mr. Speaker, I am going to introduce another classmate and colleague  of ours,   Jim Banks; and he was part of our class that came in and  said from the outset we need civil discourse. We have strong  convictions. We have deeply held beliefs, and we will fight for the  traditional American values that we believe have made America great.   But we can do that right here, without tearing a single person down,  and contributing to the swampiness of this place and being a great  example to generations of Americans.   The gentleman represents that. He is a great statesman, a great  American. I thank him for his time.   The next colleague of mine, from the Hoosier State, who is, no doubt,  a freedom fighter, and who I am terribly honored to serve with, and to  know his beautiful family, his wife, Amanda, and his three children. I  thank Representative Banks for joining us and taking part in this  discussion about defending America's values.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my beloved brother in Christ and  dear friend for not only his service as a Member of Congress, but for  his service in wearing the uniform.   I think, at its core, this mission that we have to steward and to  protect, as the Federal Government's limited--emphasis on limited--role  in the affairs of our great citizenry, is to keep us safe and keep us  free.   I thank the gentleman for doing that for his whole career. And God  bless him for his service, both in the military and here in the United  States Congress. I am honored to serve with him.   Now, another liberty loving Texan who has been in public service, who  has been a prosecutor, and has been a leader for our Lone Star State;  and, now, he too, has been willing to leave a lot of good things  behind, including a loving family, to come up here to this city and to  fight for our freedom, to change the culture of this place so that it  serves the people who hold the sovereignty and the future in their  hands. He is a dear friend, and I am honored to have him, Chip Roy, of  the great State of Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, as we say in west Texas, amen and amen. I  could listen to Representative Roy all night because he speaks from his  heart and from a passion for his country and for his fellow countrymen.  He is a truth seeker and a fighter for all that is good about this  country.   We are glad the gentleman is here as part of the great delegation of  Texas. We are all better in this body because of his presence and his  service as a Member of Congress.   May God bless the gentleman. I thank him for his words tonight.   Now, I want to invite another colleague who is a lover of freedom and  a great patriot, who is unabashed and beaming in his pride for the  United States of America.    Mr. Allen is another gentleman who could be doing a lot of things. He  is an accomplished businessman who could be doing a lot of things and  spending a lot of quality time with his children and grandchildren,  but, once again, he believes that the best way he can love his family  and love those grandchildren is to hand them a better, stronger, safer,  and freer United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the 12th District of  Georgia (Mr. Allen), who is my dear friend.    Mr. Speaker, my colleague and brother in Christ speaks  the truth. And as I said, we can pass all the laws we want,  Representative Allen, but we cannot pass laws that change the human  heart.   We must return to those core values, to that relationship with God to  remember that the greatest commandment is to love God with all your  heart, soul, mind, and strength, and to love your neighbor. And it is  hard to find a lot of love in this world today.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining on my Special  Order.    Mr. Speaker, the rise of socialism in this country is  real. Probably in times past it was used hyperbolically against Big  Government, liberals, but it is real, and it is hard to believe that  such a destructive system of government and deceptive ideology has  become mainstream in these United States. This beacon of freedom, this  great experiment--not accident, but experiment--and liberty and  democracy.   How do I know? Because people don't put their name to legislation on  behalf of the 800,000 to a million American citizens they represent if  they don't mean it.                                time  2030    H.R. 1 through H.R. 10 are just more government control, less freedom  to we, the people, government takeover of elections, the Federal  Government takeover of healthcare, taking over agriculture and energy  and government seeping into every facet of our lives.   One of our central values, as we think about the defense of American  values, is the value of freedom. And the central purpose of government  is to protect our freedom. The central tenet of our democratic republic  is that sovereignty resides, not in the State, but in we, the people.   There has been no other nation in the world, in the history of the  world, that has done more because of that powerful force of freedom  that elevates and unleashes the human spirit like nothing in the world,  save and except the love of God, and no other country that holds  freedom in such high regard and puts such a premium on freedom, on  liberty, has done more to lift people out of poverty, to protect human  rights and fundamental God-given freedoms.   No other nation has raised the standard of living or contributed to  the quality of life, not only in this Nation, but in nations around the  world, like the United States of America.  [[Page H3835]]    And I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that in large part, outside--save  and except the providential hand and favor of Almighty God, that God  that my colleague, Representative Rick Allen, implored us to return to,  to repent and return and cry out for mercy--save and except for that,  it has been freedom.   And this freedom is a remarkable thing. It is an attribute, it is a  privilege, it is a responsibility, and people are literally risking  their lives today--people will die this week just trying to get here.   They are not trying to get into Venezuela. They are not trying to get  into Cuba. God bless those people and the poor citizens of those  countries that don't have what we have that empowers us to be the envy  of the world. And that is a tremendous responsibility.   And there is no doubt that is a core value. And I say: How are we  losing this? How do we actually have a debate, a sincere debate, a  legitimate debate, about government control, central planning,  socialism as an ideology and as a system of government, when we have  the backdrop of all of this history?   No, it is not perfect. We were striving for a more perfect Union.  Imperfect people striving for a more perfect Union. And that is the  legacy that has been handed to us. That is our mission and our calling.   I think about the erosion of the values we have talked about this  evening. I think about the entitlement culture that we have created. I  say ``we.'' I say Republicans and Democrats alike. We continue to  expand the government as the answer to all that ails us, as the  solution to every problem, with no regard for the cost and consequence.   $23 trillion before COVID; $4 trillion by the end of this year added  on top of it. We will surpass our highest debt load per GDP in the  history of this great Nation. Not since World War II have we been up  over 108 percent debt-to-GDP. That is where we are heading.   And we have done that, and it has been at no cost. We don't hit  anybody's pocketbook, and we don't cut someone's pet project and their  favorite program to offset the cost.   So why wouldn't people think you can get everything for free? Why  wouldn't we have created a generation of Americans that think things  are really free, at no cost?   Well, there will be a rude awaking when the chickens come home to  roost with respect to our fiscal affairs, because this $27-$28  trillion, on our way, is a deferred tax on our children. And it is  unconscionable. It is immoral. And it is un-American for a generation  of leaders to do that to our posterity.   On top of that, we have had the tyranny of usurpation of the will of  the people. Listen, let's debate issues of immigration, let's debate  all issues, and may the will of the people prevail. That is the way it  works. Not by executive fiat, not by judicial activism, some judge  making the determination of what is best. The people know what's best.   I believe that that government fiat and the tyranny of unelected  bureaucrats and judges making policy decisions is another way we have  accelerated the decline of this country, and we have moved away from  these values.   I think now we are seeing maybe another phase of this. Mob tyranny,  people running around in the streets destroying property, assaulting  police officers and law-abiding citizens. It is just a free-for-all. No  law, no order; chaos.   And our great American cities are just burning, I believe, in large  part, because our local leaders in these cities, they are scared  because they have been intimidated. And that is how the mob works,  through fear and intimidation, and nobody is standing up to them.   But the people who have the resources, the people who are law-abiding  contributors to those cities, and the best employers, they will  eventually leave. But the poorest among our fellow countrymen in those  cities, they can't go anywhere.   Mr. Speaker, I think the President is doing exactly what he should  do. I am very sensitive to government intervention, and I think it is a  very delicate thing when you intervene in civil affairs. That is a  local and State issue.   But when you have this kind of mob violence that is unabated, when  you have systems of law enforcement and local leaders that are  overwhelmed and either unwilling or incapable of stopping it and you  are risking the lives of our fellow Americans and their rights are  being trampled and local law enforcement and Federal law enforcement  officers are being assaulted and our buildings are being burned, Mr.  Speaker, we have got to do something.   There is an appropriate way to engage, and this President has done  that, through civil law enforcement officers of this Government to go  protect that property, to protect those law enforcement and other  Federal personnel, and to come alongside the local law enforcement  there in Portland and Seattle so that they can keep some semblance of  order and protection for their people. Because the local leaders have  completely abdicated it.    And Americans all over are just scratching their heads and their  hearts are breaking and they are tremendously concerned about what  happens. And there is one thought that you just let it all burn to the  ground, and that will be the lesson for Americans all over this  country, in cities and communities, all over this country. We could do  that.   Or we could say: You know what? Those are American citizens, by God.  Those are American citizens, and nobody is coming to their help.   I hope we support this President as he is taking a measured approach  to come alongside those local law enforcement officers who have been  totally disrespected, dismissed, and either partially defunded or  significantly defunded, and certainly hamstrung to do their job.   You watch as these criminals shoot fireworks in their faces and as  they rough them up and call them names. It is just a sad scenario for a  Nation as great as ours.   We are big enough to have the protests. That is as American as apple  pie. Peaceful assembly, peaceful protest, speaking your truth to power,  that is what made this country great. But what we are seeing in Seattle  and Portland must stop. And we all must condemn it, Mr. Speaker.   And as for me, I stand with this President, and I say use every  resource--use every resource in civil law enforcement to keep the  peace, to protect our citizens and protect the taxpayers' Federal  property in all these cities where their local leaders have completely  lost control.   Mr. Speaker, thank you for the indulgence tonight, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                            ____________________
