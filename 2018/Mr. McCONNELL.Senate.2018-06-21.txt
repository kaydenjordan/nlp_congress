 Madam President, this week, we have been considering a  regular appropriations package and voting on amendments.   Many of us have wanted this return to regular order in appropriations  for quite some time. It didn't happen overnight. We owe thanks to  Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Leahy for the transparent,  bipartisan process that has produced this bill. Thanks to the  leadership of our colleagues at the subcommittee level, more bills will  be on their way to the floor for prompt consideration.   The package before us today will cross three important items off the  Senate's appropriations to-do list: funding for Energy and Water, for  Military Construction and the VA, and for the Legislative Branch.   As I have discussed on the floor this week, the first set of funding  measures attend to a number of major national priorities. The Energy  and Water title allocates critical resources for the safety, security,  and readiness of our Nation's nuclear arsenal. It delivers record  funding for cutting-edge scientific research, and it directs support  for mitigating flood damage, protecting shorelines, and upkeep for  America's inland waterways, like those that support 13,000 jobs in my  home State alone.   The Military Construction and VA title offers targeted resources to  causes that are near and dear to servicemembers and their families:  upgrades to military housing and school systems, improvements to  training facilities, reinforcement of overseas partnerships and  alliances, and maintenance of veterans' healthcare facilities.   There is so much important work contained in this package, and it is  just the first step in this year's regular appropriations process.   With additional cooperation today, we will be able to continue  processing amendments on both sides of the aisle and complete work on  these bills.                                  Tax Reform    Now, Madam President, on another matter, yesterday marked 6 months  since Congress passed our overhaul of America's Tax Code. Tomorrow is 6  months since the President signed it into law.  [[Page S4314]]    I remember debating the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act back in December. There  were two different philosophies on display. Republicans believed  working families should keep more of what they earn and send less to  the IRS. We believe you don't build a healthy society or a growing  economy by piling up money and power here in Washington, DC. We need to  leave more money and power in the hands of individuals, families, and  small businesses.   Our Democratic friends put forward a different view. They seem to  think government knows best, so higher taxes, more regulations, and  more restrictions on free enterprise are the way to go. As a result,  they stood in lockstep opposition to these historic tax cuts, and I  mean opposition.   The Democratic leader in the House said it was--and this is a direct  quote--``the worst bill in the history of the United States Congress.''  So Republican majorities in the House and Senate passed the tax cuts  with zero Democratic votes--not one.   Six months later, who was right? What has happened in America since  this major policy shift began taking effect?   Just ask the men and women this law is affecting.   Mark Guilbeau in Louisiana says this of his tax cuts:         It's bigger than crumbs like the politicians were saying. I       plan to pay down some credit card debt.    Try Brett Lancy in Ohio who has a 1-year-old son, Grayson. Brett  said:         Due to the extra takehome pay in my paycheck--it's about       $125 a month--we've been able to move him into one of the       better daycares in our area. And it's just fabulous.    In addition to the tax cuts themselves, the business side of tax  reform has helped employers raise pay and benefits for employees.   Chelsee Hatfield works at First Farmers Bank & Trust in Indiana. She  has been taking college courses online and says the raise and bonus she  received will help her pay tuition now and save for her kids to go to  college. She said: ``These steps taken as a result of tax reform are  specifically affecting me and small communities like my hometown.''   Bonnie Brazzeal from Missouri received a bonus too. She works in the  cafeteria at the College of the Ozarks and got to share the news with  President Trump when he visited the State earlier this year: ``I put  mine in savings for my retirement.''   Families are immediately benefiting from this law, but what about the  long-term impact?   We designed tax reform to lay the foundation for more investment,  business growth, job creation, and higher wages for decades to come.   It is already doing just that. In my home State of Kentucky, Novelis  is pushing ahead with a $300 million factory in Guthrie. They say their  decision was caused by this ``favorable economic environment,''  reinforced by ``the significant positive impact of tax reform.''   It is a national trend. Just yesterday, the National Association of  Manufacturers released data showing that optimism among many American  manufacturers is above 95 percent--the highest level ever recorded.   Small business owners agree. An industry survey shows that more of  them are looking to hire than at any time since the year 2000.   No wonder the job market is already better than it has been in  years. Unemployment is at an 18-year low. More than two-thirds of  Americans are saying it is a good time to find a quality job--the  highest in 17 years.    Here is a remarkable fact: There are now more job openings all across  this country than there are Americans looking for work. It is the first  time that has ever happened since we started tracking the relevant  data, and the optimism and prosperity unleashed by tax reform are part  of the reason why.   The worst legislation in history? Armageddon? Our friends across the  aisle should get their crystal balls checked.   Historically, tax reform had been a bipartisan priority. In 1986, the  last major tax reform passed the House by a 100-vote margin. It sailed  through the Senate. How times have changed.   Unlike in 1986, this time our historic proposal to let Americans keep  more of their own money faced complete partisan opposition--not one  Democratic vote, not one. Republicans had to go it alone.   But the people's Republican Senate, Republican House, and Republican  President got the job done for the families who were counting on us.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, look, this is a big test for the  Senate. There is broad bipartisan agreement that we need to quit doing  Omnibus appropriations bills. Chairman Shelby and Senator Leahy have  gotten not only the committee in a good place, but Senator Alexander  has handled this bill in such a way that we have had broad cooperation  in getting it across the floor so as to get it into conference and  actually make a law--the three appropriations bills.   There is no doubt about it--I can't find many people on this side of  the aisle who approve of the previous administration's waters of the  United States regulation. It is on its way to the ash heap of history  right now under this administration.   This is not about waters of the United States or about whether we are  for it or against it; this is about whether we want to get away from  annual Omnibus appropriations bills, and this is the first test here.  We have a minibus consisting of three bills, and we have had widespread  cooperation to get it across the floor. This amendment needs to be  tabled because this is not the right place to offer it.   I will be joining the senior Senator from Tennessee, the chairman of  the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, in tabling this  amendment. Make no mistake about it--it is not because I support the  waters of the United States but because that is being taken care of,  and we want to have regular order and the passage of appropriations  bills this year.            Amendment No. 3021, as Modified, to Amendment No. 2911     Mr. President, I call up Lee amendment No. 3021, as  modified, to Alexander amendment No. 2911.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture motions on the substitute  amendment No. 2910 and the bill be withdrawn. I further ask that the  managers' package, which is at the desk and has been cleared by both  sides, be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table, amendment No. 2911 be agreed to, the substitute  amendment No. 2910, as amended, be agreed to; finally, that at 5:30  p.m. on Monday, June 25, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate  vote on passage of H.R. 5895, as amended.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order to move to proceed to H.R. 2, the farm bill, during today's  session of the Senate.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.R. 2 and send a  cloture motion to the desk for the motion to proceed.  [[Page S4337]]     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the consideration of the following  nomination: PN1641.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the  nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that no  further motions be in order; and that any statements related to this  nomination be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  recognize Wendell Lawrence, of Elizabethtown, KY, who will be retiring  from his role as the executive director of the Lincoln Trail Area  Development District, LTADD, on August 1. After 35 years of service,  including more than two decades as the executive director, Wendell  leaves a lasting impact on his community and has helped the  organization fulfill its mission.   Comprised of eight counties--Breckinridge, Grayson, Hardin, Larue,  Marion, Meade, Nelson, and Washington--the LTADD was formed in 1968 to  foster regional strategies and partnerships to benefit the citizens of  the Commonwealth. Kentucky was the first in the Nation to establish a  statewide system of regional development organizations.   This region is an important part of Kentucky's economy and culture.  It is the home of both the Abraham Lincoln National Historical Park and  Fort Knox, a vital U.S. Army installation and the site of the U.S.  Bullion Depository. Comprised of small businesses, heritage sites, and  agricultural centers, the Lincoln Trail is a rich part of both our  Commonwealth's history and its future. Under Wendell's leadership, the  LTADD has helped communities and organizations secure grants and  resources to help the area continue to thrive.   During his time leading the district, Wendell has helped establish a  number of partnerships to increase the region's competitiveness and  benefit its workers. With organizations like OneKnox and WIRED65, the  region has leveraged unique geographical and commercial resources to  help it flourish. Wendell also worked closely with Fort Knox to expand  the installation's potential and to assist Fort Knox area military  personnel transitioning out of service into the workforce through his  role as the former advisory board chairman of Where Opportunity Knox.  Although the region has changed and developed during his tenure,  Wendell's diligent leadership of the LTADD has set the area and many of  its award-winning municipalities on a pathway to a bright future.   This year marks the 50th anniversary of the LTADD. At a recent event  to commemorate, its half century of excellence, the members showed  their gratitude to Wendell by surprising him with their Lifetime  Achievement Award. Wendell's dedicated service to the district  throughout his impressive career has endeared him to so many in this  area.   In addition to his passionate work in the Lincoln Trial area, Wendell  also used his talents for the good of Kentucky and other causes close  to his heart. As a previous chairman of the Kentucky Association of  District Directors, he helped encourage economic growth throughout the  Commonwealth. A retired captain in the U.S. Army Reserve with 23 years  of Active and Reserve service, he is also passionate about our Nation's  military and is a life member of the Reserve Officers Association and  former member of the board of directors of the George S. Patton Museum  and Center of Leadership at Fort Knox.   On a personal note, I have always enjoyed working with Wendell on  behalf of the people of Kentucky. His decades of leadership have  produced tangible benefits for the Lincoln Trail area, which will  continue to be felt for years to come. In addition, his daughter Amanda  is a constituent caseworker in my Louisville office. It is clear that a  commitment to helping Kentuckians runs in the family.   When Wendell retires later this year, he will begin a new chapter in  his life. Whatever his next adventure may hold in store, I am confident  that with the support of his wife, Jackie, and their children, Amanda,  Thomas, and Meredith, he will continue to find success.   I would like to join the people of Kentucky and the staff of the  Lincoln Trail Area Development District in thanking Wendell for his  years of achievement and wishing him well in the future. I urge my  Senate colleagues to join me.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the  Senate the House message to accompany S. 1091.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 1091) entitled       ``An Act to establish a Federal Task Force to Support       Grandparents Raising Grandchildren.'', do pass with       amendments.     I move to concur in the House amendments.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs be discharged from further consideration  of S. Res. 551 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m., Monday,  June 25; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed. I further ask that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 5895 under the  previous order. Finally, I ask that the cloture motion filed during  today's session ripen following disposition of H.R. 5895.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:35 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, June 25, 2018, at 3 p.m.                            ____________________
