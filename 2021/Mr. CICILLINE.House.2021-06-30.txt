 Mr. Speaker, our infrastructure is stuck in the 1950s,  and it doesn't have to be this way. It is long past time for America to  bring our bridges, roads, public transit, and water infrastructure into  the 21st century.   The INVEST in America Act provides $715 billion to accomplish this  goal through bold investments in modern, sustainable infrastructure.  This legislation will create millions of good-paying jobs while  combating climate change and investing in the well-being of our cities  and towns.   I worked with Chairman DeFazio and the committee to secure nearly $20  million in funding for four high-priority infrastructure projects in  Rhode Island.   The quality of roads and bridges is particularly important. That is  why I introduced amendment 19, to bring funding for the National Scenic  Byways Program in line with historic funding levels, adjusted for  inflation. This will allow the Secretary of Transportation to designate  new National Scenic Byways and All-American Roads; and allow already  designated roads, including the Revolutionary Heritage Byway in  Bristol, Rhode Island, to apply for competitive grants.   I urge the House to adopt the en bloc package 4, which includes my  amendment No. 19, and to pass the underlying bill without delay.
