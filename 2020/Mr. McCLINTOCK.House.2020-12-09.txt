 Mr. Speaker, every American needs to see Angela  Marsden's tearful video as she pours out her frustrations as a small  restaurant owner in Los Angeles.   Forced to drastically curtail her business during California's brutal  shutdowns, she took out an $80,000 loan to meet all the expensive  requirements to move her dining outside and salvage what was left of  her life's work.   Instead, authorities arbitrarily changed the rules and shut her down  again, a death sentence for her 10-year-old restaurant. Yet, the same  authorities permitted a film production company to offer the very same  outdoor dining across the very same parking lot the day she had to  close her business.   ``I am losing everything,'' she says through her tears. ``Everything  I own is being taken away from me.''   In Staten Island, police hauled a restaurant owner away in handcuffs  for desperately trying to reopen his establishment just across the  tracks from other restaurants where dining was allowed under precisely  the same conditions.   When asked to explain these capricious standards, California's  Governor Gavin Newsom smarmed: Oh, I am deeply empathetic.   Well, that must be a load off of their minds.   The Fifth Amendment in our Bill of Rights specifically protects  Americans from being deprived of life, liberty, or property without due  process of law. Where are those rights today?   Congress is now discussing how to provide relief for the thousands of  small business owners, their employees, and the families that depend on  them who have been crushed by these reckless edicts.   As usual, politicians measure their empathy by how much they are  willing to spend of other people's money.   But the fine point of the matter is this: Government cannot support  the economy for any significant period of time because government does  not finance the economy. It is the economy that finances the  government. When you shut down the economy, you shut down the revenues  that go to the government.   The only genuine relief from the COVID lockdowns is to end the COVID  lockdowns. Why is it so hard for some people to understand that? By  now, it ought to be obvious that the lockdowns have failed to contain  this virus.   After 9 months of this unprecedented experiment in social  engineering, the virus continues to spread. Common sense should tell us  that the more infectious a virus and the deeper it has already  penetrated into a population, the less effective mass isolation will  be.   The plight of Angela Marsden and countless victims of these policies  tell us clearly what we are very effectively accomplishing. We are  destroying our society.   We have set in motion countless avoidable deaths by suicide, drug and  alcohol abuse, domestic violence, deferred health treatments, deferred  health screenings, and poverty that will stalk us for many years to  come. We have robbed our youth of a year of their educations.   Nearly half of American retailers say they are now in imminent danger  of permanently closing. Forbes magazine reports: ``The number one worry  on most small business owners' mind now is the threat of more  government-mandated business closures.''   Eleven million Americans who had jobs in February no longer have  those jobs today.   Modern science and its many breakthroughs in immunology,  epidemiology, and virology have given us advanced treatments and  vaccines unparalleled in human history. But science is grotesquely  incompetent to reorder human societies or to change the laws of human  nature, nor does it give officials the omniscience to know what is best  for every person in every circumstance, nor does it give them the right  to wantonly destroy people's lives and livelihoods. After all,  medicine's most ancient command is: First, do no harm.   We have arbitrarily and indiscriminately destroyed the life's work  and  [[Page H7050]]  life's dreams of millions of Americans like Angela Marsden. We have  made the most sacred right of Americans to life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness into a hollow and bitter mockery.   The American people don't need the Governor's empathy, and they don't  need politicians' handouts. They need a government that protects their  right to make a living and to lead their own lives according to their  own best judgment.   They need their Bill of Rights back, and above all, they need their  freedom back.                            ____________________
