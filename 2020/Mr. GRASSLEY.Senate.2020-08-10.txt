 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute as in morning business, please.    Mr. President, today our national public health and  economic crisis continues without additional legislative action.  Reports over the weekend indicate that the Senate minority leader  believes that he can hold out for a massive, unwieldy bill that even  includes unrelated policies, yet refuse to consider action where there  is already consensus. The New York Times reported that the Speaker  ``believes she has the upper hand'' and ``does not intend to lose it.''   The other side refuses to support even the relief measures where  there is broad bipartisan agreement, such as providing additional funds  for unemployment benefits, the Paycheck Protection Program, education,  State and local governments, recovery checks, and hiring and employee- retention incentives. This shows us where their priorities are-- politics, not people. That is a shame.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
