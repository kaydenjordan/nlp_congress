 Mr. Speaker, the alarm bell has been sounding for over  a decade on the urgent need to permanently protect Dreamers in America.   For years, we have tried and tried to get a solution across the  finish line, but there are Members of this body who have lacked the  heart to do the right thing and get this done.   This is shameful.   It is now or never. If we don't act in this session, then DACA could  end as early as next year. Immigrant youth deserve better. They are our  teachers, firefighters, nurses, small business owners, servicemembers,  and leaders across our country.   Their contributions of $1.7 billion annually benefit all of us.   America is their home, and they deserve every opportunity to achieve  the American Dream and continue to contribute to our economy and our  great country.   I urge my colleagues to fight for a pathway to citizenship for  Dreamers, and I pray that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  do the right thing and put forth humane solutions, not senseless  legislation that keeps countless immigrant people in the shadows.                            ____________________
