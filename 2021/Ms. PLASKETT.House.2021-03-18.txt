 Mr. Speaker, this week, House Democrats are building on  the progress made under the Biden-Harris administration to reverse the  Trump damage and reform our failing system by passing two historic and  important bills:   H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act to protect Dreamers, TPS,  and DED recipients; and the Farm Workforce Modernization Act to uphold  the dignity of workers who feed America.   Americans want solutions on immigration. Voters overwhelmingly  support a path to citizenship, reforms to our legal immigration system,  smart management of our borders. Just like with the American Rescue  Plan, there is strong bipartisan support for immigration reform across  the country, just not within this body.   For too long, we have kept our arms closed to people who, under  similar circumstances 100 years ago, 30 years ago, would have been  given a path to citizenship. But now the doors are closed.   Mr. Speaker, 55,000 Haitians came to this country after the  earthquakes.  [[Page H1506]]  They are in limbo. Congress must act, and these two overwhelmingly  popular, commonsense bills would ensure that immigrants who make  America more American can continue to strengthen, enrich, and  contribute to our country.                            ____________________
