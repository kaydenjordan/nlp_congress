 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chairman's good work on  this legislation.   In my district and in many rural communities around the country, wood  burning stoves and heaters are a popular heat source, and an affordable  one as well; and it is a renewable fuel. And I will tell you what: the  person who utilizes a wood stove to heat their home is not a special  interest.   The EPA's New Source Performance Standards for products like wood and  pellet stoves and wood furnaces have raised significant concerns. This  regulation sets forth an unrealistic and unachievable timeline for  manufacturers of these products to come into compliance with the  standards in time.   I have heard from manufacturers and retailers, like England's Stove  Works in Amherst County in my district, that it is not that they don't  want to comply with the rule, they just simply need more time. For just  one wood stove, it can take up to 6 months to complete the EPA  certification process.   In the meantime, the availability of wood stoves--the affordability  of this heating source for my constituents and other people in mostly  rural areas, but other communities as well around the country, is going  to go up.   The BRICK Act, before the House today, includes provisions from a  bill that I introduced along with Representative Collin Peterson, the  Relief from New Source Performance Standards Act. This provision is a  simple one. It simply extends the time wood stove manufacturers have to  comply with Federal regulations by 3 years.   Affordable heat is important to my constituents, and Federal  regulations must take into account the real world needs and time  constraints of the industries that make these products and must now  develop new technologies.   I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill today to give  this industry more time and ensure consumers can choose wood heat  sources to help keep their families warm.
