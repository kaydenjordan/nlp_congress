 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  1425.   Since enactment of the ACA, millions of Americans have gained health  coverage, but too many families have been left behind by GOP Governors  and legislatures more interested in playing politics than helping  families.   Today, we build on that success.   Each year, more than 700 American women die from pregnancy  complications, and more than half of these deaths are entirely  preventable.   Tragically, Black moms die at three to four times the rate of White  moms, but passing this bill will help address that by allowing new moms  to remain on Medicaid for the entire postpartum period. And this piece  of legislation left the Committee on Energy and Commerce with many  Republican votes.   This portion is just one example of the good in this bill and the  lives it will save. We cannot allow preventable deaths to continue in  this country. We must do more. It was safer for me to have my daughter  than it is for my daughter now to have a baby.   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this lifesaving  legislation.   There is a lot of talk about how we should care about the health of  the American citizens, and one thing that we all can do is wear a mask.
