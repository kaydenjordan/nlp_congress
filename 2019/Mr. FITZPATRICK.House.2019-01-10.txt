 Mr. Speaker, yesterday our Nation recognized  National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, and I am proud to stand here  today with my colleagues to express our gratitude to the brave women  and men who sacrifice for our safety each and every day.   I would like to recognize the memory and legacy of one law  enforcement officer who left an indelible mark on families in Bucks  County and beyond. Bill Sample, a Chalfont resident who passed away in  2014, was a Philadelphia police officer who founded the Sunshine  Foundation in 1976.   Based in Southampton, the Sunshine Foundation, which seeks to help  chronically ill, physically challenged, and abused children from  underserved families, was inspired by Bill working protective duty at  St. Christopher's Children's Hospital. To date, the Sunshine Foundation  has answered over 40,000 dreams of deserving children.   Mr. Speaker, I speak on behalf of our entire community when I say  that I am thankful and we are all thankful for our law enforcement  community and for officers like Bill Sample. We want to thank him and  all law enforcement officers for their service and applaud the work of  the Sunshine Foundation.                          Recognizing Caleb Byelich     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  outstanding young citizen in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who at only 8  years old is already making a substantial impact in the lives of the  underserved in our community.   Caleb Byelich, a student at Neidig Elementary School in Quakertown,  held a hot cocoa stand last month with the goal of raising $100 for the  Upper Bucks Code Blue Shelter, a program that advocates for the  homeless in upper Bucks County.   To say that Caleb's stand was a success, Mr. Speaker, would be an  understatement. Through selling hot cocoa and with the help of  additional donations that came in days later, Caleb was able to raise  $1,715 for the Upper Bucks Code Blue Shelter.   We applaud Caleb for his remarkable work, and I look forward to  seeing his accomplishments in the years to come. We would also like to  thank his parents, Loren and Alicia, for instilling in him the values  of service and compassion.   We would also like to extend our gratitude to Pastor David Heckler of  St. Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church for his coordination of the  Upper Bucks Code Blue Shelter.                          Recognizing Vincent Kabaso     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an individual  in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, who recently accomplished a major  feat in his industry.   Vincent Kabaso of Ambler has become the first Professional Golf  Association member from his home nation of Zambia, a country of 17  million people. Vinny currently works as a golf professional at  Talamore Country Club in Ambler.   Vinny's love of golf came at a very young age. After graduating from  high school in 2004, he studied in England and Scotland before becoming  a coach on the Zambia national golf team. He later came to the United  States where he served as a golf professional in Connecticut before  moving to Pennsylvania.   In addition to his golf talent, Vinny has also founded a nonprofit  organization and he is also an author. He established the Raised by the  World Foundation, which assists students at the University of Zambia  and provides used equipment for young golfers.   Mr. Speaker, we applaud this major professional achievement of  Vincent Kabaso, and wish his wife, Hannah, and daughter, JoAnna, all  the best. Our community appreciates their service and their  accomplishments.                            ____________________
