 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank the  airmen of the 442nd Mission Support Group who returned home to Whiteman  Air Force Base last month after a 6-month deployment. These dedicated  reservists were deployed across six bases in support of Operation  Resolute Support and provided vital base functions for our military  overseas.   The reservists of the 442nd left their homes, jobs, families, and  friends to travel overseas to support our military's mission. I admire  their commitment, their sacrifice, and dedication to our Nation. Their  bravery and sacrifice deserve our appreciation and respect, and I am  glad to welcome them home  [[Page H7229]]  and thank them for their service to our country.   I would also like to take a moment to thank their families for their  commitment to our country. America's military families say good-bye to  their spouses, parents, children, and siblings for extended periods of  time for the good of our Nation. They are unsung heroes, and they, too,  deserve our recognition for their sacrifice.   So to the airmen of the 442nd, you and your families have our undying  gratitude. You are truly heroes. Welcome home, and thank you for your  service.                            ____________________
