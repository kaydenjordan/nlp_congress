 Madam Speaker, once again, Senate Republicans are  trying to pass a healthcare bill without serious hearings or a proper  CBO score. But the process is not the only issue with this proposed  legislation.   The Graham-Cassidy bill would allow States to end critical consumer  protections established in law by the Affordable Care Act. These  protections ensure that patients with preexisting conditions can access  affordable coverage and won't face lifetime caps that force families to  choose between lifesaving care and bankruptcy.   Regardless of whether you receive insurance through your employer or  the individual market, this bill, the Graham-Cassidy bill, endangers  access to quality, affordable health coverage for every American.  [[Page H7475]]    Senators have proposed changes to this bill, but they cannot change  the underlying fact that it would be unconscionable to rip healthcare  away from more than 32 million Americans. I implore the Senate to  reject this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to work in a  bipartisan manner to reduce costs and expand coverage.                            ____________________
