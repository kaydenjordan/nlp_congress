 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  working with me on this important issue. I also thank leadership for  recognizing this issue and working with me to fix the problem.   I am proud to rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 2581, the Verify  First Act.   My bill is intended to stop fraud in the distribution of healthcare  tax credits and protect taxpayer dollars. It is simple: the American  people expect that we are verifying that someone qualifies for taxpayer  money before that money goes out the door.   This is about the Federal Government being good stewards of the money  our constituents send to Washington. Every Federal dollar that goes to  someone committing fraud is a dollar that is not going to a person who  truly needs and deserves assistance.   No one should be allowed to commit fraud at the taxpayers' expense.  No business would give a refund without first verifying a receipt.   Yet this is exactly what is happening under our current healthcare  system. The law claims that taxpayer money will only go to people who  qualify for it. Yet no one is being held responsible for making sure  that that happens. My bill does that.   Under current law, the Federal Government pays tax credits to  individuals without first verifying that they qualify to receive them.  If individuals cannot verify their legal status, the IRS is then forced  to chase after the money.   This pay-and-chase model of distributing tax credits has greatly  increased costs to the taxpayers. A 2016 Senate report revealed that,  under ObamaCare, $750 million in taxpayer-funded healthcare subsidies  went to people who did not qualify for those benefits.   We could fix this problem and save time and money so that IRS agents  are helping people, instead of trying to recover improper payments by  verifying legal status first.   My bill simply requires the IRS to work with the relevant Federal  agencies to verify that an individual is a  [[Page H4878]]  citizen, national, or lawfully present in the United States before tax  credits go out the door. This can be done by verifying an applicant's  Social Security number or other immigration documents. Again, the  American people expect that we are already doing this.   Under my bill, everyone who applies for the advance premium tax  credit will be verified for legal status. Most people won't even know  that this is happening because the verification check is so quick.   My bill also includes protections that ensure that individuals who  are legally entitled to these tax credits are not penalized if there is  a delay in verifying their documents. I first raised this issue last  year with the previous administration. I am raising it again this year  because there is no evidence that anything has been done to address it.   Nobody wanted to take responsibility for mismanaging $750 million of  taxpayer money. Everyone pointed fingers at other people. My bill holds  people accountable.   While I received assurances from the current administration that it  would implement and follow a process to verify legal status, my bill  would require it in law. This issue is too important to be left to the  changing positions of unelected Federal bureaucrats. The American  people deserve to know that their representatives are doing everything  in their power to protect taxpayer money.   The Verify First Act provides that certainty and upholds the  integrity of the health insurance premium tax credit by putting an end  to fraud and abuse.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the cosponsors of my bill for their support.  They include Diane Black, Mo Brooks, Jeff Duncan, Jimmy Duncan, Mike  Kelly, Doug Lamborn, Mike McCaul, David McKinley, Kristi Noem, Jim  Renacci, Mike Rogers, Lamar Smith, Jason Smith, G.T. Thompson, and Joe  Wilson.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from  NumbersUSA and FAIR, two groups that have been working with me to  protect the interests of the American worker and legal immigrants.                                                     NumbersUSA,                                        Arlington, VA, May 23, 2017.      Hon. Lou Barletta,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Barletta: NumbersUSA, on behalf of our       more than 8 million activists, applauds you for introducing       the Verify First Act to ensure that health care tax credits       are not paid to illegal aliens or other disqualified aliens.       As you know, NumbersUSA opposed the ineffective verification       provisions in the Affordable Care Act because we knew they       would result in taxpayer-funded subsidies being sent to       illegal aliens. Our concerns, unfortunately, were confirmed       by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental       Affairs, which reported that more than $700 million in       Obamacare subsidies had been paid to ineligible aliens by       2015. Like you, we recognized that these same ineffective       verification procedures in the American Health Care Act       (AHCA) would result in the payment of health care tax credits       to illegal or otherwise ineligible aliens.        The Verify First Act will require the Social Security       Administration (SSA) and the Department of Homeland Security       (DHS) to actually verify the citizenship or immigration       status of every applicant for a credit under the AHCA before       the Treasury Department issues the credit. Both SSA and DHS       have established, proven methods of verifying status in a       timely and efficient manner, including the E-Verify system,       which relies on data from these two agencies to verify work       authorization, and the Systematic Alien Verification for       Entitlements (SAVE) system, which uses DHS data to establish       welfare eligibility.        Hard-working Americans and legal residents already are       struggling to pay for their own health care. There is simply       no excuse for the Federal government to force them to       subsidize health care for illegal aliens through taxpayer-      funded credits.        For this reason, NumbersUSA is delighted to support your       Verify First Act and we look forward to working with you to       make sure it is enacted into law. We also applaud House       Republican Leadership and the House Ways and Means Committee       for working with you to close this expensive loophole in our       health care system.            Sincerely,                                                      Anne Manetas,      Vice President, NumbersUSA.                                   ____                                             Federation for American                                              Immigration Reform,                                       Washington, DC, May 24, 2017.      Hon. Lou Barletta,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Barletta: On behalf of the Federation for       American Immigration Reform's (FAIR) nearly 1.5 million       members and supporters nationwide, I am writing to thank you       for introducing the Verify First Act. This important piece of       legislation would deny health care tax credits to illegal       aliens and ensure that Americans' hard-earned tax dollars       only go to those with a valid Social Security number (SSN).        As you know, federal law explicitly prevents illegal aliens       from receiving tax credits. Despite this, a recent report by       the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs       Committee found that nearly 500,000 illegal aliens received       approximately $750 million in taxpayer-funded health care       subsidies as of June 2015. Under Obamacare, the federal       government pays health care tax credits on a ``temporary       basis'' to individuals who are unable to verify their       citizenship. If an individual is ultimately unable to verify       their immigration status, the funding is suspended and the       Internal Revenue Service (IRS) attempts to recoup       overpayments from the individuals who were wrongly covered.       This challenging practice--known as ``pay and chase''--is       costing taxpayers millions.        As a complement to the recently passed American Health Care       Act, your legislation ensures that the IRS has verified that       an individual is a citizen, national, or lawfully present in       the United States before the advance health insurance premium       tax credit is disbursed. This will be done by checking an       applicant's SSN or other immigration documents. Additionally,       your legislation prohibits the use of the Individual Taxpayer       Identification Number (ITIN), which are issued without       verification of legal status.        For the aforementioned reasons, FAIR applauds you for       introducing the Verify First Act. When this important piece       of legislation is considered on the House floor, FAIR will       include the vote in our voting report.            Sincerely,                                                         Dan Stein,                                                         President.     Additionally, this legislation is supported by Citizens  Against Government Waste and Americans for Tax Reform.   Finally, I include in the Record a Statement of Administration Policy  noting that the President would sign this bill into law.                     Statement of Administration Policy      H.R. 2581--Verify First Act--Rep. Barletta, R-PA and 14 cosponsors         The Administration supports H.R. 2581, the Verify First       Act. Under Obamacare, millions of dollars in advance payments       of the premium tax credit may have been paid on behalf of       individuals who were likely ineligible beneficiaries,       including illegal immigrants. By eliminating the practice of       providing advance payments while an applicant's immigration       status is being verified, this bill stems the flow of       payments to ineligible individuals under Obamacare and       strengthens the ability of the Administration to ensure       premium tax credits will be appropriately provided to       eligible individuals under the American Health Care Act of       2017 (AHCA). By protecting the integrity of Federal funds,       this bill furthers the President's vision of a more efficient       Federal Government that respects taxpayer dollars.        H.R. 2581 would prohibit advance payments of premium tax       credits to individuals under current law and the AHCA, unless       the Secretary of the Treasury receives confirmation that the       individual is a citizen or a national of the United States,       or is lawfully present in the United States. H.R. 2581 would       also strengthen the AHCA, as passed by the House of       Representatives on May 4, 2017, which the Administration       continues to support strongly.        If H.R. 2581 were presented to the President in its current       form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into       law.     Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge passage of my bill.
