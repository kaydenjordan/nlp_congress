 Mr. Speaker, this Friday, more than  100,000 Americans will travel from across the country to take part in  the world's largest pro-life event right here in the Nation's Capital.   The theme for the 45th annual March for Life is ``Love Saves Lives.''  This embodies the true spirit and mission of the pro-life movement by  enlisting the power of love to empower others to choose life.   Since the Supreme Court issued a decision in Roe v. Wade, tens of  millions of abortion procedures have been performed throughout the  United States. Although consistent attempts to overturn this decision  have fallen short over the past 4 decades, support for Federal pro-life  policies has remained strong.   We will witness this strength Friday when Americans from all corners  of the country will march on Washington to highlight the progress of  the pro-life movement and encourage strong support moving forward.   President Trump will address the marchers from the Rose Garden and  show his commitment to protecting the unborn. He is the first sitting  U.S. President to address the event via satellite from the White House  in the event's 45-year history.   President Trump has remained steadfast in his commitment to advance  pro-life policy. One of his first actions in 2017 was an executive  order reinstating the Mexico City policy, which bars international  nongovernmental organizations that perform or promote abortions from  receiving funding from the U.S. Government. This action, first instated  by President Reagan in 1984, helps ensure that taxpayer dollars are not  used to fund abortions overseas.   Members of this House also passed H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for  Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017, just 1 day  after President Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy. This bill made  permanent some longstanding policies that prohibit the use of taxpayer  dollars to fund abortion, such as the Hyde amendment.   H.R. 7 also helps to ensure that health insurance companies remain  accountable to consumers by requiring them to fully disclose whether or  not their healthcare plans cover abortion services.   Another pro-life victory that passed the House in October was H.R.  36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This bill outlaws  abortions performed after the 20-week postfertilization period.   I have consistently voted to prohibit late-term abortions and to  protect the unborn, and I will continue to do so as long as I am  serving in the House. We must always demonstrate a strong commitment to  protecting the lives of the defenseless.   The House will continue the fight this week. On Friday, we will vote  on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This means that,  in the case of a child born alive during an attempted abortion, that  child must be immediately transported and admitted to a hospital. If a  baby born alive is left to die, the penalty can be up to 5 years in  jail. I will certainly vote in support of this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, abortion is a tragedy not just because an innocent child  died, but because of the lasting impact the abortion itself had on the  mothers of those children.   We continue to see efforts by the pro-life movement making an impact.  Data shows that the annual number of abortions performed in this  country is in decline, including my State of Pennsylvania. There are  legislative efforts across the country to protect unborn children and  provide assistance and hope to their mothers. These efforts are one of  the keys to ending abortion in the U.S.   Pro-life education is having an impact on our culture and in the  lives of women facing unexpected pregnancies, but there is much still  to be done. That is why I look forward to participating in the 45th  annual March for Life, where we will redouble our commitment to  protecting the sanctity of human life in all phases and conditions.  Attendees will hear stories of love, courage, and victory through God's  mercy and grace.   Mr. Speaker, human life is sacred and, through education, love can  protect the most vulnerable. The pro-life movement is a voice for the  voiceless, and I am incredibly proud and honored to be a part of it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, earlier today, I had the  honor of being in Pittsburgh with President Trump to hear him speak  about how tax reform is putting America back to work. We were at H&K  Equipment, a company that is investing in itself at a rate of 50  percent higher than last year thanks to tax reform.   H&K credits the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for providing them with the  ability to expense 100 percent of the investments they make in new  construction and demolition equipment. That is tax reform right at work  in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   Of course, this is in addition to State College's AccuWeather giving  year-end bonuses; Malvern's Meridian Bancorp increasing its minimum  wage to $15 per hour, with an additional 20 percent added to the 2017  bonuses; Allentown's American Bank giving employees $1,000 bonuses; and  Pittsburgh's PNC Financial Services giving $1,000 bonuses to 47,500 of  its nationwide employees, while increasing base wages, retirement  program contributions, and its charitable giving.   These are just a few stories. Tax reform is working, fair and simple.                            ____________________
