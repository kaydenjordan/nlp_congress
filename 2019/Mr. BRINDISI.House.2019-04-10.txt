 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for  his leadership on this important topic.   The free market is the cornerstone of America's economy, and this  bill would ensure that free-market competition is protected on the  internet.   However, for many Americans living in small towns, basic internet  access remains out of reach. Too many homes in rural areas are not  connected at all to high-speed broadband, and those that are online  suffer from slow speeds and constant interruptions in service.   Customers see their bills go up month after month, and service just  gets worse and worse.   Internet access is essential in today's economy, and we need to do  more to connect rural areas to high-speed broadband.   My amendment would direct the Government Accountability Office to  issue recommendations on how to expand broadband internet service in  rural and other underserved areas. This information will help guide our  work on how to best expand broadband access in rural communities.   I urge adoption of my amendment, and I, again, thank the gentleman  from Pennsylvania for his leadership on this bill and urge our  colleagues to pass the underlying legislation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania.    Mr. Chairman, I again urge adoption of the amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
