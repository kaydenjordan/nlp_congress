 Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that we say  good-bye to Dr. Amy Reed, a recognized physician, exemplary mother and  wife, and dedicated patient advocate.   Dr. Reed didn't ask for the situation she found herself in following  a procedure in 2013, but it was immediately evident to anyone that met  her--and her family--that she was going to be a fighter, not only for  herself but for others.  [[Page H4593]]    Through her loving husband's, Hooman's, campaign to bring awareness  to the dangers of power morcellators, there is no doubt that women's  lives around this country have been saved and device manufacturers and  regulators have been forced to review their safety protocols and  standards.   This is Amy's gift, and we are eternally grateful. My thoughts and  prayers are with her dedicated husband and partner, their six children,  and her entire family. Let our community embrace them in their time of  sorrow and vow to carry Amy's legacy and mission forward.                            ____________________
