 Mr. President, I supported Rod Rosenstein's  nomination to become Deputy Attorney General. Throughout his 27-year  career, Mr. Rosenstein has earned a reputation as a fair and focused  administrator of justice. He has served in Maryland in both Republican  and Democratic administrations and has earned the distinction of being  the longest serving U.S. attorney in the country.   I had the honor to introduce Mr. Rosenstein to the Senate Judiciary  Committee at his confirmation hearing. He has aggressively prosecuted  not only dangerous gangs and criminals in Maryland but also elected  officials who violated the people's trust. He has shown impartiality in  these investigations, and his successful prosecutions have led to  ethics reforms that increased transparency and public confidence in  Maryland.   When Mr. Rosenstein and I met recently, I asked him if he supported  the consent decree negotiated between the Obama administration and the  city of Baltimore. He assured me that, if the court formally entered  the consent decree, he would support its implementation. Attorney  General Sessions, however, has frequently expressed skepticism about  consent decrees. Baltimore is the only city to invite the Justice  Department to conduct a thorough, methodical analysis of its police  department in order to foster transparency and increase trust between  police officers and Baltimore city residents. As the former U.S.  attorney in Maryland, Mr. Rosenstein is well acquainted with the  challenges that the city faces. He has prosecuted corruption charges  against Baltimore city police officers and should recognize the  importance of reform and effective community policing. I trust Mr.  Rosenstein will keep his promise to support the consent decree.   In addition to being a top-notch lawyer, Mr. Rosenstein is known for  the professional manner in which he runs his current office. In his  letter of support, Maryland's Attorney General Brian Frosh notes that  Mr. Rosenstein ``inherited an office in turmoil'' when he became  Maryland's U.S. attorney, but with a ``steady hand and superb  management,'' created a department that is now universally respected.  Those skills will be put to the test immediately. Mr. Rosenstein will  assume the office of Deputy Attorney General at a tumultuous time for  the Justice Department. His job will be to serve justice, not political  leaders.   As Mr. Rosenstein and I discussed, the question for him is the same  that then-Senator Sessions posed to Sally Yates during her hearing to  become Deputy Attorney General. Senator Sessions said: ``You have to  watch out because people will be asking you to do things you just need  to say no about.'' Senator Sessions then asked: ``Do you think the  Attorney General has the responsibility to say no to the President if  he asks for something that's improper?'' Like Sally Yates, Mr.  Rosenstein said that he would be willing to put his job on the line to  uphold the integrity of the Department of Justice.   I believe that any investigation into the ties between the Trump  administration and Russian interference in our elections will require  the appointment of an independent special counsel, and I have also  joined my fellow Senators in calling for a nonpartisan commission.   I also made clear to Mr. Rosenstein that, if the FBI Director did, in  fact, request that the Justice Department deny President Trump's  unsubstantiated claims that the Obama administration wiretapped Trump  Tower, then the Justice Department has a duty to immediately let the  public know the truth.   It is vitally important that the American public have faith that our  laws apply equally to all Americans, regardless of rank or position.  Rod Rosenstein has applied that principle faithfully during his time as  U.S. attorney in Maryland. It is essential that he apply the same  principle at the Department of Justice.                            ____________________
