 Madam Speaker, this is really about people over politics  today, and I am glad that people all over the country are watching and  listening to this debate.   It is not about the wealthy, the well-connected, and the well-off. It  is about people who believe, like many of us, that we have gone too far  without lowering the cost of medicine for everyday people by reducing  and capping costs where they are--the $35 cap on insulin--and finding a  way to close the real gap that exists in terms of affordable care and  extension of the subsidies and making sure that we are really tackling  the climate crisis by providing the things that will allow consumers  and homeowners to do what they need to find a way to take advantage of  the tax subsidies.   Most of all, it says to everyone else that this is completely paid  for. This is not a tax bill. It is paid for. It is paid for by making  sure that the wealthiest and corporations that really get out of paying  taxes don't get out of paying taxes anymore.   It is not about the wealthy, the well-connected, and the well-off. It  is about people all over this country, in Baltimore and elsewhere, who  want and need this legislation.
