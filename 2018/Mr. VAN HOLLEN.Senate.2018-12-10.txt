 Mr. President, last week the Senate passed a second  continuing resolution for fiscal year 2019, providing short-term  funding for  [[Page S7383]]  many Federal Government agencies that have not yet received full year  funding.   Several outstanding issues need to be resolved in order to complete  the final seven appropriations bills, and I am hopeful that the hard  work of the Appropriations Committee will not be in vain by resorting  to a year-long continuing resolution for the remaining bills.   Congress must act in order to fully fund essential transportation and  housing programs, environmental protection efforts, the Appalachian  Regional Commission, NASA programs, the Census, FEMA relief programs,  and to prevent President Trump from freezing the pay of over 2 million  Federal civil servants, by enacting the 1.9 percent cost of living  increase for Federal workers that the Senate passed on a broad  bipartisan basis.   While I am glad this short-term continuing resolution will provide  for an extension to keep the flood insurance program from unnecessarily  lapsing, I want to see Congress enact a long-term reauthorization. This  year's flooding of Ellicott City shows that we need a long-term  solution. That is why I am an original cosponsor of the SAFE act, which  provides for a 5-year extension for the program, in addition to  important program enhancement as well as the Federal Flood Risk  Management Act that ensures that federally owned or funded buildings,  housing, and infrastructure, be made more weather-resistant and  resilient so that we can protect our communities and our investment of  Federal tax dollars.   As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I look forward to  working with my colleagues over the next 2 weeks to complete the  committee's fiscal year 2019 work.                            ____________________
