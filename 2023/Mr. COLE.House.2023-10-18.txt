 Mr. Speaker pro tempore, I rise for the purpose of placing  in nomination the name of the Honorable Jim Jordan for the position of  Speaker of the House at the direction of the Republican Conference.   Mr. Speaker pro tempore, 2 weeks and 1 day ago, I was on this House  floor and in this Chamber defending my very good friend and our former  Speaker, Mr. McCarthy, from an effort to vacate the Chair.   In the course of that speech, I made the remark that those who did  this, whether intentionally or unintentionally, were going to put the  Congress in a state of chaos and the country into a state of  uncertainty. I think the last 2 weeks have vindicated that observation.  We have a chance today to end that chaos and to end that uncertainty.   When these races happen, there are always a lot of hard things said  on both sides of the aisle. There is a lot of finger-pointing that goes  on. I don't intend to be involved in any of that today. I think the  decision in front of us is far, far too important for that.   I am very proud, very proud, to place in nomination the name of our  good friend, my good friend, our Republican candidate for Speaker, the  Honorable Jim Jordan of Ohio.   I have had the privilege of knowing   Jim Jordan for a long time. I  have been in Congress for a long time. For his entire period in the  House, I have had the honor of serving with my friend.   My friend is not exactly a shrinking violet. You don't win national  championships in college; you don't come to this floor with a sincere  set of beliefs and a desire to make a change and be shy about it. My  friend is not a shy person.   I have learned some things about him over the years. He is a person  of absolute personal integrity. I have never once had to question  something that he told me. He is an honorable man.   I also think we all know he is a pretty direct man, too. I don't  think anybody in here on any issue of any substance would have to guess  where   Jim Jordan is going to stand.   He doesn't deceive. He doesn't dissemble. He simply tells you  straight up that this is what I believe; this is why I think it is the  right thing to do for the country; and that is what I am going to try  and accomplish, and I am going to work with you in any way that I can  to do it.   The other thing I think we have found in the last couple of weeks is  what it takes to be a Speaker. The one thing I know--never having been  one and never having aspired to be one--is that it takes a spine of  steel to do this job.   My friend has that kind of determination, has that kind of character,  and has that kind of spine. I think the next Speaker is going to need  that quality, and I know my friend has it in great abundance.   If you are a Republican, it ought to be a pretty easy decision, my  friends. This is somebody who believes what we believe and has fought  for and shown that over and over again.   When I first got to know him, a lot of his focus was on spending.  That is exactly where the focus of this House ought to be.   Now, he has laid out a plan, not just a short-term plan, as to how we  deal with the appropriations process. I am an appropriator. I think I  know that that is not the root of the problem.   Unlike any other Speaker we have had, he has had the courage to talk  about a long-term plan and to get at the real drivers of debt, and we  all know what they are. We all know it is Social Security. We all know  it is Medicare. We all know it is Medicaid.   No President of either side has been willing to deal with this. No  Speaker of either side has been willing to deal with this.   My friend, our former colleague John Delaney, and I offered a plan. I  still file it every year--John is not here anymore--which is to go back  to 1983 and do what we did then and address Social Security. We can  never get any help.   This is a guy that wants to create a debt commission, a bipartisan  debt commission, and get at the roots of our spending problem. That  takes courage.                                time  1200    Republicans ought to support somebody with that kind of courage. He  is not only focused on one thing. I don't know anybody that has done  more to highlight and talk about the border disaster that is underway  right now as we speak.   I had the privilege of serving here when Jeh Johnson was Secretary of  Homeland Security. I have a very high opinion for Jeh Johnson. I think  he is one of the finest public servants that I ever met. He was asked  on one occasion to define what was a crisis on the southern border.   He said: Any time that you have more than 1,000 illegal entries a  day, you have a crisis.   We have 10 or 11 times that every single day. In that tide of  humanity that is coming across, there is a boatload of fentanyl coming  to kill tens of thousands of all of our constituents.   There are human traffickers who are taking advantage of young men and  young women and, frankly, predators in our own country, and they are  bringing them across, not by the 10s or 20s or the dozens, but by the  hundreds and the thousands.   There are, amongst that flow of people, people that wish us ill.  There are people who are not fleeing from oppression. There are people  who are terrorists or criminals that are coming into our country for no  good reason.   That is not an immigration problem. That is a border security  problem. They are not the same thing. We can debate immigration. That  is a worthy debate. We should never have to debate border security.  Nobody has highlighted that issue like my friend   Jim Jordan. Nobody  has done more as a committee chairman to move legislation that would  meaningfully deal with this problem.   This, my friends on both sides of the aisle, but with all due  respect, particularly this administration and my friends on the other  side, need to look at this. You need to look at this seriously. Don't  confuse it with immigration. You are not going to have immigration  reform until we have border security. It cannot be done. He has been  the number one champion of that. It is one of the number one issues  that we have.  [[Page H5027]]    Finally, I want to talk about something that can bring us together.  There are a lot of things we disagree on, legitimately so, but most of  us do not disagree about the security of the State of Israel. All of us  on both sides of the aisle reacted with horror and with deep sympathy  and with legitimate outrage at the crimes that were perpetrated against  the people of Israel in the last week. All of us know that they are  within their rights to respond forcefully and swiftly to defend their  people and punish those who brought that upon them.   In a moment of crisis--and we are in a moment of crisis--we should  come together and act. We know we can't do that without a Speaker of  the House. Now, it is a narrow majority, but my friends and I are in  the majority. We need to produce a Speaker.   We have a candidate who we know where he will stand on issues that  are important. We know where he is going to stand on spending because  it is where he has always stood. It is not like he changed over the  course of his career.   We know what he is going to do on the border. We read H.R. 2. We have  seen what his committee produced. It is not just money; it is policy  and change that will provide security for the American people.   Finally, and I say this on a bipartisan basis, I know he will stand  up for Israel, and I know in that area we can come together. That  crisis is on us now. We may get a request at almost any time to act. We  need to be able to act. My friend will act on that crisis. He has shown  it his whole career.   It is with a great deal of pride that I have the privilege of  nominating my friend, our chairman of the Judiciary Committee, but a  person whose principles you know, whose actions you can trust, and who  in a time of crisis will respond with the leadership we need,   Jim  Jordan.
