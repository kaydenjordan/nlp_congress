 Mr. President, I rise today for just a moment to discuss  the Keep Kids Fed Act, which will help schools and summer providers  operate as they return to normal, while facing supply chain problems  and fighting food costs.   This bill is a result of a bicameral, bipartisan agreement that  assists schools and students as they resume regular operations of the  meal programs.   The waivers to provide higher reimbursement rates and universal free  meals under these programs during COVID are no longer necessary.   However, schools still face unusual times with a 35 to 40 percent  increase in food prices due to inflation and supply chain difficulties.  This bill provides targeted and temporary relief for the 2022-2023  school year to help schools with higher food costs and is fully offset.   We all want to ensure that children in this country receive healthful  and affordable meals to help them focus on their education.   This bill will help schools provide those meals as they return to  normal, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill. And, again, thank  you so much, Senator Stabenow, to you and your staff, and to my staff  and everyone that has worked so hard to come to an agreement.
