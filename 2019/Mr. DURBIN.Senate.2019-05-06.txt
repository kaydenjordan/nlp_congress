 I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand), the Senator from  California (Ms. Harris), and the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar)  are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, in 1958, recently married Genie Zavaleta  went on assignment with the Migrant Ministry with her husband Hector.  They traveled the country to support Mexican migrant workers. Genie was  a child of the Great Depression, and she knew when people needed help.  What was supposed to be a 1-year stint became a lifetime of helping  people in need.   Last month, Genie passed away at the age of 92. She was known as the  grandmother of the Dreamers. She was a longtime champion and mentor to  undocumented youth in Arizona and a fierce advocate for the Dream Act.  Genie also was my ally in defending the Dreamers.   In 1965, Genie and Hector moved to Arizona permanently with their two  sons, Dan and David. Arizona was a transforming State, and the influx  of migrant workers attracted Genie. She became the first director of  education at Planned Parenthood of Phoenix, teaching classes on poverty  and across the county. She taught classes at Phoenix College and  Arizona State University too. She worked with the  [[Page S2632]]  Maricopa County Health Department for 15 years until her retirement in  1989.   Genie's retirement was not close to the end of her story. She moved  into full-time advocacy for immigrants. For more than a decade, my  staff and I worked with her on behalf of Dreamers. She saved countless  Dreamers from being deported. Genie had my office on speed dial. She  frequently alerted us to Dreamers at the risk of deportation. She  shared stories of Dreamers that I told on the Senate floor.   In 2011, I organized the Dream Sabbath, a gathering of faith  communities around the country to put a human face on the plight of  undocumented students. An event about the Dream Act would never be  complete without Genie's participation, so of course, she helped  organize Arizona's Dream Sabbath.   Genie did not seek fanfare. She quietly became one of Arizona's most  influential immigration activists. She did not want fame. It was about  the Dreamers.   On the lawn of her home in Arizona, there once were signs covering  the whole area for the causes she supported. Today, the house is quiet,  and the lawn is empty except one sign, a stars-and-stripes one with  ``In our America, all people are equal'' at the top. We will keep  fighting on Genie's behalf until the Dream Act is the law of the land.   Genie Zavaleta is survived by her husband Hector, her sons Dan and  David, and their wives Nori and Linda. On behalf of the hundreds of  people she helped, Loretta and I send our sincere condolences.
