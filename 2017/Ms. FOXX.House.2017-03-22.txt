 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 210, I call up  the bill (H.R. 1101) to amend title I of the Employee Retirement Income  Security Act of 1974 to improve access and choice for entrepreneurs  with small businesses with respect to medical care for their employees,  and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1101.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 1101, the Small Business Health  Fairness Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, this week marks 7 years since ObamaCare was signed into  law. We all remember the promises former President Obama and Washington  Democrats made at the time.   Families were promised that their healthcare costs would go down.  They were promised more choices and more competition. Small businesses  and their employees were promised greater access to affordable health  care.   But for 7 years, we have watched as all of those promises were  broken. For 7 years, we have heard from families and small businesses  across the country that have seen their healthcare costs skyrocket and  their choices diminish.   Members of the House Education and the Workforce Committee recently  heard from Scott Bollenbacher, an Indiana small-business owner with 11  full-time employees. The company has been forced to switch healthcare  plans twice now under ObamaCare, and their only viable option this year  was a plan with a 78 percent premium increase.   Mr. Bollenbacher is one of countless small-business owners struggling  to make ends meet under a failed government takeover of health care.  Because of ObamaCare, 300,000 small-business jobs have been destroyed,  including nearly 8,000 in my home State of North Carolina.                                time  1400    Additionally, an estimated 10,000 small businesses nationwide have  closed their doors, and small business employees have lost $19 billion  each year in wages.   It should come as no surprise that, since 2008, the share of small  businesses with fewer than 10 employees offering health coverage has  dropped 36 percent. It is not that they don't want to; it is that  onerous mandates and regulations have made it simply unaffordable to do  so.   Fortunately, relief is on the way. This week we are not only moving  to repeal ObamaCare, we are also advancing positive reforms that  promote affordable coverage for working families, including the Small  Business Health Fairness Act.   As its title implies, this important legislation is about fairness  for small businesses and their employees. Today, small businesses are  on an unfair playing field with larger companies and unions when it  comes to health care. Large businesses have the ability to negotiate  for more affordable healthcare costs for their employees, but small  businesses do not have the same advantage. Because of their size, small  businesses have limited bargaining power, which means their employees  can end up paying more for health insurance.   With millions of Americans employed by a small business, it is long  past time to level the playing field. That is exactly what this  commonsense legislation is about. This bill would empower small  businesses to band together through association health plans, or AHPs,  to purchase high-quality health care at a lower cost for workers.   This bill represents a first step toward a more competitive health  insurance market that crosses State lines. Under H.R. 1101, small  businesses in different States could join together through a group  health plan. These plans would have strong protections and solvency  requirements to ensure workers can count on healthcare coverage when  they and their families need it.   What does all of this mean: more choices, more freedom, and more  affordable health care for working families and small-business owners  like Scott Bollenbacher. This is a better way, one that stands in stark  contrast to ObamaCare's failed approach. Instead of more mandates, this  bill empowers individuals to access the high-quality, affordable  healthcare plan that meets their needs.   I want to thank my colleague Representative Sam Johnson for  championing, for years, the positive reforms in this bill.   I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1101 so we can level the  playing field for small businesses and expand affordable health  coverage for working families.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Sam Johnson), the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health,  Employment, Labor, and Pensions.  [[Page H2322]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe), a distinguished colleague, a member of the  committee, and the chair of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), the distinguished chairman of the Small  Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen), a member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Lewis), a member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  have spent a lot of their time extolling ObamaCare and indicating that  we should just stay with what we have, but we all know that ObamaCare  is failing.   Republicans are on a rescue mission. We truly do have a better way.  As some of my colleagues have stated, we will be passing the American  Health Care Act tomorrow. What we are doing here with this bill is  something we could not include in that legislation that will round out  what it is we want to do with keeping our promise in what we promised  last year in our program called A Better Way.   Let me just talk a little bit about the failures of ObamaCare. As my  colleagues have said, all the promises were broken: if you wanted to  keep your doctor, you could keep your doctor; if you wanted to keep  your healthcare plan, you could keep your healthcare plan. Those  promises were the most obvious ones that went away. The cost of health  care would be going down, and none of that happened.   Mr. Speaker, in addition to that, there is a 25 percent average  increase in premiums this year for millions of Americans trapped in  ObamaCare, healthcare.gov exchanges. Nearly one-third of U.S. counties  have only one insurer offering exchange plans; 4.7 million Americans  were kicked off their healthcare plans by ObamaCare. There was $1  trillion in new taxes, mostly falling on families and job creators; 18  failed ObamaCare co-ops out of 23, which my colleague from Tennessee so  eloquently pointed out.   These were established as an alternative to the public option. Those  healthcare co-ops collapsed, costing  [[Page H2327]]  taxpayers nearly 1.9 billion and forcing patients to find new  insurance; $53 billion in new regulations requiring more than  176,800,000 hours of paperwork. ObamaCare regulations are driving up  healthcare premiums and costing small-business employees at least $19  billion annually.   As I said in the hearing that we had on this bill, the Democrats want  a coercive system. Republicans want a system based on freedom.   Today we have an opportunity to make a real difference in the lives  of hardworking men and women who are employed by small business. We  have an opportunity to deliver much-needed relief to small-business  owners who are trying to do the right thing and provide high-quality  healthcare coverage for their employees. This legislation represents a  truly positive reform that will help lower healthcare costs for working  families and put small businesses on a fair and level playing field.   Small businesses are the backbone of our Nation's economy, and there  is no reason why they should be at a disadvantage when it comes to  finding an affordable healthcare plan. They should be treated in the  same fashion as larger businesses and have the ability to craft  healthcare plans that meet the needs of their employees. If we want to  encourage small businesses to offer health care at a lower cost to  workers, this is one commonsense step we can make.   Again, I thank our colleague, Congressman Sam Johnson, a true patriot  and servant of this country, for his longtime support of this  legislation.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1101, the Small Business  Health Fairness Act, which will help more Americans access high- quality, affordable health care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, this motion is nothing more than a last-ditch  attempt to defeat a commonsense bill that will help expand access to  affordable healthcare coverage for working families. In fact, this  motion represents the same failed approach to health care we have  experienced in recent years.   We have seen what happens when the Federal Government dictates the  kind of health insurance individuals can and cannot buy. Healthcare  costs skyrocket and patients have fewer choices.   While our Democrat colleagues offer a motion that doubles down on a  failed approach to health care, my Republican colleagues and I are  offering the American people a better way.   The Small Business Health Fairness Act is about empowering  individuals, families, and small-business owners so more Americans have  access to affordable healthcare coverage. By rejecting this motion and  supporting the underlying bill, we can take an important step in  keeping our promise to deliver free-market, patient-centered healthcare  solutions.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit and  ``yes'' on the Small Business Health Fairness Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
