 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Patrick Leon Bennett, who passed away on July 28, 2023, at the age of  55.   Patrick was born in Waycross, Georgia, and lived most of his life in  Pierce County. He was known for being an endearing and funny person by  many and a celebrated member of the Future Farmers of America.   He was passionate for hunting, fishing, and coaching recreational  football. Patrick was able to lead his teams to three State  championships, two of which he won.   Furthermore, Patrick was active in his teenage years in the FFA  organization, including serving as chapter officer, a member of the  1985 State Winner Dairy Judging Team, 1986 State Livestock Judging  Team, and recipient of the Green Hand Degree, Chapter Farmer Degree,  and Georgia Planter Degree.   He will be remembered by his family and friends and his community,  which he served well.                            ____________________
