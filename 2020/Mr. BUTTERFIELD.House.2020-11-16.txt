 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for  yielding time this afternoon.   I rise, Mr. Speaker, in strong support of H.R. 1964, the Lumbee  Recognition Act, and I urge my colleagues to vote for its passage.   Mr. Speaker, let me just take a moment to thank the chairman of the  committee--he is not here today--Mr. Grijalva. I thank him so very much  for his friendship and for his leadership on this issue. I thank Mr.  Huffman for managing the floor today and recognizing me for just a few  moments. And to the ranking member, Mr. Bishop from Utah, I thank him  so very much. He is the ranking member of the committee, and I thank  him for his leadership as well.   Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to thank Mr. Hudson--I don't see Mr.  Hudson on the floor, but I know he is very close by--and my friend, Mr.  Bishop from North Carolina. I thank both of them for their unwavering  support for this legislation.   I might say that Robeson County--someone mentioned ``Robeson County''  a few moments ago; it is actually ``Robeson County''--is a part of Mr.  Bishop's Ninth Congressional District.   This bill, Mr. Speaker, will finally extend full Federal recognition  to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, making its members eligible for  the same services and benefits provided to members of other federally  recognized Tribes. Most importantly, the bill will establish once and  for all the Lumbee Tribe as an independent and sovereign entity under  Federal law.   North Carolina, as Mr. Bishop, I believe, or Mr. Huffman mentioned a  moment ago, has recognized the Lumbee Tribe since 1885. This body even  recognized the Lumbees in the 1950s, but during the dark days of the  termination era, they refused to allow the Lumbee Tribe access to  federally funded services and benefits.   Almost all the Tribes that were terminated in this troubling era have  since been restored to Federal recognition. We are long overdue in  delivering the same justice to the Lumbee Tribe.   This legislation, Mr. Speaker, has tremendous bipartisan support, as  you can see today, tremendous bipartisan support that has only  accelerated over the past few months.   At the end of September, under Chairman Grijalva's leadership, the  Natural Resources Committee passed this bill by a voice vote. It was  noncontroversial. Shortly thereafter, Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer  announced his support for full Federal recognition for the Lumbee  Nation and his intention to bring the bill to the floor.   Mr. Hoyer told me, and he told Chairman Godwin in a telephone call a  few weeks ago, that he would bring this bill, H.R. 1964, to the floor  on November 16. Today is November 16.                                time  1615    During the Presidential campaign, Joe Biden gave his unconditional  support to this legislation, and President Trump, as Mr. Bishop said,  did so as well.   Now is the time for the House to get this done. When this legislation  passes, it is my fervent hope that our Senate colleagues from both  parties will support passage and send it to the President's desk for  his immediate signature.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me remind the House that this  legislation has been before this body many times over the years since I  have been in Congress. I recall Democratic Congressman Mike McIntyre  repeatedly introducing this legislation. In the 110th and the 111th  Congress, the House passed this legislation, but it never ever saw the  light in the other body.   It appears that the legislation now has the support of Senators Burr  and Tillis. I am not suggesting that they didn't support it previously.  It was another time and another Congress, but it appears that the  legislation has the support of Senator Burr and Senator Tillis and it  should be favorably considered in the Senate.   Therefore, I respectfully ask my colleagues to extend a hand of  friendship to the 66,000 members of the Lumbee Nation and grant them  their long overdue full Federal recognition.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on H.R. 1964.
