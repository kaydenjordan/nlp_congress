 Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the passage of H.R. 3979 extends the authorization of  volunteer and educational programs on the National Wildlife Refuge  System administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service.   This bill highlights the importance of community partnerships and  volunteers and the value they bring to our public lands. In 2016,  refuge volunteers donated 1.3 million hours, which equals $30.6 million  of labor value.   Volunteers are critical for the daily operation of the National  Wildlife Refuge System and other Federal lands. I know, in many cases,  visitors would not have access to these unique places without the  participation of volunteers and other partners.   I serve as ranking member of the Federal Lands Subcommittee, where we  held a hearing on this bill in November and heard testimony from the  National Wildlife Refuge Association about the importance of sustaining  the volunteer program. I am pleased we can work in a bipartisan fashion  to move this important message through the House.   I commend the sponsor, Representative Jeffries of New York, for his  hard work and dedication to this issue. This is a good bill, and I urge  my colleagues to support its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
