 Mr. Speaker, as my colleague said, if we defeat the  previous question, Republicans will amend the rule to include the  consideration of the repeal of the medical device tax.   The medical device tax hurts jobs and innovation, preventing the  development of cutting-edge, lifesaving technologies. That also  increases the cost of patient care for all of our constituents,  Republican and Democrat. There is not a corner on the market for  patient success and lifelong cures more than the medical device tax  elimination.   Hoosiers in my State are proud to be leaders in medical innovation,  with more than 300 medical device manufacturers in my State alone  supporting nearly 55,000 good-paying jobs. However, after this tax took  effect, the industry lost nearly 30,000 of those jobs nationwide from  2012 to 2015, according to the Commerce Department data.   Congress has temporarily suspended this job-killing tax since 2016,  and this expires in January. Here we are at a crux that we have never  faced before. We are 3 months away. Congress needs to act today, now,  not for me, for all of us on this floor.   These folks who live and die by medical devices do not declare  themselves as being Republicans, Democrats, or independents. They are  Americans in need of our help, and they need it now.   Medical devices have literally changed the way we think about  healthcare. In all of our districts, patients undergo less invasive  procedures, which leads to shorter hospital stays. New technologies  diagnose illnesses earlier, lowering the impact of care on a person's  daily life. Yet, all these notable gains will be wiped out if the  medical device tax elimination repeal is not carried through here  today. It will divert millions of dollars that could have been spent on  critical investments in research and development of cures and  therapies.                                time  1315    There is huge bipartisan support for this bill. Unlike very few other  bills in this place, it is bipartisan because we have all recognized at  one time or another that our constituents need our help and we are  doing something to help them.   By defeating the previous question, we can do that. We can unleash  the potential of the medical device technology that could be developing  better treatments, managing chronic care, and improving the quality of  life for people in all of our districts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against the previous  question.
