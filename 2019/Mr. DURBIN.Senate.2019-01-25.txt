 Mr. President, the announcement this morning that air  operations in major cities in this country on the east coast and other  places could be delayed or are interrupted comes as no surprise.   This last week, I met with air traffic controllers in St. Louis and  in Aurora, IL. We have over 600 air traffic controllers in Northern  Illinois because of O'Hare, Midway, and so many other important  airports in that region, and, of course, in St. Louis, with Lambert  airfield and others. They have quite extensive air operations.   They explained to me what is going on with air traffic controllers.  It shouldn't have worried us before the shutdown. It should frighten us  at this moment.   Currently, air traffic controllers work 10-hour shifts. It is a  stressful job--an important, stressful job. There is hardly any person  more on the frontline of public safety than an air traffic controller.  They are expected to concentrate--to concentrate exclusively--for 10  straight hours on each shift. Because of a shortage of air traffic  controllers, they now are working 6 days a week.   If you can only imagine for a moment what it is like, and, if you  have been to an air traffic control tower, you know what it is like--at  least from an outside observer's point of view. There they are, with a  screen full of dots. In each one of them is an airplane, and in each  airplane tens, maybe even hundreds of lives, and they are trying to  make certain that nothing terrible occurs.   Imagine the added burden they face now on the 35th day of this  government shutdown. As of today, they will have missed two pay  periods. The last paycheck came last year. I listened to these air  traffic controllers explain what it meant to them. For some of them, it  has gotten down to the basics. In the St. Louis area, one of the air  traffic controllers has to drive a long distance each day. They didn't  have the cash for gasoline. He sold his plasma in order to fill the  tank to go to work.   At another air traffic control meeting in Aurora, one of the  controllers came to me and said that one of his colleagues, who had  been working for some time, came to him and said that he only had 5  days left that he could continue doing this--working for nothing--and  then he would have to go look for other jobs and possibly jeopardize  his future in air traffic control.   The stories came to me one after another. There was a young family  where a little child of the family is suffering from medical illnesses  of a serious nature. Luckily, they still have health insurance when  they are not being paid. When it comes to the out-of-pocket expenses  and copayments, they don't have money for it.   Those are the realities these men and women face. They are the  realities that have to be on their minds every waking moment. We pray,  as passengers in these aircraft, that the only thing on their mind is  their job. Instead, for many of these people, it is just basically  getting by, keeping their family together.   A lady came up to me at the airport at O'Hare and told me that she  and a lot of friends run a food pantry in Oak Park, which is west of  the city of Chicago, and she said to me: We have problems. The Federal  employees who are coming around now are in desperate need of help, and  we are running out of supplies at our food pantries.   Has it come to that in America, where we have to rely on food  pantries and charity for men and women who are performing such a vital  function as air traffic control? That is the reality of the situation.  [[Page S668]]    Yesterday we had two votes on the floor of the Senate. I know that  every Federal employee and their families were tuned in, in the hopes  that this shutdown would end yesterday, that we would muster the  courage and political will to come together on a bipartisan basis. We  didn't. We fell short of the 60 votes needed on both of the measures  that were called.   There is a ray of hope but only a small one. The conversations at the  highest level continued last night and even into today. My only hope is  that the President will decide that this shutdown has to come to an  end.   He alone stood in the beginning and said he was proud to claim that  he was the author of this shutdown. I don't see how anyone can be proud  of what has happened in this country. It is time to put it behind us.  It is time to move forward with serious negotiations about border  security and other issues but not at the expense of 800,000 Federal  employees.                                  Venezuela    Mr. President, last year, my staff prevailed on me to make a trip  which I really wasn't sure I should do. It was to Caracas, Venezuela. I  had never been to that country, and I was visiting there at the  invitation of their government. Nicolas Maduro was the President of  Venezuela, and he did not enjoy the very best of reputations, but yet  he was willing to see me.   So for several days I went down to Venezuela, met with President  Maduro, met with the opposition, met with the American who was being  held prisoner by the Maduro regime, and in matter of a few days, got an  impression of what was happening in Venezuela.   It is hard to imagine that 30 years ago, Venezuela was one of the  most up-and-coming countries in South America. It was considered one of  most prosperous. Their oil industry was generating money in amounts  they had never imagined before. The lifestyles of people were  improving. There were a lot of things to be said on the positive side  of the ledger, but over the span of the next 20 or 30 years, things  became tremendously worse.   Last year, as I had this opportunity to travel in Venezuela and meet  with then-President Maduro, I met also with members of the elected  National Assembly, civic and humanitarian groups, medical  professionals, and the exceptional men and women who were working at  the U.S. Embassy.   What I found was that this once-proud and relatively wealthy  democracy, last year was on the verge of political, economic, and  humanitarian collapse.   The stories I learned in that short period of time were  heartbreaking--of children fainting at school because they were hungry,  the return of diseases that had once been eradicated, a massive outflow  of millions of refugees from Venezuela to neighboring countries, some  rates of infectious disease being rivaled only by war zones in this  world. So many children were going so hungry while the government  cronies were siphoning off millions of dollars from the state food aid  program. It was infuriating and disgusting.   I walked down the streets of Caracas and saw firsthand Venezuelans  emaciated, waiting in long lines at ATM machines, and I asked: Why is  it every hour of the night and day there is a long line at the ATM  machine? Inflation was so bad in that country that people had to wait  patiently in line to max out each day's withdrawal from their accounts  so they would have enough money for a roundtrip bus ride the next day.   I walked through one of the private hospitals, and I heard of  unimaginable shortages of key medicines, shortages even worse in the  state hospitals, where simple blood tests were no longer possible.   In fact, just this week, a collaborative and brave Venezuelan media  effort entitled ``Petrofraude'' released a devastating investigation.  It details how the Venezuelan Government decimated the nation's oil  supply to enrich the cronies of President Maduro and attempt to buy  diplomatic support, all while its people were dying of malnutrition,  and inflation was soaring beyond 1 million percent.   When I met President Maduro last year, I told him--this was in  April--that if he proceeded with the planned, rigged election, he would  find himself even more isolated in the world, and he would bring even  greater suffering on his people. He ignored me, and of course, sadly,  that is what happened.   In May, he went forward with a bogus election whose illegitimate  results were not recognized by many countries in the region.   Maduro also then kicked out America's top diplomats at the time--two  of our finest whom I have had the pleasure of meeting and working with  on the trip.   Yet, during my visit, I was also inspired and found some hope. There  were brave civic leaders who were looking for public service for the  right reason--healthcare workers, doing the best they could with almost  nothing, and the next generation of young elected members of the  National Assembly, the only legitimate democratic body left in the  nation of Venezuela.   These young leaders had notably won election in areas that once  supported Hugo Chavez, supposedly the patriarch of the country and the  godfather of Maduro, but they had prevailed in districts that had gone  for Chavez in previous elections because the people in those areas had  grown disillusioned with the years of corruption, repression, and  movement toward dictatorship by Mr. Maduro.   Among this group of patriotic elected officials were some  extraordinary leaders with whom I managed to have dinner one evening.   We went to a somewhat secret location on the second floor of a  neighborhood restaurant. There were five of them. They were on the  opposition side from President Maduro. They were careful not to meet or  be seen too much in public, and I sat and talked to them about why they  were in politics. They weren't even being paid. Maduro had decided to  stop paying them after they were elected, and yet they continued to try  to serve.   At one point, one of them said to me: Senator, if you come back next  year, I can tell you that of the five of us, two will likely be in  prison, two will be exiled, and one may have disappeared. That is what  happens when you oppose the Maduro regime.   I thought to myself, there is a heavy price to pay for politics in  our country, but it doesn't get close to what these young people were  facing.   Seated at that table that night was a young 35-year-old man. His name  was Juan Guaido--the same Juan Guaido who was recently chosen as  President of the Venezuela National Assembly.   This last Wednesday, he did a courageous and dangerous thing. He  announced that under the Constitution, he believed he had the power to  take control and to call for a free and credible election, and he  announced that he would be the interim President of Venezuela under  that Constitution.   It was a dramatic move. Guaido now finds himself as the interim  Venezuelan leader--35 years old.   What has happened since he made that announcement? The United States  has recognized him, as has Canada, and virtually every other country in  South and Central America, save three, and I will spell them out:  Bolivia, Cuba, and Nicaragua which refuse to recognize him.   The Secretary General of the Organization of American States has also  recognized him.   Under article 233 of the Venezuelan Constitution, if the Presidency  of the country is deemed unfilled by a vote of the National Assembly,  then the National Assembly President ``shall take charge of the  Presidency'' and lead a timely transition back to a legitimate  government.   This is what has happened on the streets of Caracas because of his  courage: The National Assembly passed a measure finding that the Office  of the Presidency was vacant due to a clearly stolen election.   So Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador,  Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the United Kingdom have  all recognized Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader, in addition to  the United States and Canada, I might add.   Earlier this week, I also joined in support of his effort, calling on  him to fulfill his constitutional role to help Venezuela return to the  community of democracies and to do so with a thoughtful and timely  transition to a credible election in which the Venezuelan people can  once again choose their leaders through a fair, transparent process.  [[Page S669]]    Yesterday I had the privilege to speak at length with President  Guaido and offer my support for his transition. Just as when I met with  him last year in Caracas, he was deeply thoughtful and expressed his  love of his country that he serves. That couldn't have been more clear  in our conversation.   He knows how much the Venezuelan people have suffered, how the Maduro  regime bankrupted the nation and destroyed its democracy and economy,  and how desperate the people of this country are to rejoin the  community of democracies.   I told him we in the United States stand ready to help, and the  Venezuelan people need our help to rebuild their country's democracy  and economy and to help return the millions of Venezuelan refugees  safely.   Yesterday the administration pledged $20 million of humanitarian  support to the opposition, to those who are in the streets trying to  reclaim democracy in that country.   I support that $20 million and hope other countries will join us. It  is just the beginning of the help they will need.   This once-proud country can return to the community of democracies.  It can start to restore the faith of the people in their government. It  can start to answer the basics.   To think of what they are going through, to think that children are  fainting in school because of malnutrition and that basic antibiotics  are not even available in the hospitals, these are unthinkable  developments in any modern country in our hemisphere. I hope this  effort, as dangerous as it may be for the new interim President, leads  to a credible free election and the restoration of democracy in  Venezuela.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
