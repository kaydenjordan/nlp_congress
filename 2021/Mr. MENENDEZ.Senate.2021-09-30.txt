 Mr. President, it was my intention to come to the floor  to ask unanimous consent for a $1 billion replenishment for Iron Dome.  We Democrats believe that this is incredibly important for the safety  and security of the State of Israel, our ally.   Unfortunately, Senator Paul, who has an amendment to my unanimous  consent request, could not be here tonight, and, as a courtesy to him,  we are postponing until Monday, but on Monday I intend to come to the  floor and ask for that unanimous consent.   I yield the floor.
