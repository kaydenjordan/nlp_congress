 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are wrapping up the year in the Senate,  and I am looking forward to getting home to South Dakota for Christmas.  Before we leave, we will wrap up this year's spending bills, including  the Defense funding bill.   Yesterday we passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which is  yearly legislation to authorize funding for our military and our  national defense. I am pleased to report that this year's bill  authorizes the full annual funding request for development of the B-21  bomber, which will be coming to Ellsworth in the not-too-distant  future.   The news that Ellsworth Air Force Base had been selected as the first  home of the future B-21 Raider was exciting news this year. Ellsworth  Air Force Base has been a priority of mine since I first came to the  Senate and worked with a lot of dedicated people to prevent Ellsworth  from being closed by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission in  2005.   Since then, I have worked with the other Members of the South Dakota  delegation and the Air Force and community leaders to make sure the  base never again finds itself in the same position. Among other things,  our efforts resulted in the expansion of the Powder River Training  Complex into the largest training airspace in the continental United  States.   It is undoubtedly partly thanks to this airspace that Ellsworth was  chosen as the first home for the B-21. Ellsworth is going from strength  to strength. I am honored to advocate for our national security and the  airmen at Ellsworth in the U.S. Senate.    The following Senators are ncessarily absent: the Senator  from North Carolina (Mr. Burr), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding provisions of rule XXII, at 4 p.m. today, the Senate  vote on the motions to invoke cloture filed on Monday's session of the  Senate in the order filed. I further ask that if cloture is invoked,  the Senate vote on confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 465 and the  nominations at a time to be determined by the majority leader in  consultation with the Democratic leader; that if confirmed, the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  [[Page S7142]]  from Georgia (Mr. Isakson) and the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul).
