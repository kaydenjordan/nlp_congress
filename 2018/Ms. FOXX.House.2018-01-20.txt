 Mr. Speaker, all the news today is about the Schumer  shutdown. The House has done its work. The economy is booming. We  passed a massive tax cut before the end of the year, which is bringing  raises and prosperity to all segments of our economy. What is the  problem?   The problem is the Democrats in the United States Senate. The  Democrats in the Senate are holding government funding hostage. The  people protecting this country will continue to work but won't get a  paycheck; this includes firefighters, Border Patrol, and  servicemembers.   We have a short-term funding bill ready for the President to sign,  but Democrats are standing in the way. Democrats are endangering our  national security, our veterans, and our children. The insurance of 9  million children is at risk because CHIP would not be reauthorized.   Mr. Speaker, it appears as though the Democrats want to take away  attention from the wonderful economy we have. We need to pass this bill  and move on.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 31 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Sunday, January 21, 2018, at 2 p.m.                            ____________________
