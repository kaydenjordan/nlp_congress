 Mr. Speaker, I arrived yesterday, as all 435 Members did,  to hopefully do the work of the people in the United States Congress.  What did I find? No legislation to vote on this week. We are basically  not doing anything other than listening to secret testimony about  impeaching this President who was duly elected in 2016.   Here are some questions for the American people:   Why are we not voting on lowering prescription drug prices?   Why are we not voting on USMCA, which will help every manufacturer  and every business in this country?   Why are we not voting on securing our border?   Why are we not having a budget?   Why are we not reducing regulations to help this great economy?   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve better than this. I will  sign the censure to hold Adam Schiff accountable, which should be done.  I urge my other colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________
