 Mr. Speaker, when I entered the House of Representatives,  I was 1 of just 24 women serving in Congress. Today, there are 154  women in Congress, out of 540 Members of the House and Senate. What  progress our country has made in recognizing and embracing the equal  role of women in all aspects of our society.   This Women's History Month, we have the opportunity to celebrate the  success and sacrifices of those who have committed themselves to  uplifting women, families, and our society.   Meanwhile, let's also rededicate ourselves to continuing to fight for  the advancement and security of our mothers, wives, sisters,  grandmothers, godmothers, and daughters.   It is more imperative than ever for us to carry forward the legacy of  those who came before us and to do our part to pave the way for future  generations. Let us embrace a world where there is no limit to what  women can be and what we can achieve together.                            ____________________
