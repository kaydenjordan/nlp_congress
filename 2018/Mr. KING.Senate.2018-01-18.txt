 Mr. President, I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.    Mr. President, I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.    I don't understand why we are adjourning when we are in  this urgent situation. We could vote tonight on cloture and have an  entire day tomorrow to work on this matter. This is irresponsible, and  I just don't understand it, so I object to the motion.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I renew my unanimous consent request  that I propounded earlier.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
