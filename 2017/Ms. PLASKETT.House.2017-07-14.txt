 Mr. Chair, I want to thank the chairman and ranking  member for agreeing to include my amendment en bloc in the NDAA.   The amendment that we have is a transitioning of the Virgin Islands  Active Guard and Reserve from overseas housing allowance to basic  allowance for housing.   We know that, in 2013, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness reported that a change would be feasible  and would not be difficult to allow Virgin Islands Active Guard and  Reserve members to be part of the basic housing allowance.   Congress didn't intend inequitable and unfair treatment to the Virgin  Islands Active Guard and Reserve members, and this amendment provides  an equitable solution to the disparate treatment of the housing  allowance for Virgin Islands Active Guard and Reserve members.   We are grateful for the support and are thankful that our  servicemembers will now, in their housing, be treated the same as those  in the 50 States and the District of Columbia.
