 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor East Orange City  Councilwoman Quilla Talmadge. Councilwoman Talmadge has served the  citizens of East Orange with distinction for 30 years.   Her political career started as president of her third ward  neighborhood. It continued with her active leadership as a member of  her local Parent Teacher Association, local NAACP, and the National  Council of Negro Women, among many others.   She has won numerous awards for her community and church involvement.   Recently, the New Jersey State League of Municipalities inducted her  into the Elected Officials Hall of Fame.   Councilwoman Talmadge is retiring from the city council this year,  but she has left a legacy that will be remembered for many years to  come.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me and the residents of  East Orange in commending her service to her community.                            ____________________
