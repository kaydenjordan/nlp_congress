 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the career of Dr.  William ``Bill'' Craig, who retired on June 25, 2018, after 58 years of  civilian service. Dr. Craig served as the director of the Software  Engineering Directorate SED for 30 years at Redstone Arsenal in  Huntsville, AL. Through his direction, SED experienced significant  growth not only within its customer base but also by expanding its  facilities. He has provided decades of service to improve the  development and fielding of numerous Army systems, as well as the  quality of life in his community and across the State of Alabama.   Mr. Bill Craig is a native of Senatobia, MS, and he received a  bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Mississippi State  University. His civil service career began in 1960 at Dr. Werhner von  Braun's astronics laboratory. Ten years later, he moved to the Army  Ballistic Missile Defense Agency. He later became a charter member to  the Army Missile Command's Missile System Software Center in 1976.   Bill has earned many recognitions throughout his career, including an  honorary doctorate degree from the University of Alabama in Huntsville.  In 1985, he was awarded Supervisor of the Year by the North Alabama  Chapter of Federally Employed Women. Bill was the first recipient of  the Joseph C. Moquin Award given by the Huntsville Association of  Technology Societies. Bill also received the Medaris Award from the  Tennessee Valley National Defense Industrial Association, and he was  inducted into the Alabama Engineering Hall of Fame, the Order of Saint  Barbara, and the Ancient Order of Saint Barbara.   What is truly remarkable are Bill Craig's many contributions to the  State of Alabama and the U.S. Army through his work at Redstone  Arsenal. I am proud to take this time to recognize him for his service  to the people of Alabama and the people of our country. Bill is a  highly respected leader and visionary in the State, and I thank him for  his commitment to Alabama.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the remarkable  career of Ann Richardson McNair, who dedicated over 51 years of service  to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and the Redstone Arsenal, both  located in Huntsville, AL. Mrs. McNair was an acknowledged leader in  both the engineering and institutional fields at Marshall. She held  many significant positions and earned outstanding honors and  recognitions during her tenure there. Mrs. McNair has provided decades  of service to improve the quality of life in her community and across  the State of Alabama, and her notable career has left a lasting mark on  the space industry.   Mrs. McNair earned her bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics  from the University of Alabama. In 1958, she began her career with the  Army Ballistic Missile Agency at Redstone Arsenal. Mrs. McNair then  moved  [[Page S5357]]  on to work at Marshall Space Flight Center in 1960. She continued her  work there until retiring in 2012.   Mrs. Ann McNair has earned many recognitions and made history  throughout her career, among them being the first female supervisor in  engineering at Marshall. She was awarded the Team Redstone Women's  History Award and the Technology Award for Women Honoring Women from  the Women's Economic Development Council. Ann received the Presidential  Rank Award for Meritorious Executives in 2009, which is the highest  honor a Federal employee can receive. The Alabama Senate also commended  her in 2009 for her outstanding professional achievement during her 50  years of NASA service. Other noteworthy recognitions include the  Outstanding Leadership Medal for leading the Mission Operations  Laboratory, the NASA Exception Achievement Medal, and two NASA  Exceptional Service Medals.   Ann's contributions to NASA and Marshall Space Flight Center are  truly exceptional. I am proud to take this time to recognize her  service to the State, as well as to the Nation. Her achievements and  dedication to advancing the industry have made a lasting impact. I join  Ann McNair's friends, family, and former colleagues in recognizing her  wonderful career, and I thank her for her commitment to Alabama.                            ____________________
