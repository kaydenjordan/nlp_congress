 Mr. Speaker, last month, more than 400,000  illegal immigrants crossed the Darien Gap into Central America on their  way to our southern border, nearly double the number that had arrived  in all of 2022.   Let's put that number in perspective. Mr. Speaker, 400,000 is more  than double the populations of Altoona, Johnstown, Chambersburg,  Lewistown, Breezewood, Gettysburg, Waynesboro, Mifflintown, Newport,  McConnellsburg, Greencastle, Huntingdon, Shippensburg, and Bedford  combined.   It is clear that President Biden's border policies, which welcome  illegal immigration, have created a national security crisis, a public  health crisis, and a humanitarian crisis, all due to the porous  southern border.   Since Joe Biden took office, there have been a total of 7.6 million  encounters at our southern border, and for the third year in a row,  Americans are now on track to see the worst border crisis in our  Nation's history.   This year, we have seen public schools used as holding facilities for  illegal immigrants instead of being used for American students who are  already suffering from historic learning losses following Biden's  prolonged school shutdowns.   While an influx of illegal immigrants has strained the food banks,  the shelters, and the hospitals along our southern border, this  administration continues to turn a blind eye and refuses to assist the  communities that are threatened and in need.   It is time for the Senate to pass the Secure the Border Act, which  would: first, force the Biden administration to restart construction of  the border wall; second, increase the number of Border Patrol agents;  third, end catch and release; and, finally, deploy the new technologies  that our Border Patrol agents have requested in order to help secure  our southern border.   President Biden's failure to address this crisis is simply  unacceptable. Report after report from Eagle Pass, San Diego, and  McAllen shows that this crisis will only continue to worsen each and  every day.   We can't afford business as usual from Washington, and we cannot  abandon our Border Patrol agents who deal with this problem. It is time  for Democrats in Congress to join us and deliver real solutions and not  more empty promises to the American people.                            ____________________
