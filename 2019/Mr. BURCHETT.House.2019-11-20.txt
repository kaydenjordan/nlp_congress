 Mr. Speaker, November is Alzheimer's Awareness Month. I  rise to recognize the millions of Americans across this great country  who are living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.   Alzheimer's is a frightening disease that has impacted several  individuals close to me. My Aunt Jane lost her battle with the disease,  while my Aunt Virginia continues to fight it. Additionally, the  legendary Pat Summitt, a friend of mine--she actually came to my  father's funeral--who coached the University of Tennessee Lady Vols  basketball team for 38 seasons, lived with and brought awareness to  Alzheimer's disease before passing away in 2016.   I am especially thankful for the caregivers who assist those living  with a memory disorder. Friends, family members, and trained  professionals care for these patients and make sacrifices to ensure  their comfort. These efforts must not be overlooked, Mr. Speaker.   Individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's need to know they are not  alone in their battle against this difficult illness. And while I  remain optimistic about new treatments and ongoing research to find a  cure, this November I encourage my constituents and colleagues to take  a moment to think about those Americans living with Alzheimer's disease  and say a prayer for them and their families and to show support for  the caregivers who look after and advocate for them.                            ____________________
