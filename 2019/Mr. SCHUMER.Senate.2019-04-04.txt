 Mr. President, rather than spend time yesterday on a  terribly destructive rules change, Leader McConnell could have focused  the Senate on an urgent matter that this Chamber has failed to act on:  disaster relief.   In a few moments, Senator Leahy and I will ask unanimous consent to  have a vote on a new version of the emergency disaster relief that  couldn't get through the Senate earlier this week. Our new amendment  offers this Chamber a path forward from this week's impasse. It is a  plan that meets everyone's needs. It doesn't say only aid this or only  aid that; it recognizes  [[Page S2248]]  all American citizens deserve to be helped when disaster strikes.   The amendment Senator Leahy and I will offer provides $16.7 billion  in relief for Americans struck by natural disasters last year and in  the last 2 years. It includes $2.5 billion in new funding--funding that  the bill from the Republican side that failed, offered by Senators  Shelby and Perdue, did not have--$2.5 billion in new funding for the  recent flooding in Iowa, Nebraska, and Missouri. We all agree these  communities need assistance now. This amendment also crucially includes  aid for our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico and other territories. It  doesn't say to pick one or to pick the other. It says to do both.    All of us in this Chamber should agree that we must do something now  to help all Americans in need. This amendment offers our Republican  friends--those who have said we need aid in the Middle West--the  opportunity to do just that. So, if this Chamber wants to help families  in Nebraska, in Iowa, in Missouri and if we want to help the families  of Texas and of Florida, this amendment is the path forward. It is the  key to moving forward. This is the solution that has the ability to  pass the House. This is the option that has enough support to reach the  President's desk. The Speaker of the House has said the original  Republican bill wouldn't even have been put on the floor. This bill  will.   Now, some will say and, I know, my dear friend from Alabama--and he  is my good friend--will say that the President will not sign this.  Well, I have something else to say. If my colleagues on the other side  pass this measure, the President will dare not veto it. That is my  prediction. We all know the President has huffed and puffed about  vetoing bills in the past. He has said he would veto ``this,'' and he  has said he would veto ``that.'' Yet, in most instances, when the  Republicans in the Senate have stood up, he has caved. In this case in  particular, he will not want to veto legislation that helps Nebraska  and Iowa and Missouri and Texas and Florida. So let's not play this  game.   We all know what happened. There was a bipartisan agreement.  President Trump went to the Republican lunch and said: No aid for  Puerto Rico. That is why we are in this mess, but we can change that.  It is time to call the President's bluff. Elections have consequences.  There is a Democratic House. The time has come for the Republicans of  this Chamber and for the Republicans in the House to have a frank  conversation with the President about what can and cannot pass the  Congress.   If the President cares about farmers in Iowa and Texas and Missouri  and all American citizens who have been affected by natural disasters,  he will not veto this bill. We know that. The measure we are presenting  today isn't some solution that has been cooked up out of left field; it  is a simple proposal. We need disaster relief for all Americans, plain  and simple.   Senators Leahy and Shelby worked in good faith earlier this year, as  they always do, and I appreciate the great relationship our  Appropriations Committee chair and ranking member--vice chair--have. It  would have worked had the President not gone to that lunch. Who knows  why, where, or when he pounded the table and said: No aid to Puerto  Rico. He said that, OK? The only problem is when we are at the brink of  a compromise, all too often, President Trump torpedoes things, and then  the Republicans act powerless. They don't act.   If Leader McConnell and the Senate Republicans will not support this  measure--a measure that notes the needs of all affected Americans--then  what is their plan that can pass the House and pass the Senate and go  to the President's desk?   If this measure just had aid to Puerto Rico and not to the Middle  West, the President might veto it, but he is not going to veto a bill  that gives aid to the Middle West nor should he.   So, if an ``all of the above'' solution will not work, what on Earth  will?   So far, the answer from this Chamber on the other side seems to be  nothing--none of the above. That doesn't make sense. This is an  emergency. People are suffering. People can't get back into their  homes. Small businesses need help starting up again. This is not the  time to duck, to look for cover, to know when the President has done  something sort of wrongly and seemingly on a whim to just bow to what  he says. We should agree on the need to do something now to help  communities that are recovering from natural disasters. Our amendment  offers the Republicans the opportunity to do just that.   Nobody--no Member of this body--should pick and choose which American  citizens get help in times of crises. It is a profound shame that my  colleagues on the other side, thus far, have allowed the President to  derail this process and have gone along with appeasing him. I say the  power of this Chamber is greater than they realize. If we vote on this  package and if it passes the Senate and if it passes the House and  reaches the President's desk, the President will sign it. He will not  follow through on a veto threat even if he knows that doing so will be  a profound betrayal of his promise to look after the well-being of all  Americans.   I urge the Senators to support our amendment today that gives aid to  the Middle West, to the South--those from Florida to Texas--and to the  people of Puerto Rico.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that as in legislative  session, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 268; that all pending  amendments be withdrawn; that Leahy amendment No. 246 be agreed to;  that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; and that  the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  with no intervening action or debate.    I will hold it up.    Mr. President, first, let me thank my good friend the  Senator from Illinois for those great  [[Page S2258]]  words. We have had police officers in New York hit the same way. There  is a bridge in New York on Southern State Parkway that we named after  an officer who died a few years ago in the same situation, and I thank  Lucy for caring and pushing hard.                     Nomination of Mark Anthony Calabria    Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the nomination of Mark  Calabria to become the Director of FHFA. I hope every Senator who has  homeowners in their districts will pay attention here.   For decades we have had Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac providing  mortgages at lower rates for people because there is a Federal  guarantee. Because housing is such an important part of our economy, it  stimulates jobs and the growth in the economy.   It is utterly amazing that, once again, we are in a sort of ``Alice  in Wonderland.'' The nominations from this administration go directly  in the face of what I bet almost every Member on the other side  believes--that interest rates should be low for mortgages and that  there should be some kind of Federal guarantee.   Well, here is what Dr. Calabria believes. First, he believes that the  30-year mortgage is not necessarily part of our Federal housing finance  system. He believes that Fannie and Freddie guarantees should be no  higher than $200,000.   I would ask Dr. Calabria to visit some of the middle-class  neighborhoods of New York--policemen, firemen, teachers, construction  workers. Their homes would be put in jeopardy by this, and a home is  the middle class's piece of the rock.   What the heck are we doing around here?   President Trump doesn't pay attention to who the nominees are. They  are put forward by Mick Mulvaney, who believes in no government  involvement in anything, and people get hurt.   What about the young couple with a new job, a new baby? They want to  buy their first home. What about the person of color? Finally, when  zoning laws and other things have changed, they can get a home. What  about parents who are about to retire and want to sell their home so  that they can move to smaller quarters and have a little bit of extra  money? What about grandparents? To put in somebody who wants to undo  the FHFA and undo our rock solid housing system would be ridiculous.   I hope my colleagues will listen. If you believe in homeownership, if  you believe the middle class ought to have homeownership, you can't  support somebody who wants to eliminate Federal guarantees, who wants  to lower the amount, and who wants to say that the 30-year mortgage,  which has had such a success in America, should no longer be the  bedrock of our system.   I hope people will look at who this nominee is and vote no. I  certainly will.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1044         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate       that from June 2017 through June 2018 more than 48,000 people       in the United States died from an opioid overdose, with       synthetic opioids (excluding methadone), contributing to a       record 31,500 overdose deaths. While drug overdose deaths       from methadone, semi-synthetic opioids, and heroin have       decreased in recent months, overdose deaths from synthetic       opioids have continued to increase.        (2) The objective of preventing the proliferation of       synthetic opioids though existing multilateral and bilateral       initiatives requires additional efforts to deny illicit       actors the financial means to sustain their markets and       distribution networks.        (3) The People's Republic of China is the world's largest       producer of illicit fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, and their       immediate precursors. From the People's Republic of China,       those substances are shipped primarily through express       consignment carriers or international mail directly to the       United States, or, alternatively, shipped directly to       transnational criminal organizations in Mexico, Canada, and       the Caribbean.        (4) In 2015, Mexican heroin accounted for 93 percent of the       total weight of heroin seized in the United States,       transported to the United States by transnational criminal       organizations that maintain territorial influence over large       regions in Mexico and remain the greatest criminal drug       threat to the United States.        (5) The United States and the People's Republic of China,       Mexico, and Canada have made important strides in combating       the illicit flow of opioids through bilateral efforts of       their respective law enforcement agencies.        (6) Insufficient regulation of synthetic opioid production       and export and insufficient law enforcement efforts to combat       opioid trafficking in the People's Republic of China and       Mexico continue to contribute to a flood of opioids into the       United States.        (7) While the Department of the Treasury used the Foreign       Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (21 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) to       sanction the first synthetic opioid trafficking entity in       April 2018, precision economic and financial sanctions policy       tools are needed to address the flow of synthetic opioids.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the United States should apply economic and other       financial sanctions to foreign traffickers of illicit opioids       to protect the national security, foreign policy, and economy       of the United States; and        (2) it is imperative that the People's Republic of China       follow through on the commitments it made to the United       States on December 6, 2018, through the Group of Twenty--        (A) to schedule the entire category of fentanyl-type       substances as controlled substances; and        (B) to change its national and provincial laws and increase       provincial law enforcement efforts to prosecute traffickers       of fentanyl substances.

SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS AND REPORTING ON INTERNATIONAL                     OPIOID CONTROL REGIME.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that,       in order to apply economic and other financial sanctions to       foreign traffickers of illicit opioids to protect the       national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United       States--        (1) the President should instruct the Secretary of State to       commence immediately diplomatic efforts, both in appropriate       international fora such as the United Nations, the Group of       Seven, the Group of Twenty, trilaterally and bilaterally with       partners of the United States, to establish a multilateral       sanctions regime against foreign opioid traffickers; and        (2) the Secretary of State, in consultation with the       Secretary of the Treasury, may consider forming a new       coalition of countries to establish a multilateral sanctions       regime against foreign opioid traffickers if certain       countries in existing multilateral fora fail to cooperate       with respect to establishing such a regime.        (b) Reports to Congress.--        (1) In general.--The President shall include, in each       report required by section 101(b), an assessment conducted by       the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of       the Treasury, of the extent to which any diplomatic efforts       described in subsection (a) have been successful.        (2) Elements.--Each assessment required by paragraph (1)       shall include an identification of--        (A) the countries the governments of which have agreed to       undertake measures to apply economic or other financial       sanctions to foreign traffickers of illicit opioids and a       description of those measures; and        (B) the countries the governments of which have not agreed       to measures described in subparagraph (A), and, with respect       to those countries, other measures the Secretary of State       recommends that the United States take to apply economic and       other financial sanctions to foreign traffickers of illicit       opioids.       SEC. 103. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS.         The President shall impose 5 or more of the sanctions       described in section 104 with respect to each foreign person       that is an entity, and 4 or more of such sanctions with       respect to each foreign person that is an individual, that--        (1) is identified as a foreign opioid trafficker in a       report submitted under section 101(a); or        (2) the President determines is owned, controlled, directed       by, supplying or sourcing precursors for, or acting for or on       behalf of, such a foreign opioid trafficker.       SEC. 104. DESCRIPTION OF SANCTIONS.         (a) In General.--The sanctions that may be imposed with       respect to a foreign person under section 103 are the       following:        (1) Loans from united states financial institutions.--The       United States Government may prohibit any United States       financial institution from making loans or providing credits       to the foreign person.        (2) Prohibitions on financial institutions.--The following       prohibitions may be imposed with respect to a foreign person       that is a financial institution:        (A) Prohibition on designation as primary dealer.--Neither       the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System nor the       Federal Reserve Bank of New York may designate, or permit the       continuation of any prior designation of, the financial       institution as a primary dealer in United States Government       debt instruments.        (B) Prohibition on service as a repository of government       funds.--The financial institution may not serve as agent of       the United States Government or serve as repository for       United States Government funds.       The imposition of either sanction under subparagraph (A) or       (B) shall be treated as one sanction for purposes of section       103, and the imposition of both such sanctions shall be       treated as 2 sanctions for purposes of that section.        (3) Procurement ban.--The United States Government may not       procure, or enter into any contract for the procurement of,       any goods or services from the foreign person.        (4) Foreign exchange.--The President may, pursuant to such       regulations as the President may prescribe, prohibit any       transactions in foreign exchange that are subject to the       jurisdiction of the United States and in which the foreign       person has any interest.

Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate       that from June 2017 through June 2018 more than 48,000 people       in the United States died from an opioid overdose, with       synthetic opioids (excluding methadone), contributing to a       record 31,500 overdose deaths. While drug overdose deaths       from methadone, semi-synthetic opioids, and heroin have       decreased in recent months, overdose deaths from synthetic       opioids have continued to increase.        (2) The objective of preventing the proliferation of       synthetic opioids though existing multilateral and bilateral       initiatives requires additional efforts to deny illicit       actors the financial means to sustain their markets and       distribution networks.        (3) The People's Republic of China is the world's largest       producer of illicit fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, and their       immediate precursors. From the People's Republic of China,       those substances are shipped primarily through express       consignment carriers or international mail directly to the       United States, or, alternatively, shipped directly to       transnational criminal organizations in Mexico, Canada, and       the Caribbean.        (4) In 2015, Mexican heroin accounted for 93 percent of the       total weight of heroin seized in the United States,       transported to the United States by transnational criminal       organizations that maintain territorial influence over large       regions in Mexico and remain the greatest criminal drug       threat to the United States.        (5) The United States and the People's Republic of China,       Mexico, and Canada have made important strides in combating       the illicit flow of opioids through bilateral efforts of       their respective law enforcement agencies.        (6) Insufficient regulation of synthetic opioid production       and export and insufficient law enforcement efforts to combat       opioid trafficking in the People's Republic of China and       Mexico continue to contribute to a flood of opioids into the       United States.        (7) While the Department of the Treasury used the Foreign       Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (21 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) to       sanction the first synthetic opioid trafficking entity in       April 2018, precision economic and financial sanctions policy       tools are needed to address the flow of synthetic opioids.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the United States should apply economic and other       financial sanctions to foreign traffickers of illicit opioids       to protect the national security, foreign policy, and economy       of the United States; and        (2) it is imperative that the People's Republic of China       follow through on the commitments it made to the United       States on December 6, 2018, through the Group of Twenty--        (A) to schedule the entire category of fentanyl-type       substances as controlled substances; and        (B) to change its national and provincial laws and increase       provincial law enforcement efforts to prosecute traffickers       of fentanyl substances.
