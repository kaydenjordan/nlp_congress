 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the objection.    Madam Speaker, my constitutional oath is sacred, and I  have a duty to speak out about confirmed evidence-filled issues with  the administration of the 2020 Presidential election in certain  battleground States.   Signature verification, ballot observation, voter roll integrity,  voter ID requirements, and ballot collection protections were weakened  on top of the millions of mailboxes that were flooded with unrequested  mail-in ballots.   Many of my constituents have been outraged and demanding that I voice  their objections here today.   This debate is necessary because rogue election officials,  secretaries of state, and courts circumvented State election laws. They  made massive changes to how their State's election would be run. These  acts, among other issues, were unlawful and unconstitutional.   Congress has the duty to defend the Constitution and any powers of  State legislatures that were usurped.   Some claim today's objections set new precedent by challenging State  electors. That claim, of course, ignores that Democrats have objected  every time a Republican Presidential candidate has won an election over  the past generation. If you don't have any observations today, that is  your call, but don't lecture about precedent.   Over the past 4 years, Democrats boycotted President Trump's  inauguration and State of the Union Addresses, pushed the Trump-Russia  collusion conspiracies and investigations and knowingly lied about it,  voted to impeach the President before even knowing what to impeach him  for, and then actually passed Articles of Impeachment before Senate  Democrats voted to remove him from office.   Today's debate is necessary, especially because of the insistence  that everything President Trump and his supporters say about the 2020  election is evidence-free. That is simply not true.   No one can honestly claim it is evidence-free. When I say that, in  Arizona, courts unilaterally extended the legislatively set deadline to  register to vote.                                time  2200    The Arizona State Senate issued subpoenas post-election to get  information from the Maricopa County board on various election matters,  but the board and the courts refused to help at all to let the State  senate complete its constitutional duties.   In Pennsylvania, where State legislators wrote us about their powers  being usurped, the Democrat majority on the State supreme court changed  signature, signature matching and postal marking requirements. The date  to submit mail-in ballots was extended contradictory to the date set by  State law.   The State legislature expanded no-excuse mail-in balloting without a  constitutional amendment. Constitutions apply to the acts of all  branches of government.   The issue was magnified by the voter rolls being so inaccurate that  more voters submitted ballots than there were registered voters.  Signature authentication rules for absentee and mail-in ballots were  weakened by the Democrat secretary of the Commonwealth without  authorization. Ballot defects were allowed to be cured in some counties  but not others. There were poll watchers denied the ability to closely  observe ballot counting operations.   In Georgia, the secretary of state unilaterally entered into a  settlement agreement with the Democratic Party, changing statutory  requirements for confirming voter identity. Challenging defective  signatures was made far more difficult, and the settlement even  required election officials to consider issuing training materials  drafted by an expert retained by the Democratic Party.   In Wisconsin, election officials assisted voters on how to circumvent  the State's voter ID laws and signature verification laws, while also  placing unmanned drop boxes in locations picked to boost Democrat  turnout. The Democracy in the Park event in Wisconsin had over 17,000  ballots transferred that shouldn't have been.   These are all facts and certainly not ``evidence free.''   Americans deserve nothing less than full faith and confidence in  their elections and a guarantee that their vote--their voice--counts  and that their concerns are being heard. That is why we need to have  this debate today, whether you like it or not.   This isn't about us. This is about our Constitution, our elections.  This is about our people and our Republic.
