 Mr. Speaker, today I have introduced a resolution of  inquiry requesting that the President and Attorney General provide the  House with any evidence in their possession relating to President  Trump's claims that President Obama illegally ordered the wiretapping  of Trump Tower, a task not welcomed but necessitated by the President's  seemingly baseless accusations that the Obama administration wiretapped  Trump Tower during the Presidential campaign. These accusations should  be taken literally and seriously.   As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I have seen absolutely no  evidence that supports the President's claims. President Trump and the  Department of Justice have a responsibility to completely clarify the  President's statement on Twitter.   If the White House and Department of Justice are unable to produce  this evidence, as I suspect will be the case, the President owes the  American people a thorough and immediate explanation and apology.                            ____________________
