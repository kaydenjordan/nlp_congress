 Madam Speaker, I rise today to applaud the passage of the  Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act.   Millions of Americans live with a very serious mental health or  substance abuse disorder. We must recognize their plight as part and  parcel of providing overall health.   When we ignore the signs and symptoms of mental and substance abuse  disorders, we are unable to attain the help that is available for  millions, but help is available.   Now, thanks to this legislation, we will ensure more people have  access to quality, affordable behavioral healthcare.   By increasing resources for proper diagnosis and recovery services,  telehealth, mental health screenings, suicide prevention, we will  improve lives and save lives all across our country.   Let us continue working to provide the care that is essential to  daily life. Help is within reach. Let us make sure that those who need  medical diagnoses on the behavioral front receive it. Finally. Finally.   As a member of the Mental Health Caucus and the Bipartisan Addiction  and Mental Health Task Force, I thank the Committee on Energy and  Commerce for their steadfast work to assure wellness for millions of  Americans.                            ____________________
