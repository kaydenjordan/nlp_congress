 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of legislation introduced by my  colleague, Congresswoman Karen Handel from Georgia, H.R. 6691, the  Community Safety and Security Act.   This is an important piece of legislation for multiple reasons.  First, passage of this legislation fulfills Congress' duty to fix a  loophole in our Federal legal code that the Supreme Court has decided  must be changed. Specifically, the U.S. Supreme Court has said that our  definition of ``crime of violence'' is unconstitutionally vague,  applicable throughout U.S. Code. This means courts must decide on a  case-by-case basis which crimes are of violence and which are not.   Unfortunately, this vagueness leads to inconsistencies. Individuals  who commit crimes of sexual assault, kidnapping, assault on a police  officer, and much more may be set free by the courts because of this  vague phrase in our code.   With this legislation, we can ensure those committing these acts stay  behind bars. And further, fixing this problem is exactly what Congress  was designed to do, allowing those elected directly by the people to  create and update the laws we live by, creating consistent and clear  laws to uphold the rule of law.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  important legislation.   I thank my colleague from Georgia for sponsoring this legislation.
