 Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to speak about a  great Nebraskan and a great American. His name is Dwight L. Clements.  He died last week at 102 years old.   Dwight Clements was born in Elmwood, Nebraska, and he went on to  study at the University of Nebraska and got a degree in business.   But this is the interesting part, Mr. Speaker: His education was  disrupted by World War II, where he served as an Army combat engineer  in France until the war ended in 1945.   After the war, Dwight earned his law degree at the University of  Nebraska and then returned to small-town Elmwood to work at the family- owned American Exchange Bank and to join the law firm with his father,  Clements Law Firm. He continued in banking and law until he retired in  1985.   But this is the point, Mr. Speaker: Dwight Clements was a humble,  dutiful, small-town Nebraskan. But as a member of the Greatest  Generation, he served something far larger than himself. Through his  sense of duty, selflessness, sacrifice, and patriotism, he represented  the kind of person that not only holds Nebraska together but holds  America together.   May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
