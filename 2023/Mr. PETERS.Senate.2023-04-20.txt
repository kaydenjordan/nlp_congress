 Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Maryland  for his support of the Fire Grants and Safety Act.   The amendment he is offering would authorize a new grant program at  FEMA to fund fire station construction. And while I fully support  increased Federal resources for this purpose, I must, unfortunately and  reluctantly, vote no on this particular amendment.   This language has not been moved through committee, and FEMA has not  had the opportunity to provide input to ensure that this bill achieves  its intended goal.   But let me say again: I fully support this effort, fully support the  Senator from Maryland, and agree with him totally that we need to have  more resources to help our communities upgrade their fire stations.  This is an urgent need.   I also agree we want to make sure that we are not raiding the current  fund for this purpose, which is why the next amendment coming up, I  will also be voting no. But I fully intend to work with the Senator  from Maryland to move towards a markup on his stand-alone bill, on this  very topic, which has been referred to the Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee, a committee in which I chair.   But I will reluctantly be voting no on this amendment.                           Vote on Amendment No. 85     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute on the amendment.    Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Alaska's  support and cosponsorship of the Fire  [[Page S1281]]  Grants and Safety Act before us, and I also appreciate and fully agree  with this amendment to help smaller communities build new facilities.   But I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment because of the  unintended consequences it would have. The Assistance to Firefighters  Grant Program historically receives applications for five times the  amount of funding that is available. In 2020, there were $2 billion in  requests for only $300 million available in funding. This program is  massively oversubscribed, and that is why all of the major firefighting  services in this country oppose this amendment. That includes the  International Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association  of Fire Fighters, the National Volunteer Fire Council, and the National  Fallen Firefighters Foundation. All are calling for clean passage of  the Fire Grants and Safety Act without amendment.   I know my colleague shared the goal of the good Senator from Alaska.  I do as well, but I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, join  with our firefighters all around the country. Let's send a clean  firefighting bill to the House.    Madam President, in just a few moments, each of our  colleagues will have the opportunity to cast their vote for a  bipartisan bill that provides essential Federal resources to fire  departments all across our country.   The Fire Grants and Safety Act reauthorizes two vital grant programs  administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency that provide  funds to help fire departments purchase safety equipment, address  staffing needs, fund fire training and education programs, and provide  cancer screenings to firefighters.   The legislation also reauthorizes the U.S. Fire Administration, which  works to support fire and emergency medical services as they help  safeguard our communities.   Federal grants enable many firefighters, especially those in smaller  and rural communities, to invest in the vehicles, equipment, or  training they need to do their job safely and effectively.   I have had the opportunity to visit several fire stations across  Michigan to see firsthand how they use these vital grant programs to  purchase extraction tools like the Jaws of Life and up-to-date  breathing equipment to keep firefighters safe on the job. Without these  programs, many fire departments would simply not have the resources to  afford the equipment and tools they need to protect their communities.   Now the Senate will be able to show these heroes that we have their  backs by voting to pass this commonsense, bipartisan legislation.   I want to thank my cosponsors and colleagues for their support,  including Senators Collins, Carper, Murkowski, Coons, Moran, Boozman,  Heinrich, Rounds, King, Sullivan, Tester, Sinema, and Kennedy.   By passing this critical bill, we can ensure our firefighters and  first responders have what they need to continue safeguarding our  communities from emergencies.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.
