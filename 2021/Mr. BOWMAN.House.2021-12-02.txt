 Madam Speaker, I rise today because the maternal health  crisis in this country is dire, with the United States being the only  developed country in the world experiencing a rise in maternal  mortality rates.   It is even more dire for Black women, who are three to four times  more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications.   This is no coincidence. For centuries, systemic racism has harmed the  mental, physical, and economic well-being of Black and Brown people.  Thanks to the leadership of Black women in Congress, Congresswoman  Underwood, Congresswoman Sewell, Congresswoman Adams, and more, who are  driving the momnibus, this body is working to bring us out of a Black  maternal health crisis.   Madam Speaker, I rise for my sisters and their babies who are more  than a statistic and deserve to be holistically treated and cared for.  Black moms matter.   I urge my colleagues to support the momnibus and join us in our  effort to protect Black women and Black mothers.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, today, we are focused on Federal student  loans.   This global pandemic, which is very much still with us, has been hard  on Americans in so many ways. One source of relief the Federal  Government has been able to provide is the pause on Federal student  loan payments. That pause is scheduled to end after January, and tens  of millions of Americans will have to resume monthly payments on their  loans.   Millions of people will yet again be faced with terrible choices  between paying off their loans and putting food on the table, paying  for childcare, or paying medical bills. Student debt is a national  crisis. It was a crisis before the COVID-19 pandemic and it is an even  bigger one now.   I can't think of a better opportunity to cancel student loan debt.  Today, over 40 million borrowers owe a combined $1.8 trillion in loans,  and the share of people who are able to make payments high enough to  reduce their principal balance has been rapidly declining. That means  for years people have been doing all they can to make  [[Page H6896]]  monthly payments but can only afford to keep up with the interest that  accrues.   If someone took out a $30,000 loan to go to a public State university  but can only afford the minimum monthly payments to cover interest,  they can be paying hundreds of dollars every month for years without  seeing the total amount they owe go down at all. In fact, many  borrowers see their debt increase because they can't even keep up with  the interest.                                time  1845    Far too often it can take a borrower over a decade to pay off their  loans, and many borrowers end up defaulting because they simply cannot  make ends meet with such high payments. This can have lasting impacts  on a person's financial, mental, and physical health which taken all  together makes it harder for people to fully participate in the economy  over the long-term.   For example, Madam Speaker, you can't get a Small Business  Administration loan if you have defaulted on any loan in the past 7  years. So many of our family members, friends, and neighbors face  additional barriers to starting businesses because of student debt.  They face additional barriers to save for retirement, buying homes,  taking care of their health and putting off doctors' visits or  necessary prescriptions, starting families, or pursuing a career they  are passionate about.   Students took these risks in their pursuit of the American Dream  through obtaining a college degree. Students across America are doing  exactly what we asked them to do; work hard, study and learn deeply,  grow your mind, develop your skills, and expand your world view.  Students across America took these steps because we told them that  education, particularly higher education, would be the great equalizer.  We told them their hard work would open doors for the rest of their  lives.   Instead, we have shut those doors in their faces one by one, and we  have disproportionately done this to Black and Latino, indigenous, and  poor students. We have preyed upon our most vulnerable kids.   The student debt crisis is a racial justice issue, and we cannot talk  about the problem nor the solutions without centering the experiences  of students and families of color and others who come from marginalized  communities.   Canceling student debt would mean putting money back into people's  pockets and improving the overall economy. This is money that can be  used to pay for childcare so that parents can reenter the workforce and  actually use the degree they went into debt for in the first place.  This is money that can be used to start a business or buy a house or  pay for necessary healthcare.   This newfound freedom will open the door to pursue a passion or a  purpose like teaching, nursing, or public service rather than one that  just pays the bills. This freedom will improve one's quality of life  and provide the self-determination necessary for quality, long-term  planning.   Canceling student debt would go a long way in reducing the racial  wealth gap and the racial homeownership gap and would help address many  of the systemic barriers Black and Brown families face.   It is time to cancel this predatory student debt to give the American  people a fresh start and accelerate both the economic and social well- being of our Nation. Our predatory debt is an unfair and unjust burden  that has been hanging over the heads of borrowers since they decided to  pursue an education.   That is why I, along with many Members you will hear tonight, Madam  Speaker, have been calling on President Biden to use his executive  authority to cancel Federal student loans. This authority is already  being used right now to cancel the interest owed on all Federal student  loans during the pandemic. Now it is time to use that same authority to  cancel all Federal student debts.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Jayapal), who will highlight many ways canceling students loan debt is  urgently needed. Congresswoman Jayapal will address this House on this  very important issue.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jayapal for her  remarks, and I thank her for her congressional leadership as the chair  of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. I thank the gentlewoman for  lending her voice and vision to this very important issue.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Espaillat), who represents the Boogie Down Bronx right next door to me.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Espaillat for his kind words.  Before he goes, I want to underscore what he said about people  investing in their own communities when they have more money in their  pockets. The gentleman just made me think of all the young children who  want to take art classes, drama classes, and swimming lessons, and  receive tutoring, and all the things that families cannot afford  because they are trying to pay down their student debt.   They can reinvest in their communities, reinvest in their children,  and their children will be much less likely to commit harm to  themselves or their communities because they have been developed and  nurtured from an early age.   I thank the gentleman so much for his remarks, my brother  representing the Bronx, Manhattan, and the historic Washington Heights.  We cannot forget that, Brother.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms.  Williams), my sister and fellow freshman.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Williams for  participating.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio- Cortez), who represents the Bronx and Queens.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez for  taking me back to when I was 17, a senior in high school, trying to  figure out what the heck I was going to do. I decided to go to college.  We didn't have any money, so they offer you all this free money and  say: There you go. You could take out as much as you want, as much as  you need. Just come to our school, and we will take care of you.   Then what happens is, you take on all of this debt, and then you get  out, and you are underpaid in terms of the employment you receive. Then  the rent is too high, and the groceries are too high, and the childcare  is too high.    I yield to the gentlewoman from New York.    And health insurance is too high. It is unbelievable.   We need to cancel student debt and end the predatory practices on our  young people, completely end the practice.   It is my honor to now yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley).    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Pressley for her  words.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Tlaib so much for  her powerful words.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee).    Thank you so much, Congresswoman Jackson Lee. You made me  think of the hundreds or even thousands of students and families that I  have met throughout my career in education who in elementary school  have already made the decision that their children are not going to  attempt to go to college despite their brilliance, despite them being  artists and scientists and architects and engineers and athletes and  musicians and all of those things.   Because of the crippling impact of student debt and cost of college,  they have already made the decision when kids are as young as 5, 6  years old. That is unconscionable, that is un-American, and the  President has the authority and the moral responsibility to cancel  student debt right now. Thank you so much for your words.   I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Gomez), the last  speaker of the evening. I thank him for being here.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Gomez for his powerful  and inspiring words.   President Biden and his administration have made some important  strides to improve student loan debt for many people who are enrolled  in public service loan forgiveness. 30,000 people getting loan  forgiveness is a big step in the right direction. Now we need loan  forgiveness for the more than 40 million other people in this country.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
