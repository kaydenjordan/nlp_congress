 Mr. Speaker, when the President of the United  States approved airstrikes targeting General Qassem Soleimani, he did  so without the authorization of, or consultation by, the Congress.  Americans stationed abroad are now categorically less safe than they  were before the president took action.   Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, no American will mourn the loss of  General Soleimani--and nor should they. We are not here on the floor  today to debate the merits of his assassination, but rather to address  the failure of this Administration to adhere to the longstanding  procedure of congressional consultation as mandated by the War Powers  Resolution; specifically, the failure to properly and expeditiously  articulate to the Congress any intelligence supporting the alleged  threat which prompted this assassination.   The Administration's actions have already endangered the lives of  many American servicemembers, diplomats, and foreign service officers.  I fear that the path we are on now, one lacking a coherent strategy  moving forward, will only add to the instability of the region and lead  to an extended conflict for which we are not prepared.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution simply reaffirms to the president and to  the public Congress's role in authorizing the use of military force. As  representatives of Americans from every corner of the country, we  deserve to have our voices heard in a serious discussion on the  implications of yet another conflict in the Middle East.   I plan to vote in favor of the resolution and would urge my  colleagues to do the same.
