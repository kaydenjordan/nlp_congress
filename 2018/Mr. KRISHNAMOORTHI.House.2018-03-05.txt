 Mr. Speaker, since the tragic events at Marjory  Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, leading American  companies, including DICK'S Sporting Goods, Walmart, L.L.Bean, and  Kroger, have taken a leadership role in combating gun violence.   Last week, all four companies announced that they would no longer  sell guns to anyone under 21.   DICK'S Sporting Goods has demonstrated singular courage as the first  company to establish a minimum age for gun sales and also by announcing  that it would no longer sell assault-style rifles or high-capacity  magazines.   When DICK'S announced these policies, it also challenged Congress to  show the same commitment to commonsense gun reform. In his open letter,  DICK'S Sporting Goods' CEO Ed Stack implored Congress to ban assault  weapons and high-capacity magazines, establish the age of 21 as the new  minimum age to buy a firearm, and secure an effective universal  background check system.   The American business community is already acting to combat gun  violence. The private sector is ahead of us. Congress must follow suit.                            ____________________
