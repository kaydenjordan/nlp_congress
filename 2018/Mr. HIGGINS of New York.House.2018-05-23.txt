 Mr. Speaker, there are 54,000 structurally  deficient bridges in America. Every second of every day, seven cars  drive on a bridge that is structurally deficient.   Earlier this month, New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli issued  a report finding that our broken sewer systems are dumping billions of  gallons of sewage into our lakes and rivers.   The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the Nation a D rating  when it comes to infrastructure and estimates that it will cost $2  trillion just to bring our infrastructure to a state of good repair.   Mr. Speaker, a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan over 5 years would  create 34.5 million jobs, and infrastructure pays for itself with $1.60  of new economic growth for every dollar invested: this, according to  the Congressional Budget Office. That is 6.9 million jobs each of the  next 5 years and 575,000 jobs each month for the next 60 months.   Mr. Speaker, it is time that we get out of Iraq and Afghanistan and  invest in nation building in America, with American workers and for the  American people.                            ____________________
