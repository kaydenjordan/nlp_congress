 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to sponsor H.R. 647, the Palliative Care and  Hospice Education and Training Act, which has 296 bipartisan cosponsors  and endorsements from 54 national organizations, including the American  Cancer Society and the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative  Medicine.   The goal of palliative care is to provide patients relief from the  symptoms of a serious illness. This form of medical care can accompany  treatments and even cures. Often, an interdisciplinary team of  healthcare providers consisting of doctors, nurses, social workers, and  chaplains provide palliative care. In this capacity, these  professionals often help patients with medical decisionmaking and care  coordination.   Palliative and hospice care has been shown to improve health outcomes  for patients, but not many people are aware of the benefits.  Furthermore, our Nation has a shortage of qualified palliative and  hospice care professionals.   The Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act will help  remedy these issues. This bill will create programs to train the next  generation of providers of palliative and hospice care. It will also  better educate patients, families, and health professionals about  palliative care's benefits, and it encourages the National Institutes  of Health to expand research in this field.   Nearly every one of us has felt the pain and stress of a serious  illness, either personally or standing beside a loved one. By passing  this bill, we will take an important step forward in bringing relief to  patients suffering from serious illnesses.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member  Walden for their leadership on this issue and Congressman Reed and  Congressman Carter, who coauthored this bill with me.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from 54  national organizations and 35 State organizations.

Re: Support for the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and           Training Act (PCHETA)        Dear Representatives Engel, Reed, and Carter, Chairman       Pallone, Ranking Member Walden, and Vice Chair Clarke: The       undersigned organizations write to express our support for       H.R. 647, the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and       Training Act (PCHETA). This bipartisan legislation will make       a difference in the lives of millions of patients living with       serious or life-threatening illness and their caregivers.        Despite a high intensity of medical treatment, many       seriously ill individuals still experience troubling       symptoms, unmet psychological and personal care needs,       fragmented care, poor communication with their health care       providers, and enormous strains on their family caregivers.       However, numerous studies have shown that adding palliative       care can improve pain and symptom control, quality of life,       and patient and family satisfaction.        Palliative care is an interdisciplinary model of care       focused on relief of the pain, stress and other debilitating       symptoms of serious illness, such as cancer, cardiac disease,       respiratory disease, kidney failure, Alzheimer's, AIDS, ALS,       and MS. Its goal is to relieve suffering and provide the best       possible quality of life for patients and their families.       Palliative care can be offered simultaneously with life-      prolonging and curative therapies for persons living with       serious, complex, and eventually terminal illness and       includes hospice care. By its very nature, palliative care is       patient-centered care--translating patient goals to       appropriate treatments.        We appreciate your leadership in recognizing the       significant role palliative care and hospice can play in       creating lasting change across the health care system. With       PCHETA's focus on expanding the interdisciplinary palliative       care workforce, promoting awareness of the benefits of       palliative care among patient and providers, and improving       the evidence base for this care, you have demonstrated a       strong commitment to addressing key barriers to palliative       care access for the growing number of Americans with serious       or life-threatening illness.        Delivery of high-quality palliative care cannot take place       without sufficient numbers of health care professionals with       appropriate training and skills. Students graduating from       medical, nursing or health care professional schools today       have very little, if any, training in the core precepts of       pain and symptom management, advance care planning,       communication skills, and care coordination for patients with       serious or life-threatening illness. Further, there is a       large gap between the number of health care professionals       with palliative care training and the number required to meet       the needs of the expanding population of seriously ill       patients. PCHETA would go a long way towards bridging this       gap by establishing education centers and career incentive       awards to improve the training of doctors, nurses, physician       assistants, social workers and other health professionals in       palliative care.        PCHETA also aims to strengthen clinical practice and       improve health care delivery for patients living with serious       or life-threatening illness, as well as their families, by       directing funding toward palliative care research. Research       funding for palliative care and pain and symptom management       comprises less than 0.1 percent of the National Institutes of       Health annual budget. PCHETA would direct an expansion and       intensification of research in these important areas.        At the same time, more must be done to ensure patients and       providers are aware of the benefits of palliative care.       According to the Institute of Medicine, there is a ``need for       better understanding of the role of palliative care among       both the public and professionals across the continuum of       care.'' PCHETA would direct the implementation of a national       education and awareness campaign so that patients, families,       and health professionals understand the essential role of       palliative care in ensuring high-quality care for individuals       facing serious or life-threatening illness.        Through your leadership last Congress, PCHETA passed the       House of Representatives with overwhelming bi-partisan       support. We appreciate your continued support and dedication       to this important issue. We look forward to working with you       toward quick passage of this legislation in the 116th       Congress.
