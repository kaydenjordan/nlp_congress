 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, every Democrat and every Republican in this Chamber  recognizes there is a youth vaping epidemic in the United States of  America. I am sure that every Member of Congress has heard stories  about millions of middle school and high school students using  addictive vaping products.   I became focused on this issue last year when a group of mothers from  Parents Against Vaping e-cigarettes told me about the stories of  schools filled with student vaping. I actually spoke to my 16-year-old  son, and I  [[Page H1273]]  learned just how prevalent vaping has become in the school districts in  my community and how they are throughout the country.   We have to act, and we must act now.   Madam Speaker, this important bipartisan legislation we are  considering today includes my bipartisan bill, the Protecting American  Lungs Act, which passed out of the Committee on Ways and Means with  bipartisan support.   This bill will establish much-needed tax parity between vaping  products and cigarettes. It will tax nicotine, a harmful and addictive  substance, at approximately the same rate, whether you get it from an  e-cigarette or from traditional cigarettes.   Importantly, this bill includes an exception for FDA-approved  nicotine replacement therapies, which means that if a company can prove  that its product is a legitimate cessation device, then the nicotine  will not be taxed.   This bill has the support of over 50 public health, medical, and  educational organizations, including the American Academy of Nursing,  the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Cancer Action Network, the  American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the American  Medical Association, and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.    These groups agree that one of the best ways we can stop people from  using vaping products is to tax them. For young people especially, who  have less money and higher price sensitivity, taxes on these products  are an effective way to decrease usage. It is proven.   In fact, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, every 10  percent increase in the cost of cigarettes leads to a 4 percent overall  smoking reduction and 7 percent less youth smoking.   I know that some people raised their voices against this effort. We  have heard it all before when we fought to raise cigarette taxes in my  State of New York. Some will say the science is not conclusive yet.  Some will advocate for free choice. Others will say this is typical  taxing Big Government.   When it is all said and done, however, the opposition will come from  those who put their lucrative nicotine interests ahead of our  children's health and proven public policy.   In my home State of New York, despite intense industry opposition, we  raised cigarette taxes. Because of that, we have some of the Nation's  lowest rates of smoking and smoking-related illnesses.   We can save lives with this bill by raising the prices of harmful  vaping products and decreasing their usage among teenagers. The  opportunity to stop the youth vaping epidemic is one that we must not  pass up.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, before I yield to the chairman of our  committee, I just want to note again that the Protecting American Lungs  and Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act has an exception for FDA- approved nicotine replacement therapies and has over 50 public health,  medical, and educational organizations supporting it.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Neal), the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee who is just a  fantastic chairman.    Madam Speaker, I just want to point out to my good friend  from Georgia that the tax does not exempt premium cigars in any way  whatsoever.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer), a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee and chair  of the Trade Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I just want to note again that the  bipartisan Protecting American Lungs Act, again, has over 50 public  health, medical, and educational organizations supporting it.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Danny K. Davis), another senior member of the Ways and Means Committee,  the chairman of the Subcommittee on Worker and Family Support, and my  good friend.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an analysis by the  Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, showing that e-cigarette use is  dramatically higher among high school and middle school students than  amongst adults.                        Action Needed: E-Cigarettes         Since their introduction in 2008, e-cigarettes have become       both ubiquitous and an increasing source of public policy       concern and debate. This concern stems primarily from drastic       increases in youth e-cigarette use. The most recent data show       that 27.5% of high schoolers are using these products--a rate       of youth tobacco product use not seen in nearly two decades.       The public health community, parents and educators are       shocked and worried to find their children and students using       these products at home and even  [[Page H1276]]       in class. Young people are reporting severe signs of       dependence, including using e-cigarettes when they first wake       up, inability to concentrate in the classroom without using       an e-cigarette, and even waking in the night to get a       nicotine fix.        We have known for decades that youth in particular should       not be exposed to nicotine because it changes brain chemistry       to create a stronger addiction, can lead to memory and       concentration problems, and can make youth who use it more       susceptible to addiction to other substances. Research also       suggests that young people who use e-cigarettes are four       times more likely to go on to smoke combustible cigarettes.        E-cigarettes are now threatening to undo all the progress       that the public health community and government have made       over decades to reduce cigarette smoking. Indeed, the surgeon       general raised the alarm by issuing an advisory declaring a       youth e-cigarette epidemic in December 2018. Since then, data       show that more and more youth continue to use e-cigarettes.       And this isn't just experimental or occasional use--it's       regular use likely driven by addiction. The most recent       National Youth Tobacco Survey data show that 34.2% of current       high school e-cigarette users use them on 20 days or more per       month.        Conversely, as the youth e-cigarette epidemic has continued       unabated, we have seen adults, and especially older smokers,       simply reject the product. In 2014, the first year that the       National Health Interview Survey measured adult use of e-      cigarettes, 3.7% of adults used the product in the last 30       days. In 2018, the adult usage remained low, at 3.2%, and was       largely driven by young adult users (7.6%), who have matured       during the youth e-cigarette epidemic. While some adults have       switched completely to e-cigarettes from combustible       cigarettes, the predominant pattern among adult users       continues to be e-cigarette use in conjunction with smoking.       This ``dual use,'' however, provides no reduction in the       harms associated with smoking.        As youth use continues to rise, the science around the       potential harms of e-cigarettes has grown. Studies show that       e-cigarettes produce lower amounts, but are not free from the       toxins found in cigarettes. At the same time, flavoring       compounds and other ingredients may be producing their own       unique harms. Recent studies demonstrate the harms e-      cigarettes pose to the respiratory system. Similarly, new       studies show e-cigarettes may present unique threats to       cardiovascular health. It continues to be nearly impossible       to make generalized statements about the potential harms and       benefits of the overall category of e-cigarettes due to the       incredible variation in hardware design and ingredients.       Moreover, as industry executives themselves have       acknowledged, we simply do not know the long-term health       impacts of e-cigarette use. It took us many decades to       understand the toxicity of cigarettes, and, even today, we       are discovering new ways in which they harm health.        Simply put, the data show that e-cigarettes as they are       currently sold and regulated in the United States are       overwhelmingly a vehicle for youth initiation, not adult       cessation. E-cigarettes expose kids--who otherwise never       would have been--to nicotine and put them at risk for both       long- and short-term health consequences.                 THE POSITION OF TRUTH INITIATIVE          Truth Initiative has maintained that there may be some       possible public health benefit from properly regulated e-      cigarettes, provided manufacturers can demonstrate that the       products can help adults quit smoking combustible cigarettes       safely and completely. However, no e-cigarette has been       approved for smoking cessation and no e-cigarette has gone       through the rigorous scientific review necessary to determine       whether it actually does help smokers to quit. Furthermore,       any public health benefit from e-cigarettes for smokers must       be weighed against the incredibly high youth use of e-      cigarettes and the fact that there are currently no       significant marketing restrictions on these products. Without       a significant change in regulatory approach, it is unlikely       that e-cigarettes will contribute to the overall benefit of       public health.     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cox), a good friend and leader on this important issue  to reduce cost for Americans with chronic lung disease and asthma.    Madam Speaker, I just want to mention again that the  Protecting American Lungs Act had over 50 public health, medical, and  educational organizations sponsoring it.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Shalala), a very good friend, a real leader on health issues, and the  former Secretary of Health and Human Services in the United States of  America.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Florida.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee, a good friend and a leader on this issue.    Madam Speaker, I just want to clarify, again, that  premium cigars are already subject to a Federal excise tax, and there  is no carve-out for the taxes on premium cigars.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York  (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), a good friend, the chairwoman of the  Committee on Oversight and Reform.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, every Democrat, every Republican in this House knows  there is a problem with youth vaping in the United States of America.  Every single one of us recognizes that something must be done, and  today we are taking important action.   I want to point out that this is not a new debate. It is pretty much  the same debate we went through with smoking years ago.   I used to serve as the Nassau County Executive in New York State when  the  [[Page H1283]]  smoking issue was a massive debate in this country, and we heard the  same arguments about Big Government. We heard the same arguments about  taxing. We heard the same arguments about choice. And we can't fall for  it again.   We saw it happen in this country with smoking, that for so many years  we ignored the fact that smoking was the number one killer in this  country, and it took us decades to act.   Now that we see youth vaping growing in this country every single  day, efforts that are being made to market specifically to young  children every single day, we must act to try and protect our families  and to try and protect our children.   Again, I want to point out that the Protecting American Lungs Act,  which is part of this bill, has the support of over 50 public health,  medical, and education organizations, including the American Academy of  Nursing, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Cancer  Society Cancer Action Network, the American Heart Association, the  American Lung Association, the American Medical Association, and the  Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Neal. I want to thank  Chairman Pallone. I want to thank all of the leaders, such as Donna  Shalala, former-Secretary Shalala, and Raja Krishnamoorthi and all of  my colleagues who have spoken here today.   I urge my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, to act now on  behalf of the children of our country.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
