 Mr. President, I am delighted and honored to follow  my great colleague from neighboring Rhode Island after that feisty,  fighting speech, which also captures the spirit of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  She was deeply concerned about the corrupting impact of money on our  political system. She was a longstanding critic of Citizens United, the  Supreme Court decision that opened the way to that dark money that has  so corrupted our system.   She was a believer in closing the gaps and loopholes because she was  smart enough and curious enough to learn what the real facts were, as  opposed to her colleagues on the Supreme Court who relied on the  stereotypes of the political system that were outdated even when  Citizens United was adopted. We live in a democracy that is threatened  by exactly that dark money in every sphere of the public square and  public office, never more than in our judicial system because it is  even less visible and more easily disguised. In part, the reason is  that people pay less attention to it. Another reason may be that the  amounts of money by comparison seem smaller. The amounts of hundreds of  millions of dollars seems small compared to the billions involved in  legislative or Executive races. But Ruth Bader Ginsburg knew that the  power of the dollar, whether it is judicial selection or legislative  campaigning, can be easily corrupted on a system that lacks limits.   So I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for reminding us about part  of the legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which was to stand for principles  and people--the constitutional principles that animated her whole life  and gave breath to her matchless advocacy, the sense of righteousness  that could capture attention in a courtroom. Even though it seemed to  be surrounded by technical legal language, she made that language  accessible to everyday Americans.   And she chose her plaintiffs wisely. When she was arguing a case or  mounting against gender discrimination, she chose a male plaintiff who  was denied Social Security simply because his wife, a woman, was the  one in the military.   And she knew the power of hard work. Her work ethic was second to  none, but her commitment to her family and most especially to her  husband Marty--also a brilliant lawyer, a wonderful, warm human being-- was legendary.   I was really privileged and honored to know Justice Ginsburg  casually, informally. I knew her warmth, her compassion and caring,  sometimes to her law clerks or other friends. I was also privileged to  argue three cases before her on the U.S. Supreme Court. I argued four  as attorney general of Connecticut, and I can tell you that I feared  nobody more on that Court because her incisive, piercing, penetrating  questions cut to the core of the issues. Sometimes they actually could  rescue an arguer from a rabbit hole that some other Justice drew the  plaintiff or defendant, appellant or appellee down because she would go  to the heart of what the case really concerned. She was straight to the  point.   And that is why, straight to the point now, we need to carry on the  fight on so many of those principles. Yes, she was an icon and a giant.  She broke barriers from the classroom to the courtroom. She  demonstrated courage and conviction in her career that were unexcelled,  but she stood for principle, and that is ultimately her legacy.   Maybe it is no coincidence--a sad and tragic coincidence that this  Nation has just passed the 200,000 mark of Americans who have died from  COVID-19. That number is due to the administration's callous  indifference to science, its cruel disregard for human life. Donald  Trump's self-absorption has led to countless lies about the dangers of  this pandemic--the latest and most outrageous being that it has  affected nobody. Well, it has affected everyone in this Chamber. Think  about it for a moment. Every one of us knows someone, has worked with  someone, has a loved one or a friend who has been affected. A friend of  mine whose children grew up playing with mine passed away 5 days from  getting the virus. Yet, at this moment when we are threatened with a  continuing, raging pandemic in this country, a persistent public health  crisis greater than any in our lifetime, and an economic crisis that  prevents people from putting food on their family's table, and small  businesses are going under, we are going to rush through a nominee who  would decimate protections for preexisting conditions--which, by the  way, now includes COVID-19, because COVID-19 does great damage even to  survivors' lungs and heart and brains and other organs. It is a  preexisting condition, and along with other benefits in the Affordable  Care Act, like the ability to stay on a parent's coverage for a young  person  [[Page S5770]]  up to 26 years old, all will be decimated because the Trump  administration is in the Supreme Court in a case that will be argued on  November 10 seeking to destroy it. That protection for preexisting  conditions will be gone, in part because this new Justice, we know, is  committed to eliminating it. How do we know? Because the President  himself has said a strong test will be applied. So those groups, like  the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation and others who do  the vetting and screening for this administration--the choice has been  outsourced to them--have vetted and screened that short list, and every  one of them you can bet has passed that test.    The second part of that test is women's reproductive rights. Donald  Trump has said another part of that strong test will be overturning Roe  v. Wade. Now, I was a law clerk to Justice Harry Blackmun in the 1974- 1975 term right after Roe was decided. So I have lived with the efforts  to overturn Roe. I have fought against those efforts. I have seen the  campaigns in the State legislatures, and they are even more present and  threatening than ever before.   The threat to Roe v. Wade is very much with us. In fact, we were  concerned even after the last Supreme Court decision on reproductive  rights that, in fact, Roe was in danger. Just 3 months ago, we held our  breath waiting for the Supreme Court decision in June Medical Services  v. Russo, the latest attack on reproductive rights, because we knew  there was more than a chance that the Court could strip away those  rights from women across the country. The Court on the slimmest of  margins upheld Roe--the narrowest of legal readings. It was a landmark  legal victory against the radical politicians who continue to attack  reproductive rights notwithstanding Roe v. Wade, but those principles  of Roe are now more in danger than ever before.   The administration and the Republican majority, instead of dealing  with this pandemic, are rushing to approve a nominee who would decimate  protections for women's reproductive rights. And there will be real  consequences for real people, as there are in many other rights that  would be at stake and at risk--voting rights, marriage equality, gun  violence protections, civil rights and civil liberties, and protection  against gender discrimination, the threat to protection from  preexisting conditions like cancer, substance abuse disorder, diabetes,  kidney disease, Parkinson's or pregnancy, and now, for an increasing  number of Americans, COVID is most striking.   An example is Conner from Ridgefield, CT. I have spoken about him  previously on the floor. Several years ago, Conner was diagnosed with  Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It is a degenerative, life-threatening  disease with no cure. He was 4 years old when he was diagnosed. His  parents sought treatment and learned it would cost tens of thousands of  dollars each year, which they couldn't afford, but because of the  protections for people from preexisting conditions, it was a life  saved. Conner is in school. Conner is thriving. Conner is a fighter,  just as Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a fighter. Conner never gave up, and  neither did Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   Conner endured the harsh reality of physical illness and emotional  trauma. And Ruth Bader Ginsburg reached out to people like Conner and  offered them hope. She reached out to women and she inspired a whole  new generation of women and many of us know them because they are women  in our families who decided to pursue a career in law because of her  example. She was small in stature, soft in voice, but she packed a  powerful punch, even before she was a rock star and a pop icon, because  she never gave up. She was a fighter. We cannot give up now.   We must fight for a process that is fair and gives the next President  and the next Senate the choice about the next Supreme Court justice.  That was Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dying wish. We should fight for that  principle because it is a matter of fairness. It is a matter of people  keeping their word.   In this place, there are almost no unwritten rules. There are no  written rules. There are more unwritten rules, and one of those rules  is people keep their word. So we need to fight and make sure that the  legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg is upheld, that these constitutional  principles that matter in the real lives of real people are upheld, and  we cannot give up. Her memory should always inspire us.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Mrs.  Liliane Coucke Smith, a remarkable woman who served as a nurse during  World War II and turns 100 on October 3.   Born in Belgium, Mrs. Smith joined the Belgian Resistance at age 20.  As a wartime nurse, she entered Germany alongside the advancing Allied  Forces.   Her outstanding commitment to serving others continued afterward,  when she worked as part of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation  Administration and the International Refugee Organization to help  resettle over 10 million people displaced by the Second World War,  including former slave laborers and concentration camp survivors. Mrs.  Smith also oversaw the establishment of six refugee camps in the  American occupation zone.   While working as a French-English translator in Naples, she met her  beloved husband, Dudley C. Smith, a U.S. Naval officer. The two split  their time between Europe and the United States, before settling  permanently in Groton Long Point, CT.   Her tireless dedication to helping others in even the most arduous  times is a credit to her generous spirit. A deeply considerate and  unfailingly driven person, Mrs. Smith sets an inspiring model for all  of us through her readiness to embrace new challenges and serve those  in need. Her incredible legacy will be enduring.   I applaud her many accomplishments and hope my colleagues will join  me in congratulating Mrs. Liliane Couke Smith on this milestone of her  100th birthday.                            ____________________
