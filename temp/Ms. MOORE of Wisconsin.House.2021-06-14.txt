 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding to me and for inviting me.   Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to join my CBC colleagues in  highlighting the importance of honoring the holiday and continuing the  legacy of Juneteenth Day, the first one celebrated on June 19, 1865.   As you have heard, this is the date on which Union Major General  Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, to announce the end of both  the Civil War and the inhumane system of legalized enslavement of  Africans in the United States of America.   Now, it must be noted that this announcement came 2\1/2\ years after  President Abraham Lincoln issued an executive order that most of us  know as the Emancipation Proclamation. But it is an important reminder  that our efforts to form a more perfect Union don't really have any  timeframe or any date, but they are ever ongoing.   Madam Speaker, I want you to know that in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from  which I hail, we are going to be celebrating Juneteenth Day, and it  will be the 50th anniversary of Juneteenth Day. Yes, in Milwaukee,  Wisconsin, up north, we started observing this holiday in 1971. It is a  long way from Galveston, Texas, making it one of the first Northern  States to commemorate the end of slavery in our country.   Madam Speaker, this Saturday, we will again gather along North King  Drive to highlight Black culture with traditional food, music, youth  essay contests, marketplaces, pageants, and a parade, unofficially  marking the opening of Milwaukee's famous summer festival. This coming  Friday, we will be raising the Juneteenth flag in the State capital of  Madison, Wisconsin, to honor this day. We take Juneteenth seriously.   Madam Speaker, in 1972, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported an  estimated 3,000 people attending our second annual Juneteenth festival.  That number increased over the years, and between 160,000 and 170,000  people have attended these festivals. The high number of festival-goers  can be personally attributed to Milwaukee's notably special, historic  response to the system of slavery and to our efforts to teach the young  people about Wisconsin's and Milwaukee's role in ending slavery.   Now, in 1854, a Missouri slave owner traveled to Racine, Wisconsin,  the place where I was born, 27 miles south of Milwaukee, to demand that  a runaway slave by the name of Joshua Glover be surrendered under the  U.S. Fugitive Slave Law. Glover, who had been playing cards at the  time, was arrested and carried 27 miles north to Milwaukee so that he  could be in a secure jail until the Federal marshals could move Joshua  Glover back to Missouri because it was a larger and more secure jail.   Well, when abolitionist newspaper editor Sherman Booth heard this, he  rode through Milwaukee streets calling on sympathizers to storm the  jail. A mob of 5,000 Milwaukeeans outnumbered the police and demanded  the keys, but the wardens refused. The crowd smashed down the door.  Joshua Glover was freed and successfully moved through the Underground  Railroad to Canada.   Booth later declared in court:         I rejoice that the first attempt to convert our jail into a       slave-pen and our citizens into slave-catchers has signally       failed.    The Wisconsin State Supreme Court agreed with him and declared the  Federal Fugitive Slave Law unconstitutional in Wisconsin. In fact, in  1850, Wisconsin was the first and only State to declare the Fugitive  Slave Law unconstitutional.   As one of my constituents, the curator of the Wisconsin Black  Historical Society, noted, the Juneteenth holiday signifies that  African Americans are full citizens of this country, deserving of  equity and justice.   Madam Speaker, it is an important day of jubilation not only for the  descendants of Africans enslaved in the United States but for the  American people as a whole, for it is not just simply Black history  that we are celebrating. We are celebrating a victory in American  history about freedom and equality for all of us who call ourselves  Americans.   While it may have been the 13th and the 14th Amendments of the  Constitution that formally freed the slaves, let us continue to observe  Juneteenth Day as our day of reflection, knowing that our ancestors  paid in blood and paid it forward for the unimaginable toil for the  freedom recognized on this day.   As I often tell our young people: Freedom just ain't free, y'all. Our  ancestors paid for it. And as a tribute to them, we have to take  responsibility to do the best that we can and continue to work  tirelessly toward justice and equity in this great land of ours.   Madam Speaker, that is why I admire Sheila Jackson Lee and Barbara  Lee so much for their efforts around reparations and equity in our  society.   With that good news arriving in Galveston, the push for true equality  of opportunity continues to this great day in our society. We see it  reflected in the marches, in the movements, in the legislation, and in  everything that we do today, because despite our being free, we see the  disparities in healthcare, in education, in homeownership, in COVID.   The struggle is real. The struggle continues. And we are here to  remind everyone that all of us are Americans.   Madam Speaker, I again thank Sheila Jackson Lee for yielding.                                time  2000
