 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss an ongoing issue that  has affected nearly every American: the barrage of annoying and  deceptive robocalls.   These seemingly endless automated phone calls disrupt our daily  lives; they constitute a serious form of harassment and expose millions  of Americans to dangerous financial scams.   That is why I introduced a bipartisan bill, alongside my colleagues,  Representatives Lacy Clay and Dan Bishop, called the Foreign Robocall  Elimination Act. Our bill takes on robocalls that originate overseas by  directing the FCC to convene an interagency task force to develop  effective measures to combat robocalls coming from abroad.   No matter which side of the aisle we find ourselves on, we should all  be able to agree: It is time for these illegal robocalls to be stopped  once and for all.                            ____________________
