 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah  for yielding me this time.   Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, in February of 2016, I spoke on this floor  in tribute to Dean Stone shortly after he retired from his full-time  position as editor of The Daily Times newspaper in Maryville,  Tennessee.   Dean Stone worked for The Daily Times for an astounding 67 years,  serving as sports editor; managing editor; and then starting in 1988,  until 2016, as the top editor.   He was always very proud that he gave our great Senator Lamar  Alexander one of his first jobs when Senator Alexander was in high  school in Maryville.   Dean Stone was the standard of journalistic fairness and integrity in  my district and a towering figure in east Tennessee.   Unfortunately, he was unable to enjoy a long retirement, as he passed  away several months later at the age of 92.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of a bill that I have introduced  to name a very unique 800-foot-long bridge on the Foothills Parkway in  his honor.   This bill is a fitting tribute to Dean Stone because his story and  that of the Foothills Parkway will be forever linked in history.   First authorized by Congress in 1944, the Foothills Parkway was  intended to be the Tennessee companion to the Blue Ridge Parkway, which  was built to link the Great Smoky Mountains National Park with the  Shenandoah National Park.   Construction on the Foothills Parkway did not begin, however, until  1960; and in the early decades, a few detached sections of the highway  were completed.   Despite this progress in the early years, construction of the 16-mile  stretch between Walland and Wears Valley, Tennessee, became plagued  with problems. A 1.5 mile section in the middle of this segment, which  eventually became known as the ``Missing Link,'' featured rugged  terrain that was extremely difficult to build upon.   Construction was further complicated by the discovery of minerals in  the soil that could cause damage to the environment.   Despite these complications, my staff and I worked hard to keep the  project alive. In my early years in Congress, we obtained a $3 million  appropriation to resurface and maintain existing sections of this  parkway.                                time  1715    I was pleased that I was able to include $8.6 million in the Federal  highway legislation, T-21, which was signed into law in 1998, and then  the 2005 highway bill contained another $7.5 billion to continue this  project.   In 2016, the Department of Transportation awarded $10 million toward  the completion of the parkway, and the State of Tennessee committed to  providing an additional $15 million match to fund the final paving of  this project. During these years, Dean Stone was a key ally in this  process. It was then that the histories of the parkway and Dean Stone  became permanently linked.   Dean Stone didn't just write in support of the Foothills Parkway. As  chairman of the Great Smoky Mountains Park Commission and as president  of the Foothills Parkway Association, Dean worked hard to convince  people of the need to complete the missing link. Within the next year,  the missing link will be no more, and that section of the parkway will  finally be open to the public. Dean Stone was probably the  indispensable man in getting this section of the road completed.   The Daily Times has stated that one main task remains. What is still  needed, according to The Daily Times, is ``proper acknowledgment of the  Blount Countian who persisted over the years in encouraging, insisting,  cajoling, and convincing the powers that be the `missing link' could  be, should be, and would be connected.''   My bill, H.R. 3469, would name the longest bridge in the missing link  section of the Foothills Parkway as the Dean Stone Bridge. This  particular bridge is an 800-foot engineering marvel similar to the  famous Linn Cove Viaduct on the Blue Ridge Parkway. New technological  advances have allowed the construction of a bridge that floats around  the edge of the mountain rather than tearing into it.   There is no doubt that the elegant curves of this bridge will be the  iconic feature of the Foothills Parkway. Naming it after Dean Stone is  a fitting tribute for all that he did for the Great Smoky Mountains  National Park and for this region. In fact, it is fair to say that no  one individual did more for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park  over the years--through many, many years--in promoting the Great Smoky  Mountains National Park in many different ways.   I have a beautiful photograph that Dean Stone took of the Cades Cove  area of the Smoky Mountains in my office here in Washington even today.  My only regret is that Dean Stone did not live long enough to see the  completion of the missing link, but I take heart in knowing that soon  millions of people will be able to benefit from the fruits of his  labors as they drive over the Dean Stone Bridge and see the glories of  the Great Smoky Mountains.
