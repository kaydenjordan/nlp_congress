 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Red Arndt  of Luverne, MN, for his many years of leadership to the Lewis & Clark  Regional Water System and his commitment to providing safe water to  rural America.   He became the public utilities director of Luverne, MN, in 1989 and  soon heard about a proposal to bring water from the Missouri River in  South Dakota to the surrounding States. At that time, many people  believed it would be too expensive and could not be done.   However, Red believed it was possible and needed more research and  more support. He recommended that Luverne become one of the first  members of the organization that would become the Lewis and Clark  Regional Water system. The city council and mayor approved, and the  dream of delivering safe and reliable water to rural towns and farms  took its first step forward.   It became Red's mission to make that dream come true.   He became one of the only two original directors from 1990 who are  still on the project's board and proudly shoveled the first dirt when  construction began in 2003.   Over the years, he made hundreds of trips to county, city, and  community meetings and to legislatures in several States. He also took  over 60 trips to Washington, DC. He would not let the dream die.   He has worked vigorously for the project. He was vice-chairman of the  board beginning in 1994 until becoming the board chairman in 2006. He  is still the chairman.   Because Red refused to let the Lewis & Clark project die, 14 member  communities and rural water projects are receiving water through over  200 miles of pipeline for over 300,000 people across South Dakota,  Minnesota, and Iowa. He has helped secure over $470 million in funding  for Lewis & Clark.   Red's incredible dedication was seen when he participated in the  ribbon-cutting ceremony for the water treatment plant in August, 2012.  It was only 2 weeks after Red had open-heart surgery. At the ceremony,  he was honored with the Lewis & Clark Trailblazer Award, which is the  organization's highest honor.   In May 2016, Luverne was connected to Lewis & Clark, and Red was  given the honor of taking the first drink of water from the new system  that he had worked so hard to create. The meter building in Luverne was  also named in his honor.   When Red is thanked for all of his hard work, he always says it was  not him, but a true team effort, but everyone involved will tell you  that Red's determination and leadership was the bedrock that led to  success.   I am one of those 300,000 people who are grateful for his dedication,  and I am proud to call him my friend.   I commend Red Arndt for his many great contributions and wish him the  best as he continues to make the most out of the life God has  given.                            ____________________
