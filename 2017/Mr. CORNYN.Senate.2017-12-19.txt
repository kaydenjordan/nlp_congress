 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the House will pass a bill today called  the Jobs for Our Heroes Act, which I hope will be quickly signed into  law by the President.   This bill streamlines a process by which Active-Duty military,  reservists, and veterans can apply for commercial driver's licenses. As  the Presiding Officer knows, and as people may know generally, there is  a shortage of people who can get a commercial driver's license and fill  these well-paying jobs.   This bill will also allow States to permanently waive license  requirements for current servicemembers and National Guardsmen if they  have military experience in driving comparable vehicles. That way,  members of the military will not have to go through the same old  rigmarole twice, wherein they get trained in the military, then get  out, and the civilian world ignores the fact that they had been trained  and had gotten qualified in the military. This bill fixes that.   I am honored to have a broad range of bipartisan support for this  legislation. One would hope something like this would. I thank  Congressman Rob Woodall, who played a key role in helping to get this  bill through the House.   I hope, with this bill being signed into law, more members of our  military will be able to utilize the skills they acquired while they  were in the military to be able to qualify for well-paying jobs in our  communities. We continue to use our best efforts to keep faith with our  veterans who have done so much for all of us.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the second matter I would like to address  is the historic vote that the House will take today and that we will  take later on this evening on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   This bill will dramatically reduce taxes on American families and  incentivize the creation of new jobs. It is a major victory for all  Americans who want to know that Washington has their best interests at  heart. It does exactly what we told the voters we would do in 2016, and  it is important to keep our word. We are delivering tax reform in a way  that is real, comprehensive, and substantial, and we are doing it  through what we usually refer to as regular order in the Senate.   I know that ever since the Affordable Care Act was written in then- Democratic Leader Harry Reid's conference room and was brought to the  floor, there has been a lot of concern about the way the Senate  conducts its activities. Senator McCain, who unfortunately will not be  able to be with us today, has been a stickler for returning to regular  order--by that, meaning introducing a bill, having it marked up and  debated in the relevant committee--in this case, in the Finance  Committee--then having it brought to the floor, where it is amended,  and then debating it until we finally pass it. Then we go to a  conference committee with the House and reconcile the differences  between the Senate version and the House version. That is exactly what  we did with this piece of legislation.   I have spoken at length about certain provisions in the bill before,  but I want to make one point abundantly clear. For the American people,  this represents the very best kind of Christmas gift we can offer  them--one that will actually make their lives better and one from which  they will benefit right away. This tax reform may not bear the ribbons  and bows of a Christmas present, but the men and women who are trying  to make ends meet will benefit from having lower taxes, bigger  paychecks, and a resurgent economy that will produce more jobs and  better opportunities.   I will refer to an article that came out in January of this year  which cited  [[Page S8075]]  a shocking statistic, really. The statistic is, most Americans remain  one misstep away from having a financial crisis. Fifty-seven percent of  Americans don't have enough cash on hand to cover an unexpected $500  expense. These findings from this CBS News report shed light on how  many households continue to struggle with their basic finances more  than 7 years after the official end of the great recession of 2007. A  typical American household still earns 2.4 percent below what it  brought home in 1999. When people talk about less purchasing power and  flat wages, that is what they are talking about.   At the same time, we know costs for essentials, such as housing and  childcare, have surged faster than the rate of inflation, which puts  even more stress on these household budgets. That is one of the reasons  we will pass this conference report later on this evening--because we  believe these families deserve to keep more of what they earn so as to  make sure they don't go into debt when they suffer an unexpected  financial expense of $500, like the 57 percent of the respondents to  the poll said they would, which was reported by CBS News. That is why  it is a big deal.   For example, a typical family of four who earns the median family  income of $73,000 a year will receive a tax cut of $2,058, which is a  reduction of nearly 58 percent. Now, that may not seem like a big deal  inside the beltway, but to those families who are living paycheck to  paycheck and who cannot deal with unexpected financial expenses, this  will help them in a real and meaningful way.   Consider the single mother--or father, for that matter--with one  child and an annual income of $41,000. That parent, that family, will  receive a tax cut of $1,304.50, which is a reduction of nearly 73  percent. This may be shocking news to most people who are listening  because all they have heard about is what is bad in this bill.   There are a lot of very good things in this bill, but it could have  been made better if our Democratic colleagues had worked with us rather  than resisted us at every step along the way. I guess they are  satisfied with the status quo--the fact that purchasing power for the  average family is actually 2.4 percent below what it was in 1999. The  message I would like to convey is, we are not satisfied with the status  quo. We think life can be better, and one way it will be better is to  start with letting people keep more of what they earn.   For a married small business owner with an income of $100,000, he  will receive a tax cut of $2,603.50, which is a reduction of nearly 24  percent. So you can see, across all incomes and among people in very  different circumstances, each of them will benefit from the bill we  will pass tonight and send to the President.   This bill also does something for which Barack Obama had argued in  2011, that of having a bipartisan consensus formed to cut the corporate  income tax rate. I know people aren't necessarily immediately attracted  to the idea of cutting corporations' taxes, but the fact is, America  has the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. What  that means is, it is cheaper for businesses to move to other countries,  to invest in jobs there, and to keep the money overseas that they earn  abroad. By reducing it to 21 percent, as we do in this bill, we will  basically have achieved the average tax rate in the industrialized  world, and we will move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial  one. This really is a bipartisan consensus move.    When our Democratic friends criticize us for corporate giveaways, we  are embracing the very same reforms they have advocated in the past,  whether it is President Obama, Democratic leader Senator Schumer, or  the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Wyden. All  of them have advocated reducing the corporate tax rate and making our  corporate business tax more competitive because they recognize, as we  all recognize, the fact that the status quo kills jobs and encourages  businesses to move overseas. We want to grow jobs in America, along  with investment, and encourage those businesses to come back home.   I daresay that all Americans from every walk of life will benefit  from this stimulus to our economy. Janet Yellin, who was last appointed  Chairman of the Federal Reserve by Barack Obama, said that in part as a  result of this tax package, the Federal Reserve has raised its  projection on growth of the U.S. economy from 2.1 percent next year to  2.5 percent--four-tenths of 1 percent. That is a big deal.   Every American will feel the benefit of that economic growth in terms  of the wages they earn, the opportunities they have, and their ability  to protect themselves against unexpected financial expenses, as I  mentioned earlier.   What could someone do with $2,600 more in their paycheck? Well, you  could install concrete countertops or laminate flooring in your house.  When it comes to a cell phone--everybody seems to have a cell phone-- you can pay your cell phone expense for 2\1/2\ years. You can go online  at a Texas college and pay for your education for a full year. You can  breathe a little bit easier in Dallas by having enough money to pay for  2 months of average apartment rent. You can drive down Interstate  Highway 35 in Texas, knowing that almost 5\1/2\ months of an average  car payment is taken care of. If you need a little dental work done,  you can go to your dentist for a little tune-up and pay for that out of  the savings you will achieve as a result of this bill.   Stories like these, stories of how busy, hard-working and  multitasking Americans will benefit from our plan, simply leave me with  confusion as to why our Democratic colleagues have simply refused to  participate in this process and have blocked and dragged their feet  every step along the way, trying to stop us from providing this relief,  from keeping our promise to the American people. It seems in the  process they have given up on the American dream, they have settled for  the status quo, and they are even rooting for failure.   This bill's final passage won't wait for our Democratic colleagues to  wake up. We are simply determined to get this win even without them  because American families need more take-home pay, they need higher  wages, they need greater job opportunities, and they need a competitive  economy and the benefits it brings. American families should not have  to settle for anything less, and we will make sure they don't.   There is one more aspect of the bill I want to bring up. Our tax  reform plan strengthens our long-term energy security by opening up an  area in Alaska to responsible energy development. At the invitation of  Senator Murkowski, I traveled to the North Slope of Alaska about a year  or so ago, and I am amazed at the technology they were able to deploy  in extracting oil from the North Slope. They literally have ice roads  that don't exist except during the coldest part of the year in order to  protect the environment and allow equipment to travel overland. Thanks  to directional drilling, they are able to occupy basically a very small  footprint and literally drill hundreds of wells in a multitude of  different directions and pump the energy from that location. It creates  jobs, it creates wealth, and it helps create energy security for the  people of Alaska and for the United States.   I come from a State with a huge energy presence, and I understand the  importance of developing our natural resources responsibly. Limited  development with modern technologies will not ruin this area, as some  of the critics have charged, because a very small portion of the  acreage is allowed. It will provide jobs.   Let's not forget why we are doing this. One reason we are increasing  our domestic energy production is because we want to make ourselves  less dependent on foreign energy sources. It also helps lower the price  at the pump for millions of hard-working Americans.   So I can't wait to vote on this bill later today, and I can't wait to  hand-deliver to the President's desk this important bill this week and  for him to sign it into law. We will all benefit from passage of this  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain.)    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain).
