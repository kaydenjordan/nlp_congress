 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time  and, more importantly, for his eloquent words. I appreciate the support  both for The American Legion and for this piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, thank you for bringing the bill to the floor, H.R. 2519,  The American Legion 100th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act, for a  vote today.   For nearly a century, The American Legion has worked tirelessly day  and night to improve the lives of veterans and their families. For that  reason, words cannot express the gratitude that we have for the men and  women of The American Legion.   As both a veteran and a legislator, I see firsthand the results they  achieve for veterans on a daily basis.   This bipartisan piece of legislation has the support of over 370 of  our peers, including the entirety of the House Veterans' Affairs  Committee, the Financial Services Committee, and the majority and  minority leaders.   The Senate has passed a similar piece of legislation, and I look  forward to continue working to get this to the President's desk.   These commemorative coins are just a small token of thanks to show  the millions of American Legion members that we appreciate what they do  for our servicemembers, for our veterans, for our national security,  and for our local communities.   In full disclosure, Mr. Speaker, as a longtime member of The American  Legion, I am proud to stand here sponsoring this piece of legislation.  I look forward to it being signed into law, and then I look forward to  Americans getting a piece of this history that we should all be proud  of.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3819, the Department of  Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2017. I want to thank the  gentleman from Florida for his hard work on this, as the entire  committee did.   H.R. 3819, as the gentleman said, makes sure that some of the vital  programs we have in place to provide for our veterans continue past the  end of the fiscal year and continue to help our veterans.   Included in this bill are provisions related to their healthcare,  their benefits, homeless veterans, and other related issues.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support extending programs related to  the support for caregivers, childcare for certain veterans receiving  healthcare, and the pilot program on counseling in retreat settings for  women veterans newly separated from service.   It also has provisions to extend the authority related to  rehabilitation and vocational benefits to members of our Armed Forces  with severe injuries or illnesses, homeless veterans reintegration  programs, homeless women veterans, and homeless veterans with children,  and providing housing assistance and counseling to homeless and at-risk  veterans.   Also included are extensions of authority for programs to help  disabled veterans as well as authority to enter into agreements with  the National Academy of Sciences to review the research on links  between diseases and dioxin exposure. This is a critical step in  creating any new Agent Orange presumptions that still may be there.  Both of these provisions are critical in helping our aging Vietnam  veterans as well, as we move forward.   The final section contains, as the gentleman said, a technical fix to  the Forever GI Bill, an important piece of legislation once again  crafted in a bipartisan manner with the help of our veterans service  organizations and passed earlier this year. The correction will simply  help make VA implement the law correctly, and all sides agree it must  become law as quickly as possible.   Mr. Speaker, in short, this bill that both the majority and the  minority support, we all agree it must be signed into law as soon as  possible.   Mr. Speaker, with that, I urge my fellow Members to support its  passage, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for his  strong words, for his commitment and service to this country, and I  appreciate his support on this piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Takano), my good friend, the vice ranking member of the full Committee  on Veterans' Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank the gentleman from Louisiana for his support and work  on the committee.   Once again, the old saying is you shouldn't get a pat on the back for  what you are supposed to do; but around here, it is harder than you  might think, and I am incredibly grateful and proud.   I want to thank the majority staff for their work on this piece of  legislation, always including the minority staff, always including us  in decisions, so that when we get to the floor, we bring a piece of  bipartisan legislation that we can all support. It is must-pass  legislation, and that is why it will pass today.   I thank the gentleman from Florida for his continued leadership. We  have been on this committee for over a decade together, and it seems  like it is always that way, so I am grateful for that, grateful we are  able to move this forward.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3819.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
