 Mr. Speaker, I stand against Republican  efforts to give massive tax cuts to the wealthiest citizens and big  corporations while robbing the pockets of middle class families and  ransacking Medicare and Medicaid.   My constituents are worried. Just ask Marion, who uses Medicare to  buy her costly diabetes drugs, or Sherry, whose husband has Alzheimer's  and lives in a nursing home paid for by Medicaid.   Americans want a better deal, one that invests in infrastructure,  education, and innovative research and lowers the costs of things like  child care and prescription drugs.   We want better jobs, better pay, and a better future, not more  giveaways to hedge funds and conglomerates.                            ____________________
