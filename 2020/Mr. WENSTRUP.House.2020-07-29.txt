 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in thoughtful opposition to H.R. 7327.   Everyone in this Chamber agrees that protecting our children is our  top priority and that childcare is one of the most critical pieces of  the equation in getting our economy back to the record levels that we  had achieved earlier this year.   I have talked to parents across my district in Ohio who want to go  back to work but don't have reliable care options available for their  children. It is about more than just returning to work. Children need  to be able to grow socially and emotionally by interacting with their  peers regularly.   Instead of rushed partisan legislation, we need bipartisan solutions,  like my Family Savings Flexibility Act that I introduced with  Representatives Kelly and Axne. Our bill allows parents to increase the  contribution limit to their Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts,  as well as roll over the funds from the 2020 plan year--a huge help to  working parents.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  work with us on finding bipartisan solutions, and I oppose this bill.                                time  1315
