 Mr. Speaker, President Trump shielded Sheriff Joe  Arpaio from a prison sentence for criminal contempt, despite Sheriff  Arpaio's record of illegal racial profiling and abuse directed at  immigrant communities.   The President's latest salvo in his war on immigrants is his tragic  decision to end the DACA program, which has given nearly 800,000  innocent DREAMers, who want to be Americans, the opportunity to work  and attend school.   In my native State of Virginia, we have more than 12,000 DREAMers,  who contribute more than $711 million to our GDP every year--that is  contribute.   These young, hardworking DREAMers, who see themselves as Americans,  as do I, are contributing to our communities, creating jobs, serving in  our military, teaching our children, and caring for our family members.  President Trump would learn that if he ever sat down with them, as I  have, and so many of my colleagues have, and broken bread with them,  and listened to their fascinating, challenging, wonderful stories.   Ending DACA is self-defeating, hurts the American economy, and  neglects all that makes America unique. Let's fix this.  [[Page H7103]]                                ____________________
