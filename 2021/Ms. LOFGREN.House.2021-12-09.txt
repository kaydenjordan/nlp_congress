 Madam Speaker, I want to highlight an important element  of reform that came out of work  [[Page H7584]]  a while ago from the House Administration Committee.   Most Americans believe that if a foreign adversary reaches out to  interfere in our elections, the campaign ought to report that to law  enforcement. Instead, as we saw in the previous administration,  campaign officials welcomed and, in some cases, even solicited foreign  assistance for political activities. This bill creates a duty to report  illicit offers of campaign assistance from foreign governments to law  enforcement.   It also clarifies what is a thing of value. It includes information  sought or obtained for political advantage, like opposition research.   It ensures that individuals engaging in misconduct with foreign  actors to influence our elections would be held accountable. It also  ensures that foreign money cannot influence our politics through State  and local ballot initiatives and referenda, closing a loophole that  recently was created by the FEC.   Now, it is astounding to hear criticism of the idea that the FBI  should be notified when a foreign adversary is trying to corrupt our  elections. We all know that that should happen.   To distrust our law enforcement agencies when it comes to protecting  our country from this kind of attack--which is what it is--from a  foreign adversary is shocking. Support this bill.
