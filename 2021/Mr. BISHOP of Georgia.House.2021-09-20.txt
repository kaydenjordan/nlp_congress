 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair, Chair Takano,  for yielding time. I thank the ranking member, along with you and the  entire Committee on Veterans' Affairs for all the work that you do in  support of our Nation's veterans and, of course, this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleague, Drew Ferguson, in  offering this legislation to honor the former mayor of Columbus,  Georgia, Colonel Robert Stephen ``Bob'' Poydasheff, Sr.   The naming of this VA clinic in Columbus for Bob Poydasheff honors a  great champion of veterans, an exceptional soldier, a distinguished  public servant, and a dear friend.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is endorsed by the Veterans of Foreign Wars,  The American Legion, and the Disabled American Veterans, and it is  cosponsored by every single member of the Georgia congressional  delegation.   Sadly, Bob passed away last year on September 24. He was a native of  the Bronx, New York, and he was born with an innate determination to  excel, which was apparent in virtually every single aspect of his life.  He served honorably in the United States Army for 24 years, and he  retired at the rank of colonel.   He began his distinguished military career as an infantry officer,  serving one combat tour in Vietnam before transferring to the Judge  Advocate General's Corps.   In recognition of his service to our country, he received the Vietnam  Ribbon, the Legion of Merit, and the Army Commendation Medal with two  oak leaf clusters. He was also elected to the Ranger Hall of Fame,  located at Fort Benning, Georgia.                                time  1715    Following his military service, Bob Poydasheff made Columbus,  Georgia, his permanent home. Through his leadership, first as a member  of the city council, then as mayor of the city, Columbus experienced  extraordinary growth and prosperity.   He was a longtime advocate working on behalf of disadvantaged  veterans, including supporting the location of the new VA clinic in  Columbus, which this bill will name in his honor. Bob will be missed,  but his legacy will live on through the lives of veterans who will be  helped at this clinic.   It has been said that you make your living by what you get, you make  your life by what you give. Robert S. ``Bob'' Poydasheff gave so much  to so many for so long, and this clinic memorializes his legacy.  [[Page H4543]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me and my colleague, from  Georgia, Drew Ferguson, the entire Georgia delegation, the VFW, the  American Legion, the DAV, in supporting this bill to name the new  community-based outpatient VA clinic in Columbus, Georgia, the Robert  S. Poydasheff VA Clinic.
