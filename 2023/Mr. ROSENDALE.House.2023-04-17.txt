 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Biggs, my good  friend from Arizona, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, President Joe Biden wants to raise the national debt by  more than $3 trillion over the next 2 years. Washington is bleeding  American taxpayers dry with their addiction to spending, with no end in  sight to this endless financial disaster.   The U.S. already has roughly $31.6 trillion in debt, with no concrete  plan to pay it back. Most folks cannot even fathom how much money that  truly is.   Congress can avoid raising the debt ceiling almost indefinitely by  returning spending to pre-COVID levels and practicing fiscal  responsibility.   On March 28, my colleagues and I proposed targeted cuts to nondefense  discretionary spending that would reduce the deficit by $100 billion  over the next year and reduce the total spending by more than $1  trillion over the next decade.   I am proud to cosponsor over 500 bills that were introduced by  Representative   Andy Biggs to achieve this. These are concrete,  commonsense proposals to eliminate woke and wasteful spending from our  Federal Government.   We must rescind unspent COVID-19 money and stop funding the radical  left's wish list, like the IRS expansion, wasteful green energy  projects, and student loan bailout.   Congress can still pass a strong budget that protects Social Security  and Medicare benefits without having to raise the debt ceiling at all.  Yet, Democrat leaders have yet to respond to this proposal, and the  President has made it clear that he is unwilling to work with any  Republicans.   Biden's proposed budget of $6.8 trillion represents a nearly 32  percent increase in spending since the COVID-19 pandemic began.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, my fellow colleagues, the pandemic is  over. The Federal Government was big in 2019. The American people were  taxed enough already in 2019.   When the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed, it lowered Federal taxes for  all Americans and led to the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. It  has generated nearly $1 trillion a year more in Federal revenue.   It is inappropriate for the President to ask the American people for  even more of their hard-earned money when there is still over $100  billion in unspent COVID relief money lying on the table.   There are too many wasteful organizations and woke government  programs that do almost nothing for the American people while costing  them billions each year in increased spending and increased regulatory  burdens.   In fact, the Congressional Budget Office produces a long list of  Federal departments, programs, and agencies  [[Page H1756]]  that are no longer authorized, but many of these programs still receive  funding.   This is just one example of the countless ways that Congress could  address our spending addiction.   Mr. Speaker, our deficit is getting worse every year. Congress has  failed in its duty to provide sound stewardship of the American  finances, and we are all facing the consequences of this failure.                                time  2130    Worse yet, the consequences of our decisions will fall on the future  generations of Americans.   We all need to come together and find a solution to this problem and  shrink Washington and grow America.
