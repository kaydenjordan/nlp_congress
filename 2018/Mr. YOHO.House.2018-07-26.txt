 Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Lynetta Usher  Griner, an outstanding community leader and a friend, on being named  the 2018 Swisher Sweets/Sunbelt Ag Expo Florida Farmer of the Year.   Lynetta is a timber and beef cattle producer who operates a large,  successful agricultural business in north Florida. Her operation is a  model for success and sustainability, and she has been recognized on  many occasions for her effective natural resource conservation.   Lynetta's businesses have received the Florida Audubon Sustainable  Forestry Award, the Florida Farm Bureau's CARES Award, and the Logger  of the Year Award from the Florida Forestry Association.   Aside from her dedication to the timber and beef industry, Lynetta is  an outstanding community leader. She has served on the Suwannee River  Water Management District's governing board for over 14 years and was  named the first female president of the Florida Forestry Association.   Additionally, Lynetta regularly advocates for good and effective farm  policies at both the local and national levels.   It is my greatest honor to represent Floridians like Lynetta in the  United States Congress. Her selfless leadership and dedication to her  industry and community are admirable.   Congratulations again, Ms. Lynetta Usher Griner.                            ____________________
