 Mr. Speaker, I want to share with you a letter that was  received in the Rules Committee last night.   It is a letter actually addressed to Chairman Kevin Brady of the Ways  and Means Committee. It is from the Joint Committee on Taxation. It is  a long letter. I will not read all of it. Some of it is difficult to  understand, but let me pick out the important points.   In each case, the taxpayers' total income tax liability is lower.  Here is their concluding paragraph:         In its totality, the combined effect of the tax rate and       the income threshold and amendments made by the bill, along       with the increase in the standard deduction, would not, in       and of themselves, result in an increase in the amount of tax       imposed on virtually any filer as a result of these changes.    Translation: no one's taxes go up; not 36 million; not 3,600; not 36.  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, that number is zero, Mr.  Speaker.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Rules Committee  for yielding.   Today, the House of Representatives is considering tax reform for the  first time since 1986.   In the last 31 years, the world has changed a lot and it is time that  we bring the Tax Code into the 21st century. This needed tax reform  will put our country on a path to long-term economic stability and help  hardworking families around the country get ahead.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help American families in important  ways. First, it focuses on Americans in the middle of the earning scale  by doubling the standard deduction and creating a new family  flexibility credit for nondependents. Taxpayers will be able to deduct  even more from their taxable income, reducing the need for tedious  itemization.   In addition, the bill repeals the alternative minimum tax. This tax  was never intended to be as broad as it has become, but because it was  not indexed for inflation when it was introduced, many of us find  ourselves having to calculate our taxes twice to see if we are ensnared  by the alternative minimum tax. It is time for this one to go away.   With decreased taxation, American families have more money in their  pockets, resulting in greater contributions to the economy.    The bill also alleviates some of the cost of raising children by  expanding the child tax credit. It preserves the adoption tax credit so  parents can continue to receive additional tax relief as they open  their hearts and their homes to an adopted child.   This bill reduces the number of tax brackets from seven to four, with  rates of zero, 12, 25 and 35 percent for most taxpayers. It does  preserve the 39.6 percent rate of the previous administration for the  highest earners. These reforms will help simplify the Tax Code and make  it more competitive for hardworking American families.   I am grateful the Ways and Means Committee kept the step-up in basis,  despite repealing the estate tax by 2024. The step-up in basis is an  important component of estate planning when people are planning for  future generations. This will allow people who may experience a tragedy  to continue ownership of family property without bearing excessive  penalties.   Mr. Speaker, I am a supporter of the flat tax. I have introduced H.R.  1040 in every term that I have been in office, but I recognize this  bill makes a lot of needed reforms and repeals some credits while  maintaining those important to American taxpayers.   Donors will still be able to make tax-exempt charitable  contributions, employers will still be able to contribute to 401(k)  retirement savings accounts, new homeowners will be able to deduct the  interest expense on up to $500,000 of a mortgage, and no changes are  made as to Social Security.   I was actually hoping we could lower Social Security taxes. We  couldn't. But we certainly do not increase Social Security taxes,  despite what some of the fake news says.   Students will continue receiving a credit through the consolidated  American opportunity tax credit.   Simply put, this bill will promote growth at middle-income levels,  create a more favorable business environment, and continue important  tax credits.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following  letter from Thomas Barthold to Chairman Kevin Brody:                                      Congress of the United States,                                     Joint Committee on Taxation,                                   Washington, DC, November 14 2017.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: You asked me to comment on the changes       made by H.R. 1 as ordered reported by the House Committee on       Ways and Means in the context of Clause 5(b) of Rule XXI of       the House of Representatives.        Clause 5(b) of Rule XXI sets special passage requirements       for measures that amend subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), or       (e) of section 1 or section 11(b) or 55(b) of the Internal       Revenue Code in a manner that imposes a new percentage rate       of tax and thereby increases the amount of tax imposed by       such section. H.R. 1 amends the relevant sections by       eliminating the 10-percent bracket, which is obviated as a       marginal rate as a result of the increase in the standard       deduction provided in section 63(c) and makes general changes       to the income thresholds at which the varying tax rate       brackets apply and eliminating several other tax rates of       present law. These changes combined with the increased value       of the child tax credit (in section 24) result in virtually       every taxpayer who formerly would have been in the 10-percent       tax bracket having a lower tax liability under the changes       that would be effectuated by H.R. 1 than they would under       present law.        Similarly, H.R. 1 eliminates the present-law 33-percent       marginal tax bracket. As a result there are some taxpayers       who would claim the standard deduction and had his or her       last dollar of income taxed in the 33-percent tax bracket       under present law but under H.R. 1 after claiming the       increased the standard deduction would have their last dollar       of income taxed in the 35-percent tax bracket. However, in       each such case the taxpayer's total income tax liability is       lower under H.R. 1 than under present law. For taxpayers who       eschew the standard deduction under present law there is       substantially greater variability in resulting tax       liabilities. With the elimination of some deductions that       taxpayers may elect to itemize under present law, it is not       possible to say in all cases that these taxpayers have lower       total income tax liability under H.R. 1 than under present       law. However, by comparison to the case of a taxpayer       claiming the standard deduction, the variability of these       results is clearly a consequence of the changes to the tax       base effectuated by H.R. 1 rather than a consequence solely       of the elimination of the present-law 33-percent bracket.        Because the House rule does not contemplate changes to the       Internal Revenue Code as a whole and the interactions such       changes have on tax liability, H.R. 1 requires a waiver of       the rule's provisions. In its totality, the combined effect       of the tax rate and income threshold amendments made by the       bill, along with the increase in the standard deduction,       would not, in and of themselves, result in an increase in the       amount of tax imposed on virtually any filer as a result of       these changes.        I hope this discussion is helpful. Please contact me with       any questions.            Sincerely,                                                Thomas A. Barthold.    The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 619 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       section:       ``SEC. 5. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST ANY TAX BILL THAT RAISES                     TAXES ON MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES BY ELIMINATING                     OR LIMITING THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION.         (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the House       of Representatives to consider any bill, joint resolution,       motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses, or       conference report that repeals or limits the State and Local       Tax Deduction (26 U.S.C. Sec. 164).        (b) Waiver in the House.--It shall not be in order in the       House of Representatives to consider a rule or order that       waives the application of subsection (a). As disposition of a       point of order under this subsection, the Chair shall put the       question of consideration with respect to the rule or order,       as applicable. The question of consideration shall be       debatable for 10 minutes by the Member initiating the point       of order and for 10 minutes by an opponent, but shall       otherwise be decided without intervening motion except one       that the House adjourn.''                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools  [[Page H9279]]       for those who oppose the Republican majority's agenda and       allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer       an alternative plan.
