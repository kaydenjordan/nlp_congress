 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  Equality Act, a long overdue measure I cosponsored to expand important  civil rights protections to every American.   This is personal for me and my district. Central Florida is an area  that prides itself on its diversity, compassion, and inclusiveness. But  tragedy struck in June 2016, when a gunman walked into the Pulse  nightclub and took the lives of 49 innocent individuals. Our community  relied on those same values--diversity, compassion, and inclusiveness-- to overcome hate and move forward together with love.   But despite tremendous progress our Nation has made toward equality,  too many LGBTQ Americans still live in fear. That is because LGBTQ  people across the country remain vulnerable to discrimination on a  daily basis. The Equality Act ensures protections that already exist  for other protected classes are equally available to all Americans. It  is past time we pass this bill so that no American faces discrimination  because of who they are or whom they love.                             Honoring David King     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor David King, a  constituent of mine who passed away recently.   David was born and raised in Tennessee. He attended Tennessee  Technical College and Vanderbilt Law School, where he was an editor of  the law review. David then served honorably in the Marine Corps,  deploying to Vietnam. Following his military service, David relocated  to Orlando with his college sweetheart, Marilyn, by his side. Together,  they made central Florida home.   David was a trial attorney of skill and integrity, earning the esteem  of fellow lawyers and judges. David fought vigorously for his clients  but always treated his courtroom opponents and the justice system  itself with respect.   David served as lead attorney for the Fair District Coalition, which  worked to end partisan gerrymandering in Florida. David was dedicated  to the cause of free and fair elections and to the principle that every  vote matters in our democracy. David was deeply committed to his  central Florida community, generously giving his time, energy, and  financial support to many local nonprofit organizations.   David's proudest accomplishment was his family, especially his 56- year marriage to Marilyn and the sons and grandchildren their happy  union produced.   May God bless the memory of this wonderful man, and may God bless his  family, his friends, and all those who loved him.                            ____________________
