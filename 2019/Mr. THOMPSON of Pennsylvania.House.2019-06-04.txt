 Mr. Speaker, last week I was honored to  attend the Showcase for Commerce in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Cambria  County.   For nearly 30 years, the annual Showcase for Commerce has highlighted  the exceptional work happening in Cambria County.   Established by the late Congressman Jack Murtha, the event brings  together Federal, State and local leaders, as well as major defense  corporations and subcontractors and regional, national, and  international business leaders.   With more than 100 exhibitors and more than 2,000 attendees, the  Showcase for Commerce has grown into a nationally recognized business  and industry trade show and defense contracting exhibition.   Cambria County has a skilled workforce that makes considerable  contributions to our national security. We saw more than $180 million  in new defense contracts announced at this year's showcase. Because  America can't merely remain competitive in a global economy, but we  must lead the way with the most sophisticated technology.   As a Member of the House of Representatives and the father of an  Active-Duty soldier and a Purple Heart wounded warrior, I am not  interested in a fair fight. Our United States military members deserve  our best, that includes the resources to be optimally safe, effective,  and lethal.   There is no better means to a peaceful world or a deterrent to would- be dictators and terrorists than a well-equipped, robustly trained, and  properly funded United States military.   Generations of workers in Cambria County and southwestern  Pennsylvania have been dedicated to our national security through  service overseas and service here at home.   They ensure that we send our servicemen and women into combat with  the most advanced state-of-the-art equipment available.   Here in Washington, the Army's modernization efforts include a  request of $12.2 billion in research, development, tests, and  evaluation funding, and $21.8 billion in procurement, which will begin  to address the Army's identified top six modernization priorities:  Long-Range Precision Fires Missile, next-generation combat vehicles,  Future Vertical Lift, tactical network, air-and-missile defense, and  soldier lethality.   Now, I support this request because we need to be ready to answer the  threats that are before us, whether they come from Iran, North Korea,  Russia, or elsewhere, we must be able to counter and mitigate such  threats swiftly and deliberately.   Career and technical education play a role in our readiness. Right  now, there are more than 7 million job openings in the United States,  and it is one of the greatest challenges we face--the skills gap.   Thanks to the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the  21st Century Act, we were able to completely overhaul the Perkins Act  and invest the resources necessary to have a dominant and prosperous  workforce.   We can secure the future, and help more Americans climb the rungs on  the ladder of opportunity through career and technical education  programs.   Mr. Speaker, the Showcase for Commerce puts Cambria County workforce  on display. Those of us in Pennsylvania already knew this, and the  showcase lets us share it with the rest of the Nation.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, today, I have Jeremy  Collier with me as part of the National Foster Youth Institute Shadow  Day.   Jeremy and his wife, Ashley, live in Cincinnati with their 2-year-old  son, Payton. Jeremy recently completed his MBA studies at Western  Governors University.   Life wasn't always easy for Jeremy. Jeremy aged out of the foster  care system at age 18 when he was still in high school. Jeremy was  virtually homeless, yet he graduated and went on to complete a  bachelor's degree from the University of Cincinnati. Jeremy majored in  business with a concentration in finance.   Today, Jeremy works as a senior insurance auditor, focusing on risk- related audits. I thank Jeremy for being here today, sharing his story  and helping so many children overcome similar obstacles.   Jeremy went through tough times and persevered. He came to Washington  to share his experiences in the hope of strengthening the system for  foster youth.   Madam Speaker, I wholeheartedly congratulate Jeremy on all that he  has achieved in life. Madam Speaker, I am proud of Jeremy's success and  wish him and his family the best moving forward.                            ____________________
