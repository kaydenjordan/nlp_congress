 Mr. Speaker, the President's decision to rescind  DACA has brought fear to hundreds of thousands of DREAMers and their  families.   They are DREAMers like Saul Jimenez, who teaches special needs  students in Los Angeles, and is just one example of how DREAMers  contribute and add value to our country and our communities.   DREAMers are American in every way except for their immigration  status. To send DREAMers to a country they have never known would be  tragic for them and our Nation, which will lose their valuable  contributions.   The American people overwhelmingly oppose deporting our DREAMers, and  our faith-based community and business leaders are imploring Congress  to pass the Dream Act. Yet the Republican leadership is ignoring their  wishes and refusing to allow us a vote on this bipartisan, bicameral  bill.   To my Republican colleagues who say they want to protect our Nation's  DREAMers: If that is true, this is your chance. Vote ``no'' on the  previous question so we can vote on the Dream Act and put our DREAMers  on the road to the security and future they have earned in the only  country they know, the United States of America. The time to pass the  Dream Act is now. Vote ``no'' on the previous question.
