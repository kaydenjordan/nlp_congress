 Madam Speaker, the 117th Congress, I believe, will go down  as one of the most successful Congresses in modern history. We have  passed over 200 bipartisan bills, provided funding for vaccine relief,  the American Rescue Plan, $1.2 trillion bipartisan investment in  infrastructure, efforts to deal with our veterans, focusing on reform  on the Postal Service, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the list goes  on and on.   We have not passed such successful legislation since perhaps the  Great Society in the 1960s. As we reflect upon that and the historic  Speakership of Nancy Pelosi, we reflect upon the success of the last 2  years with a 4-vote majority and a 50-50 tie in the Senate. Certainly  her Speakership is historic in so many different ways.   Madam Speaker, I look on to the next Congress, the 118th. Hopefully,  notwithstanding our divisions, we can find ways to work together on  infrastructure as we continue to invest in America, in water, extreme  drought conditions facing the West and California, much necessary for  the long-term future because where water flows, food grows; investing  in transportation to compete around the world; broadband; I want to get  a medical school in the San Joaquin Valley. We have a shortage of  physicians, and we need to increase the number of nurses to improve  better healthcare for all Americans. We need to focus on rural America.  I represent a great deal of it.   Yes, there are divisions in this country, but I hope the 118th  Congress remembers that we are here to serve the people. This is the  people's House. That is our purpose, to work together and solve  problems.   Madam Speaker, I am hoping that my alma mater, Fresno State Bulldogs,  will be successful in Saturday's game. Go, Dogs.                            ____________________
