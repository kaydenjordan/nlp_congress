 Mr. Speaker, I represent three of the six hardest-hit  counties in America. New York is the epicenter of the pandemic.   As a former mayor and county executive, my biggest priorities have  been to deliver funds to New York based upon the rate of infection and  to eliminate the SALT cap. Both are included in the HEROES Act.   Republican and Democratic Governors, mayors, and local officials all  support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, it is the height of hypocrisy for Senator McConnell to  call this a blue State bailout when my State sends billions more to the  Federal Government every single year, often to benefit Senator  McConnell's State of Kentucky.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
