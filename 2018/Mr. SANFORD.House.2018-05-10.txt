 Mr. Chairman, I rise too, in support of this bill, and I  want to single out Chairman Shimkus for his tireless work. He stood up  in conference after conference after conference, insisting that we move  forward. This bill has been, indeed, a long time coming.   This is about a national solution to a national problem. Each of the  States could come up with their own navies, their own armies. We tried  that once in South Carolina. It didn't work out so well.   But it is important that we, again, have a national solution to a  national issue; that is certainly the case with nuclear waste. This is  about moving past politics to policy. This thing has been held up for  years based on politics.   I don't begrudge anybody in Nevada for pushing and using every tool  in the toolkit in holding it off, but this is ultimately moving to  policy.   This is about not building a mountain of waste in South Carolina and  a whole lot of other interim sites across this country. We have a fault  line at the Savannah River Site, and there are similar security  concerns with the plethora of different sites that we have across this  country. Consolidating makes sense from a security standpoint.   Finally, this is about giving people what they paid for, $40 billion  nationally, over $1 billion in South Carolina paid by ratepayers.   I thank the chairman for acting on this bill.
