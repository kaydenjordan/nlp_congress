 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise tonight to talk about something  we don't see very often in this body. We saw a bipartisan effort today  to move to regular order, to actually put a bill on this floor, to  debate its merits, to make amendments to it, and to try to find a  compromise position to do the right thing for the people across many  States in our country that have been devastated by untoward disasters  just in this last year.   As many of us know all too well, our country suffered a series of  unprecedented natural disasters over the last year. Actually, it is a  trend that has gone on over the last couple of years. We have had a  series of unprecedented disasters.   In July, August, and November 2018 alone, wildfires in California  displaced hundreds and even thousands of people and destroyed thousands  of homes in a very short period of time. These fires were the deadliest  and most destructive in California history.   In August 2018, Hurricane Lane dropped 52 inches of rain over 5 days,  causing heavy flooding and mudslides. It ranks as the second wettest  tropical cyclone in U.S. history, behind Hurricane Harvey in 2017.   In September of 2018, Hurricane Florence caused catastrophic damage  in North and South Carolina. It flooded homes, schools, and businesses.  A week after the hurricane, major highways were still underwater.   In November 2018, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Alaska and damaged  highways and buildings and displaced hundreds, if not thousands, of  individuals.   Earlier this year, an EF-4 tornado flattened Lee County, AL, and took  23 lives, including 3 children, and injured hundreds of others.   Today, our friends in the Midwest are suffering from devastating  flooding. Roads have been washed away, fields look like lakes, and many  cattle have been drowned. As a matter of fact, this flood happened just  at the wrong time--during calving--and we know that thousands of calves  have been lost.   My home State of Georgia has not been immune and is indeed at this  moment reeling from a natural disaster as well.   On October 10, 2018, Hurricane Michael made landfall on the Florida  Panhandle with a category 4 hurricane. It was one of the strongest  storms to ever hit the United States. Over the next few hours,  Hurricane Michael barreled through Florida, tore through southwest  Georgia, and moved on to North Carolina and South Carolina, doing  immense damage. In a matter of hours, homes were flattened, tracts of  timber destroyed, crops were ruined, and people's lives were radically  changed forever. This hurricane hit exactly at a time when most crops  were ready to be harvested. Cotton, peanuts, pecans, timber--it was  devastating. Nothing was spared.   Today, agriculture is Georgia's top industry and our No. 1 economic  driver. Before the hurricane, farmers in my State were expecting a  record harvest in many commodity categories. Instead, just at the time  when harvesting was starting, Hurricane Michael hit, and crops were  completely destroyed across most of our State.   Our farmers are resilient, however. They have weathered droughts  before and low-yield harvests and poor farm economies. They suffered  through several years of low commodity prices as well. But they never  ever faced anything quite like this before. The strength and magnitude  of this hurricane indeed was unprecedented.   Shortly after the hurricane hit, President Trump, Vice President  Pence, and the Secretary of Agriculture all came down to Georgia with  Senator Isakson and me to view the damage. Together, we toured the  State, saw the devastation, and heard directly from farmers about the  tough road to recovery. It was interesting that these farmers were not  asking for anything; they were actually praying for their brethren in  other parts of the country who were also being ravaged by these  disasters.   The scene we saw that day is something I personally will never  forget. We visited one of the largest pecan farms in the world-- certainly in Georgia--and saw the damage in their fields. At this one  farm alone, these two brothers who started from nothing had 800 acres  of beautiful pecan trees. These maturing pecan trees were completely  uprooted at the very time when the heavy harvest was sitting right  there on the trees. In fact, when I was there, you couldn't walk on the  ground; it was just a solid carpet of pecans on the ground, literally  ruined.   Crop insurance will help with this year's losses somewhat, but  agriculture insurance only covers part of the loss. What it won't cover  are the trees that were damaged, particularly in this 800-acre tract  that we personally saw with the Vice President.   Here, there is no insurance. Today in the agriculture industry, there  is no way to insure this machine called a pecan tree that produces  pecans. You can insure part of the crop, but you can't insure the  trees. It takes about 10 years--some varieties, a little less, but  about 10 years to start getting a crop from those new trees. So you can  see for them that this is truly a generational loss.   When they saw the devastation, the Trump administration told Georgia  farmers and other farmers around the Southeast from this particular  hurricane that they would have their backs, and they have moved to do  just that.   President Trump said: ``Farmers really got hurt, especially in  Georgia, but we're going to get it taken care of.'' Vice President  Pence said: ``We will rebuild these crops and these communities. We  will restore southwest Georgia. We will restore the Sunbelt region  bigger and better than ever before.'' They have acted consistently  since October of last year.   The State of Georgia immediately stepped up and offered tax credits,  short-term financing, bridge loans, and other forms of direct  assistance to those impacted. The Federal Government has been a little  slower to act. It has been 5 months since Hurricane Michael ravaged the  Southeast, and this Congress has done very little to help people who  are barely hanging on right now. That is shameful. It is time to do  something about it. This aid should have been funded as soon as we had  an estimate of the damage, which was really a mere few weeks after the  hurricane came through in October. Instead, disaster aid got caught up  in a partisan spending battle here in the Senate, and in typical  Washington fashion, Congress kicked the can down the road.   It is totally unacceptable that Washington's intransigence continues  to threaten the livelihood of the very people who sent us here to  represent them. If we don't help these people right now, they may lose  their businesses, their farms, their livelihoods, and, in some cases,  their families through no fault of their own. That is the reality we  are facing here.   Every night, farmers in my State get on their knees and pray that  help will soon come. They pray their lenders will show compassion when  their bridge loans are maturing, as they are, literally, today. They  pray they will not go bankrupt. They pray they will be able to provide  for their families. And yes, they are praying for other people around  the country who have been devastated just like they have.   Senator Johnny Isakson has been a workhorse in this entire effort. He  and I, along with several other Senators from southeastern States, have  introduced this stand-alone supplemental disaster relief bill that we  just had a vote on merely an hour ago. This bill passed the motion to  proceed 90 to 10. I am very proud to be a Member tonight of a body that  has agreed to put this on the floor and to do what the Senate is  supposed to do, and that is to debate a bill, amend it, and then vote  on its passage.   This particular bill, among other things, for States like California  and other parts of the country, includes $3 billion for agriculture.  This is specifically disaster relief for our farmers and ranchers  around the country. These funds are for States like Georgia, Florida,  Alabama, the Carolinas--that is  [[Page S1976]]  North Carolina and South Carolina--Alaska, Hawaii, California, Iowa,  Nebraska, Missouri, and Kansas, which are all battling natural  disasters right now and over the past year.   I would also add that our colleagues from the upper Midwest have  really moved very quickly and have been very reasonable so that we can  include in the language here flexibility to make sure their needs are  met, as well.   I also want to take a moment to thank our colleagues here for being  very reasonable about needs in other parts of our country.   I really think that what the President has done with Puerto Rico  needs to be called out. The Trump administration has been resolute in  their support of the people in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria and  Hurricane Irma hit the island. To date, $40 billion has already been  allocated, and another 50 is potentially going their way--depending on  how things happen in the next 5 years or so--to help Puerto Rico  recover from recent hurricanes. That is a potential of over $90  billion.   To ensure Puerto Rico continues to have the resource it needs to  recover, this disaster relief bill includes $600 million in additional  nutritional assistance for the most vulnerable families in Puerto Rico  since that relief, that aid, actually runs out this week.   Some Members of this body argue we should allocate more funding for  Puerto Rico. I would remind them that this is the same level of funding  that they have previously supported. In addition, Puerto Rico's own  representative in Congress, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, supports our  bill. She said this ``bill puts my constituents one step closer to  receiving the assistance they need to continue the long path toward  recovery, and I look forward to its swift passage.''   This bipartisan disaster relief package is a win for our farmers. It  is a win for families and businesses who were devastated by historical  hurricanes in the Southeast and wildfires in the West. It is a win for  the people in Puerto Rico, whom the President has previously helped.   Every day we continue debating this issue is a day that people across  the country face crippling uncertainty. Today, I call on each of us to  put our individual political interests aside and do the right thing for  these people who are depending on us right now. Time is of the essence.  People back home are counting on us to get this done.   In conclusion, this discussion reminds us of a bigger issue. The  funding we are debating here today is, by definition, borrowed money.  Because of Washington's intransigence over the last 4 years and its  inability to get its financial House in order over the last few  decades, coupled with this debt crisis we have today, we are losing the  ability to do the right thing, whether it is medical research,  infrastructure, education, or responding to national disasters. Moving  forward, we will not be able to continue dealing with these emergencies  and crises if we don't have a functioning Federal Government that can  pay its bills and keep its financial house in order. Today I ask each  of my colleagues here for their individual support on this disaster  relief package.   I also ask that going forward we have a serious debate about tackling  this debt crisis and responsively funding the Federal Government on  time every year so we can help the American people when they are  counting on us the most.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.
