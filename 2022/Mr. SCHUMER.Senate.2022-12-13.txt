 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before I begin, I want to extend a  massive--massive--congratulations to the Syracuse Orange men's soccer  team for winning the NCAA College Cup national championship last night  in a heart-stopping 7-to-6 victory, after penalty kicks. A big congrats  to Coach McIntyre, all the amazing players, and the staff on a  phenomenal accomplishment--the first in Syracuse history. Go Orange.                              Government Funding    Mr. President, now on the omnibus, a more serious subject,  negotiations for a yearlong omnibus agreement move forward. There is a  lot of work left to do, but we are optimistic that if we preserve the  good faith we have seen so far, we will get there. I remain hopeful  because despite disagreements about the ultimate package, there is  little disagreement that an omnibus is by far the best solution for  funding the government. Still, we are going to need a little more time  beyond this week to get an omnibus done.   To avoid a shutdown this Friday, the Senate should be ready to pass a 1-week CR by the end of this week to give negotiators more time to  finish an agreement by the holidays. The House is set to begin  consideration of a weeklong CR today, and after all the progress made  towards an omnibus agreement, I hope nobody here in the Senate stands  in the way of getting a  1-week CR passed quickly, through consent if needed.   Again, an omnibus is the best option--the most responsible option-- for funding the government in the next fiscal year. It will ensure that  the Federal Government has all the resources necessary to serve the  public at full capacity. It will make sure our troops in uniform are  taken care of. And I expect an omnibus will contain priorities both  sides want to see passed into law, including more funding for Ukraine  and the Electoral Count Act, which my colleagues in the Rules Committee  have done great work on. It will be great to get that done.   After all the work we have done this year to pass important new  bills, like the PACT Act and the CHIPS and Science Act and so much  more, a CR into next year could prevent the investment secured in those  bills from going out the door. The vast majority of us don't want to go  down that road. So, again, the best option--the most responsible  option--is to proceed toward an omnibus, even if it won't contain  everything both sides want.                        Nomination of Arun Subramanian    Mr. President, now on judges, later this morning it will be my honor  to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee to introduce an  exceptional public servant, Arun Subramanian, whom President Biden  nominated on my urging to serve as a district judge for the Southern  District of New York.  [[Page S7108]]  Here on the floor, Arun Subramanian is one of the few South Asians who  are on the bench--we need more--but he will pave the way. And it is my  intention to continue to support South Asians to come to the bench.                        Nomination of Dana M. Douglas    Mr. President, here on the floor, we will also proceed with the  confirmation of Dana Douglas to serve as circuit court judge for the  Fifth District, which covers Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.   Judge Douglas's confirmation today will be significant for a few  reasons. For one, Judge Douglas will be the 28th--the 28th--circuit  court judge this majority confirms in the last 2 years. Of the many  votes we take in this Chamber, confirming circuit court judges ranks  near the top in importance. The lion's share of all Federal cases,  after all, are decided at the circuit court level.   Judge Douglas is also significant because, after her confirmation,  the Senate will have confirmed 11 Black women to serve as circuit court  judges. This is a record for any single session of Congress. Before  President Biden, only eight such nominees had been confirmed by this  Chamber. So this is truly a historic shift in the court's composition.   This representation matters enormously. The health of our Federal  courts hangs on judges who will both apply the law correctly while also  earning Americans' trust in the first place. The more our courts look  like the country at large--the more languages and backgrounds and  specialties we have on the bench--the more likely the trust endures.  That is more important than ever, given the recent disturbing decisions  handed down by the Supreme Court.   That is why judges like Dana Douglas matter. That is why circuit  court judges matter. And we are going to keep working for the rest of  this year and beyond to bring diversity and balance back to our courts.                           Respect for Marriage Act    Mr. President, on the White House signing ceremony, finally, this  morning I want to note my tie. I am wearing it today for two reasons.  First, it is a constant reminder of one of the happiest moments of my  life, the day my daughter got married. And, second, I am wearing it  because, later this afternoon, President Biden will sign the Respect  for Marriage Act into law.   For many Americans in same-sex marriages--or who one day wish to  marry their partner--today is a day of relief and of jubilation. By  passing this law, we are sending a message to LGBTQ  Americans everywhere: You, too, deserve dignity and equality under the  law.    Few bills have hit home for Members on the Hill quite like this one.  Marriage equality is not just the right thing to do for America, it is  personal for so many of us, our staffs, and our families.   My daughter and her wife are beautifully--praise God--expecting their  first child, my third grandchild, next spring, and I want them to raise  their child with all the love and security that every child deserves.  Thanks to the dogged work of many of my colleagues, my grandchild will  live in a world that will respect and honor their mothers' marriage.   And, look, nothing about the Respect for Marriage Act was inevitable.  On the contrary, it took a lot of faith and a bit of risk taking to  reach this point. When my colleagues came and asked me for a delay, I  made that choice, and it was because they believed--and I believed-- that the bipartisan process could indeed work.   It wasn't a decision we took lightly, but today that gamble is paying  off. So I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for making  today's signing possible, and I thank my friend Senator Feinstein, who  originally authored this landmark bill. Because of them and because of  the millions of Americans out there who pushed for change, history will  be made at the White House later today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
