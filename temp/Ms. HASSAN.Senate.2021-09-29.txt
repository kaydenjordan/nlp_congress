 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Mike  Mariani of Spofford and Devin McLaughlin of West Chesterfield as  September's Granite Staters of the Month. Mike and Devin are currently  biking nearly 4,000 miles across the United States to raise money and  awareness for suicide prevention efforts following the loss of Mike's  brother to suicide in 2018.   Three years ago, Mike lost his 16-year-old older brother Nathan.  Nathan was a junior at Keene High School at the time and was known to  friends and family for his sense of humor and love for the outdoors.   In his memory, Mike and his best friend Devin launched Pedaling for  Prevention, an initiative to raise awareness for suicide prevention by  cycling across the country. Pedaling for Prevention also raises money  for The Samaritans in Keene, which is a nonprofit that provides  resources, including an anonymous crisis hotline, to help Granite  Staters battling depression or thoughts of self-harm.   This cross country bike ride was initially scheduled for last year,  but the COVID-19 pandemic forced Mike and Devin to change their plans.  Instead, the pair travelled across New England and held socially  distanced meet-and-greets where folks could share their stories about  losing loved ones to suicide and help reduce the stigma around mental  health. On their return home, the duo received a warm welcome from  their community, including a ride through town on the top of a fire  truck, courtesy of the Chesterfield Fire Department.   Mike and Devin started their long-awaited cross-country journey  earlier this summer. The two are currently exhibiting an incredible  show of endurance by pedaling 3,762 miles across the entire United  States and providing social media updates to spread awareness about the  importance of suicide prevention. On their journey, they are also  sharing their story with people they meet along the way to further  expand their reach.   These two thoughtful, brave, and determined young people embody what  it means to be a Granite Stater. After a heartbreaking loss that  reverberated through an entire community, Mike and Devin decided to  make a positive impact by spreading a message of resilience and hope,  all the while educating others about suicide prevention and the  importance of reaching out for help.                            ____________________
