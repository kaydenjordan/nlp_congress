 Mr. President, I rise today to once again ask that  every Senator have a chance to consider and cast their vote on the  Military Justice  [[Page S3842]]  Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act.   This bill would ensure that when crimes are committed in our  military, justice is delivered. This commonsense reform, which has  bipartisan, filibuster-proof support, moves the decision on whether to  prosecute serious crimes to independent, trained, and professional  military prosecutors, while leaving misdemeanors and uniquely military  crimes within the chain of command. In other words, it takes the same  approach to criminal justice that the military takes in most other  areas of operation. It puts highly technical work in the hands of  trained specialists.   This is not a new concept. I first introduced a similar form of this  legislation in 2013.   This is not a new idea that requires hypothetical thinking. This  system or a version of it is already being used by our allies around  the world to positive effect. Australia has moved charging decisions  for serious crimes from the chain of command to the director of  military prosecutions, as has Canada, New Zealand, and Ireland. In  France, charging decisions are made by lawyers, not by commanders.  Germany tries military cases in civilian courts with civilian  authorities. In Italy, charging decisions are made by judge advocates,  who are fully independent of the chain of command. The Netherlands  assigns charging decisions to public prosecutors with broad experience  in military cases. Norway uses military prosecuting authority for  criminal offenses by military personnel. The UK moved serious crimes  out of the chain of command in 2009 as part of an effort to provide an  independent and impartial tribunal to the accused. In Israel, charging  decisions are made by judge advocates whose sole commander is the  military advocate general, a general officer.   I will note that the Israeli system is almost identical to the  procedures set forth in our bill. Israel has not seen a decrease in  good order and discipline and, in fact, has seen increased reporting  and faith in their military justice system.   These countries took serious crimes out of the chain of command  because they believed that defendants have a right to civil liberties.  They recognized that servicemembers deserve a trial not led by a  commander, who often has no legal experience or education, but by  trained criminal lawyers.   When they made these changes, they did not see a diminution in  command control or the ability to maintain good order and discipline  within their ranks. In fact, when we stop asking commanders to act as  judge and jury in complex cases, they will have more time to focus on  rebuilding the trust and cohesion among their ranks that we know is  critical to military readiness.   We pride ourselves on having the best military in the world. To  maintain it, we need to do more to make it safe for everyone to serve.  Our allies have already done this. Every day we don't act is a day we  fall further behind on this front.   This is a tried and tested system. It has delivered change for our  allies that the incremental reforms put in place by the Armed Services  Committee have not delivered to our servicemembers. This reform has  been tested; requested by survivors, veterans, and commanders; backed  by experts in military justice; and supported by 65 Senators. There is  no reason to delay a vote on the floor any further.   I ask unanimous consent that, at a time to be determined by the  majority leader in consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate  Armed Services Committee be discharged from further consideration of S.  1520 and the Senate proceed to its consideration; that there be 2 hours  for debate equally divided in the usual form; and that upon the use or  yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the bill with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I would like to actually give some  information to the chairman about what these other nations' leaders  have actually said about this issue.   Major General Blaise Cathcart, advocate general of the Canadian Armed  Forces, wrote:         The 1999 changes to the military justice system were battle       tested in the theater of active operations and, in my view,       were a key contributor to combat effectiveness of the       Canadian armed forces. The current military justice system       contributed substantially to the fielding and sustainment of       a disciplined and efficient force with high morale.    Air Commander Paul Cronan, director general of the Australian Defense  Force Legal Service:         At this point, it's appropriate to reflect on the effect of       the reforms made to the Australian military justice system in       2003 and 2006. These reforms have undoubtedly had a       significant and positive impact on the efficacy,       impartiality, and perceived fairness of Australia's military       justice system. This is a fact confirmed by a number of       subsequent independent reviews of the effectiveness of the       2003 and 2006 reforms. As a result of their independent       review, they concluded that the reforms had been effective,       and that as a result of these reforms, ``The military justice       system is delivering and should continue to deliver       impartial, rigorous, and fair outcomes. Enhanced transparency       and enhanced oversight is substantially more independent from       the chain of command, and is effective in maintaining a high       standard of discipline both domestically and in the       operational theater.''    In the UK, Commander Andrei Spence, Commodore Naval Legal Service,  Royal Navy, UK:         Probably the most pressing question that you need answering       from me, and if I may preempt it slightly at the risk of       being too forthcoming, is what's the effect on command of our       changes? How do they view it? Do they feel disempowered,       disenfranchised? I have to say that the simple answer to that       is no.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter this testimony into  the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                          MJIIPA: Allies Testimony      Maj. Gen. Blaise Cathcart, Advocate General of the Canadian Armed                                   Forces         ``The Canadian armed forces require a robust and fair       military justice system to investigate, prosecute, and       adjudicate allegations of sexual assault. As the       superintendent of the administration of the Canadian military       justice system, I am confident our system meets the       disciplinary needs of the chain of command while addressing       the interests of victims and reflecting the constitutionality       protected Canadian values of fairness, transparency, and the       rule of law . . . The 1999 changes to the military justice       system were battle tested in the theater of active operations       and, in my view were a key contributor to the combat       effectiveness of the Canadian armed forces. The current       military justice system contributed substantially to the       fielding and sustainment of a disciplined and efficient force       with high morale.''     Maj. Gen. Steve Noonan, Deputy Commander, Canadian Joint Operations                                  Command         ``My intent is simply to inform the Panel that as an       operational commander, I'm very comfortable with where we       have evolved to, recognizing the continued key role of the       commanding officer in the system, and the latitude that the       system still provides for us to maintain good order and       discipline, two key elements of operational effectiveness . .       . In terms of the role of the commanding officer in the court       martial process, in sensitive matters, like an alleged sexual       assault, we believe it is in the best interest of the chain       of command, the accused, and the complainant to have an       independent investigator assess the evidence and lay charges,       an independent prosecutor determine whether or not to       proceed, and an independent court martial administrator       convene a court martial. All of these actors, in my view,       strengthen my role in the chain of command as those under my       command can be confident in the real and perceived       independence of the military justice system.''   Air Comm. Paul Cronan, Director General, Australian Defense Force Legal                                  Service         ``At this point, it's appropriate to reflect on the effect       of the reforms made to the Australian military justice system       in 2003 and 2006.
