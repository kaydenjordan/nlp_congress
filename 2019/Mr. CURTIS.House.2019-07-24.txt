 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against the medical  device tax.   Utah has earned a reputation as a thriving hub for innovation in life  sciences, leading the Nation in technology breakthroughs. Each year,  medical device manufacturers in Utah pioneer new, exciting medical  technologies that help patients live longer and more productive lives.   Unfortunately, the culture of collaboration and innovation has been  threatened by the medical device tax, a tax on device manufacturers  that has stalled medical technology investment across the country.   Although Congress has come together on a bipartisan basis time and  time again to delay its implementation, the continuous threat of heavy,  onerous taxation has stifled job growth among medical technology  innovators and has delayed cutting-edge research that could potentially  lead to breakthroughs in patient care and treatment.   As it stands today, this tax will come into effect January 1, 2020.  The impact would be devastating in Utah, where the med tech industry  employs thousands of Utahns and contributes approximately $5 billion to  the local economy. One local company estimated the tax would cost them  over $7 million, money that would otherwise be reinvested into  workforce and technology development.   As we approach this January deadline, I call upon my colleagues to  come together and finally repeal the tax on innovation once and for  all.                         Our Relationship with Israel     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight our critical  relationship with Israel, an alliance not only important to our two  countries, but to the tectonic plates of global geopolitics.   I was pleased to both cosponsor and vote in favor of the United  States-Israel Cooperation Enhancement and Regional Security Act and the  resolution opposing the efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel and  the Global Boycott, Disinvestment, and Sanctions movement targeting  Israel, two important legislative priorities, because I believe  Israel's safety and security is critical to our own safety and  security. More importantly, it is the right thing to do.   I have shared with my colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs  Committee that Israel holds a special place in my heart. As a college  student 40 years ago, I had the opportunity to spend a semester in  Jerusalem and get to know the people and cultures. I developed a unique  appreciation and understanding for the struggles they face on a daily  basis.   As many of us know, the BDS movement exists solely to delegitimize  Israel's very existence, and I am proud of the House of Representatives  coming together on a bipartisan basis with a unified voice that we will  not stand idly by while one of our closest allies is targeted and  vilified. The path to peace between Israel and Palestine will not be  hindered by that kind of blind hatred.   Although this BDS resolution sends a critical message, it falls short  of what is ultimately needed to address the long-term challenges. I am  hopeful that the House will consider stronger legislation with actual  binding policy provisions to help the United States stand with Israel  against BDS.   I am prepared to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to address these issues and those facing our allies.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1365.   As the gentleman has so well already explained, this bill would  authorize the release of certain funds from the Guam Treasury that have  been set aside to pay Guam World War II survivor claims.   Many individuals living on the island during the Japanese occupation  suffered injury and, in some cases, death.   In 2016, Congress enacted the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition  Act to provide for the adjudication of claims and for the payment of  compensation as recommended by the Guam War Claims Review Commission in  their 2004 report. However, legislation and language in the act  unintentionally prevented funds from being provided to World War II  survivors and their heirs. This bill fixes the original act's language  to ensure survivors can receive these claims.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure. I have no additional  speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 434, which would authorize the  Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of the  proposed Emancipation National Historic Trail. This 51-mile trail  follows the migration route taken by newly freed slaves and other  persons of African descent from the major 19th-century seaport town of  Galveston to the burgeoning community of Freedmen's Town in Houston.   Although President Abraham Lincoln officially ended slavery through  the Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, 1862, many slaves were  not freed until much later when news of the proclamation reached their  towns. The last of those slaves lived in the South and were freed on  June 19, 1865, after the Emancipation Proclamation was read in  Galveston.   On January 1, 1866, the Emancipation Proclamation was read at the  African Methodist Episcopal Church on 20th and Broadway, now Reedy  Chapel. A large number of the freed slaves marched from the courthouse  on 21st and Ball Streets to the church, where the director of the  Freedmen's Bureau read the proclamation to the marchers.   The Emancipation Proclamation is still read at the church each year  at the Juneteenth celebration.   Houston, Texas, has rich ties to African American history. The  Emancipation Trail proposed by H.R. 434 ends in Freedmen's Town and  Emancipation Park in Houston. Freedmen's Town is one of the first and  the largest of the post-Civil War Black urban communities in Texas. The  community was established by former Texas slaves who left their  plantations for the safety of Houston.   Emancipation Park is also significant to Houston African American  history. In the years following the emancipation of slaves in Texas,  African American populations across Texas collected money to buy  property dedicated to the Juneteenth celebrations. In honor of their  freedom, they named it Emancipation Park.   This bill is an important reminder of the struggles of African  Americans throughout our Nation's history as we have worked to form a  more perfect union. I support Ms. Jackson Lee's efforts to study the  proposed trail and highlight the important African American history of  Texas.  [[Page H7359]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 759, sponsored by the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Babin), would amend the act of Congress that restored Federal  recognition to the two Tribes in Texas that are the subject of this  bill.   The amendment would override a gaming limitation imposed by Congress  on the Tribes, thereby authorizing the Tribes to operate the casinos  regulated under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 and not under  Texas law.   The question of whether Texas law or the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act  applies to the two Tribes is no longer under serious dispute. Federal  courts have settled the question, and the result of the litigation is  that the two Tribes may not conduct gaming under IGRA unless Congress  enacts a measure to allow them to do so.   This bill enjoys significant local support in the communities around  the reservations of the two Tribes, and the Members who represent the  Tribes strongly support enactment of the measure because the  reservations, where the casinos would be operated, are within their  districts.   However, while the bill enjoys support in Texas, I must note that the  Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, has written letters to the House  leaders and committee leaders in opposition to the legislation. In the  view of the Governor, this bill allows the Tribes to violate the Texas  constitution without the consent of the State of Texas.   It is my hope that such concerns with the measure can be worked out  as the legislative process continues.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr.  Young).   (Mr. YOUNG asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Hurd).    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers on this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
