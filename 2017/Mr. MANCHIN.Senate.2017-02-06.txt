 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise to express my concern with the  nomination of Betsy DeVos as the Secretary of Education.   The State of West Virginia is a State made up of a lot of small  towns. We don't have any what you call large metropolitan areas. We are  an urban rural State. For many communities in West Virginia, our  schools are more than just classrooms, teachers, and textbooks. Our  children in West Virginia learn more in their public school than  reading, writing, and arithmetic. They are the heart of the community  and a home away from home for most of them. They are a safe place to  stay after school where no harm will come to them. They are a place  where nutritional meals are served and health care services are  provided by trusted school nurses.   After meeting with Mrs. DeVos and watching her answer questions at  her confirmation hearing, I have a hard time believing she has the  qualifications to be the Secretary of Education. I believe in local  control of education and also that strong public schools are vital to  our State's future.   Education is local. Each one of our 55 counties is responsible for  the financing of the schools. If the counties do not have the  sufficient funds, we have what we call a school aid formula that  basically offsets that so that every child in West Virginia will get a  quality education.   In my State, charter schools and school vouchers would pull already  limited public funds and resources from the schools, students, and  teachers who need them the most and could be harmed and would probably  be harmed.   There are some towns in West Virginia with only one school--one  school only--or where students have to travel for more than an hour on  a bus to get to the school that has been consolidated. Voucher policies  would be completely useless in these places. There is no place for them  to attend.   In areas where there are a few private schools in my State, a voucher  program would have devastating effects for public school children. The  limited dollars that we do have, if you deviate that money whatsoever,  then basically you are going to have the strain on the public system  that will not be able to pick it up in the rural areas. There is no  other way for us to have the funding we need.   Vouchers will siphon public funding away from our public schools,  causing them to have to cut resources like teachers, advanced  coursework, and preschool programs. They often do not pay the entire  cost of attendance at a private school, making them unusable by low- income students and families.   Vouchers also can strip students with disabilities and their families  of their rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  The most troubling part of that hearing, if you watched it or saw any  parts of it, was the lack of understanding that every child deserves  the opportunity for a quality education no matter what his or her  disabilities may be. That is a responsibility we have as Americans.   With that, if you have never been in a public school setting, you  have never attended a public school yourself and have always been  privately schooled, your children have never attended a public school  and have always either been privately schooled or home schooled, you  have probably never been in a setting where you have seen a disabled  child trying to get the opportunities that other children have, with a  special aide who is working with them. You can say that is a waste of  resources. I guess you could say that if it wasn't your child. If it  wasn't somebody you knew, it would be easy to say that, But just the  empathy you would have--it would be hard for a person to understand  that. I believe that is a compelling reason to make me take pause and  say that I believe we need somebody who has had that diversity, who has  had that real classroom experience.  [[Page S712]]    Another thing--never to be in a PTA meeting where you have problems  with schools. You might have problems with the bus and transportation.  You might have problems with extracurricular activities or lunch  programs or a routine study program, where you can sit down with other  parents and work through these programs. That is something that is hard  for most of us in West Virginia to ever conceive, that you could never  be in that position and never have that experience in life. I believe  communities in West Virginia know our students' needs better than  someone who never attended or worked in the public school system.   Many West Virginians have called and written to me expressing their  concern about Mrs. DeVos. I have a letter I want to read from Diane  from Marion County, my home county. We have hundreds of letters that  have come in. Diane writes:         I am asking you to vote against the confirmation of Mrs.       Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. As an educator with 44       years of experience in public schools, I recognize we have       many issues, but I also know we do much that is right for       children. Educators no longer simply teach core content. We       know that children can only thrive if their social, emotional       and physical needs are met. The whole child is now the focus       of every teacher, and teaching has become a very difficult       but a very rewarding job.        Educators need and DESERVE a Secretary of Education that       knows and understands the tremendous responsibility each of       us has accepted. We do not have the time to get the leader       ``in step'' with us. We need and DESERVE someone who       understands how policies can impact what we are able to do       for our children. . . . We need and DESERVE someone who       understands the value of academic growth versus proficiency.       We need and DESERVE someone who understands how important it       is to send food home in backpacks because our children will       not eat during a weekend or holiday break.    I want to stop there and give you a personal experience. When I was  Governor of the State of West Virginia, I would go around to the  schools. The school would tell me what was going on in the community. I  would always go to the cooks because they really had the pulse of the  school. This was May, and school was getting ready to let out for the  summer. One of the cooks was crying in the kitchen. I couldn't figure  out what was wrong. I went back and tried to console her and talk to  her.   I said: Can you explain why you are so upset? You are just about out  for the summer.   She said: I know these little kids aren't going to eat much this  summer.   She wanted to stay and cook through the summer, have all year so the  kids would have nutrition. That tells you what we are dealing with in  an awful lot of rural settings.         We need and DESERVE a leader who knows that almost every       teacher utilizes his/her own personal funds to buy pencils,       paper, classroom supplies and instructional materials for our       students because the budget for what our children DESERVE is       not given to us. That is the strain we already have on the       system now. If you put any more strain on that by taking       funds away makes it almost impossible.        My request is not politically motivated--my request for you       to vote against Mrs. DeVos is about the teachers I work with       in Marion County and across WV. One of the pillars of a great       civilization is education. Although the American system of       education is not perfect, we are still envied by many       nations.        Education is a hope for children of poverty as well as       those who have economic security. Please encourage President       Trump to seek out a former or current state superintendent of       education or a chancellor of higher education or anyone with       the knowledge to walk in step with us as we make a brighter       future for our children.    During her hearing, Mrs. DeVos demonstrated a lack of knowledge about  the basic issues in public education, including the debate about how  best to measure student progress. She also did not appear to have a  solid understanding about the amount of student loan debt in this  country, which is now the second-largest source of consumer debt in the  United States, surpassed only by home mortgages.   Not only does she lack the institutional knowledge, but she has no  personal or family experience with the student loan system or any  experience running a major loan program like the one she would be in  charge of as Secretary of Education. This leads me to believe that she  would be unable to run the program effectively and efficiently.   What I have said and spoke to other people about--I understand and I  think most of us have been in Washington long enough to understand how  the system works. Even though the person would have the greatest of  intent, the most honorable of intent, wanting to do a balanced job, if  they never had the experience and they are charged with setting up  programs that are supposed to incentivize schools, school districts,  States, those programs are not going to lean to where they have no  knowledge; those programs will go to where they have the most knowledge  and in a direction of the policies they believe in. With that being  said, incentives would go in that direction. When the incentives go in  that direction, it pulls further resources away from a rural public  education system.   At her hearing, Mrs. DeVos failed to recognize that the Individuals  with Disabilities Education Act is a Federal law protecting access for  individuals with disabilities to a decent public education and that she  would be in charge of ensuring that the school implemented the act. No  child should ever be denied access to the same public education because  they suffer from a disability. As both a Governor and a father, I can  never look a parent in the eyes and tell them their child cannot get  the same education as another child simply because they suffer from a  disability and it would be too costly for us to do.    West Virginians need an Education Secretary who has an understanding  of the needs of all children, including those with disabilities, and is  committed to ensuring they receive a quality education. A strong  education is the building block for success for every child and the  foundation for our country's long-term economic strength. We need an  Education Secretary that understands the challenges that students,  teachers, and schools in rural areas face.   Betsy DeVos has spent her career working in the private school  system, not investing in and improving the public school system. Much  of the policies that Mrs. DeVos supports would divert public funds to  private schools--whether it was intentional or not--strip  accountability from these schools, and significantly harm the public  school system in my little State of West Virginia, which is all we  have.   It is difficult to speak--and I try not to make it personal because I  don't believe in the toxic rhetoric that goes on sometimes in this  room, and it shouldn't in this great Senate Chamber of ours and on the  Hill. So I know this is probably a good lady who is well-intentioned.  She just doesn't have that personal experience it takes to grab this  entire country and understand that we are different. States are  different. We depend on it. We can't always go in one direction, and  that is the flexibility. They are saying: Well, we will give you  flexibility. We need the support from Washington to have the  flexibility to make sure the children of West Virginia have the same  opportunities that a child in Pittsburgh, PA, might have in a larger  school district, one in a metropolitan area that could afford--because  you don't have all the travel and everything else that is involved--to  have a charter school.   In my State, even the legislature couldn't. They looked at charter  and voucher systems, and they couldn't find a pathway forward because  of the limited funding and knowing that it would divert. If there is no  more funding going into it, that means you have to cut the pie more.  They were concerned about even going in this direction. My legislature,  in the last 2 years, has flipped completely to a Republican majority in  both the House and Senate. They are all good people, well-intended.  They are looking at all these different avenues, but at the end of the  day, you have to take care of those whom you are responsible for. In  rural West Virginia, that is a child who might have to ride 1 hour just  to go to school. I don't know where you would put a charter school. I  don't know where, with the voucher system, you could send him.   If we have a problem in deficiencies, that is basically the  responsibility of the county and the community. It is the  responsibility of the parents and guardians to be involved. It is a  responsibility for all of us to speak up. I guess what we are going to  end up with is all the children with disabilities or children who  basically do not have the means or a person in their family who  [[Page S713]]  is able to drive them or take them to a special school; they are all  going to be left, so-called, behind.   It is just not who we are in West Virginia. I ask for your  consideration that maybe we can find a Secretary who has the experience  and understanding and has the real-life experience--they might have  attended a public school themselves. I am a product--I am sure you are  a product of public schools. We are a product of the public school  system, probably, more than likely, rural public school systems. We did  pretty well with them. People cared. We had to give a little bit and  make some sacrifices, and we did that. The bottom line was that there  were no options. We made the best out of what we had. These kids aren't  going to have options. The majority of kids in West Virginia or  Oklahoma will not have those options. You better make sure that school  system you have, a public school in a rural setting, is giving that  child every opportunity that he and she can excel. Who knows, maybe one  day they will be sitting in my seat or your seat. I hope so.   With that, I say I must oppose her achieving the Secretary position  that President Trump has nominated her for, with all due respect. I  think I stated my reasons for that. I would hope that people understand  our rural public schools truly need a champion. We need that champion  to really step forward and lift us all up.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.
