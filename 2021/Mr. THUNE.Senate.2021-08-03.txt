 Mr. President, I would associate myself with the remarks  of my colleagues who have just been here acknowledging the heroic work  done by the Capitol Police on January 6. Clearly, they are very  deserving of all the recognition that they have received. What they  went through on that very harrowing day I think is a reminder to all of  us of the importance of the work they do day in and day out and just  the challenge they face defending this Capitol and people who work in  it. I, like my colleagues, am enormously grateful and just want to join  in recognizing that with the award they just received.   I also point out that we are in the midst of a debate here on a bill  that was negotiated in a bipartisan way. It is great to see Republicans  and Democrats working together, talking together, coming up with  solutions, whether we agree with them or not. But the fact that there  are people sitting down across the table from each other and working  through some of these big issues that we face here, one of which,  obviously, in this country is maintaining a strong infrastructure, is  encouraging, and in many ways, it is refreshing to see that happening  here.                      Nomination of Tracy Stone-Manning    Mr. President, it is sort of ironic, too, that in the light of that  spirit of bipartisanship, that we continue to see nominees brought to  the floor who don't reflect that spirit.   The Senate voted last week to bring Tracy Stone-Manning's nomination  to the Senate floor. It is difficult to know exactly what President  Biden was thinking when he decided to nominate Ms. Stone-Manning for  Director of the Bureau of Land Management. Perhaps the administration's  vetting wasn't thorough enough. Otherwise, it is pretty difficult to  understand why the President would nominate an individual with ties to  an ecoterrorist organization--an ecoterrorist organization--to head the  Bureau of Land Management.   That is not all. She was actually involved in a tree-spiking plot  during her time in graduate school, sending a threatening letter to the  U.S. Forest Service at the request of one of the individuals involved  in spiking trees in an Idaho forest.   Tree spiking, as many know, involves hammering spikes into the trunks  of trees to cripple chain saws or the equipment at the sawmill where  the trees are processed. It poses a significant threat to logging and  mill equipment, but most seriously, it poses a threat to human life.   In a famous incident, a worker at a lumber mill in California was  engaged in splitting logs when his saw hit a spiked log and the saw  exploded. I will let a Washington Post story covering the incident  speak for itself, and I quote from the Washington Post, as follows:         He was nearly three feet away when the log hit his saw and       the saw exploded. One half of the blade stuck in the log. The       other half hit Alexander in the head, tearing through his       safety helmet and face shield. His face was slashed from eye       to chin. His teeth were smashed and his jaw was cut in half.        Alexander had never even heard of a sabotage tactic called       tree spiking until he became a victim of ``eco-terrorism.''       Someone who objected to tree cutting had imbedded a  [[Page S5688]]       huge steel spike in the log that violently jammed the saw.    Then the Washington Post continued, and I quote again:         Tree spikes are among the most vicious of the strategies.       While the tree is still in the forest, the spike is driven in       at an angle so the head is hidden in the bark. It can shatter       a chain saw on impact, sending pieces of razor-sharp steel       flying.    It is very hard for me to believe that we are seriously considering  confirming an individual to head the Bureau of Land Management who was  in any way involved with tree spiking.   Furthermore, Ms. Stone-Manning apparently initially refused to  cooperate with the subsequent investigation into the tree-spiking  incident, only coming clean after it became clear that she could face  criminal charges for her role in the incident. Equally troubling is the  less-than-forthright response that she provided to the Senate on her  nominee questionnaire about whether or not she had ever been  investigated by a law enforcement organization.    Ms. Stone-Manning's involvement in the tree-spiking incident is not  the only reason to be concerned that she has extremist views. As a  graduate student, she also argued for population control, in one  instance referring to a child as an ``environmental hazard.'' Last  year, she took advantage of Twitter to promote an article her husband  wrote in which he expressed satisfaction at the idea of seeing homes  people have built in forests burn in fires.   President Obama's first Bureau of Land Management Director withdrew  his support for Ms. Stone-Manning's nomination over her involvement in  the tree-spiking plot. A Deputy Director at the BLM under President  Obama also expressed his concern over the nomination, noting:         Much of the focus seems to be whether this is a Democrat or       Republican thing, but the lens I look at this through is as a       38-year career person in both agencies. . . . [Y]ou need the       career employees to implement your agenda successfully across       the West. Your leader has got to be respected by career       employees and across the landscape, in both blue and red       states.    His point is well-taken. How are BLM employees and the many Americans  who regularly interact with the Bureau of Land Management going to feel  about working with Ms. Stone-Manning? Our public lands are used for a  variety of purposes, including recreation, livestock grazing, and  timber harvesting. What kind of attitude should we expect from Ms.  Stone-Manning to display toward timber harvesting? Is this really the  best President Biden can do when it comes to the Director of the Bureau  of Land Management?   As 75 House Republicans said in a letter to President Biden urging  him to withdraw the nomination, ``There is no doubt that someone with  this history of extreme, violent views should not be in a position of  authority at an agency responsible for managing 245 million acres of  federal lands and 700 million acres of mineral estate.''   I wish I could say that Ms. Stone-Manning's nomination is an  aberration, but, in fact, President Biden has nominated a number of  candidates with extremist views for various offices.   Last week, we voted on his nominee to head U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services, a nominee who failed to receive even a single  bipartisan vote in committee, due in part to her refusal to say she  won't completely bypass Congress when fashioning policies to deal with  those who are in the United States unlawfully.   Then there is the President's nominee for head of the Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, David Chipman, whose main  interest seems to be targeting law-abiding gun owners and who has  communicated a clear disdain for gun owners in public remarks. This  nominee was also apparently the subject of a complaint for making  racist remarks while working at ATF.   Then there are the multiple President Biden nominees now serving in  the Department of Justice who have publicly expressed their support for  defunding the police. That is right--President Biden filled key posts  at the Justice Department, the Department charged with enforcing the  law and prosecuting criminals, with individuals who have gone on the  record with their support for defunding the police.   I suppose it is no real surprise that President Biden nominated an  individual to the Bureau of Land Management who once referred to a  child as an ``environmental hazard'' when you consider who he nominated  to head up the Department of Health and Human Services.   HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra's rabidly pro-abortion views put him far  to the left of the majority of Americans. Polls consistently show that  a strong majority of Americans believe that there should be at least  some restrictions on abortion. President Biden's HHS Secretary doesn't  seem to support any restriction on abortion, and if he does, I would  sure like to hear about them. During his time in the House of  Representatives, Secretary Becerra repeatedly voted against banning  partial-birth abortion, an abortion procedure so heinous that I think  most Americans would rightfully shrink from seeing it performed on an  animal, let alone a human being.   As I said, given that, I suppose it is not hard to believe that  President Biden nominated an individual to the Bureau of Land  Management who once described a child as an ``environmental hazard.''   President Biden tends to present himself as a moderate and someone  who will bring people together. He said in his inaugural address: ``I  pledge this to you: I will be a President for all Americans.'' In  practice, however, too often he has seemed to be a President for the  far-left wing of the Democratic Party.   I hope that my Democratic colleagues will think twice before  confirming Ms. Stone-Manning as head of the Bureau of Land Management.  Involvement with ecoterrorism should be a disqualifying factor for  heading up this Agency.   I yield the floor.
