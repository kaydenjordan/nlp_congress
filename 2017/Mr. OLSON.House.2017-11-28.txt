 Mr. Speaker, it first happened in 1975, then 1976, 1977,  and 1992. The fifth time was November 18, 2017, 2 weeks ago.   The Needville Lady Blue Jays won the Texas State volleyball  championship. One word describes our Blue Jays, and that word is  ``domination.'' They swept the playoffs, losing 1 out of 22 sets.   All of Texas 22 is proud of our coaches--Schultz, Bradford, and  Smyers--and the stars who took us on the drive for five: Janssen,  Sydney, Kailey, Peyton, Hayden, MacKenzie, Kaitlyn, Samantha, Anna,  Baley, Madison, Evan, Treasure, and Maddy.   Mr. Speaker, get ready, number six is coming in 2018.   Go Blue Jays.                            ____________________
