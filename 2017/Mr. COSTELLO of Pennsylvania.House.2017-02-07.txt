 Mr. Speaker, last Congress, Members on  both sides of the aisle came together to restore education  decisionmaking authority to where it should be--at the State and local  level--devolving it from overreach by the Federal Government through  the Every Student Succeeds Act. It was a bipartisan accomplishment that  I speak very proudly of in my congressional district, as I know many  Members do in their congressional districts.   However, certain regulations were issued by the Department of  Education last year that threaten regulatory overreach, including  problematic provisions requiring States to issue uniform standards to  determine a teacher's level of effectiveness or ineffectiveness. Put  quite simply, the rule, as it was issued late in November, is not  consistent with the law that we passed that we were all so proud of. In  fact, it is necessary to use the CRA to override this rule in order to  maintain the integrity of the ESSA, which we are all very proud of  passing, to restore local control, and that goes from student testing  to curriculum, to teacher evaluation. What we have here, as written,  are regulations which threaten an overemphasis on students'  standardized testing scores when evaluating the quality of a teacher.   H.J. Res. 57 would override regulations because they are not  consistent with the law that we just passed. H.J. Res. 57 would  preserve the bipartisan accomplishments achieved in the ESSA by  allowing States to continue tailoring the ESSA to meet local needs  without overreach and without mandates from the Federal Government. Put  simply, what we are seeking to do here is to prevent the Federal  Government from once again nudging its nose into local and State  control over teacher evaluations, which was one of the main objectives  of the ESSA in the first instance.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Rokita for his leadership.
