 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, first, I hope all of my colleagues had a  good and fine Thanksgiving. We all know that across the country we  celebrated a Thanksgiving--all of us, every American--unlike any in  recent memory. Too many loved ones spent this holiday alone, unable to  join with loved ones out of concern for their safety. As painful as it  is to refrain from seeing family and friends, these are tough choices  that we sometimes have to make, and we need to maintain our resolve  more than ever.   While the hope of a vaccine shimmers on the near horizon, we are  living through the worst stretch of the pandemic right now. Last  Friday, for the first time, over 200,000 new cases of COVID were  reported in a single day. The United States is averaging over 1 million  new cases a week. Some 20 percent of all patients now hospitalized in  the United States have COVID-19.   The worst and most unalterable part of this pandemic, of course, are  the deaths. Since November 10, America has been losing more than 1,000  precious lives a day. On one day, November 24, we lost more than 2,000.  The national death toll stands at a very sad 270,000 American souls.  Families all across the country are experiencing the unthinkable,  unbearable losses of their loved ones.   As a compassionate nation, we cannot and must not ignore or become  inured to this terrible reality. We must not avert our gaze. We must  acknowledge the lives we are losing. We must honor the grief of the  children, parents, spouses, siblings, and friends of the increasing  number of Americans who are dying from COVID-19 every single day. We  must redouble our efforts to flatten the curve and protect each other  by wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and complying with the  guidance of health officials.   As this Chamber gavels back into session, we must redouble our  efforts before the end of the calendar year. As the pandemic increases  in severity, so does the economic pain felt by countless working  families and small business owners. In a few short weeks, several  provisions of the CARES Act--including student loan forbearance,  eviction moratoriums, and jobless benefits for millions of workers-- will expire.   So first and foremost on the Senate's to-do list is COVID relief.  Both sides should come together and negotiate a COVID relief bill in a  bipartisan way that meets the needs of our businesses, our schools, our  healthcare systems, our workers, and our families.   At the start of this crisis, Democrats and Republicans came together  in a flurry of negotiations--I was thickly involved with them with  Secretary Mnuchin--to pass a bill that truly met the moment. Now we are  about to reach a new, more difficult stage of the crisis. We need to  renew that spirit, that urgency, that bipartisanship.   Leader McConnell's view, stated just a few minutes ago, seems to be  that the only things that should be in this bill are things Republicans  approve of, even if the needs of the country--the desperate needs of  the country--are beyond the small list that Republicans might support.  That is not real compromise.   We need to come together. Both sides must give. We have a Democratic  House, and in the Senate there is a need for Democratic votes to pass  any bill, so we need a true bipartisan bill--not ``this is our bill;  take it or leave it''--that can bring us together and solve the  desperate needs of the American people, which we all very much want to  solve.   Mr. President, the second item on our to-do list is Federal  appropriations, which expire in 2 weeks. As we speak, appropriators  from both sides in the relevant committees continue their negotiations.  It is my hope and expectation that we can come to an agreement very  soon.   Mr. President, third and finally, Congress should pass the annual  Defense bill. As our country prepares for a peaceful transfer of power,  the continuity of our national security is paramount. For nearly 60  years, Congress has never failed to pass the annual Defense bill, but  this year it seems the normally uncontroversial legislation has hit a  snag. President Trump has threatened to veto the bill over a provision  that would rename military bases and installations named after  Confederate military leaders, men who would rend this country in half  to preserve the institution of slavery, men who literally fought  against this Nation's military in pursuit of an ignoble cause.   For that--a provision to rename our military bases to honor actual  heroes rather than traitors to our country--President Trump is  threatening to veto a pay raise for our troops. And it seems that  Republicans in Congress are slow-walking the bill in hopes of finding  some way to appease the outgoing President rather than just passing the  bill over his rather ridiculous objection.   The provision to rename these installations was included in both the  House- and Senate-passed versions of the bill, and the larger bill  passed both Chambers with broad bipartisan support. There is no reason  to further delay a pay raise for our living military heroes because  President Trump wants to honor dead Confederate traitors.    The other provision that is at risk, shockingly, from our Republican  colleagues is an amendment to assist veterans who have long suffered  from their exposure to Agent Orange in the Vietnam war. The amendment  passed this Chamber with 94 votes in favor, a rare and near-unanimous  demonstration of bipartisan support.   The Trump administration's own VA advisory panel recommended this  policy to improve healthcare for these veterans, but for some reason,  our Republican counterparts are now reportedly trying to strip it from  any final agreement. It would be an affront to a group of ailing  veterans, who have suffered enough already, to strip a provision that  would help provide them adequate healthcare.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on President-Elect Biden's nominees,  as President-Elect Biden prepares to assume office on January 20, he is  beginning to announce a slate of qualified, experienced public servants  whom he intends to nominate to his Cabinet or other key administrative  positions.   This morning, the President-elect announced that he has assembled his  core economic team, led by another Brooklyn native, Janet Yellen, who  would be the first woman to ever hold the title of Treasury Secretary.  The President-elect's economic team clearly has the experience, the  knowledge, and the prowess to meet the seriousness of this moment. More  than that, they understand the needs of all Americans because they  represent all different kinds of Americans.   They will get to work not just on rebuilding our economy but striving  to  [[Page S7100]]  provide greater and more equitable prosperity to future generations.   Alongside the President-elect's deeply experienced national security  team and his soon-to-be-announced health team, his economic team will  ensure that the incoming Biden-Harris administration will hit the  ground running.   Everyone knows that the Senate plays a pivotal role in confirming a  new President's Cabinet. In the midst of this once-in-a-century crisis,  it is imperative that the next administration can count on the Senate  to confirm its Cabinet without delay, so hearings on President-Elect  Biden's nominees should begin in January, immediately after the Georgia  runoff elections.   Let me say that again. The Senate should begin hearings on President- Elect Biden's nominees in January, immediately after the Georgia Senate  elections, so that key Cabinet officials can be confirmed on January 20  and soon thereafter, which is traditional for a new President. Senate  committees held hearings for President Obama's nominees and President  Trump's in early January, before the inauguration. Majority and  minority staff should begin preparation for those hearings as  President-Elect Biden names his Cabinet.   Now, President-Elect Biden's slate of intended nominees provides a  stark contrast to the caliber of nominees advanced by the current Trump  administration over the past 4 years. The early days of the Trump  Presidency were defined by high-level appointments of individuals who  were manifestly unqualified, plagued by ethical complaints, or swimming  in conflicts of interest--sometimes all three.   At the time, Republicans in the Senate lined up to confirm President  Trump's appointments, arguing that a President deserves his Cabinet and  broad deference on his nominees. I would hope the same deference would  be extended to President-Elect Biden's nominees, especially considering  the obvious gulf in quality, experience, and ethics.   Already, however, the Republicans are twisting themselves into  pretzels to explain their reflexive opposition to these outstanding  selections. Neera Tanden, who would be the first woman of color to ever  run the OMB, the Office of Management and Budget, is so eminently  qualified that some on the Republican side--grasping at straws--have  taken issue with comments made on Twitter criticizing the policy  positions of Republicans in Congress.   Honestly, the hypocrisy is astounding. If Republicans are concerned  about criticism on Twitter, their complaints are better directed at  President Trump, who has made a hobby out of denigrating Republican  Senators on Twitter.   I fully expect to see some crocodile tears spilled on the other side  of the aisle over the President-elect's Cabinet nominees, but it will  be very tough to take those crocodile tears seriously. Our Republican  colleagues are on the record supporting some of the least qualified,  most unethical, and downright sycophantic Federal nominees in recent  memory   Many defended the conduct of previous OMB Director Russell Vought,  who allowed foreign aid to be held up for political reasons, resulting  in the President's impeachment. Right now, Republicans in Congress are  looking the other way while President Trump pardons a man who pled  guilty to the FBI.   So, again, it will be impossible to take these overblown complaints  over President-Elect Biden's nominees very seriously. Given the urgent  need to address COVID-19 and its economic fallout, the Senate should  follow precedent and promptly hold hearings on President-Elect Biden's  nominees in January, immediately after the Georgia elections, before  inauguration.   The American people cannot afford to wait to have its government  working at full force to keep them safe, defeat the virus, and get our  economy back on track.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, before I yielded the floor, I talked  about Agent Orange, maybe before he had come on the floor, and it would  be outrageous--the Senator from Montana has done great work helping our  veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange get the healthcare they need  and deserve, and I hope that our Republican colleagues will relent and  allow those provisions to stay in the NDAA bill, and I compliment him  on the work he has done.   I yield the floor.
