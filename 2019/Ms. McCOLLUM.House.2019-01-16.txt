 Madam Chair, I rise in support of this funding package,  and I am pleased that, within the Interior, Environment, and Related  Agencies Subcommittee's jurisdiction, the bill provides more than $2  billion for recovery from devastating natural disasters.   This includes $849 million to rebuild drinking water and wastewater  systems to a state of resiliency against future storms, $50 million for  coastal resiliency projects to reduce ecosystem and community  vulnerability to help with sea level rise and with the flooding and  erosion caused by storms.   The bill provides funds to repair Federal facilities that were  destroyed or damaged, such as the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, funds  for historic preservation grants to repair culturally significant sites  and properties, and funds to clean up hazardous and solid waste sites.   A critical provision in this bill provides $720 million to fully  repay the U.S. Forest Service for funds it was forced to borrow in the  last fiscal year to cover the cost of wildland fire suppression. An  additional $103 million will help the Forest Service to address damage  to national forests and treat hazardous fuel loads.   This emergency funding is in sharp contrast to the President's  threats to block disaster response funds to Californians who are  struggling to restore their lives and to return to their homes after  the devastating fires of last year.   I have just heard from a friend that he is being evacuated now  because of potential mudslides because of the burnt area in the Malibu  part of California.   Americans in all of our States and territories deserve Federal  support so they can recover from natural disasters, and our government  agencies have to be open in order to ensure the delivery of these  important emergency funds.   Democrats are proud to bring this bill to the floor to help our  communities who have suffered from these natural disasters and want to  begin to rebuild and heal in their lives.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for the time.   As I pointed out earlier, the supplemental includes $824 million to  the U.S. Forest Service to help California and those who have been  impacted by wildfires and Hurricanes Florence and Michael to recover.   While the funding includes $27 million for hazardous fuel, I support  the gentleman's proposal to increase this amount because we know we  have a lot of work to do in fuel reduction. I would like to point out  to the gentleman, I also support the continuing resolution portion of  this legislation in front of us today because we need to reopen the  Forest Service so we can use these funds.                                time  1600     Madam Chair, a point of parliamentary inquiry.    Madam Chair, could I ask unanimous consent to rise in  opposition even though I am not opposed to the bill, claim 5 minutes,  and then the gentleman could have time to close?    Madam Chair, I leave that to the gentleman. He has 1  minute remaining, Madam Chair, if he would like to use it now and then  I will use my own time.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition, even though I am not opposed to the amendment.    Madam Chair, the supplemental appropriation that we are  discussing today includes $8.24 million for the U.S. Forestry Service  to work on disaster relief, and it includes $2 million for State and  private forestry. As I have told the Members here, I totally support  the gentleman's proposal to increase the amount, and they have done an  excellent job describing why it is so important.   As wildfires continue to increase in both frequency and intensity as  a result of climate change, we need to do more to prevent them. The  State private forestry programs bring together States, Tribes, and  local governments and gives them the tools they need to protect  communities and our environment from wildfires. I have seen firsthand.  I have spoken to people who have used these programs, and it is money  well spent to prevent wildland fires.                                time  1630    However, in order for the Forestry Service to be able to use these  critical funds, I will be supporting the CR portion of this bill to  reopen the government, because without this continuing resolution the  agencies won't be able to receive funds to get to work immediately.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
