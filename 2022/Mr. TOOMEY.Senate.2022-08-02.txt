 Mr. President, I rise to discuss the PACT Act, on which  we will be voting for several amendments and then we will have a final  passage vote later this evening.   This could have been resolved months ago, as I suggested it would be,  but finally we have gotten to the point where we can resolve this.   And I have to say we are witnessing a very old Washington trick  playing out on what might be an unprecedented scale.   And what is that trick?   That trick is you take a very sympathetic group of Americans--it  could be children with rare diseases; it could be victims of crime; it  could be veterans who are suffering an illness after having been  exposed to toxic chemicals while serving our country--you take this  sympathetic group, craft legislation to address their problems, and  then sneak in something that is completely unrelated that could never  pass on its own and dare anyone to stand up and say a word about that  because we all know, if you raise a concern about the unrelated  provision, people in this Chamber and outside will stand up and make up  all kinds of fabrications and falsehoods.   They will enlist some pseudo celebrities, they will get their  accomplices  [[Page S3847]]  in the media to propagate the dishonest charge that: Oh, those mean  Republicans don't care about those sympathetic figures. That is what  has been going on here for some time now.   It is in the PACT Act. We have an exceptionally sympathetic,  overwhelmingly popular group of Americans--and rightly so. They are  veterans who put on the uniform, served overseas, took huge risks, and  along the way were exposed to toxic chemicals that have resulted or  could have resulted in their illness.   There is overwhelming consensus to provide the resources to at least  cover their healthcare costs and provide them with disability benefits  because of their service to our country.   In fact, the cause is so popular that the $280 billion of new  spending contemplated by this bill is completely unoffset. It is  mandatory spending. It is like OCO, and there is nobody I know of-- certainly not myself--who is asking that it be offset. It is like, this  is what we need to do and people acknowledge this and we agree on it.   But that is not where the PACT Act ends. That is not all there is to  the PACT Act. It also includes the old Washington trick. And the form  the trick takes in this bill is a complicated change to budget rules  that allows current spending--by which I mean spending that is going to  happen under existing law unrelated to the PACT Act, that spending that  is routine already--to be basically shifted off the books, so to speak,  in such a way that is designed to make it easier for future Congresses  to spend a whole lot more money on completely unrelated programs.   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this clever little  device will result--could result in up to maybe even a little more than  $400 billion of additional spending over the next 10 years; again,  totally outside of the veteran space, totally outside.   Now, the chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs is my friend  Jon Tester, a guy I know and like. He pretty much essentially  acknowledged that yes, the legislation could be exploited this way. But  he said: But you should have faith. You should have confidence and  trust in your colleagues, future Congresses, that we wouldn't do a  thing like that.   Seriously? I am supposed to trust this and future Congresses not to  go on a spending spree--seriously? That is unbelievable. And, by the  way, if I should have that trust, then why did they design this feature  precisely so they could go on a spending spree?   This isn't the first time this has happened. A good example is the  CHIPS program. That is an acronym for the Children's Health Insurance  Program. It was created in 1997. It is a very popular program. It is  mandatory spending, completely unoffset. It is a very good cause. That  is why.   In 2009, Congress started providing more funding than was necessary  to fund the program--much more than would actually be spent on the kids  that qualified for it. Congress did this very knowingly and started  doing it annually. Why, you might ask, would Congress provide more  funding than the program requires? Because the amount by which this  funding exceeds what gets spent can be spent on other programs.   It is a trick. It is a budget trick that allows for more spending in  unrelated areas.   The Crime Victims Fund has a very similar dynamic. Criminal penalties  go into a fund that is supposed to go to victims of crime, but they set  up the rules so that, in any given year, if we spend less than the  amount of money that went into this fund, they can pretend those are  budget savings and then spend the money somewhere else.   So my point is that we have seen this before. It is being played out  again, but I don't think we have ever seen it on this scale--$400  billion over the next 10 years.   We have budgets and we have budget rules for reasons. They are meant  to try to provide some guardrails on spending. Now, Congress can always  disregard them. Any Congress can always disregard budget rules for a  good reason or a bad reason. If there are 60 votes, the budget rules  can be waived.   By the way, there are five budget points of order against this bill.  I am not aware that anyone has raised a single one. We are not going to  have a vote on any one, and that is because people say the new spending  for these veterans is so important that we are going to waive the  budget rules that this bill breaks, and I think that is the right thing  to do. But to think that the appropriations process is going to be a  sufficient check on the abuse of this gimmick that is in this bill is  very unrealistic.   You know, the Senate can always vote against a future spending bill  that would take advantage of this. All right, so this is one of the  arguments we have heard: Well, yes, you can always vote against this if  Congress were to exploit this gimmick and start spending these $400  billion.   But here is the problem. In a given year, that would be about $40  billion, right? Four hundred over 10 years means $400 billion of this  extraneous spending annually. Except, as the Presiding Officer knows  very well, we typically fund the government with one giant bill--an  omnibus spending bill that is over 1,000 pages long, usually. Nowadays,  it is about $1.7 trillion. And $40 billion is a lot of money, but it is  3 percent of $1.7 trillion.   So if you object to exploiting this budget gimmick and exploiting  this loophole and spending $40 billion that shouldn't be spent on who  knows what, you can vote against the whole bill and that is your only  option--vote to shut down the government and not spend any money at  all. That is no disciplinary mechanism. That is no mechanism for proper  oversight.   Now, you may hear that my amendment caps spending for veterans, and I  want to be very clear about this. The chairman of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee said my amendment would place a limit on the amount of  funding Congress could provide to cover care and benefits to veterans  made available by this legislation and could create a scenario where  the VA runs out of funding.   That is completely, 100-percent factually false. It is very hard to  believe that the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee is not  aware of that.   But here is the truth. The fund that is created in the PACT Act--the  fund that the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee is referring  to, the fund where we cap the money that goes into this fund--that fund  does not have the meaning that any normal person thinks a fund has.  This is not a pool of money. This is not an account at a bank from  which doctors are paid. This is nothing more than an accounting device.  This is just a mechanism that the Federal Government uses to classify  spending as mandatory instead of discretionary. That is all it is.   And there are no limits whatsoever. This is an important point. My  amendment has no limits whatsoever on the amount that Congress can  appropriate in any given year or in the cumulative total of years for  veterans' healthcare or other benefits. My amendment doesn't affect  that in any way whatsoever. Congress can appropriate a trillion dollars  in a given year.   What my amendment would do is it would limit the amount of that  appropriation that could be considered mandatory spending as opposed to  discretionary spending. That is it. My amendment is 100 percent about  how the government designates the spending. It has nothing to do with  how much is actually spent.   Now, what matters to a veteran who is ill because of a toxic  exposure? I think what matters to him is that the money is there to  cover what he needs. That is what he should be concerned about, and  that will be there.   What I am trying to limit is the extent to which they can use a  budgetary gimmick to reclassify spending so that they can go on an  unrelated spending binge.   So what would happen if the cost for actually caring for veterans in  a given year is bigger than the cap we set? Appropriators simply  appropriate the amount that is needed. My cap has no bearing on how  much appropriators can spend. It only limits how much gets treated as  mandatory spending.   If my amendment is adopted, spending on veterans' benefits would not  be reduced by one penny. Spending on veterans' families would not be  reduced by one penny. The $280 billion in new spending as a result of  the PACT Act would not be reduced by a penny. It would not be offset.   We have no attempt to make any change to any of that. If anyone is  suggesting that my amendment would, in  [[Page S3848]]  any way, reduce care for veterans or require rationing of care, they  are either completely misinformed or they are being dishonest.   So why does this matter? Why did the authors of the bill want to  create this device that shifts this spending that is going to happen  anyway from discretionary spending to mandatory spending? Because we  have a cap on total discretionary spending, and for any spending that  gets pulled out of the discretionary spending category and goes to a  different category, that creates a hole under the cap. Congress will  fill that hole with spending on who knows what. That is the way this is  going to play out. That is what is going to happen.   Now, some people have suggested that my amendment, if adopted, would  kill the bill. Now, think about that. An amendment that does not cut  spending on veterans' care or veterans' benefits by one dime but does  make it harder for Congress to go on an unrelated $400 billion spending  spree--that is going to kill the bill? Really?   Well, if that would kill the bill, then it speaks volumes about what  is really important to the people who would vote no as a result of  making it clear that unrelated spending is more important than the  spending on the veterans--if my amendment would kill the bill.   So I don't think passage of my amendment would kill the bill. It  would frustrate the efforts of those who want to have the skids greased  for a massive spending binge. It would definitely do that. But it  wouldn't cut one dime of spending for veterans' care, and I think in  the end the bill would pass.   I have this very simple solution. It allows us to fully fund our  vets. It eliminates this budgetary gimmick that greases the skids for  unrelated spending. And I would just urge my colleagues that hiding  unrelated spending behind the sacrifice our veterans have made is no  way to go. I would urge support for my amendment.                   Motion to Concur With Amendment No. 5186    Mr. President, I move to concur in the House message to accompany S.  3373 with amendment No. 5186.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed  with.    Mr. President, a lot has been said about my amendment  that is completely false, mostly outside of this Chamber, so let me say  very simply what it does. My amendment does only one thing, it would  maintain the current policy of classifying currently authorized VA  healthcare spending as discretionary spending, rather than change that  classification going forward to mandatory spending as the PACT Act  would allow.   My amendment does not cap any spending. It does not reduce veteran  spending. It does not change the classification of PACT Act spending.   But by preventing this change in classification, we would prevent a  budget gimmick that is designed to grease the skids for up to $400  billion in totally unrelated spending.   So let's pass the PACT Act, but let's pass it without enabling an  unrelated $400 billion spending spree. Support my amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
