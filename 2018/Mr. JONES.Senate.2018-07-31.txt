 Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to  remember and honor Maryon Pittman Allen, a former Member of this body,  who passed away on July 23, 2018. Maryon Allen was one of only two  women ever to represent the State of Alabama in the U.S. Senate.   Born in Meridian, MS, in 1925, Maryon Pittman and her family moved to  Alabama in 1926 in order for her father to open a Caterpillar tractor  franchise. She grew up in Birmingham, attending Avondale School and  Ramsay High School, before matriculating at the University of Alabama,  where she planned to major in journalism. While in college, she met and  married her first husband, attorney Joshua Mullins, and they had three  children. After the marriage ended in divorce in 1959, Maryon entered  the workforce, first as a secretary, then in insurance sales, and  eventually putting her journalism training to use writing for the  ``Shades Valley Sun'' as society editor.   In the 1960s, Maryon joined the Birmingham News as women's editor.  Two weeks into her new job, she drove to Montgomery to interview then- Lieutenant Governor James B. Allen in  [[Page S5513]]  connection with a speech he had delivered to the Alabama Federation of  Women's Clubs. She and Allen, a widower with two children, were  instantly attracted to each other and married in August 1964, after a  whirlwind, 4-month courtship.   When Alabama Senator Lister Hill chose not to seek reelection to the  U.S. Senate in 1968, Jim Allen sought and won election to his seat. In  January of 1969, Maryon and Jim moved to Washington, D.C., as Jim began  his term in the 91st Congress. From Washington, Maryon began writing a  new column called Reflections of a News Hen, which was regionally  syndicated in several southeastern newspapers and won Alabama Press  Association awards for ``best original column.'' She also served as  chair of the Blair House Fine Arts Commission in 1974, appointed to the  position by President Gerald Ford.   Jim Allen died suddenly, of a heart attack, on June 1, 1978. One week  later, Alabama Governor George Wallace appointed Maryon to fill her  husband's seat until the special election, which was scheduled to take  place in November. Mrs. Allen pledged to ``continue to espouse the  great principles of government to which Senator Allen dedicated his  life. When I cast a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate, it will  reflect the philosophy he expressed so eloquently and strongly during  his almost 10 years of service.''   Mrs. Allen served 5 months in the Senate. She was the first woman to  serve on the Judiciary Committee, and she presided over the Senate on  several occasions, but even as a Senator, she stayed true to her roots  and continued writing her ``Reflections'' newspaper column.   Shortly after Mrs. Allen left the Senate in 1978, Washington Post  editor-in-chief Ben Bradlee invited her to write a weekly social column  about life and events inside the Beltway. Until 1981, Allen remained in  Washington, writing ``Maryon Allen's Washington'' and entertaining Post  readers with her trademark wit and style. Eventually, however, Maryon  returned to Birmingham to be near her family and friends. Back home,  she began yet another career as one of America's finest restorers of  antique wedding dresses, christening gowns, and other heirloom  textiles, using skills she had learned from her grandmother. Allen and  her extraordinary artistry were featured in several national magazines.   My wife, Louise, and I wish to extend our gratitude for Mrs. Allen's  service, as well as our condolences for her loss to her children Joshua  Sanford Mullins, III, and his wife Eugenia; John Pittman Mullins and  his wife, Alison; and Maryon Allen Allen, widow of the late Stephen  Allen; to her stepson James Browning Allen, Jr., and to her six  grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.   Maryon Allen was independent, intelligent, and charismatic, with a  self-described ``penchant for being irreverent.'' She faced life's  challenges fearlessly, refusing to be defeated by adversity. She can  now rest in peace after a life well-lived.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is my honor today to celebrate  the life and service of Judge Helen Shores Lee of Alabama, who died on  July 2, 2018. The daughter of respected civil rights attorney Arthur  Shores, Judge Lee was a civil rights advocate and pioneer in her own  right. She was the first African-American woman to serve as judge in  the civil division of the circuit court in Jefferson County, AL, and  she devoted her life to making sure that all people are cared for,  concerned about, and spoken up for.   Helen Shores Lee lived a life of exemplary courage, dedication, and  generosity, and I am fortunate to have known her. I am even more  blessed to have called her my friend.   Helen developed courage as a young girl growing up in the Smithfield  area of Birmingham. The Shores family home was on ``Dynamite Hill,'' so  named because of the dozens of unsolved bombings there during the civil  rights struggles that convulsed the Birmingham area from the late 1940s  to the 1960s. In the summer of 1963, Helen's own home was bombed twice,  just weeks before a bomb exploded at the 16th Street Baptist Church  nearby, killing four little girls who were her friends. Two years  later, another bomb was discovered in the Shores' yard, but  fortunately, that one was defused before it exploded. Despite the  damage they caused and the terror they were intended to inspire, those  bombs did not deter or displace the Shores family, nor did they  dissuade the rest of the African-American community from the patient  pursuit of equality.   Though her father was small in stature, Judge Lee described him as a  ``giant in life.'' Helen used to tell a story about one time, when a  car full of White men was driving around her neighborhood pointing a  gun out the window. Frustrated and frightened, young Helen ran in the  house and got a gun of her own. Her father followed her out onto the  porch, took the gun from her hands, and taught her the importance of  fighting ``the right way.''   Judge Lee's courage was bolstered by her faith, which she also  learned from her father. Recalling the threats and the bombings, Judge  Lee said, ``It was our Christian faith that got us through this ordeal.  My dad prayed constantly. We witnessed that.'' The Shores home was  directly across the street from the First Congregational Church, where  Shores was Sunday school superintendent, deacon, and trustee. Even at  the end of his life, his daughters pushed him across Center Street in a  wheelchair so he could get to church. Arthur Shores died in that house  on Dynamite Hill, now an unofficial landmark of the civil rights  movement.   With her sister Barbara and author Denise George, in 2012, Judge Lee  published ``The Gentle Giant of Dynamite Hill,'' a biography of her  father that tells how Shores, a former high school principal, became  one of the Nation's top civil rights attorneys. Shores handled a number  of high-profile cases, including representing Autherine Lucy, the first  Black student to attend the University of Alabama. Shores also  represented the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., when he was indicted  for leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott.   From 1971 to 1987, Judge Lee worked as a clinical psychologist,  serving her patients and the community with dedication and compassion.  In 1986, she dedicated herself to a new kind of service, becoming a  magistrate for the city of Birmingham. After graduating from the  Cumberland School of Law in 1987, she joined her father to form Shores  & Lee, where she practiced law until she was appointed circuit judge of  the Tenth Judicial Court of Alabama and assumed the bench in January  2003. She was twice reelected by the citizens of Jefferson County.  Although she retired in 2015, Judge Lee continued to give generously of  her time and talent to a number of organizations.   Judge Lee's commitment to her community included serving as a member  of the Alabama State Ethics Commission from 1996-2000 and as its  chairwoman from 1999-2000. She also chaired the community advisory  board of the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Minority Health and  Research Center, she was a trustee for Leadership Birmingham, she was a  member of the Cumberland School of Law advisory board, and she served  on the boards of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama, Campfire, Inc., the  Civil Rights Institute, the Young Women's Christian Association, and  many more. In 2013, the Young Women's Christian Association of Central  Alabama honored Judge Lee with the Jeana P.  [[Page S5515]]  Hosch Woman of Valor award for her decades of commitment to civil  rights and community service. Samford University named her Alumnus of  the Year in 2014.   In addition, Judge Lee was often called on to speak about her  experiences in the civil rights movement and the role her family played  in moving the country to a better place. I was fortunate to share the  stage with her many times and always marveled at how she would share  her story with grace, compassion, and a sense of justice, not hatred or  bitterness.   My wife, Louise, and I extend our sincere and deep condolences to  Judge Lee's family. The city of Birmingham and the State of Alabama are  better for her having lived and served there and so am I.                            ____________________
