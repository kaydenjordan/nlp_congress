 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the Sergeant  Andrew Brucher Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 5419, located in Kauneonga  Lake, New York, which will soon be celebrating its 50th anniversary.   At the anniversary dinner, the post will honor two very special  people: Mrs. Mabel Brucher, a Gold Star mother whose son Post 5499 is  named for; and Mr. Raymond Jankowski, a veteran of the Second World War  and founding charter member of Post 5499.   Honoring those who have served our Nation should be a top priority  for all Americans, and the VFW is an essential organization that  fosters camaraderie among American veterans and advocates on their  behalf.   Congratulations to Post 5499. I look forward to honoring this  important milestone with members of the post this weekend.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Simpson for yielding the  time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3219, the Defense,  Military Construction, Veteran Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Energy  and Water Development National Security Appropriations Act.   Specifically, I would like to discuss division D of the bill, which  appropriates additional funding to the Army Corps of Engineers. This  bill allocates $289.5 million to fund projects and activities to  enhance the Nation's economic growth.   The Whaley Lake Dam, located in my district in Pawling, New York,  Dutchess County, will be eligible to compete for these funds, and is  authorized pursuant to section 5003 of the Water Resources Development  Act of 2007. Originally built in the mid-1800s, the Whaley Lake Dam is  in critical need of repair.   The outlet of the dam feeds a stream necessary to the movement of  treated wastewater from multiple municipal water treatment facilities.  Additionally, the town of Pawling is the home to nearly 9,000  residents, including 500 homes located on Whaley Lake specifically.   Mr. Chairman, could the chairman please confirm that the Whaley Lake  Dam project could compete for funding included in the bill?    Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Simpson for this  confirmation. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.
