 Mr. Speaker, I rise to affirm our ally Israel's right to  exist.   The unprovoked October 7 attack by Hamas has left a deep wound.  Israel has a right to defend itself against this barbarism consistent  with international humanitarian law, including the protection of  civilians.   Far too many Israeli families do not know the fate of their loved  ones at the hands of Hamas. While some have relief, there are still  many who need to be reunited with their families. My hope is that the  success President Biden has had will secure the release of all the  hostages.   Importantly, the extended pause has meant additional humanitarian  assistance to alleviate the suffering of the innocent Palestinian  families in Gaza for whom Hamas has no regard. There must be sustained  and safe access to food, water, and medical care.   Paramount is the prevention of this conflict from spreading,  preserving stability in the Middle East, and working toward a durable  peace.   These events have brought forward a rise in anti-Semitism and  Islamophobia. Anti-Semitic incidents have involved violent assaults on  Jewish students on college campuses and protesters extolling terrorist  organizations.   Close to home, I was especially horrified that this past weekend,  three students of Palestinian descent, one a Brown University student,  were shot. I pray for their recovery and that the assailant be brought  to justice.   This crisis of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia demands an urgent and  collective response. There is no place for violence or hate in America.   In recognition of Israel's right to exist and for the immediate  release of hostages taken during the October 7 attack, I urge my  colleagues to support H. Res. 888 and H. Res. 793.
