 Mr. Chairman, well, here we go again, another bait and  switch by the Democrats.   We have a great bill, the CREATES Act, that allows consumers to  access cheaper generic drugs, driving down costs, saving Americans $3.9  billion over 10 years.   What have they done with it? They have stuck in poison pills designed  to take choice away from Americans when it comes to their health  insurance plans.   As lawmakers, we owe it to Americans to protect their rights to make  their own decisions, particularly as it relates to healthcare. The fact  that we are here debating even further reducing these options available  to Americans proves that we are not keeping up our end of the bargain.   ObamaCare created a healthcare paradigm that aimed to take away  options from Americans and give that authority to the government. As a  result, premiums are skyrocketing, with the highest in the country  being in my home State of Virginia.   President Trump, thankfully, has stepped in to allow flexible, short- term, limited-duration plans to help those in my district, where my  constituents are pleading for more choices in health insurance. This  administration is simply trying to give more options to Americans in  this desert of choice.   We should be creating an environment that encourages more choices for  individuals and families. This includes a more individualized market,  particularly with regard to employer-sponsored health insurance.    It also means increasing pricing transparency at the point of sale to  avoid surprise medical billing, which the President championed last  week.   Finally, we should address consolidation in the healthcare system  through increased enforcement from the FTC and the DOJ under the  Sherman Antitrust Act.   This legislation is the height of arrogance. Government knows best,  yet again. The American people know nothing about their own choices  when it comes to health insurance.   To double down on ObamaCare and take away the few options that are  left for constituents, and giving those choices to those who caused  this failure in the first place, the Federal Government, is beyond  offensive to American citizens.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this  legislation. Reject this idea that government knows best, and stand up  for affordable and accessible health insurance for all Americans.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Rutherford for yielding  and putting together this event this evening.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the men and women in law  enforcement who serve our communities, States, and Nation with honor  and bravery. These are our friends and neighbors who willingly face  danger in order to protect their fellow man and make our cities better  places in which to live.   Just this week in Lynchburg, Virginia, I joined several hundred with  the police chief, mayor, and members of law enforcement from around the  region to honor the lives of two law enforcement officers who made the  ultimate sacrifice in the last year.                                time  2030    Virginia State Trooper Lucas Dowell, who was shot while serving a  search warrant, was only 28.   Winchester Police Department Officer Hunter Edwards, who died in a  vehicle collision while responding to a fight in Winchester, was only  30.   As this week draws to a close, I ask that all Americans remember the  more than 150 officers this year who died in the line of duty and  consider the danger that all officers face each day in order to keep  Americans safe.   Your lives are a shining example of what is right in our world. By  getting up each day and donning a uniform and badge, you are making a  difference in our communities across this great Nation. Every single  day, you have our gratitude.
