 Mr. President, it is fair to say that Americans are sick  of partisanship when it comes to issues of greatest concern. They are  asking, if you will, that we in the Senate put party behind us--behind  the needs of the people. This is especially true when we are speaking  of those issues of greatest importance, and I would argue that the  replacement of the Affordable Care Act is one of those issues of  greatest importance.   Whatever the excuse, no Senator of either party should sit on the  sidelines. This is such an important issue that every Senator, whatever  her or his personal views, should be engaged.   We know President Trump's principles, if you will. He laid them out  time and again on the campaign trail. He wants to maintain coverage,  lower premiums, care for those with preexisting conditions, and  eliminate the ObamaCare mandates upon individuals and businesses.   At his inauguration speech, he spoke of the forgotten man and of the  forgotten woman. In fact, we can see that just before his inauguration,  he emphasized that with what he said during the campaign:         We're going to have insurance for everyone. There's a       philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you       don't get it. That is not going to happen to us.    He also emphasized the quality of the care, saying that people  covered under the law that he would propose to replace can expect to  have great healthcare. ``It will be in a much simplified form. Much  less expensive, much better,'' he said to the Washington Post just  before he was sworn in. These are his principles.   When he was sworn in and gave his inaugural address, speaking of the  forgotten man and the forgotten woman, I cannot help but think that he  was influenced as he went through counties seeing folks with terrible  tales of their child dying from opioid addiction or their spouse unable  to afford insurance under ObamaCare.   I will point out that there is a huge dimension to this that we  sometimes forget, but we should not. Senator Jerry Moran from Kansas  made the point that healthcare is like no other issue. It is an issue  which touches us most personally. I think President Trump saw that on  the campaign trail. He saw the parent of an adult child with mental  illness, and she could not get a psychiatric bed for her child. We know  the fate of that child if he does not have the care he needs. He will  end up either in a homeless shelter, a jail cell, or the morgue. That  is the human dimension to this, and that is why we need to help  President Trump fulfill his pledge.   Voters understand what we are speaking of; they understand the  importance of it. But let me speak just a little bit more to the  politics of this because we cannot separate what we do here in  Washington, DC, from politics.   There are researchers from Princeton who recently published a report.  If you look at White males and females between 18 and 54 who lack a  college education, their life span is decreasing. Now, for Hispanics,  African Americans, and other minorities, it is improving, but for this  group, it is decreasing.   I have seen data which shows that in the population centers of the  United States in which this phenomenon is being most seen--these Whites  from age 18 to 54, noncollege educated, their life span is decreasing-- the counties in which this effect is most seen were most likely to vote  for Donald Trump. Think about the politics of this. The politics are  that a group of folks who understand that their life is materially and  physically declining, with higher rates of suicide, addiction, liver  disease, and other chronic illness, ending in premature death, voted  significantly more for the President who swore that he would remember  them, who spoke of the forgotten man and the forgotten woman. His  pledge to them was a lifeline. Their vote for him was a cry for help.   This is not just a human dimension; there is a political dimension  leading to a policy necessity.   Let's stop for a second. There is a key issue of cost. We understand  that the Affordable Care Act was too expensive. We can save money. But  let's not fool ourselves; it is still going to cost. We can save the  $150 billion or so that the House suggested we have to save. We know  the rules the Senate has to address to save at least that much money.  On the other hand, we know that Congress has mandated people can get  care; therefore, if Congress mandates that folks get care, then  Congress should help provide the means by which to pay for it.   There are some who think, oh, my gosh, Congress does not need to  provide for the money for care, and everything will be good. I am a  physician. I have been in the emergency room at 2 in the morning, and  at 2 in the morning, when those emergency room doors are open, whoever  comes in is treated. She may have heart failure, he may have a drug  overdose, they might be a schizophrenic, or they might be somebody  vomiting blood. Each one of them receives all the care that he or she  needs to stabilize their emergency condition. And if they have to be  hospitalized--think of a car wreck with multiple traumas--and they are  in the hospital for 4 months, they still get that care because Congress  mandates that. But, if Congress does not provide the means to pay for  it, the cost of that care is shifted not to government; the cost of  that care is shifted to the privately insured. All of those getting  their insurance through their employer begin to pay higher premiums-- much higher premiums. Somebody pays. And if we do not fulfill our  obligation, after mandating that those patients get cared for--we,  being Congress--then society pays, and society is the person struggling  to make ends meet and now finds out from her employer that her premium  has increased 20, 30, sometimes 50 percent--all because of the cost- shifting that occurs.   It is not just the group market. Under ObamaCare, we can see that in  the individual market, premiums have skyrocketed. It is not that the  Affordable Care Act is working so well. Last week I communicated with  someone who lives in San Francisco, and she and her young family are  paying $20,000 a year for a premium, $6,000 deductibles; none of them  is sick, none of them will meet their deductibles, but living in a very  expensive city, having to struggle to pay their mortgage, groceries,  and transportation, now they have to come up with $20,000 to pay for  their healthcare. That is all because of the Affordable Care Act.   Then I spoke with a person in Washington, DC, and someone in  Washington DC--that person who is a consultant on insurance issues,  knows insurance backward and forward, says that for his family, the  premium is $24,000 a year, with a $13,000 family deductible. The  insurance expert says: I will be out $37,000 in a single year before my  insurance kicks in. Families cannot afford that.   I will finish up lastly with a story from Louisiana. Folks never  believe this because it seems too crazy, but I put it on my Facebook  page. There is a couple back home, 60 and 61. They were quoted a  premium of $39,000 for a premium of one year, with a deductible on top  of that--$39,000. We can see that in the individual market, the  Affordable Care Act is not working, it is becoming the un-Affordable  Care Act. We have to address this.   But let me say, we have to address it whether we are a Democrat or a  Republican. We must respond to the cries for help coming from those  folks suffering from addiction, mental illness, heart failure, or any  other chronic disease for which they do not have coverage, but also to  the cries for help from middle-class families who cannot afford these  premiums, and if they don't sacrifice something in the budget to pay  for it, under the Affordable Care Act, they will be fined.   Let's return to the political side. The political side is that I have  voters back home asking why Republican Senators  [[Page S2945]]  are not helping a Republican President fulfill his pledge--a pledge to  all voters--but one that certain Republican voters specifically took to  heart; that is, to fulfill his pledge of caring for those with  preexisting conditions, continuing coverage, lowering premiums, and  eliminating mandates.   If you are a Democratic Senator, the forgotten woman and the  forgotten man is in your State too. I can promise you, even if you are  not a Republican but you are a Democrat, you have an opioid crisis in  your State. So if we are now looking at addressing Medicaid expansion  or the affordability of the individual market, and you are a Democratic  Senator and you decide to sit on the sideline--if you are a voter in  that State, you should be asking why.   Let's face it. Speaking of my Democratic colleagues, many of you do  not like President Trump. Some of you hate President Trump. Some of you  like him, but you have to pretend that you hate him. Even though this  is President Trump's pledge, this is not about President Trump. This  about the voters--the patients, the people in our States who either  cannot afford their insurance or who have an addiction or some mental  illness or some other critical mental healthcare need that, if this  ObamaCare replacement is not done well, will leave them far worse off.   I have heard some of the excuses from my Democratic colleagues as to  why they cannot participate. They say: Oh, we are using the word  ``repeal'' or, oh, we are not going through a normal committee  process--oh, this, or oh, that. I concede it all. Who cares? If you are  a voter right now, and your child is addicted to opioids, do you really  care that there is a semantic issue regarding whether or not we are  saying ``repeal'' or ``repair''? Do you really care that after 8 years  of hearings, we don't have a few more hearings? Do you even understand  the difference between reconciliation versus normal process? I would  say no, because the principal thing that concerns you is that your  child is desperate for help and you are not sure that the help will  continue.   So I say to my Democratic colleagues: Whatever the excuse, ignore the  excuse, and please engage.   Let me finish where I started. I think the average American right now  wants every Senator, whether Republican or Democrat, to help President  Trump fulfill his pledge to maintain coverage, lower premiums, and care  for those with preexisting conditions, without mandates. Every Senator  should listen to the American people as they ask us to put patients  over party, to put the American people over partisanship.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time during quorum  calls until 12:30 p.m. today be equally divided.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
