 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Slotkin for yielding  and for organizing this Special Order in honor of our dear friend, Paul  Mitchell.   Mr. Speaker, I represent parts of Macomb and Oakland counties. And  during my first term in Congress, Paul and I shared representation of  Macomb. Paul represented the northern part; I represent the southern  part. And while there were plenty of policies we disagreed on, there  were a lot of things we connected on, too.   We wanted to bring better water infrastructure to Macomb. And, Paul,  I am still working on it, and we are going to get there.   We talked about our shared history in the workforce world. Paul was a  real leader in workforce policy through his company, and I used to run  the State workforce system in Michigan. And he was a real leader and a  thought leader in that area. And, Paul, I am trying to carry that on as  best I can, too, as we look towards WIOA reauthorization.   And when we did spar over policy positions, it wasn't mean-spirited.  In fact, it was really close to my ideal of what it means to serve in  this body. It was real, honest debate, the kind I was happy to have and  honored to have.   Paul and I now share one more connection, and it is one we didn't  share. As a two-time cancer survivor, I know what it is like to get  that diagnosis, and I know the stress and the pain that Paul and his  family are facing. It is something I wouldn't wish on anyone, and I am  devastated that they have to go through it.   I want Paul to know that Mary and I are thinking about you and  praying for you as your treatment begins, and that I am here to lend an  ear or even talk through this experience, the same way that you did for  me when I was just coming to Congress. You were one of the most  generous colleagues I knew.   Mr. Speaker, I was lucky to have a neighbor like Paul Mitchell, and I  look forward to the day we can celebrate your remission, Paul, and  joust happily once again over the issues of the day.   God bless you.                                General Leave
