 Mr. Speaker, gun crime in the United States is a tragedy  for us all. I heard the talk about Sandy Hook, about Columbine, and,  yes, about Parkland, which happened in my State. It is a tragedy that  we all face.   But the one thing, Mr. Speaker, we all have to remember is that, in  each one of these instances, the person who acquired the firearm that  committed this tragedy acquired it lawfully, or they stole the weapons  from somebody else. This bill would not change any of those tragedies.   If anything, what this bill does, it puts more burden on law-abiding  Americans and does whittle away and strip their constitutional right to  bear arms. You see, the issue is much more about mental health than it  is about the ability to acquire firearms.   For this body to unilaterally make it significantly more difficult  for a law-abiding citizen to acquire a firearm, which is their  constitutional, God-given right, is this body acting outside of its  authority under the United States Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, in short, this bill will not fix the tragedies that we  face. Unfortunately, laws don't fix most of the tragedies that we face  as Americans. What fixes them is dealing with the human condition that,  unfortunately, inhabits people in our country. We should be working on  that, not stripping the constitutional rights from our fellow citizens.
