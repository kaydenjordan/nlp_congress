 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, tomorrow afternoon, the Senate will vote  to acquit President Trump in these impeachment proceedings. That is the  right thing to do. That is the decision that comports with both the  facts and the law.   These impeachment proceedings began in the House of Representatives  in a thoroughly partisan affair, driven by House Democrats, without  allowing the President to participate in cross-examining witnesses and  calling defense witnesses.   When the matter came to the Senate, the Senate was obligated to do  much better. We had an obligation under the Constitution to conduct a  fair trial, and that is what the Senate has done. Over the course of  the last 2 weeks, we have heard hour upon hour upon hour of argument.  The House proceeding heard testimony from 18 different witnesses. The  Senate saw 193 video clips of witness testimony presented here on the  Senate floor. The Senate posed 180 separate questions from Senators to  the House managers or the White House defense team. Within the record  were over 28,000 pages of documents, including the single most  important evidence in this case, which is the actual transcript of the  conversation at issue between President Trump and the President of  Ukraine. The Trump administration, to the astonishment of everyone,  declassified that transcript and released it to the world so that we  can read precisely what was said in that conversation.   The reason acquittal is the right decision is that the House managers  failed to prove their case. They failed to demonstrate that they  satisfied the constitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanors.  The text of the Constitution provides that a President may be impeached  for ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' The  House managers fell woefully short of that standard. Indeed, in the  Articles of Impeachment they sent over here, they don't allege any  crime whatsoever. They don't even allege a single Federal law that the  President violated.   An awful lot of Americans looking at these proceedings have heard a  lot of noise, have heard a lot of screaming, but are left wondering,  What was this all about?   If you examine the substance, there are two things that the House  managers allege the President did wrong. One, they allege that the  President wrongfully delayed aid to Ukraine, and, two, they allege that  the President wrongfully asked for an investigation into a political  rival. Both of those are legitimate ends.   Let me address them one at a time because there is a deep irony in  the argument of the House managers. Both of those objectives are  consistent with law, are permissible and legal, and both of those  objectives have been done, by any measure, substantially worse by the  preceding administration, by the Obama administration.   Let's take delaying aid to Ukraine. I am a big believer in America  standing with Ukraine. Indeed, I traveled to Ukraine. I went to the  Maidan Square and stood with protesters who had been shot down by their  government as the protesters stood for freedom.   I believe military aid to Ukraine is a good thing, and it is true  that the Trump administration temporarily delayed aid to Ukraine. That  is their right to do so. Presidents have delayed foreign aid before.  The Trump administration has done so with regard to a number of  countries. The Obama administration did so before that. Previous  administrations have done so.   But we heard hour upon hour of the House managers trying to establish  the proposition that aid to Ukraine was delayed when President Trump  admits aid to Ukraine was delayed. There is no dispute about it.   We heard testimony about how Ukrainians died because aid was delayed.  Here is the irony: If you support aid to Ukraine, as I do, military aid  to Ukraine as they stand up to Russia, there is no dispute whatsoever  that, for the entirety of his Presidency, President Obama refused to  give lethal military aid, defensive aid, to Ukraine, despite the fact  that I and other Members of this body called on President Obama to give  aid to Ukraine. I remember when we all went to the floor of the House  of Representatives to hear a speech to a joint session of Congress from  President Poroshenko, then the President of Ukraine, where the  President of Ukraine called out the Obama administration because they  were sending blankets and MREs--meals. And President Poroshenko rightly  said that you can't fight a Russian tank with a blanket.   So if the House managers are right that there is something improper  about delaying military aid, the Obama administration did so for the  entirety of the administration. What did President Trump do? He did  something Obama never did: He provided lethal defensive military aid-- Javelin missiles that can take out Russian tanks.   The first ground they allege, of delaying aid, is legal and  permissible, and by any measure, the Trump administration's record on  it is much, much better than the Obama administration's.   How about the second ground: directing an investigation into your  political rival. The most important legal question in this proceeding,  the question that resolves this proceeding, is this: Does the President  have the constitutional authority to investigate credible allegations  of corruption?   The House managers built their case on the proposition that seeking  an investigation into Burisma, the corrupt Ukrainian natural gas  company, and Joe Biden and Hunter Biden--seeking any investigation into  whether there was corruption was, in the words of the House managers,  ``baseless,'' ``a sham,'' and utterly ``without merit.'' In their  opening arguments, the House managers spent over 2 hours trying to make  that case, and Madam President, I will say, on the face of it, that  proposition is objectively absurd.   The White House legal defense team laid out, in considerable detail,  that there was very substantial evidence of corruption. Burisma is a  company that was built on corruption. The oligarch who started Burisma,  Mr. Zlochevsky, was the sitting energy minister in Ukraine, and he  amassed his billions by, as the sitting energy minister, giving gas  licenses to his own company that he was head of. That is where Burisma  made their money. It was a company built on corruption from day one.   Now, I think it is worth pausing and examining the timeline of what  occurred because, remember, the House managers' case is that it is  baseless and a sham to even investigate corruption.   In early 2014, Vice President Joe Biden was named the point person  for the Obama administration on Ukraine. In April--on April 13 of  2014--Devon Archer, business partner of Hunter Biden, the son of Joe  Biden, joined the board of Burisma and began being paid a million  dollars a year. On April 28, Britain's securities fraud bureau freezes  $23 million in accounts controlled by Zlochevsky, the oligarch who  owned Burisma. Then, just 2 weeks later, on May 12, Hunter Biden, the  son of Joe Biden, is named to the board and paid  [[Page S833]]  a million dollars a year, despite having no background in oil and gas  and no discernible background in Ukraine. Hunter Biden gets paid a  million dollars a year, and Joe Biden actively, aggressively,  vigorously leads the Obama administration's policies on Ukraine.   Now, the House managers were asked in questioning: What exactly did  Hunter Biden do for his million dollars a year? They refused to answer  that. That is a perfectly reasonable question to ask if you are  investigating corruption. Joe Biden is seen on video not just admitting  but bragging that he told the President of Ukraine he would personally  block a billion dollars in foreign aid loan guarantees unless Ukraine  fired the prosecutor who was investigating Burisma, the company paying  his son a million dollars a year. As Joe Biden bragged on that video,  ``Well, son of a bitch,'' they fired him.   Now, that, on its face, raises significant issues of potential  corruption. We don't know for sure if there was, in fact, corruption,  but when President Trump asked that it be investigated to get to the  bottom of what happened, the President has the authority to investigate  corruption, and there was more than sufficient basis to do so.   Of course, the House managers are right that it is somehow  illegitimate, it is somehow inappropriate--it is, in fact,  impeachable--to seek the investigation of your political rival.   We know for a fact that the Obama administration not only sought the  investigation but aggressively led an investigation marred by abuse of  power, going after then-Candidate Trump, including wiretaps, including  fraudulently obtained court documents and court warrants from the FISA  Court.   Impeachment is an extraordinary remedy. It is not designed for when  you disagree. It is not designed for when you have political  differences or policy differences. It is designed for when a President  crosses the constitutional threshold.   On February 6, 1974, the Democratic Judiciary Committee Chairman  Peter Rodino, Democrat from New Jersey who led the impeachment inquiry  into Richard Nixon, told his colleagues:         Whatever the result, whatever we learn or conclude, let us       now proceed, with such care and decency and thoroughness and       honor that the vast majority of the American people, and       their children after them, will say: This was the right       course. There was no other way.    That was the standard that led to an overwhelming bipartisan vote to  open the impeachment proceeding against Richard Nixon. That standard  was not remotely followed by the House managers. This was a partisan  impeachment, and we are right now in an election year. The voters are  voting, and it is up to the voters to decide which policies they want  to continue. The House managers have abused the constitutional process  by trying to use impeachment to settle a partisan score. That is  divisive to the country, and I am proud that this body will vote--and I  hope in a bipartisan way--to reject these Articles of Impeachment, to  acquit the President, and to find President Trump not guilty of the  articles the House has sent over.   I yield the floor.
