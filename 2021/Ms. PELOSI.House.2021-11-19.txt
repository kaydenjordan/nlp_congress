 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his extraordinary leadership.   He and other chairs have brought us to a moment in history on the  floor of the House today when we can do something of significance for  the people. I thank the chairman.   Madam Speaker, with confidence in the vision of President Biden, and  associating myself with the inspiring and informative comments of the  distinguished chairman, Mr. Neal, with our distinguished Democratic  leader, Mr. Hoyer, the Democratic whip last evening, and with respect  for those who work in this Capitol, and as a courtesy to my colleagues,  I will be brief.   In his remarks, our Democratic leader, Mr. Hoyer, talked about the  pride we take in telling our children and our grandchildren that we  were here present to pass the Build Back Better legislation and what it  means for future generations. Whip Clyburn talked about the three legs  of the Biden platform: the Rescue Plan, the BIF, the Infrastructure and  Jobs bill, and now the Build Back Better, the infrastructure for our  future. And Chairman Neal quoted   Daniel Webster and spoke of our  responsibilities to the people.   Madam Speaker, in that spirit, I proceed by saying: Under this dome,  for centuries, Members of Congress have stood exactly where we stand  now, to pass legislation of extraordinary consequence in our Nation's  history and for our Nation's future.   In the original House Chamber, now Statuary Hall where Lincoln  served, is Clio, the muse of history. Clio reminds men and women in  these hallowed Halls that we are part of history; that our words and  actions will face the judgment of history; and that we are part of the  long and honorable heritage of our democracy.   With the passage of the Build Back Better Act, we--this Democratic  Congress--are taking our place in the ``long and honorable heritage of  our democracy,'' with legislation that will be a pillar of health and  financial security in America that will be historic in forging landmark  progress for our Nation. We talk about history as we look and prepare  for the future.   Much has been said since our distinguished Democratic leadership  spoke last evening. Much has been said on this floor. But the facts are  these: Following the vision of President Biden, guided by the expertise  and energy of our chairs, Members, and staff, we have the Build Back  Better bill that is historic, transformative, and larger than anything  we have ever done before. We are building back better.   If you are a parent, a senior, a child, a worker--if you are an  American--this bill is for you. And it is better.   It is better in terms of healthcare. It is better if you are a  senior: Your cost at the pharmacy will be cut to a fraction, with  annual costs capped under Medicare Part D, and you will benefit from  the Medicare hearing benefit.    It is better if you have diabetes: When you go to the pharmacy,  instead of paying hundreds for insulin, you will pay no more than $35  per month.   And it is better for all Americans: We are halting Big Pharma's  outrageous tax hikes; and in addition to that, we are dramatically  lowering healthcare costs under the Affordable Care Act.   We are also expanding coverage to millions under the Affordable Care  Act, as I mentioned.   It is better in terms of family care. If you are a parent, it is  better. Most families will benefit from reduced childcare costs, cut  fully in half for most families, and free universal pre-K for every 3-  and 4-year-old in America.   It is better if you are a middle-income family. You will benefit from  an expanded Biden child tax cut and paid family and medical leave.   It is better if you are a caregiver. You will have the respect you  deserve with the benefit of an historic investment of high-quality home  healthcare.   And it is better for America's working families, with an average of 2  million jobs created each year over 10 years, together with the BIF.   Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs; a four-letter word.   And it is better for climate. If you want your family to benefit from  clean air, clean water, for the development of good-paying green jobs  for the future and from improved national security, we are meeting the  President's vision to cut pollution in half by 2030 and 100 percent by  2050, creating good-paying union jobs and lowering families' energy  costs; advancing environmental justice with the Justice40 initiative of  President Biden; and honoring our commitment to passing on a better  planet to our children. Our responsibility is always to our children  and to the future.   Last week, our congressional delegation went to COP26 in Glasgow and  affirmed the commitment of this Congress to meet and beat our climate  goals. With this legislation, we can achieve this for the children and  for Mother Nature.   The Build Back Better agenda creates jobs, secures tax cuts for the  middle class, lowers costs for families, while making the wealthiest  pay their fair share. Good-paying jobs; cut taxes for the middle class;  lower costs, especially in regard to healthcare and childcare; making  the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share.   Build Back Better is fully paid for. It reduces the deficit and grows  the economy. Unlike--and perhaps I need to remind you--unlike the  Republican tax scam, which was passed in the dark of night, with the  speed of light, with no hearings whatsoever, and it increased the  deficit by more than $2 trillion, more than this whole bill does for  the American people; tax cuts for the wealthiest, giving 83 percent of  the benefits to the top 1 percent and did nothing to help the American  people in terms of jobs, clean air, clean water, affordable healthcare,  and the rest.                                time  0815    Madam Speaker, 83 percent to the top 1 percent, in the dark of night,  at speed of light. Don't make me laugh about criticizing this bill.   Build Back Better will not increase inflation, according to the  experts, including an array of Nobel Peace Prize-winning economists and  Moody's.   This victory is possible because of the tenacious, tireless, and  values-based leadership of our chairs, members, and staff of the  committees.   I just want to acknowledge the staff of this institution, the House  of Representatives, for their just being there for us over and over  again regardless of when and where. Thank you so much.   Build Back Better is a better agenda for workers, for families, for  children, and for our planet. If you believe, as I do, that this planet  is God's creation, and we have a moral obligation to be good stewards  of it, this bill is for you.   Even if you don't share that view--and I think most of us do. If you  don't share that view, we all agree that we have a moral responsibility  to our children and to their future to pass on the planet in a  responsible way.  [[Page H6661]]    We are proud to be passing this legislation under the leadership of  President Joe Biden. He was an advocate and a leader in terms of the  bipartisan infrastructure bill, but he did not confine his vision for  America to that bill alone.   Today, we have the opportunity to build back better for the American  people and for the children. Madam Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote on  the legislation and a ``no'' vote on the motion to recommit.
