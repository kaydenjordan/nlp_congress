 Mr. Speaker, domestic violence is an insidious problem that  affects far too many people across our country.   One in four women and one in seven men will be the victim of violence  by an intimate partner in their lifetime.   Sadly, the scourge of domestic and sexual violence affects our  communities, our schools, our servicemembers, and threatens the well- being of women, men, children, the LGBTQ community, our veterans, and  others.   But through education and legislative action like reauthorizing the  Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA, we can and have made a difference.   Since its passage 25 years ago through 2012, the rate of domestic  violence decreased by 63 percent. From 1996 to 2015, the rate of women  murdered by men in a single-victim/single-offender incident dropped by  29 percent.   This week, we voted in the Judiciary Committee to reauthorize this  life-saving legislation.   I look forward to bringing VAWA to the floor so that families may be  protected from the tragedy of domestic and sexual violence; so that  young women like my granddaughter, Aubrey, feel safe to focus on the  things that are most important, like claiming her education, her  career, and her happy life ahead of her.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this important  legislation.                            ____________________
