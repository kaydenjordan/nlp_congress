 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  World's Biggest Fish Fry, which happens to be this week in Paris,  Tennessee. Each year at the end of April, people from all across the  country travel to west Tennessee to take part in a week-long  celebration that includes parades, a carnival, rodeos, dances, catfish  races, and much more.   The Fish Fry, as folks call it in west Tennessee, originated in 1938  as one of the many ``Mule Days,'' when farmers gathered to trade their  products, do their shopping, and enjoy the fellowship of their  community.   By the 1950s, the tractor replaced the mule, so the good citizens of  Paris and Henry County started a new event that is now known in west  Tennessee and around the country to be ``The World's Biggest Fish  Fry.''   The festival ends with the main event this Friday, April 28, when  more than 5 tons of catfish will be cooked, leading up to a grand 2- hour finale of parades.   I thank the Paris-Henry County Chamber of Commerce for their  leadership in preserving this great west Tennessee tradition.                            ____________________
