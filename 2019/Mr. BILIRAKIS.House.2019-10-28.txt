 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition and  celebration of Oxi Day.   Seventy-nine years ago today, the Greek Prime Minister, Ioannis  Metaxas, replied, ``oxi,'' or ``no,'' to the fascist forces looking to  enter Greece initially in their quest for total conquest of the  continent. With this historic response, Greece rejected submission to  the Axis Powers, proving it would not go easy.   Though the invasion of the Greek homeland ultimately happened, the  fascist forces could not contend with the ferocity of the Greek  resistance. The delayed invasion marked the first Axis setback in the  entire war and actually precipitated a fatal delay in the German  invasion of Russia, serving as the turning point for Allied Powers  during World War II.   Mr. Speaker, I celebrate the bravery and resistance of Greek  warriors, which serves as an example for all freedom-loving people.                            ____________________
