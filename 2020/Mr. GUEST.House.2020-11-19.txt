 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to welcome my new colleagues  who will join the 117th Congress. This group includes individuals from  diverse backgrounds, including a historic number of conservative women.   The ideals that these conservative Members stand for are a rejection  of the ideals of the radical left.   The American people have spoken and voted against defunding the  police, against overreaching legislation to take election independence  away from our States, against adding Justices to the Supreme Court, and  against moving our country toward the failed policies of socialism.   Instead, the American people are interested in issues that will move  our country forward, like supporting our veterans, securing our border,  addressing our aging infrastructure, and ensuring our country remains a  safe place to live, worship, and raise a family.   In short, the American people want and deserve from their leaders  real solutions to problems facing our Nation, and I will continue to  work with others toward finding those solutions and advancing our  conservative principles.                            ____________________
