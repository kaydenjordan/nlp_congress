 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for  today's vote on the motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No.  226, Callista L. Gingrich to be U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See. I  would have voted yea.    (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
