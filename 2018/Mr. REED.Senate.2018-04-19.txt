 Mr. President, I come to the floor to continue my series of  speeches about Russia's actions in the 2016 election and the threat  that Russia poses for the 2018 midterm elections and our national  security.   Free, fair, and open elections are the foundation of our country. The  Framers created a unique system that has stood for over 200 years and  served as a beacon around the world.   Regrettably, the Russian hybrid operations and malign influence  against the 2016 election has put the sanctity and security of our  democracy in question.   Our duty as citizens and as legislators is to recognize this crisis  and take concrete steps to protect our democracy. We must foster a  climate of vigilance and Federal-State cooperation when it comes to  elections integrity. So today, I wanted to take a moment to review what  happened and offer some steps that we should take immediately.   Some may say that there was no interference and that talking about  Russia's meddling against our democratic institutions is ``fake news.''  I wish it were ``fake news'', but the facts are very clear and are  acknowledged by experts of every political viewpoint. Let me take a  moment to review what happened before I discuss the threat and what we  should do.   Fifteen months have now passed since the intelligence community  released its assessment, which concluded that the Kremlin attacked the  heart of our democracy by interfering with our elections process. This  operation sought to weaken our democratic institutions, amplify and  exacerbate societal tensions, and generally sow chaos.   There is clear evidence that the Kremlin sought to influence the 2016  Presidential election. The key findings of the intelligence community's  assessment were these:         We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an       influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential       election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in       the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and       harm her electability and potential presidency.        Moscow's influence campaign followed a Russian messaging       strategy that blends covert intelligence operations--such as       cyber activity--with overt efforts by Russian government       agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and       paid social media users or ``trolls.''        Russia's state-run propaganda machine contributed to the       influence campaign by serving as a platform for Kremlin       messaging to Russian and international audiences.    In February of this year, leaders of the intelligence community  appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee and reaffirmed these  findings. In a related action, in February, the special counsel's  office issued indictments against 13 Kremlin-linked trolls for  conducting ``information warfare against the United States'' with the  purpose of interfering with U.S. political and electoral processes,  including the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.   These tactics are aspects of a larger coordinated operation of hybrid  aggression conducted by the Kremlin, using the broad spectrum of  military and nonmilitary tools at its disposal. The main tenets of the  Kremlin's hybrid operations are these: information operations with  cyber tools, which people commonly think of as hacking; propaganda and  disinformation; manipulation of social media; and malign influence,  which can be deployed through political and financial channels.   Furthermore, throughout this hybrid campaign, Russia has denied its  involvement and engaged in deception to hide its fingerprints.   Russia recognizes that, for now, its military capabilities are  limited relative to the United States and NATO, and it will seek to  avoid a direct military conflict with the West. Instead, Russian  tactics leverage their strengths and exploit our open society and free  markets in ways that they hope will have a strategic impact without  leading to conventional war.   As laid out in the ``Russian National Security Strategy'' in 2015,  the Kremlin's approach to how they respond to conflict includes  weaponizing tools and resources from across their government and  society.   The Russian strategy states:         Interrelated political, military, military-technical,       diplomatic, economic, informational, and other measures are       being developed and implemented in order to ensure strategic       deterrence and the prevention of armed conflicts.    This strategy describes the conventional and nonconventional use of  warfare as the Kremlin sees it and how Russia has utilized all the  tools of statecraft to engage an adversary without, in many cases,  actually firing actual shots. These different disciplines together can  be called a Russian hybrid approach to confrontation below the  threshold of direct armed conflict, which has been developing and  escalating since the earliest days of Putin's rise to power.   Russia's attacks have not ceased since the 2016 election. As former  FBI Director James Comey so presciently stated about the Russians,  ``They'll be back.''   Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper assessed that  the Kremlin has ``been emboldened'' by the success of their operations  to date and warned that hybrid operations ``will continue.'' At a  Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in February, CIA Director Pompeo  confirmed that the intelligence community has seen ``Russian activity  and intentions'' to affect the 2018 midterm elections.   Director of National Intelligence Coats stated at this same hearing  that our intelligence experts expect that Russia will conduct bolder  and more disruptive cyber operations in the coming year. The agency  heads from across our intelligence community agreed with this  assessment.   The warnings from our current and former intelligence officials  appear to be spot-on. There has been a steady pace of Russian hybrid  operations deployed against us, our allies, and partners, with varying  degrees of intensity and mixes of tools and methods. The techniques  unleashed against us in the 2016 elections as laid out by our  intelligence community were deployed with maximum intensity during last  year's French Presidential elections. There was also evidence of hybrid  operations against the German Federal elections held in September of  2017. Kremlin-linked trolls targeted the people of Spain, exacerbating  divisions during the referendum on Catalonian independence. Outgoing  National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said we have seen ``initial  signs'' that the Kremlin is using tools from its hybrid arsenal against  the upcoming Mexican elections. After last month's poisoning of the  former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil, an estimated 2,800  Kremlin-linked bots were unleashed to cast doubt on Prime Minister  May's assessment that Russia was responsible and to amplify divisions  among the British people. While the majority of the interference  appears to have come from Russia, others are catching on and deploying  these tools as well.   As highlighted in the Economist last week, a coalition of Indonesian  religious extremist groups used propaganda and disinformation to affect  a local election in Jakarta last year. The frontrunner, a Christian,  was falsely accused of insulting Islam and huge rallies were organized  against him. In the end, he lost to a candidate that  [[Page S2307]]  held the support of Muslim groups. This more overt interference has  been coupled with covert information operations, using social media to  smear candidates they deem ``not Muslim enough.''   A second Christian candidate in upcoming Indonesian regional  elections has been portrayed as a front for Christian domination in a  country that has an estimated 90-percent Muslim population and has been  featured in a video that falsely claimed that he was part of a massive  church building campaign.   With voters in this area spending an average of 4 to 5 hours a day  looking at social media on their phones, videos and messages have  quickly gone viral. As this example highlights, these campaigns don't  even have to be sophisticated. They use tactics out of the Kremlin's  playbook and they indicate how ubiquitous this type of activity is  becoming across the world.   We also continue to see evidence of the Kremlin and Kremlin-linked  agents deploy hybrid tools to sow division, exacerbate racial and  religious divides, and amplify social tensions here at home. We don't  have to look far for examples.   Kremlin-linked trolls flooded Twitter with messages intended to sow  division and disinformation in the wake of the tragic shootings in Las  Vegas and Parkland, FL.   During the special election to fill the Alabama Senate seat vacated  by now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, one candidate gained 1,100  Russian-origin Twitter followers over a 3-day period, with many of the  accounts appearing to be artificial.   January press reports indicate that Fancy Bear--the Russian military- linked hackers who perpetrated attacks on the Democratic National  Committee in the 2016 election--have been attempting to penetrate the  emails of Senate offices in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections.   Kremlin propaganda outlets RT and Sputnik continue to try to  capitalize on our open press and public debates to spread  disinformation and amplify division.   In sum, Kremlin and Kremlin-linked agents are still trying to hack  us, our allies, and partners to fuel their information operations. They  are still using trolls and bots to manipulate social media and  targeting us with disinformation campaigns and still deploying  propaganda.   In the absence of strategic action to deter these kinds of attacks,  Russia sees our 2018 midterm elections as another prime target.   Despite this threat and multiple warnings from across our  intelligence community, Trump administration officials have testified  to Congress dating back to last spring that the President has not  directed his Cabinet or senior staff to work on a strategy to protect  our democratic institutions. When I asked Defense Secretary Mattis on  June 13, 2017, whether the President had directed him to begin  intensive planning to protect our electoral system against the next  Russian cyber attack, he was not able to point to any guidance  indicating that the President recognizes the urgency of the Russian  threat or the necessity of preparing to counter it during midterm  elections.   On June 21, 2017, I asked officials from the Department of Homeland  Security, who are in charge of election security, whether the President  had directed them to come up with a plan to protect our critical  election infrastructure. They responded no.   On October 19, 2017, I asked leading officials from the Pentagon, the  FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security, who are in charge of  protecting critical cyber infrastructure, including our electoral  infrastructure, if the President had directed them to counter the  Russian threat. They could not point to any specific direction coming  from the White House to do so.   On February 13, 2018, I asked the top directors of our intelligence  community whether the President had directed them to take specific  action to blunt or disrupt ongoing Russian influence activities. I  received no affirmative responses. FBI Director Wray said he had not  been ``specifically directed by the President.'' Admiral Rogers, who  serves as head of both the National Security Agency and Cyber Command,  responded: ``I can't say that I have been explicitly directed to `blunt  or actively stop.' '' The other witnesses could not point to any  directives from the President to confront or blunt Russian influence  operations either.   On February 27, 2018, I asked Admiral Rogers whether he has the  authority and the capability to disrupt hacking operations where they  originate. He responded that he does not have the authority from the  President to go after these perpetrators and stated that the government  as a whole has so far, in his words, ``opted not to engage.''   The bottom line is that the President has not directed anyone in the  intelligence community, his Cabinet, or elsewhere in his administration  to develop or implement a strategy to disrupt, blunt, or retaliate  against Russia for its hybrid aggression against our democracy. This  threat is clear, and it only grows as we move closer to our midterm  elections in November. It is past time for the President to step up and  provide strategic leadership against Russian interference.   Russia has gone to school on our social and political divisions and  our democratic institutions and will continue to adapt. They have  learned how to exploit our vulnerabilities and are planning future  operations to hit our blind spots. We are fooling ourselves if we are  only looking to protect against the threats from the last Russian  operation. We need to be prepared to blunt what comes next.   February testimony from the Armed Services Cybersecurity Subcommittee  highlights this evolving threat. Professor Richard Harknett, a cyber  security expert from the University of Cincinnati, warned that Russia's  2016 campaign against our elections was the ``stone age'' relative to  the sophistication of cyber activities we are likely to see in the  coming elections. Similarly, Russia expert Heather Conley from the  Center for Strategic and International Studies testified at the same  hearing. She said:         If we're preparing for what Russia did in 2016, it will be       very different in November. It will be very different in       2020. It will look more American. It will look less Russian.       And so this is adaptation. We are already fighting the last       war.    As an article from the May issue of ``Atlantic'' portrayed, we may  soon find ourselves in an era where doctored images are used to further  aspects of hybrid operations. New technology exists that can  superimpose a person onto video of an activity they did not participate  in. Franklin Foer, the author, wrote of this phenomenon:         The genre is one of the cruelest, most invasive forms of       identity theft invented in the internet era. . . . A casual       observer can't easily detect the hoax.    As was highlighted recently on a ``60 Minutes'' show, we know the  Russians targeted election systems in 21 States in the 2016 election  and that Kremlin or Kremlin-linked actors compromised websites or voter  registration systems in 7 States. The fact we have not yet taken steps  to correct all the vulnerabilities does not inspire confidence for the  2018 midterm elections. Former FBI agent and expert on Russian  information operations, Clint Watts, said recently on ``Meet the  Press,'' ``at this point we can't ensure the vote is accurate or not  changed'' and that his number one priority would be protecting the  elections and the vote ahead of the 2018 elections. We cannot continue  to have a wait-and-see attitude with regard to the Kremlin's hybrid  operations because, next time, it could and likely will be worse. They  might actually be able to change ballots or tamper with voter rolls or  carry out another operation entirely that we haven't even thought of.   We are behind the curve in preparing our defenses against Russian  interference in 2018--these elections that are coming. Even by the  administration's own admission, we are not doing enough. At an October  18, 2017, hearing, Senator Sasse asked Attorney General Sessions  whether the administration had prepared to counter future interference  by Russia and other foreign adversaries in the information space.  Attorney General Sessions responded:         Probably not. We're not. And the matter is so complex that       for most of us, we are not able to fully grasp the technical       dangers that are out there.    This is not an acceptable response to such a pressing problem. Russia  attacked the heart of our democracy, and if we do not try to find  solutions and guard our infrastructure, we are derelict in our duties.  [[Page S2308]]    One of the last acts of the Obama administration was to deem election  infrastructure critical, which put it in a priority category for  assistance to guard against election interference. While appropriate  and important, that is the mere beginning of a solution, and we have  hardly progressed in the last 14 months.   I recently asked General Curt Scaparrotti, the head of European  Command, who is on the frontline of blunting Russian aggression in  Europe, whether we had a sufficient whole-of-government to combat such  hybrid operations. He responded that we did not have an ``effective  unification'' across the government and affirmed that additional focus  was needed immediately because of the nature of the threat.   We need a whole-of-government approach with the weight of the White  House behind it. We need an approach that will enable coordination  across the different agencies of our government and support effective  outreach and collaboration with State and local officials and the  private sector, including the media. Given the nature of Russia's  asymmetric aggression, conducted below the level of direct military  conflict, we must deploy a range of tools, including cyber; diplomacy;  economic sanctions; financial investigations to counter foreign  corruption, money laundering, and malign political influence; and  strategic communications.   This administration has not effectively employed the nonmilitary  tools in its arsenal, and it has been slow to respond in any meaningful  way. The administration's dithering is exemplified in its foot-dragging  in utilizing the State Department's Global Engagement Center to counter  Russian propaganda and its delay in implementing sanctions to punish  Russia. While recent actions to expel Russian diplomats after the  poisoning of the Russian spy and his daughter on British soil and the  decision to finally implement sanctions targeted against Putin's base  of power are encouraging, they do not add up to a policy of effective  deterrence.   In this regard, I would note that a former senior Defense Department  cyber policymaker recently testified to the Armed Services Committee  that a standing joint interagency task force is required to bring to  bear the right capabilities and resources spread across the government  to respond effectively to Russian aggression. Such a task force would  utilize expertise from across our government, including the  intelligence community, the Department of Defense, the State  Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Treasury  Department, and would allow effective coordination and collaboration on  policy to counter Russia. The minority staff report of the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee on Russian asymmetric operations in Europe  recommended a similar mechanism. I think this is a good way forward,  and I intend to continue to work with my colleagues on the Foreign  Relations Committees and other committees of jurisdiction on how best  to stand up such a capability.   The Senate Intelligence Committee, of which I am a member, has  recently issued recommendations to improve election security. The  committee urges retaining States' primacy in running elections and  providing them with necessary assistance; creating effective  deterrence; improving information sharing on threats; and securing  election-related systems. All of these are important steps and should  be implemented without delay.   Several of my Senate colleagues have thoughtfully incorporated these  recommendations into legislation, the Secure Elections Act, and I  strongly support this effort. This bill would improve information  sharing between Federal Government and local election agencies, assist  States with cyber security preparedness, and support them in replacing  outdated and insecure electronic voting machines. I thank Senators  Klobuchar, Lankford, Graham, Collins, and Heinrich for their work on  this bill, and I look forward to working with them on further  legislation to protect the institutions that are essential to our  democracy.   As I laid out, these operations against our elections are part of a  broad pattern of Russian hybrid attacks against us and our allies and  partners. As Vice President Biden and former Deputy Assistant Secretary  of Defense Michael Carpenter reminded us in a recent article in Foreign  Affairs:         More than a decade has passed since Estonia became the       first NATO country to see its government institutions and       media organizations attacked by hackers based in Russia. In       the intervening period, the risk of a far more debilitating       attack has increased, but planning for how to defend against       it has lagged.    There are countries, such as those in the Baltics, that have been  dealing with these Russian threats for far longer than we have and have  developed effective approaches for countering them.   Department of Defense National Guard units, which regularly deploy to  Eastern Europe and the Baltics, may be uniquely positioned to share  information on Russian hybrid attacks with State and local officials  and explain procedures they learn from our European partners.   With regard to building credible deterrence--one of the Intelligence  Committee's key recommendations--it does not appear that we have  mounted an effective policy against Russia. As DNI Coats testified  earlier this year, Russian influence operations in cyber space are  intended to achieve ``strategic objectives'' and will continue unless  and until there are clear repercussions for Russia. In February,  Lieutenant General Nakasone testified to the Armed Services Committee  that the Russians, amongst several other adversaries, don't fear us and  have calculated that, in his words, ``not much will happen to them'' in  retaliation for cyber attacks on America. Cyber Commander Admiral  Rogers also testified in February to the Armed Services Committee that  Vladimir Putin has concluded there is little price to pay for Russian  aggression against the United States, and he has no incentive to stop  these hybrid attacks. In outgoing National Security Advisor McMaster's  last remarks, he even admitted ``we have failed to impose sufficient  costs'' on Russia.    In the absence of Presidential leadership to set a policy to blunt  Russian aggression and send the message to our foreign adversaries that  we will not stand for attacks of this nature, the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 requires a comprehensive plan  from the administration to counter Russian malign influence. That plan  is overdue. The Act also requires that the President develop a national  cyber policy, including any capabilities that be used to impose costs  on adversaries in response to a cyber attack or malicious cyber  activity. There is no time to waste, and I urge the administration to  deliver these strategies and actually implement them, which would work  toward imposing costs on our foreign adversaries.   I intend to return to speak further on these issues, as I believe the  American people deserve a comprehensive explanation of the threats that  face our democracy. I also intend to work with my colleagues on  additional measures to secure our political system and election  infrastructure against malign foreign influence.   None of this is to say that States will lose their traditional  primacy over elections. Rhode Island is one of the States that is  taking this issue very seriously by adopting new technologies to  streamline voting and guard voter information.   My State is also working with the Department of Homeland Security to  shore up election security, but election security must be a national  priority, and the Federal Government must be a reliable partner. I must  commend our Secretary of State, Nellie Gorbea, for her great efforts.   One thing remains clear. The Russians attacked our elections  process--the heart of our democracy--and are primed to do it again  unless the administration provides effective deterrence. This is not a  Democratic issue or a Republican issue; it is an issue of national  security. As the old saying goes, ``Fool me once, shame on you; fool me  twice, shame on me.'' We have no time to waste.   I yield the floor.
