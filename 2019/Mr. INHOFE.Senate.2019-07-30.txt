 Madam President, first of all, despite what some people  might think, I have the highest regard for the Senator from Rhode  Island.   It is very interesting in that the climate is changing, and the  climate has always changed. All evidence out there--all historical  evidence, all scriptural evidence--tells us over and over again that  the climate is changing. It always has been changing, and it always  will change.   The good news is that the world is not coming to an end because of  climate change. That is because the climate is always changing. So, for  those people who believe the world is coming to an end because of  greenhouse gas emissions, the good news is it is not. I am happy to  share that good news with you.                        Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019    Madam President, I am here to speak about some other good news, which  is that we have an opportunity with a vote that is coming up. Some  people call it the budget vote or the budget agreement. I don't refer  to it as such. I call it a defense agreement. I think everybody knows  where I stand on this. This is a vote that is going to have to come up  before too long, and there is a unique group of people in the U.S.  Senate who know the reason that we have to pass the defense budget.  They are the members of the Senate's Committee on Armed Services. It  happens that I chair that committee and that we have done really great  work.   I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for such time  as I may consume.    Madam President, we had a situation in which we went  through an 8-year period of time when our military was somewhat  devastated, and I want to share some of the specifics of that because  it is a serious thing. We are going to be voting on the defense budget  agreement, and I have already stated where I stand on it. I am here to  outline why the budget agreement is necessary for our national defense.   This defense budget agreement will be able to focus on the Senate's  Armed Services' top priorities, one of which is to fix the on-base  privatization of military housing.   Remember that this happened about 6 months ago. We discovered, all of  a sudden, that we were not doing a good job on our privatized housing.  Hey, I have to admit that I am partly responsible for that because I  was around here when we decided to privatize the housing. It did work  for a while. I think, after a period of time, people got a little  careless, and there was a little slack. Some of the contractors who  made that commitment got a little bit greedy. This information as to  how bad the conditions were came from a person at Tinker Air Force Base  who was the spouse of a military person. When I first heard this, I  thought there were bad conditions just in my State of Oklahoma, but  there were not; they were all over the Nation.   So we fixed that thing. We fixed it with our defense authorization  bill, and we had a lot of provisions in there. We are now modernizing  our military housing in a way that is going to be good for all of our  spouses and others who are forced to live there. For some reason, if  our defense budget agreement were to go down in flames and not be  passed, there wouldn't be the modernizing of our military or the giving  to our troops a well-deserved pay raise, and they have not had a pay  raise in a long time. This is going to be the largest pay raise for our  military people in the last 10 years. It is a good thing.   By the way, people are always talking about how we can be so  concerned about building our military when we have China and Russia  that have passed us up in many areas and spend just a fraction of the  amount. The reason is very simple, which is that China and Russia are  countries that don't have to do anything for their soldiers. We take  care of ours. We try to provide good housing. We provide the types of  things that our all-volunteer force can be very proud of and are very  proud of. That is something we have to incur. The largest single  expenditure that we have in the military is end strength--the people  out there. Communist countries--China, Russia--don't have to worry  about that. ``Here is a gun. Go out and kill somebody.'' We don't have  that luxury, and we wouldn't do that if we wanted to.   If we don't pass this budget bill, the effects on the military will  be devastating. Let me just share a couple of things that would happen.   We would force the Department of Defense to operate under a  continuing resolution, which would shortchange our troops and waste  taxpayer dollars. We all know that. We would face destructive,  haphazard cuts in sequestration. What is it we hear on our committee?  The Presiding Officer is fully familiar, for she is one of the most  loyal members of the Senate's Committee on Armed Services. We have  posture hearings for about 6 months at the beginning of every year with  the leaders of the various branches of the military--General Votel,  Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, ADM Craig Faller, ADM Phil Davidson, all of  these people.   What do they tell us?   They tell us, if we don't actually start funding our military again,  we are going to have sequestration. Look, if we vote for this thing and  pass it, we will end the sequestration problems and threats forever. It  will not happen again.   What else do they tell us?   They tell us that a CR, which is a continuing resolution, would be an  absolute disaster. A lot of people in this body don't know this, but  every member of the Senate's Committee on Armed Services does know this  because they were there.   All of these people--16 leaders--come in for posture hearings each  year, and we know the problems we are having and the problems we are  confronted with. We would be faced with cuts in sequestration.   This document right here is the ``Assessment and Recommendations of  the National Defense Strategy Commission.'' Here it is right here. This  is our blueprint of what we are doing to save America and to put us  back on top in all of these areas in which we are deficient. If, for  some reason, we don't pass this defense budget agreement, then we will  not be able to continue the implementation of the national defense  strategy, and we all know that. Certainly, we don't all know that, but  the members of the Senate's Committee on Armed Services do know that.   So that is what would happen. But what would this mean? The members  of the Armed Services Committee know what it means, but for everybody  else, the deficit budget deal would end the threat of sequestration  forever. You don't need me to tell you that sequestration would be  devastating.   General Milley, just confirmed to be the Chairman of the Joints Chief  of Staff, said that the levels of funding caused by sequestration would  place America ``at great risk.''   Remember, unfortunately, Heather Wilson, the former Air Force  Secretary who had to leave her position. She said the cuts would be  ``absolutely devastating in scope and scale.''   If we were hit by sequestration, there would be an across-the-board  cut of $71 billion to the defense programs. That would halt our  progress on the Space Command and developing crucial capabilities like  hypersonic weapons and artificial intelligence. Those are two areas  where we have actually been passed up by both Russia and China.   Just yesterday, the DARPA announced that they have completed a  successful design review of a hypersonic weapons program. Now, that is  a good first step. I am really glad because we were way ahead of them  back before the last administration came into office, and then, all of  a sudden, over that period of time, we got behind. So, meanwhile, China  and Russia are already testing their hypersonic weapons, and they are  ahead of us. We are just trying to catch up, and that is what this  budget vote is all about.   The 2020 NDAA invests in hypersonic weapons, but we can't move  forward if we are hit by sequestration. It would mean it would set us  even further behind.  [[Page S5176]]    By the way, the hypersonics that we are talking about are the state  of the art. That is a new thing. That is a weaponry that moves at five  times the speed of sound, and here we are, allowing our--I don't want  to characterize China and Russia as enemies. They are not enemies, but  they are certainly on the other side, and people are in shock when they  find out that they have something that we don't have. We have to be  competitive with them, and we are going to be if we pass this defense  budget vote that we are going to have before us.   So another example, in our NDAA that we passed overwhelmingly just  last month, it authorized a 3.1-percent pay raise, or increase, for our  troops. They deserve that pay raise, and under sequestration that pay  raise is at risk.   The ability for basing facilities to receive the next generation of  aircraft is also at risk. If your State is like my State, your State is  slated to house the F-35 or the T-X trainer or the KC-46. The KC-46 is  a system that is going to replace the KC-135, which has been in place  now for over 50 years and so is 50 years old. That is a system, and if  you were going to have one of these systems in your State, you may not  get it because of this deal. Without the budget vote that is going to  take place, we wouldn't be able to move forward with our plan, and we  would be hit by sequestration. It could all be over.   I am talking about systems like the F-35, which we talk about every  day, and the T-X trainer. We have had the trainers in existence now for  some 50 years, and the KC-46, the same thing.   So, anyway, that is what would happen if for some reason we vote  against and don't pass the defense bill that we are going to be asked  to vote on probably tomorrow.   We have also made plans to continue increasing our end strength by  17,000 troops from the Obama era to our current goal, and without this  defense budget deal, that wouldn't be possible. I think we all know it.   Now, maybe we don't all know it in this Chamber, but as for every  member of the defense authorization committee, the Senate Armed  Services Committee, they all know because they have been told over and  over, and that is why it is so important that they be very responsible  in their vote.   It would be kind of hard to say that you are working for the defense  of our Nation and then turn around and vote to gut their funding.   Now, we have made remarkable gains in readiness over the past couple  of years, thanks to President Trump's leadership and greater budgetary  stability. For just one example, at the end of the Obama  administration, only 5 percent of our brigade combat teams were ready  to what they call ``fight tonight''--only 5 percent.   Now, we have made a huge improvement. That is up to 50 percent now  after just 2 years of this administration, but we have a lot more to  do. All the improvements we have made in fiscal years 2018 and 2019  would be at risk if we were not able to go forward and pass our defense  budget act that we are going to be asked to support.   Sequestration would undo what we have done and take us back where we  were before. It would be abandoning our troops right when we said we  would be there for them. A continuing resolution means funding will go  to the wrong places--places that were important last year but don't  need to be funded this year. That is just wasteful. We all understand  that, but a continuing resolution would be especially devastating for  the military.   Every one of these military people whom I was just reading about came  in for their annual meeting. They all said the same thing: It would be  devastating if we had to go into a continuing resolution. We would be  forced to do programs that otherwise we would not be doing.   So General Dunford said it himself. He said: ``The fact that we have  routinely not had a budget at the beginning of the year has delayed new  starts, and it's been incredibly inefficient in how we prioritize and  allocate resources throughout the year.'' That was General Dunford.   A continuing resolution means that our military will lose key  planning ability. David Norquist, nominated to be the Deputy Secretary  of Defense, gave a great example to the Senate Armed Services Committee  last week. He said: Let's say a unit is planning right now for some  training in October, but we are operating under a continuing  resolution. At that time, they will cancel training because they don't  know how much money they would be getting in order to accomplish that.  We may eventually get more money, but in the meantime we will have lost  a month in the process.    With sequestration off the table and with a stable 2-year budget deal  in place, the Department of Defense can move forward with what is  really important: implementing the National Defense Strategy. This is  what my committee has been focusing on all year. We are facing a  different, more dangerous world than we were 10 years ago.   I look back wistfully. I have said this many times. I look back  wistfully at the days of the Cold War. We had two super powers. We knew  what they had, and they knew what we had--mutually assured destruction.  It doesn't mean anything anymore. You have countries that are run by  people that are mentally deficient having the capability of blowing up  one of our American cities. It is a scary world out there. That is what  we are doing. That is why it is so important that we pass this budget,  because our defense is depending on it.   Not everybody knows this, but the members of the Armed Services  Committee do know it. We are falling behind China and Russia as they  continue to build their militaries. We are seeing persistent threats  from North Korea, from Iran, from the terrorist groups, and we no  longer have the best of everything, and most people don't understand  that. Of course the members of our committee do understand that.   We have set clear priorities, and now we need to fund it. The future  of our Nation is at stake. This is what it will take to regain the  qualitative and quantitative advantages that we have lost.   I would have liked to have seen even more funding provided to this.  The National Defense Strategy Commission--by the way, they set up a  system that they can use, and that system is that we should be putting  together between a 3- and a 5-percent increase over inflation, but we  have not done it. We have not done it even with the budget that we are  working on now.   The National Defense Strategy Commission, which is nonpartisan, has  said that 3 to 5 percent growth is what is needed, and that is what we  did not do.   But at the end of the day, I am willing to take this smaller than  ideal increase and give our military what it needs--predictability. It  is also more than what the House passed in their Defense authorization  bill, which was dangerously low.   Every member of Armed Services Committee should vote for this defense  budget because they know everything we have been talking about. They  know that we are outranged and outgunned in artillery. They know that  we are at a disadvantage in air defense, having only two Active-Duty  battalions. Nuclear Triad modernization has not been taking place. We  aren't there. China and Russia are.   So, anyway, what I am trying to impress upon you is that those  individuals who are members of the committee are fully aware of the  problems we have had. They remember that under the Obama  administration, at the end of the Obama administration, our Air Force  was short 2,000 pilots, and 1,500 of them were fighter pilots. Only  one-third of our brigade combat teams, one-fourth of our aviation  brigades, and half of our divisions were ready. Also, 60 percent of our  F-18s weren't flyable. This is what we are in the process of  correcting, and it is all dependent upon the passage of this budget.   So I would say to those individuals who are on the committee, I can't  imagine that any of them would not be supporting this defense budget  when it comes up, and I would hope that we don't have members of our  committee who are anticipating doing things such as hearings back in  their State or amendments to go as we put our Defense authorization  bill through the next steps, because now is when our defense system  needs to have this budget passed.   I yield the floor.
