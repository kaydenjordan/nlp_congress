 Madam President, I begin this morning with some good  news. I am happy to say that last night I reached an agreement with  Leader McConnell, the Speaker, and the chairs of the House  Appropriations Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee on a  continuing resolution that will keep the Federal Government funded  through mid-February of next year.   This is a good compromise that allows an appropriate amount of time  for both parties in both Chambers to finish negotiations on  appropriations. As I said, this is a good compromise that allows an  appropriate amount of time for both parties in both Chambers to finish  negotiations on appropriations.   This morning, the House will start the process to take up this  government funding measure, and we hope they can have it passed through  their Chamber by the end of today.   Unfortunately, it seems Republican dysfunction could be a roadblock  to averting an unnecessary and dangerous government shutdown. Democrats  and most Republicans, including the Republican leader, have said they  don't want to see a Republican shutdown. We hope cooler heads will  prevail.   Just as we saw with the NDAA, a few individual Republican Senators  appear determined to derail this important legislation because of their  opposition to the President's lifesaving vaccine guidelines critical to  healing our country in the middle of a pandemic.   Let's be clear: If there is a shutdown, it will be a Republican anti- vaccine shutdown. Democrats want to get the government funded as soon  as possible. It was not easy to reach this deal. It took a while to get  Republican leadership on board. But I am glad that we have gotten it  done. I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for working  with us to find a path forward.   Now all that is left are a few lone holdouts who are raising  objections that are doomed to fail and which can be debated elsewhere.  There is no reason we should have a Republican shutdown. I have worked  with the Republican leader on an agreement that will  [[Page S8876]]  avoid one. Now, again, I hope cooler heads will prevail on the other  side so we can keep the government funded before tomorrow's deadline.                                  H.R. 4350    Now, Madam President, on the NDAA, once again, Republican  dysfunction--that seems to be what is going on in the other Chamber,  not by all Republican Members but by some who seem to run the show--the  Republican show, that is. Republican dysfunction has, sadly, caused  immense damage on another routine, important, and largely bipartisan  priority, the NDAA.   Democrats have been working in good faith with the other side for  weeks--since before the Thanksgiving holiday--to secure an agreement to  approve our annual Defense bill. Last night, because of the objections  of one Republican, the NDAA has, once again, been prevented from moving  forward.   As I said last night, the amendment pushed by my colleague would  certainly raise a blue slip objection in the House and, thus, kill the  entire NDAA. Now, the Senator from Florida says there are no blue slip  issues, but this isn't a matter of opinion. The authority here rests  with the Ways and Means Committee in the House, and they have stated,  unequivocally, that his proposal would raise blue slip issues. There is  no objection to the substance of the amendment presented by the senior  Senator from Florida, but it simply would violate the provision in our  Constitution that requires revenue measures to originate in the House.  Other Members had amendments with similar issues, but they worked with  the Ways and Means Committee in the House to resolve them because they  are the arbiter. Senator Rubio has not done the same.   It is unfortunate that this misguided demand of a single Republican  Senator is preventing this important legislation to support our  national security from moving in the Senate, particularly in light of  the fact that so many amendments were allowed to be offered by Senator  Reed and Senator Inhofe. The number of amendments that would be voted  on--let me repeat--would exceed the total number of amendments--the  total number of amendments--that were allowed on the NDAA under the 4  years of Republican leadership during Donald Trump's Presidency.   So to say that we are in a process that is unbalanced or unfair is  totally false. It is just, simply, one person holding it up. For the  sake of our troops and our families, I hope this Republican dysfunction  can be addressed.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand that there is a bill at  the desk that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Senate  Judiciary Committee being tied on the question of reporting, I move to  discharge the Senate Judiciary Committee from further consideration of  the nomination of Rachael S. Rollins, of Massachusetts, to be United  States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts.    For the information of all Senators, we expect the vote  on the motion to discharge to occur later this afternoon.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session and proceed to the immediate consideration  of H.R. 6119, which was received from the House and is at the desk;  that the only  [[Page S8904]]  amendment in order be Marshall-Lee No. 4868; that Senator Lee be  recognized to speak for up to 10 minutes and that, following his  remarks, the Senate vote on the Marshall amendment; that upon  disposition of the Marshall amendment, the bill shall be considered  read a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as  amended, if amended, with 60 affirmative votes required for passage;  that there be 6 minutes for debate equally divided in the usual form  prior to each vote, all without further intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that an  agreement has been reached between Democrats and Republicans that will  allow the Senate to take up and pass the continuing resolution to fund  the government through February 18. With this agreement, there will be  no government shutdown, and I appreciate the work of my colleagues from  both sides of the aisle, including Leader McConnell, to reach this  point. The good, bipartisan work that produced this agreement will give  appropriators in both parties and in both Chambers time to reach a  comprehensive agreement on appropriations by February 18 of next year.   I am glad that, in the end, cooler heads prevailed. The government  will stay open. I thank the Members of this Chamber for walking us back  from the brink of an avoidable, needless, and costly shutdown.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I am happy to let the American people  know the government remains open.   (Applause.)    Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Executive Calendar No. 567.
