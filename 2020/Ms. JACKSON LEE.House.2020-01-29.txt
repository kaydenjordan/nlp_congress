 Mr. Speaker, in 2016, I wrote this op-ed, ``Seven  Years of Change You Can See and Feel.'' I wrote it in the backdrop of  the election of President Barack Obama and his opening remarks and his  inauguration that said: ``Today I say to you that the challenges we  face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met  easily or in a short span of time. But know this America: They will be  met.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the op-ed I authored.               [From the Washington Examiner, Feb. 17, 2016]                 Seven Years of Change You Can See and Feel                          (By Sheila Jackson Lee)         The morning of January 20, 2009 was one of the coldest days       on record in Washington, DC. But this was nothing compared to       the chill wind blowing through the American economy and body       politic. The nation was facing economic challenges unseen       since the Great Depression: Americans were losing their jobs       at a frightening rate of 800,000 per month; the national       unemployment rate had risen to 7.8 percent and would continue       to climb until reaching its peak of 10.0 percent in October       2009.        For African Americans, the numbers were much grimmer: A       jobless rate of 13.5 percent in January 2009 which would grow       to 16.5 percent by the end of the year. And on top of this,       tens of thousands of American families each month were losing       their health insurance and their homes to foreclosure. The       United States was still bogged down in the quagmire that was       the Iraq War and young people by the thousands were being       forced to defer or drop out of college because of lack of       financial aid. And the average price of gas exceeded $4 per       gallon.        It was against this backdrop that I watched from the       inaugural platform as Barack Obama, surrounded by his radiant       and beautiful wife, Michelle, and their two adorable       daughters, rose to take the oath of office. After being sworn       in as the nation's  [[Page H638]]       44th president of the United States, Obama reassured an       anxious but hopeful nation, saying:        ``Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real.       They are serious and they are many. They will not be met       easily or in a short span of time. But know this America:       They will be met.''        Watching Barack Obama address the nation that day,       spectators in attendance and viewers across the country and       around the world understood they were witnessing a historic       president, the first African American ever to hold the       nation's highest office.        But more than being a historic president, Barack Obama's       actions and leadership over the ensuing seven years would       demonstrate that his would be a consequential presidency that       changed America for the better.        His first and most pressing task was to rescue an economy       on the brink of collapse. Working with the Democratic-      controlled Congress, the American Recovery and Reinvestment       Act was passed, which created 3.7 million jobs and saved the       jobs of millions of teachers, firefighters, police officers       and social service providers. The Recovery Act also cut taxes       for working families, extended unemployment insurance, and       expanded the Earned Income and Child Tax Credits, which       disproportionately benefit African American families.        Seven years later the verdict is in on the economic plan       put in place by President Obama and the Democratic Congress.       The Recovery Act ended the Great Recession, transformed the       economy from one hemorrhaging jobs to one that has created       more than 16 million new jobs over a record 71 consecutive       months. The national unemployment rate has dipped under 5       percent for the first time since President Clinton left       office, the deficit has been cut by 71 percent and the Dow       Jones stock market index topped 18,000 in 2015, an increase       of 177 percent over where it stood the day President Obama       took office.        As an added benefit, the average price of gasoline has been       reduced from more than $4.11 per gallon to $1.80, the lowest       price since before the tragedy of September 11. The seven       years of Obama also effected policy change in the areas of       criminal justice reform, health and education, national       security and foreign affairs.        President Obama also made history by appointing two women       to the U.S. Supreme Court, including the first Hispanic       American to serve on the Court. He appointed the first       African American man and woman to serve as attorney general       and the first woman to chair the Federal Reserve Board.        In the area of foreign affairs and national security,       President Obama ended the Iraq War, assembled and led an       international coalition to impose sanctions on Iran that were       so crippling that it was forced to the negotiating table.       That yielded the Iran Nuclear Agreement that prevents Iran       from ever attaining a nuclear weapon. And of course, as the       world knows, because of President Obama's leadership, General       Motors is alive and Osama Bin Laden is dead.        For seven years, President Barack Obama has represented our       country with grace, integrity, honor, and distinction. He has       provided consolation, hope, and healing in the face of       unspeakable tragedies such as the massacre of innocent       children at Sandy Hook, worshippers at Mother Emanuel AME       Church in Charleston, spectators at the Boston Marathon, and       mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado and Tucson, Arizona. He       expressed and symbolized our joy and pride in the progress       made over the last half century--and the distance we still       have to travel--when he marched across the Edmund Pettus       Bridge and addressed the multitude from the spot on the steps       where the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. shared his dream for       America's future.        So as President Obama serves the final year of his       presidency, it is clear beyond doubt that he kept the promise       he made to the nation seven years ago on that cold day in       January when he said:        ``Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real.       But know this America: They will be met.''        They were more than just met; they were overcome under his       leadership. And because of President Obama, today the United       States is stronger, more prosperous and better positioned       than ever to win the future.        And that is what makes his one of the most consequential       presidencies in American history.     In the years of Obama's service, we did, together,  meet those challenges.   His first and most pressing task was to rescue an economy on the  brink of collapse. Working with the Democratic-controlled Congress, the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the stimulus, was passed and  created 3.7 million jobs and saved the jobs of millions of teachers,  firefighters, police officers, and social service providers.   The Recovery Act also cut taxes for working families, extended  unemployment insurance, and expanded the earned income and child tax  credit, which disproportionately benefits African Americans. The  challenge was met.   So any discussion of any excitement about the work of this  administration creating an economy, it is an economy that was literally  given to them because of the work of President Obama and the Democratic  Caucus.   We have, now, $2 trillion extra in debt. We have the pending  possibility of wars. We have the continuing downward spiral of issues  that will impact this economy.   So, with this terrible tax cut, we were not given a strong economy.  We paid an extremely high price: $1.9 trillion for tax cuts has done  little for the economy. There is no such thing as a bump by this  administration. Key indicators are saying that things, in actuality,  are worse.   The Joint Economic Committee says unemployment was cut by more than  half during the Obama administration, from a peak of 10 percent to 4  percent. The economy had experienced 76 consecutive months of job  growth. The GDP growth was strong, an average of 2.6 percent in 11  quarters of the Obama administration. Growth in annual median household  income was strong and trending upward, increasing $4,800 during those  last 2 years. And the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors  under George W. Bush states that the economy was in fine shape at the  end of the Obama administration, despite what President Trump now  asserts.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Joint Economic Committee  article.     President Trump did not create the strong economy; he inherited it         President Trump regularly claims the economy he inherited       was a ``mess,'' but fact checkers have found this to false.       Before Trump took office in January 2017, the economy had       largely recovered from the Great Recession. Overall economic       indicators were already strong and were trending stronger.        Unemployment had been cut by more than half during the       Obama administration, from a peak of 10 percent to 4.7       percent.        The economy had experienced 76 consecutive months of job       growth.        GDP growth was strong--an average of 2.6 percent growth in       the last 11 quarters of the Obama administration.        Growth in annual median household income was strong and       trending upward, increasing $4,800 during the last two years       of the Obama administration.        Greg Mankiw, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers       under President George W. Bush, states that ``the economy was       in fine shape at the end of the Obama administration, despite       what President Trump sometimes asserts.''   There is no such thing as a ``Trump bump''--key economic indicators are                             the same or worse         Last week, the president said ``we have the greatest       economy we've ever had in the history of our country.'' This       claim did not make it by the fact checkers at The Associated       Press. A few facts to keep in mind:        Monthly non-farm job growth has slowed in the first 35       months of the Trump administration compared to the last 35       months of the Obama administration--36,000 fewer jobs per       month under Trump.        Average real GDP growth has been roughly the same for the       first 11 quarters under Trump and the last 11 quarters of the       Obama administration.        Growth in median annual household income was three times as       great during the last two years of the Obama administration       as during the first two years of the Trump administration.     President Trump's signature economic policy--the $1.9 trillion tax           cut--has failed to deliver the promised economic boost         Trump promised the tax cuts would be like ``rocket fuel''       to the economy, but the effects have been underwhelming. The       economic boost has been very small and short-lived.        GDP growth: Trump promised GDP growth as high as 6 percent.       However, in the seven quarters before and after passage of       the Republican tax law, GDP growth is exactly the same,       averaging 2.5 percent.        Business investment: The Trump administration predicted a       flood of business investment, which is critical to long-term       economic growth. However, it actually has slowed since the       tax cut, falling from an average annual growth rate of 4.6       percent in the seven quarters before enactment to a 3.5       percent annual rate in the seven quarters following the tax       cut.        Household income: The administration predicted that the tax       cuts would bring an increase of $4,000 to $9,000 or more per       household. However, household income increased only $550 in       the first year after the tax cuts went into effect.        Unemployment: It was at 4.1 percent before the tax cuts       took effect, falling just over one-half of 1 percent since       then.   We paid an extremely high price--$1.9 trillion--for tax cuts that have                       done so little for the economy         When it is fully implemented, the Republican tax law will       add $1.9 trillion to the national debt, according to CBO.        In just the past two fiscal years, the annual deficit has       increased from $666 billion in FY 2017 to $984 billion in FY       2019 (a 48 percent increase).        Despite a deficit forecast to exceed $1 trillion for the       rest of the decade and beyond,  [[Page H639]]       Trump administration officials continue to claim the tax cuts       will pay for themselves.        In the long term, the vastly increased deficit likely will       weigh down the economy and Republicans will argue that those       deficits will require cuts to vital services and programs       like Medicare and Social Security. In fact, the President       admitted just last week he will look at cuts to those       programs.       Trump's second major economic policy--the trade war--is a self-      inflicted wound, hurting consumers, businesses and the economy         Trump's claim that China bears the entire cost of the       tariffs is absolutely false--there are casualties on both       sides of the trade war.        One analysis finds that the trade war with China had       already cost 300,000 American jobs as of September 2019 and       the number could rise to 450,000 by the end of 2019.        CBO estimated that the trade war reduced GDP by 0.3 percent       by 2020.        The trade war hits consumers in their wallets and       pocketbooks. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimated       that tariffs on imports from China cost each U.S. household       nearly $300 per year in 2018, and over $800 per year since       with the additional 15 percent tariff on $200 billion worth       of goods.    While Trump cuts taxes for the wealthy and applauds the stock market,           millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet         In a recent analysis, the Brookings Institution found that       53 million workers--44 percent of all workers--earn just       $10.22 per hour or about $18,000 per year. $18,000 is not       enough to raise a family on.        The president has begun talking about a blue-collar boom,       but manufacturing has contracted in three of the last four       quarters. The sector has added just 9,000 jobs in the past       six months.   Most of President Trump's claims about the economy are false or highly                                 misleading         According to The Washington Post Fact Checker, Trump has       made more than 1,500 false claims about the economy.        This is part of a broader pattern. Fact Checker has found       that altogether Trump has made more than 16,000 false or       misleading claims on all topics in his first three years in       office.        Trump made half of those false or misleading claims in       2019--the pace of these claims is increasing.        Any statement the president makes about the economy has a       good chance of being false or misleading.     And so we have a challenge to try and recoup and  recover, for hardworking Americans, a real economy, because it is  frightening when we begin to start losing jobs.   Let me show how the trend went.   We were adding 270,000 jobs per month under President Obama. We are  now adding an average of 191,000 jobs under this present  administration. And it can be seen very clearly that the job growth is  challenging.   We can also see that, when we were down in a slump on median  household income, it was surging up because of the values and  principles of the Obama administration working with the Democratic  Congress.   Employment was down when Mr. Obama took office. We can see that it  surged up; and then it began to go down, with respect to this  administration, and turning red again. The economy, as I said, had been  growing very well under President Obama.   The GOP tax scam led to a record-setting $1 trillion in stock  buybacks, unlike what was represented to us, that that was going to  create investment in this country.   We are now beginning to put forward some major legislation that deals  with investment in our infrastructure, investment in public housing and  affordable housing, because we realize what creates jobs. We create  jobs when we invest back into the Nation. We do not create jobs when we  take tax cuts and give them to the rich while everybody else suffers.   The GOP tax law encourages companies to send factories and jobs  overseas. Under the GOP tax cut, income generated by American companies  abroad face tax rates that are half the new top corporate rate of 21  percent.   By the way, corporations didn't ask for that low corporate tax rate.  Some companies may be able to avoid taxes altogether on tangible  investments made offshore.   The GOP tax law increases deficits, as I said earlier, by $1.9  trillion when we are facing major budgetary challenges driven by our  aging population.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would say that there was nothing but a gift  given to this administration by the hard work of the Obama  administration.   Let us get back to investing in the American people. That is how we  build the economy, not by snatching it away from them.   Mr. Speaker, the verdict is now in, and it leads to the inescapable  conclusion that the Trump TaxScam has not accelerated the economy,  rather it is a significant drag on the booming economy President Barack  Obama bequeathed to his successor, the current occupant of the office.   Specifically, two points cannot be stressed enough.   First, President Trump did not create the strong economy; he  inherited it.   Second, we paid an extremely high price--$1.9 trillion--for tax cuts  that have done so little for the economy.   Mr. Speaker, most of President Trump's claims about the economy are  false or highly misleading.   There is no such thing as a ``Trump bump''--key economic indicators  are the same or worse.   The President's signature economic policy--the $1.9 trillion tax  cut--has failed to deliver the promised economic boost and his second  major economic policy--the trade war--is a self-inflicted wound,  hurting farmers, consumers, businesses and the economy.   Mr. Speaker, those of us who were there remember well that the  morning of January 20, 2009, which was one of the coldest days on  record in Washington, DC.   But it was nothing compared to the chill wind blowing through the  American economy and body politic because at that time the nation was  facing economic challenges unseen since the Great Depression: Americans  were losing their jobs at a frightening rate of 800,000 per month; the  national unemployment rate had risen to 7.8 percent and would continue  to climb until reaching its peak of 10.0 percent in October 2009.   For African Americans, the numbers were much grimmer, a jobless rate  of 13.5 percent in January 2009 which would grow to 16.5 percent by the  end of the year.   And on top of this, tens of thousands of American families each month  were losing their health insurance and their homes to foreclosure.   And the average price of gas exceeded $4 per gallon.   It was against this backdrop that the new President of the United  States, Barack Obama, rose to take the oath of office.   After being sworn in as the nation's 44th President, President Obama  reassured an anxious but hopeful nation, saying:   ``Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are  serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short  span of time. But know this America: They will be met.''   Because of the actions President Obama took, not to further the  interests of himself but of the American people, these challenges were  more than met and overcome and for that Barack Obama's presidency is  regarded by historians as a consequential presidency that changed  America for the better.   Mr. Speaker, before Trump took office in January 2017, the economy  had recovered from the Great Recession and overall economic indicators  were already strong and were trending stronger.   Unemployment had been cut by more than half during the Obama  administration, from a peak of 10 percent to 4.7 percent.   The economy had experienced 76 consecutive months of job growth, the  longest sustained period of growth in American history.   GDP growth was strong, average of 2.6 percent annually in the last 11  quarters of the Obama Administration and median household income growth  was strong and trending upward, increasing $4,800 during in last two  years of the Obama administration.   Even Greg Mankiw, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under  President George W. Bush, had to admit that ``the economy was in fine  shape at the end of the Obama administration, despite what the current  President falsely asserts.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an op-ed published on February  17, 2016 in the Washington Examiner, entitled ``Seven Years of Change  You Can See and Feel.''   President Obama actually had a plan to tackle the economic woes that  were affecting the American people.   Working with the Democratic-controlled Congress, the President signed  into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which created 3.7  million jobs and saved the jobs of millions of teachers, firefighters,  police officers, and social service providers.   The Recovery Act also cut taxes for working families, extended  unemployment insurance, and expanded the Earned Income and Child tax  credits, which disproportionately benefit African American families.   The Recovery Act ended the Great Recession, transformed the economy  from one hemorrhaging jobs to one that has created over 16 million new  jobs over a record 71 consecutive months.   The national unemployment rate has dipped under 5 percent, for the  first time since President Clinton left office, the deficit has been  cut  [[Page H640]]  by 71 percent and the Dow Jones stock market index topped 18,000 in  2015, an increase of 177 percent over where it stood the day President  Obama took office.   And, as an added benefit, the average price of gasoline has been  reduced from more than $4.11 per gallon to $1.80, the lowest price  since before the tragedy of September 11.   In short, Mr. Speaker, President Obama bequeathed a booming and  vibrant economy to his successor, who promptly took actions to  undermine it and explode the national debt.   Mr. Speaker, the GOP TaxScam was the wrong policy at the wrong time  because it showered benefits on the top 1 percent large multinational  corporations while doing little for everyday working Americans and Main  Street small business owners.   GOP TaxScam also raises the nation's debt by $1.9 trillion at a time  when the economy was already strong, and when we are facing major long- term budgetary challenges driven by our aging population.   And rather than devoting resources to wise investments in our workers  and small businesses, the GOP TaxScam further burdens working families,  endangers Americans' retirement security, and worsens our budgetary  outlook.   Our long-term economic growth trajectory is unchanged and there is no  sign of an investment boom.   Real wage growth for workers remains modest and factories and jobs  are more likely to go overseas.   The federal deficit is soaring as corporate tax receipts plummet and  the tax code is riddled with even more special-interest tax breaks and  loopholes.    THE GOP TAXSCAM LED To A RECORD-SETTING $1 TRILLION IN STOCK BUYBACKS    The GOP TaxScam delivered huge benefits to rich investors and CEOs  through record-setting stock buybacks in 2018 while average workers  struggle to pay for rising health care and living costs.   Stock buybacks do nothing to improve business operations or help  workers.   THE GOP TAXSCAM SHOWERS BENEFITS ON THE WEALTHY AND LARGE CORPORATIONS      WHILE DOING LITTLE FOR WORKERS AND MAIN STREET SMALL BUSINESSES    The GOP tax cut is heavily tilted toward the wealthy and corporations  and exacerbates the stagnation of wages for the vast majority of  workers and worsens income and wealth inequality.   The GOP tax law does nothing to help small businesses gain access to  capital and grow their receipts.   Only 5 percent of small businesses pay taxes at the corporate level  and most of the pass-through tax cuts go to the largest 2.6 percent of  businesses.       THE GOP TAX LAW ENCOURAGES COMPANIES TO SEND FACTORIES AND JOBS                                  OVERSEAS    Under the GOP tax law, income generated by American companies abroad  face tax rates that are half the new top corporate rate of 21 percent.   Some companies may be able to avoid tax altogether on tangible  investments made offshore.   This further incentivizes companies to move tangible assets, such as  factories and machinery, overseas.   Rather than protecting workers and their families, the GOP tax law  tilts the playing field against American workers.   THE GOP TAX LAW INCREASES DEFICITS BY $1.9 TRILLION WHEN WE ARE FACING         MAJOR BUDGETARY CHALLENGES DRIVEN BY OUR AGING POPULATION    Even after accounting for any economic growth effects, the  Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the GOP tax scam increases  deficits by $1.9 trillion over the ten years 2018 to 2028--hardly the  ``pay for itself' message we heard from the Administration and  Republicans in Congress.   Our friends across the aisle promised the GOP TaxScam would  significantly boost economic growth, spurred an investment boom, drove  unemployment down to the lowest level since the 1960s, created jobs for  millions of workers, and helped middle-class families keep more of  their paychecks.   All of these claims have collapsed in the crucible of actual  experience.           THE GOP TAXSCAM DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY BOOST THE ECONOMY    In the seven quarters before and after passage of the Trump TaxScam,  GDP growth is unchanged from the Obama economy, averaging 2.5 percent.   By 2023, the tax law's positive effect on economic growth will fade  away entirely.              THE GOP TAXSCAM DOES NOT SPUR BUSINESS INVESTMENT    There is no evidence of an investment boom, which Republicans  promised would be the key to unleashing unprecedented economic growth  and wage gains.   Nonresidential business investment grew by less than 1 percent in the  third quarter of last year, while business' orders for durable goods  (another measure of investment) fell in December for the fourth time in  five months.   Instead of encouraging investment, the tax cut triggered a record  level of stock buybacks.      THE GOP TAXSCAM IS NOT THE CAUSE OF LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT SINCE 1968    President Trump is coasting on an economic expansion--now the second- longest on record--that began under President Obama.   The law has not changed the unemployment trend.   The unemployment rate has fallen steadily since the end of the Great  Recession.         THE GOP TAXSCAM HAS NOT CREATED JOBS FOR MILLIONS OF WORKERS    More jobs were created in President Obama's last two years in office  than President Trump's first two years, a monthly average of 227,00 for  Obama contrasted to an average of 191,000 for Trump.   Monthly non-farm job growth has slowed in the first 35 months of the  Trump administration compared to the last 35 months of the Obama  administration--36,000 fewer jobs per month under Trump.   The tax law also encourages companies to send factories and jobs  overseas rather than protecting jobs at home.   THE GOP TAXSCAM IS NOT HELPING MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES KEEP MORE OF THEIR                                 PAYCHECKS    There has been very little increase in private sector compensation or  wages since the tax law passed.   Real wage growth continues to be disappointingly modest, and real  bonuses increased by just 2 cents per hour between December 2017 and  September 2018.   The law ignores the stagnation of working-class wages and worsens  income and wealth inequality.   In fact, only 35 percent of the tax law's benefits in 2018 will go to  the bottom 80 percent of households making less than approximately  $150,000 per year.   EVEN THOUGH FEDERAL REVENUES HAVE RISEN, THE GOP TAXSCAM HAS CREATED A                      MAJOR REVENUE DEFICIENCY PROBLEM    Corporate tax receipts dropped an astounding 31 percent drop in 2018,  with total receipts as a share of GDP falling to the lowest levels  since the end of the Great Recession despite healthy economic growth  and a tight labor market.   Revenue last year was 16.4 percent of the economy, almost two  percentage points below the so-year average of 18.3 percent in years in  which unemployment fell below 5 percent.   By contrast, spending as a share of GDP last year fell right at the  historical average.   Predictably, the President and our Republican friends seeks to evade  blame and responsibility for the fiscal mess and exploding debt they  have created.   Instead of redressing the harm caused by the Trump TaxScam,  Republicans resort again to their past practice of blaming the deficit  on the entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, SNAP,  and veterans benefits and seek to slash these programs to the  barebones.   For example the President sought to cut non-defense discretionary  (NDD) programs by $1.4 trillion, including cuts to Medicare and  Medicaid, reduce funding for SNAP by $220 billion or 22 percent, and  deny infrastructure funding for cash-strapped state and local  governments; and pile more hardships on struggling Americans with $327  billion in cuts to direct spending programs that safeguard basic living  standards they need to get by.   The President is obsessed with dismantling and destabilizing health  care for millions of Americans by making yet another attempt to  ``repeal and replace'' the Affordable Care Act passed under the  extraordinary leadership of President Barack Obama which provided  health security to more than 20 million Americans.   Mr. Speaker, we are now entering Act III of the immorality play we  predicted the President would write.   Act I was the cutting of taxes for the rich; Act II was the  inevitable exploding of the deficit we predicted would result and our  Republican friends denied would ever happen.   And now we have Act III, in which Republicans claim to have newly  rediscovered their horror over the deficits created by their fiscal  irresponsibility and insist that the mess they created but be cleaned  up by slashing investments in the programs relied upon by the 90-95  percent of Americans who were made worse off by the GOP TaxScam.   The President should be embarrassed and ashamed of his economic  stewardship and thankful every day to President Obama for tackling and  solving the major economic challenges facing Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Let me express my appreciation to Representative Kuster for her  unending fight on this terrible scourge of drug addiction and death  across the Nation. I look forward to working with her on her the Humane  Correctional Health Care Act, H.R. 4141, as well as the Judiciary  Committee taking this up in the near future to begin to address some of  the wide scope issues that have to be addressed.   I am reminded of the tenure here in the United States Congress, where  the impact of the arrest of addicted persons to crack and cocaine  resulted in mass incarceration and upward of 2 million people  incarcerated in this Nation, higher than any nation around the world.   I am reminded of the 2010 enactment of legislation that I wrote and  passed, along with my colleagues, that set to reduce, through the Fair  Sentencing Act, the unjust disparity between crack and cocaine from  100-to-1 to 18-to-1.   President Obama granted clemency to almost 2,000 individuals serving  lengthy sentences for drug offenses during his administration.   Now, I realize in my own community in Houston, Texas, there have been  149 deaths documented by the Harris County Institute of Forensic  Sciences in 2017, up from 79 in 2015. I also realize that, according to  the drug policy guidelines, accidental drug overdose is the leading  cause of death in the United States for those under 50.   With that in mind, wouldn't it have been preferable, even with the  legislation that is included that does, in fact, have a study that  would include the civil rights and criminal justice community's input?  I believe that input should have been in the forefront because here is  the singular problem I want to emphasize: Classwide scheduling would  facilitate broader prosecutions with harsher penalties and fewer  constitutional due process protections, according to Mr. Kevin Butler,  who appeared before the Judiciary Committee yesterday.   The Department has indicated that it will use classwide scheduling to  pursue severe mandatory minimums for anyone trafficking in an undefined  and potentially limitless set of substances without having to prove  those substances are or were intended to harm the human body.   Now, we know what the analogues will do. Here is our point: Our point  is when I asked the Justice Department about who they would prosecute,  they did indicate that they would not be prosecuting addicted persons.  But  [[Page H651]]  there are low-level traffickers. There are people who are addicted who  are trafficking. So all you are going to do is to build up, again, the  residency of the Nation's jails. That burden will fall heavily on  African Americans and Latinos and other vulnerable people.   I want the scourge to end. I want the DEA to be able to work within  the confines of the law. I want to work with the Congresswoman in her  hard work, but what I will say is that this bill needs to expire as  soon as possible.    Mr. Speaker, we need to move swiftly, as this bill  may be passed today, in order to avoid expiration, so that we can work  collectively together for what parents of the addicted and others want:  treatment services, wraparound services.   We must be able to say that we are not going to take the average guy  on the street with a dime or a dollar, trying to survive by selling it  and adding that person to the prison population, and not trying to save  lives.   Let's save lives with treatment. Let's save lives by getting rid of  the cartels and the large sellers. But let's not build up our mass  incarceration again.   Mr. Speaker, this is a very important hearing as we in the Congress  continue to deal with the opioid crisis as a nation. According to the  Drug Policy Alliance, ``accidental drug overdose is currently the  leading cause of death in the United States for those under 50. Drug  overdose deaths now exceed those attributable to firearms, car  accidents, homicides, or HIV/AIDS. More Americans died from a drug  overdose in 2017 alone than died in the entire Vietnam War.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly believe that we need to reduce drug overdose  deaths by promoting sensible, evidence-based solutions at the federal  level. The Houston region also saw an uptick in opioid overdose deaths  during the last few years, according to data from the Harris County  Institute of Forensic Sciences. There were 149 deaths documented by the  office in 2017, up from the 79 recorded in 2015.   Nearly 64,000 people died of a drug overdose in 2016, a staggering 22  percent increase from the year prior.   Nearly two-thirds of 2016 deaths (66 percent) involved a prescription  or illicit opioid.   Recent increases in death are driven by synthetic opioids like  fentanyl--deaths from synthetic opioids more than doubled from 2015 to  2016 alone.   Overdose deaths are increasing across racial groups, but non-Hispanic  whites have the highest rates of death.   It is important that we have a hearing to discuss whether or not the  lethal opioid Fentanyl and its analogues to extend the temporary order  to place it as a Schedule I drug. Factors such as poverty, lack of  economic opportunity, and limited access to a social safety net meant  that there was ready demand for those opioids. Once people become  addicted, we have little infrastructure in place to ensure they receive  the education, care, and treatment they need to prevent fatal  overdoses.   The Drug Policy Alliance states that, ``Many states are reporting  sharp increases in fentanyl-related overdose deaths. Fentanyl overdoses  occur in seconds to minutes, often with the needle still inserted. Most  users do not appear to be seeking fentanyl and are not aware that their  illicit drugs may contain fentanyl. The heroin (particularly white  powder heroin), methamphetamine, and cocaine supply is all at risk for  fentanyl adulteration. There have also been cases of counterfeit Xanax  and Oxycodone tablets that contain fentanyl. ``Most of the fentanyl on  the black market is not from the medical supply; it is produced  illegally. Though some fentanyl enters U.S. markets directly via the  dark web, most fentanyl is being added to the drug supply before it  enters the U.S., so domestic sellers may not know their drug products  are contaminated with fentanyl. There are public health and harm  reduction responses to fentanyl that are effective in reducing overdose  deaths.''   I am interested in learning more as to whether extending Fentanyl as  a Schedule I drug or even making it permanent as a Schedule I drug will  increase penalties for fentanyl, that will simply end up increasing  penalties for heroin and contribute to more incarceration. Lastly, I  think we should all be concerned about the long-term effects of  extending the temporary scheduling order would have on communities of  color as well as low income communities in both urban and rural  America.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I look forward to  working with her, and I look forward to getting a better bill in the  future.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the underlying bill  by Representative Pressley, and I thank her for her outstanding  leadership. And I rise, in particular, to support the reasonable, smart  amendment of Mr. Cohen. It says very clearly that it is the sole  reason.   Let me be clear again, to my good friend. A credit score, or owing  bills, is not criminal. It is not a criminal act. It doesn't in any way  diminish your ability to do your job.   One percent of the American people own 90 percent of the wealth. That  means that students with debt, and millennials, mostly, are not in that  category. That means that you are not encouraging leadership if you use  a credit score as the sole reason for denying an able leader that  happens to be a millennial to get a job. I am outraged and insulted by  the premise.   Mr. Cohen's amendment is a smart amendment that indicates, give these  individuals a chance, as does the underlying bill by Ms. Pressley.   I rise enthusiastically to give relief to millennials and those with  major student debt; one, under this act; and two, under Mr. Cohen's  amendment not to deny them a job.   I support the Cohen amendment. I support the underlying bill by Ms.  Pressley, the Comprehensive CREDIT Act of 2020, and I believe we should  vote ``yes'' on that amendment and ``yes'' on the bill. Do our job for  the millennials.
