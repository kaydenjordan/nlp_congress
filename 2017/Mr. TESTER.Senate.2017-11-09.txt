 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent due to a  family funeral for the votes on confirmation of Executive Calendar No.  407 and the motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 159.   On vote No. 268, had I been present, I would have voted nay on the  confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 407.   On vote No. 269, had I been present, I would have voted yea on the  motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 159.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the prisoners  of war and those missing in action and commemorate the empty chair that  was placed in Emancipation Hall this Veterans Day week.   I want to thank Montana veteran Ed Saunders for contributing his  thoughts to today's Congressional Record:         The greatest tragedy befalling an American serviceman or       woman is not that they may be killed or left missing-in-      action: that is the greatest sacrifice on the altar of       freedom.        The greatest tragedy is that America's finest in uniform       may be forgotten . . . forgotten in life and in forgotten in       death by the very same nation whose constitution, freedoms,       and way of life, they defend.        The United States of America cannot and must not leave any       serviceman or woman behind in body, in spirit, or in memory.        If we cannot bring home the revered mortal remains of those       who died, who are missing, or who remain unaccounted for,       then we have an enduring responsibility to ensure their       memory remains forever etched in these hallowed halls.    This chair is more than a symbol. It is a memory of their service and  sacrifice for this great Nation. It is a lasting reminder that we have  an obligation to fulfill our promise to our Nation's veterans and their  families when they return from war--and when they tragically don't.   We, as a nation, must redouble our commitment to that cause and work  relentlessly every day toward fulfilling that promise.   I want to thank every servicemember in attendance, your families, the  families of the fallen and missing in action, and those who remember  them.   Thank you, and God Bless America.                            ____________________
