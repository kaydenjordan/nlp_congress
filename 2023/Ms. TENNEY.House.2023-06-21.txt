 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the CHOICE  Arrangement Act and my Small Business Flexibility Act, which is  included in the underlying bill as the chairman just recognized.   Over the past 10 years, health insurance premiums have gone up 130  percent, and deductibles have increased by 125 percent, and that is on  average. It is even greater in some areas, especially for small  business owners.   This lack of affordability has led to the percentage of small  businesses providing health insurance decreasing from almost 45 percent  to 31 percent today. In addition, 75 percent of businesses with fewer  than 200 employees now only offer one healthcare choice. That is no  choice.   Small business operators want to provide for their employees. They  want to offer competitive benefits that promote choice in the  marketplace while prioritizing excellent care, quality, and  affordability. The problem is these costs are simply prohibitive.   We should not accept this as the status quo, and, thankfully, there  are commonsense solutions that can help small businesses lower cost and  increase choice for their employees.   Recent surveys have found that 70 percent of small businesses are not  even aware of the flexible opportunities to help them provide  affordable health insurance as a benefit to their employees, such as  the Small Business Healthcare Tax Credit, CHOICE Arrangement Act, and  Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangements.   My Small Business Flexibility Act will close this awareness gap by  requiring the Treasury Department to notify and educate small  businesses on the flexible coverage options.   Small employers want to provide these benefits to their employees  for, among so many other reasons, long-term retention to allow them to  ensure that they have high quality of life, and each of them has access  to healthcare.   It is time that we increased awareness of these programs and address  any obstacles to their successful and effective implementation.  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support the CHOICE Arrangement Act  and the Small Business Flexibility Act.                                time  1545
