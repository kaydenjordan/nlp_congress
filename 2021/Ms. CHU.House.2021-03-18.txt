 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6, the  American Dream and Promise Act, to put Dreamers and TPS and DED  immigrants on a path to citizenship.   These are our friends, neighbors, and colleagues. They have graduated  from our schools, served in our military, and worked in our  communities. During the pandemic, they have kept our country running  with over 200,000 Dreamers and over 130,000 TPS holders in essential  jobs at hospitals, grocery stores, and schools.   As the chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, I  know this is important to so many, including the Asian-American and  Pacific Islander community, who are 7 percent of the entire population  but 16 percent of the undocumented. That means there are well over  100,000 Asian-American immigrants who urgently need relief.   This bill means so much to so many. I urge a ``yes'' vote for H.R. 6.
