 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As we return to the Capitol this week, there remains countless crises  which demand our attention: children still separated from their  families; children being murdered on school grounds, while this body  stands idly by doing nothing, turning a blind eye to gun violence.   We have trade wars started by this President which are raising the  cost of businesses in our communities and putting some companies out of  business.   Finally, the government runs out of funding at the end of the month,  the end of this month, Mr. Speaker. We find ourselves facing yet  another Republican government shutdown.   But instead of funding the government and averting a shutdown, the  majority has decided that these two bills are the best use of our time.  That is right. The majority believes that the best use of what precious  legislative time remains, 10 days, is to codify a DOE rulemaking that  was just recently finalized.   Why don't we provide some meaningful oversight over this  administration?   We have agency after agency attacking our Nation's workers, students,  homeowners, and the health of our environment. We have a President who  is starting trade wars and, reportedly, is itching to start real wars.   But instead, all the majority is interested in doing is bringing  unnecessary bills on the margins, such as the ones that we are  considering today.   The first bill, H.R. 4606, will codify into law a Department of  Energy rulemaking that went into effect less than 3 weeks ago. H.R.  4606 is a solution in search of a problem. The current approval process  is working.   However, by enshrining this rule into law, the majority is, in  essence, saying that all small scale exports of LNG are always and will  always be in the public's interest and will continue to be so. This is  shortsighted and, if it turns out to be wrong, it will be much harder  to correct this policy once it becomes law than if it were to remain a  current DOE rule.   In addition, we are considering H.R. 1635, the Empowering Students  Through Enhanced Financial Counseling Act.   I wish to credit my Republican colleagues. This is a bipartisan bill.  This is an example of what can be done when bills are given full  hearings, a markup, and represent the consensus of the people's House.   Unfortunately, the benefits of this bill are mitigated by actions  from this administration that make it harder for students. For example,  this past February, Republicans on the Education and the Workforce  Committee passed the PROSPER Act.   The so-called PROSPER Act is a highly partisan reauthorization of the  Higher Education Act that cuts nearly $15 billion from Federal student  aid, leaving students with more expensive loans that are more difficult  to repay; more expensive loans for young Americans with the highest  interest rates in nearly a decade.   And just last week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's  student loan ombudsman, whose job was to protect student borrowers from  predatory lending practices, resigned, resigned from his position. In  his resignation letter, Seth Frotman wrote that the Trump  administration has ``turned its back on young people and their  financial futures.''   Mr. Frotman also stated that under the leadership of Acting Director  Mulvaney, ``. . . the Bureau has abandoned the very consumers it is  tasked by Congress with protecting'' and that Director Mulvaney has ``.  . . used the Bureau to serve the wishes of the most powerful financial  companies in America,'' not surprising to me.   Mr. Frotman wrote that the Bureau has failed student loan borrowers.   While this bill may help, H.R. 1635, in no way, reverses the damage  this administration has caused our students.   Congress is supposed to be a check on the administration, not a  rubber stamp.   The rule we are considering makes in order two amendments to H.R.  4606 and seven amendments in order to H.R. 1635.   I am deeply disappointed that my two amendments were not made in  order to H.R. 1635. My amendments would have helped students who have  suffered from the closure of schools or school branches.   When schools close, it is the students who are the real losers. They  are saddled with debt and left having to navigate a complicated process  for loan relief.                                time  1230    The two amendments I offered would have streamlined the process for  students to have their loans discharged, ensuring that bureaucracy  didn't slow down providing these students the relief that they need,  and fixed the Pell grant process to make sure that students wouldn't be  limited in pursuing their educational goals at a new institution. These  are bipartisan ideas, which have been reviewed by the current  administration.   I am disappointed that the House wouldn't even allow an open process;  however, I am certainly not surprised. After all, this is the most  closed Congress in our Nation's history. I hope that we can aim to do  better and give our constituents a real debate in this House.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as the cost to attend college has continued to rise, so  has the amount of debt students and their parents have had to take on.  According to the Federal Reserve, the outstanding loan debt stands at  approximately $1.5 trillion and climbing. This debt load has hampered  the ability of young graduates to buy their first home, a car, or start  a small business.   Congress needs to do more to help students and their parents deal  with the student loan crisis. This is why I rise today to offer my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle the opportunity to pass a  comprehensive bill to ensure that every student has a path to a debt- free degree or credential that leads to a rewarding career.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 6543, the Aim Higher Act. This  thoughtful proposal invests in our students, making higher education  more affordable while also addressing the rising costs of college.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The House is currently scheduled to be in session for just 10 days  before funding for the government runs out--10 days. And while the  House has passed partisan appropriation bills, none of them have been  signed into law. If Congress fails to act, it will be the third time  the government has shut down in 2018 alone--the third time.   Let me remind my friends on the other side of the aisle that the  Republican Party is in charge of the House. The Republican Party is in  charge of the Senate and the White House. President Trump is again  playing games, and without leadership from this House and our  colleagues in the Senate, his desire for a government shutdown will  cause real people pain and hurt our growing economy.   Three thousand Federal workers in my district have heard President  Trump tell them that they are the reason that we are in debt. Three  thousand workers in my district and 2 million nationally are wondering  if they will be furloughed, while corporations and millionaires get  massive tax cuts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question and  the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
