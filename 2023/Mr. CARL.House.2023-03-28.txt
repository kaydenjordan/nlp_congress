 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Lower  Energy Costs Act.   I did not bring any fancy charts. I don't have any nice pictures for  you to look at. But what I do want you to look through is my heart and  my mind.   In 64 years of living, I have spent the last 2 years working with the  other side of the aisle, watching them systematically take this country  apart when it comes to our natural resources. Enough is enough.   You want me to prove it?   We just won the House. We have the majority now. We have a chance to  change what is going on today.   Let me tell you what is going on. All we hear is: The sky is falling.  The sky is falling.   I encourage people to get out from wherever you are hiding and look  around, smell the fresh air, look at the sun shining. It is not  falling.   It is like dealing with a bunch of guys practicing magic. They want  you to watch one hand while they are picking your pocket with the other  hand. I have had enough. I have had enough, and I think it is time we  talk about it.   They have systematically shut down our copper mine, the largest  copper mine on the North American Continent and in the world, so I  understand. They have shut it down.   Who are we buying copper from now? China, a communist country we are  buying all that copper from.   Excuse me. I have got a problem with that.   I look at my oil refineries and my gas refineries down in Alabama and  outside of Alabama.   Those gas refineries, do you know what they are refining?   Venezuelan oil. Not American oil. Venezuelan oil from a communist  country.   Is there a pattern here that we should be looking at? Is there a  pattern of a communist regime here that we just keep getting pushed on  us?   I just spent 2 weeks in Central America trying to figure out how we  can keep a communist country from taking over Central America. But we  have this side of the aisle that wants to tell us the sky is falling. I  refuse to believe it, and I refuse to give it up.   Voters made their voice heard last November when they sent  Republicans to Congress to put an end to Democrats' anti-American  agenda.   Americans are paying 40 percent more for their gas since President  Biden took office, and the Democrats have done nothing but add fuel to  the fire to raise that price by shutting down our drilling and shutting  down our mines.   On the other hand, House Republicans this week are moving forward  with the Lower Energy Costs Act, this act, which has two primary  objectives here: Increasing American energy production--not communist-- and to strip away the rules and regulations that make it harder for  American infrastructure to grow this economy.                                time  1600    I am especially proud of this bill because I worked on part of it.  The Unleashing American Energy Act is included in this package. My bill  fights back on the Biden administration's war on our domestic energy  production by mandating oil and gas lease sales each year in the Gulf  of Mexico and off the coast of Alaska.   Let me remind my friends, most of these are union jobs. Unions are  supporting you. Remember that. These are union jobs you are voting  against.   House Republicans have a solution right here in this lower energy  costs bill. I encourage all of my friends to vote on this bill. This  bill will help end our reliance on these foreign countries--these  foreign Communist countries. We need to reflect on that as we vote.   Madam Chair, if you support the Communist Party, vote ``no'' on this  bill. If you support American jobs and if you support American  families, vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1.
