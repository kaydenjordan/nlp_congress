 Mr. President, I come to the floor tonight to join my  colleagues to raise concern about a proposed Senate healthcare bill  that might move through the U.S. Senate, as my colleagues are pointing  out, without a hearing, without attention to details, actually almost  in secret. I guess it would be secret--if we didn't know exactly what  was in the House bill, it would be even more secret. People have said  it is probably going to be 80 percent of what is in the House bill.   I can tell you, I agree with President Trump. That was a mean bill.  So if it is just 80 percent mean, I guarantee it is still going to be  mean.   I say that because I have been at home listening to my constituents,  and they do not appreciate it one bit. If you are Harborview Medical  Center and you are a public hospital and you are going to cut $627  million out of their budget because of your cap on Medicaid and you are  going to leave a regional hospital without resources, they are mad.   If you are talking about children's hospitals and they see children  who are on Medicaid and they are not going to be able to see those  children or get coverage, they are mad.   Just Saturday I was with veterans in Vancouver, WA. People don't  understand, but veterans of the United States of America do not get all  of their healthcare coverage through the VA. They get it with Medicaid  at individual clinics for services. I have met several of these people  in my State, and they have told me point-blank, without access to  Medicaid, they would not get the benefits they need as veterans of our  country.   I think it is mean to break our promise to veterans and not give them  access to Medicaid. I think this whole discussion is basically the fact  that we are trying to box with these guys on a proposal. If their  proposal is so great, they should come to the Senate floor and just-- don't even talk about the bill, talk about the principles.   I want to know, in the Republican proposal, what ideas do you have to  lower costs, increase the quality of care, or improve access. Those are  the milestones by which you should be debating healthcare.   Now, if your goal is to just cut Medicaid and cut people off Medicaid  and cut their benefits so you can give tax breaks to the rich, OK, you  might convince me that, yes, you have a proposal--because I think that  is exactly what their proposal is--but if your proposal is about  reducing costs, then come out here and debate it. Don't even tell me  what is in the bill; just show up on the Senate floor and debate us and  say: Here is our idea for reducing costs.   I will tell you what my idea of reducing costs is because I wrote it  into the Affordable Care Act and some States are doing it and it was a  good idea. It was called give the individual who doesn't work for a big  employer the ability to negotiate with clout and be bundled up with  other people. That is what they did for the working poor in New York.  So 650,000 people in New York are now on something called the Basic  Health Program. Why? Because they didn't work for an employer that  could negotiate a big discount for them.   We asked, on our side of the aisle: Why would we let poor people just  get thrown around in the market and not be able to drive a decent  price? I call it the Costco model. So we said to them: We are going to  let you be bundled up like the big employer is and you are going to be  able to drive a decent price in the marketplace. That plan is giving a  family, with $40,000 a year of income and four individuals in the  family, a yearly annual premium of about $500 instead of $1,500 on the  exchange.   So that is an idea. So come out here and discuss that or, if you want  to tell me you have figured out a way to give better quality of care, I  would love to hear that idea. I would love for you to come out and tell  me how you are going to deliver better quality of care because I can  tell you there are things in this bill that are about quality of care.  They are about improving the way that organizations deliver care so  they are rewarded for achieving better outcomes for patients.   The whole idea of accountable care organizations are that you put the  patient at the center of the delivery system, and you reward them for  doing a good job of delivering better outcomes. We have innovated. We  have innovated in the Affordable Care Act. If you are talking about  access, come out and tell us what proposal you have that is about  increasing the access to healthcare. I would love to hear it because in  the Affordable Care Act, we already did that too. We said: You know  what. It is kind of crazy and expensive to think that everybody who  ages, particularly in Medicaid, should spend time in a nursing home.  Why? It is more expensive, and I don't think I have met one  Washingtonian who told me they really wanted to go to a nursing home.  They want to stay at home.   So we wrote into the Affordable Care Act incentives for States to  change the delivery system, as we have done in the State of Washington,  and deliver affordable care to people at home in their communities. By  gosh, actually some States--Texas, Arizona, Indiana, other States--took  us up on it. They said: What a great idea. We want to reduce costs.    So if that is such a great working aspect of the Affordable Care Act  and you think it works and it increases access to care by giving people  community-based care and reduces Medicaid costs, come out here and talk  about it. Talk about what you want to do to put that program on  steroids so more people in America can benefit from better access to  care and not think they are going to spend their last days in a nursing  home. That is what we should be debating. But we can't even see or hear  or have a hearing about what this proposal is. Yet my colleagues can't  even come out here and throw a concept on the table.   But the fact that you want to affect over 1 million veterans who have  fought for our country and you are going to cut many of them off of the  Medicaid care they deserve to have access to--that is a broken promise.  It is just as broken a promise as what President Trump said. President  Trump tweeted: I was the first and only GOP candidate to state that  there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. So I  am not surprised that he calls it a mean bill. But he should also own  up that it cuts Medicaid.   We all have an office budget. I see my colleague from Virginia here.  If we took our office budget and said: We are going to cut it and cap  it, and next year it is going to be lower, and next year it is going to  be lower, and next year--in perpetuity--that is what their idea is, it  is to put a cap on Medicaid and cut it in perpetuity and basically cut  it out of existence.   I don't know why they are beating up on Medicaid, because Medicaid  has provided great stability to so many people in our country. It has  lifted people out of poverty, provided healthcare, stabilized  communities, and raised the economic standard of living in many  communities in our country.   I received a letter from a superintendent from the Vancouver School  District. He wrote to me about the devastating impacts that capping  Medicaid would have on his students. He wrote:         Our school-based Medicaid programs serve as a lifeline to       children who can't access critical healthcare and services       outside of their school.    He goes on to say:         Restructuring Medicaid to a per capita cap system would       undermine Vancouver Public Schools' ability to provide       America's neediest children access to vital healthcare       [insurance].    So why would we do this?   I met a veteran, Kristina, who is 46 years old and a full-time  student. She suffers from chronic and disabling injuries and needs a  high level of care. The care she gets from Medicaid helps her access  the medication that manages her chronic care and keeps her going,  [[Page S3590]]  and she is working toward that degree. Why would we cut somebody like  that--a veteran--off of Medicaid just because someone's idea over here  is to cap and reduce Medicaid?   These stories are from all over the country, and people are  wondering: Why would you take this level of investment in Medicaid out  of our entire economic system? Why would you impact our school  districts, our regional hospitals, our veterans, our Medicaid  population? Why would you affect a community that has a large Medicaid  base?   And that is the way they serve them. Our hospitals have told us: We  have stabilized private insurance premiums because more of the  population is covered and has access to Medicaid.   You rip that back, and we will be back to skyrocketing costs, with  people in the emergency room, no access to care other than that  facility, with impacts on everybody on private insurance and on  Medicaid. It is just not a good idea.   So I ask my colleagues, come out here. Don't say you want a patient- centered healthcare delivery system, because we are all for that, and  we actually put things in the Affordable Care Act that did that and are  working. If you want to make that claim, come out here and say what it  is that you don't like about the patient-centered delivery system that  we are working on promoting, and how you want to change it. If you say  your proposal increases access to Americans, let's hear it, if it is  about better quality. But I don't hear any of that. I just hear a  drumbeat by some people who want to be heartless and cut people who  have access to healthcare, people who are less fortunate in our  society, because they want to cut Medicaid.   The President promised he wasn't going to do that. I ask my  colleagues to live up to that, and let's start talking about the  substance that truly will increase access, lower costs, and give better  care to our constituents and the people of the United States of  America.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
