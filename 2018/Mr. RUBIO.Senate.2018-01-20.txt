 Mr. President, it might surprise some people here that  while what we are dealing with here is important, we are not the center  of the universe. All across this country, as I was reminded this  morning when calling home and speaking with friends and family and my  wife and my children, life goes on.   Most Americans, I think, are aware that there is an issue going on  here in Washington, DC, with regard to funding the government. But I  doubt very few of them are sitting in front of the CNN countdown clock,  where I guess now we are on the ticker because we are into the  shutdown, living it--some sort of reality drama. It doesn't mean it is  not important, but it is a reality that life goes on. People aren't  following this every single day and aren't checking their phones on a  15-minute basis to find out how this thing is going to be fixed.   I think a lot of people are a little bit confused about what is  happening here. If you are just listening to it off the top, in between  things or maybe on the radio, maybe some people have the perception  that this is all about a disagreement regarding the budget and/or a  disagreement solely about an issue that is of critical importance, and  we need to deal with it right away. That is just not accurate. I will  get to that in a moment. But it is still hard for people to understand  how this happens.   When I explain to people where we are and how we got here, it doesn't  make sense to a lot of people. I want to begin by saying, the Bible  says that there is nothing new under the Sun. It is one of the things  that came into my mind early this morning.   I had occasion a few weeks ago, around the New Year, to spend some  time with my family at the wonderful national park facilities, which I  hope are open today, in Philadelphia and in the halls where our  Constitution, the very document that designed our system of government,  that each of us appeals to, that each of us has sworn allegiance to,  was debated. That debate was a contentious one. It began on the 23rd of  May and ended on the 17th of September of the year 1787. It was  actually contentious from the start. In fact, the New York delegation  stayed only a few days, and the delegation from Rhode Island straight- out boycotted it.   What is ironic, by the way, is one of the most contentious issues in  that Constitutional Convention was the creation of the Senate. The  creation of this body was a heated discussion. We don't know a lot  about the details of that discussion because they had closed the  windows, even though it was hot. They didn't go around talking about  it. There weren't 24-hour news cycles and Twitter, but we know it was  contentious. We know that in the end, this Constitution that we all  swear allegiance to and that for over two centuries has helped create  an exceptional system of government was approved by 39 of the 55  delegates.   There were people who voted against the Constitution. The one thing  that was clear is that none of them got everything they wanted. At that  time, by the end of that convention--in fact, Monday, September 17,  1787, was the last day of that convention, and one of the delegates was  someone named Benjamin Franklin. We all know who that is. He was  internationally well known. He wanted to give a short speech to that  convention before signing it. He was actually too weak to do the speech  himself, so he had someone else deliver the speech. Based on the notes  that Madison took, here is what we know, generally, he said. It begins  with a line that says:         I confess that there are several parts of this constitution       which I do not at present approve.    He goes on to say:         I agree to this Constitution with all of its faults.    He says:         I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may       be able to make a better Constitution. For when you assemble       a number of men to have the advantage of their joint wisdom,       you inevitably assemble with those men, all their prejudices,       their passions, their errors of opinion, their local       interests, and their selfish views. From such an assembly can       a perfect production be expected?    So right from the very beginning in the history of this Nation, we  have acknowledged that in order to make progress, it is virtually  impossible for everybody in that process to get everything they want.  Our job is to move things forward--and I don't want to read the whole  thing--but suffice it to  [[Page S389]]  say, Franklin's point is maybe he was wrong. He is not perfect. Even  though many of us tend to believe we are the only people who are right  on this issue, at that stage in his life, he had learned enough to  understand he was not the holder of all wisdom; that he had changed his  mind on issues when he came upon new information. He also understood  that when you bring a group of people together and ask them to come to  agreement on something, unless they are clones of one another or unless  they all come from the same thought process, you are going to have  disagreement, but in order to reach a conclusion, everyone is going to  have to get something they need even though no one is going to get  everything they want. That was from the very beginning from our very  Founders, and it was hard then.   Imagine now, in the 21st century, with 50 States and several  territories, extraordinary diversity in terms of ideology, opinion,  geography, background, and all of it covered by 24-hour news, which  basically covers American politics like entertainment, and Twitter  feeds on both sides that are constantly driving narratives. Imagine if  they had Twitter and 24-hour news during the Constitutional Convention?  A, we would know a lot more about what they were saying to and about  each other and, B, we may never have had a Constitution, simply because  of exacerbating those tensions.   I am not here to say we should not have Twitter and 24-hour news, but  I am telling you these were factors that were always difficult. Self- government was always hard. Imagine today, with these additional  factors of diversity and the way politics is covered, practiced, and  discussed. I say that because there is a growing temptation from  American politics that largely comes from the base of both parties but  often is fed through media narratives, but the goal is to achieve total  victory.   Total victory is what you want to achieve in a sporting event. You  want to win and beat your opponent by as many points as possible, but  in a constitutional republic, total victory is nearly impossible,  especially in a country like America. It is impossible--impossible--for  a President, for any party, or for a faction on any issue to get 100  percent of what they want all the time.   Instinctively, despite the fact that they don't work here every day,  despite the fact that they don't sit glued in front of the television  all day watching politics, most Americans understand this. They know  this because it is a reality of life, and they know it instinctively  because that is the way our system was designed. That is the way self- government was supposed to function. It is hard. Self-government has  never been easy, and it has only gotten harder.   So when you talk to someone and you explain what has happened, here  are the facts. We had a government funding deadline, meaning that if by  midnight this morning we had not passed a bill to authorize more  spending, we had a sort of mini-shutdown or partial shutdown of the  government. There is a provision that was put in law by President Obama  that gave status to young people who were brought into this country  illegally by their parents, through no fault of their own, and that  provision expires on the 5th of March, about 43 days away.   We have a bill before the Senate that funds the government, that  keeps it open for 4 weeks--initially. I think now we are down to--with  this proposal before the Senate, I think it is going to end on the 9th,  so about 3 weeks. There is nothing in that bill that the Democrats are  against, but they voted against that bill last night. They are not  letting us vote on the other bill today--right now--and intend to vote  against it, apparently, when we do vote on it Monday morning, because  they want to see their demands met on something that doesn't expire for  43 days.   So this is not about whether you are for or against doing something  about DACA. It is not because it is not like the government funding  expired last night and DACA expired last night and so you have to do  both. This is the government funding expired last night and DACA  expires in 43 days. When you explain that to people--why would--how  does that work? Why does that make sense? Why would they do this?   In fairness, I listened to the argument of my Democratic colleagues,  and one of the arguments they make is they don't trust the Republican  Party on the issue of DACA, but more particularly they don't trust the  President to deal with it. So they need to force action now. They need  to do something, and they need to use government funding as the  leverage to force something to happen. Let me say at the outset that it  is a legitimate tool in the toolbox of the legislator on a matter of  deep principle to not vote on an important bill in order to get  leverage for what you want. If there is something you are deeply  principled about and you believe we need to do, it is a legitimate tool  to say: I know you really need to do this, and I really need to do  that, so I am not going to let you do what you need to do unless you  let me do what I need to do. I think that is the argument they are  making now.   As I pointed out to you earlier, this is not kind of the same because  this is a spending bill. In fact, the bill they voted against would  expire even before the March 5 deadline. In essence, we would have to  have another government funding vote even before we got to March 5, so  it is really not a leverage argument.   Even if it were, I would say that in order for self-government to  work as I have described already, we have to be judicious and careful  about how we use these tools. You can't be using them all the time. You  have to reserve them for key moments for a lot of reasons.   The first, frankly, is international implications. We can talk a lot  about Russian interference that occurred. The goal of Russian  interference above all else is to sow discord and to create conflict  and controversy in American politics so Putin can go around the world  saying America likes to lecture everyone about democracy, but their  democracy is not a real democracy and their leaders are corrupt and  their elections are rigged and all kinds of stuff. That is what he  wanted to drive.   There are nations like China which under our nose are rapidly working  to change the world in our time. While we spend all these days arguing  with each other about whatever the outrage of the day is--and every day  it is something else--China is working underneath us and all around us  to rebuild the world in their image and to their advantage and to our  detriment. One of the things they tell other countries is, Americans  have a country in decline. These people are in total decline. They are  abandoning the world and, more importantly, they can't even govern  themselves. So we are doing their job for them when we create these  sorts of controversies.    That doesn't mean we shouldn't have heated debates on tough issues,  and that shouldn't mean that from time to time people reserve the  right--and I reserve the right--to use leverage to achieve our goals. I  have done it before, and I imagine I will do it again, but we have to  be careful about it because it does impact the way the world views us.  People watch us all over the world. They don't understand, as some of  us do, that this stuff happens, and it all works out. They think,  literally, some places believe we are crumbling, being ripped apart at  the seams, and it encourages people to do things and nations to do  things sometimes through miscalculation. That is the first reason you  want to be careful.   The second reason you want to be judicious about using these sorts of  tools is because, quite frankly, it poisons the process. I would state  that the abuse and overuse of these prerogatives of Senators over the  last decade has done tremendous damage to the Senate, and it really has  impacted our ability to tackle and to solve real problems. I say that  as someone who acknowledges the Republicans have done this. Republicans  did this kind of stuff. I would argue it was different, but it doesn't  matter. Republicans used leverage in situations that people thought we  shouldn't have used. Democratic activists now insist that Democrats use  the same tool. They did it when they were in the minority, and you need  to do it now when you are in the minority.   I would also say we have to be careful because, the truth is, we all  have matters of deep principle. I have matters of deep principle that  haven't been addressed yet.   I have a matter of deep principle, and as much as I believe we need  to do something about DACA, I have a matter of deep principle that I  believe is  [[Page S390]]  more urgent and requires attention right away. The people of Florida  and the people of Puerto Rico and the people of Texas have a desperate  need for disaster relief. Forty percent of the island of Puerto Rico  has no electricity. This is a U.S. territory. American citizens are  living in third-world conditions.   In the State of Florida, our citrus growers are in critical  condition. We may not have a U.S. citrus industry based in Florida if  this goes on much longer. We still have people living in hotels and  motel rooms in Florida because their homes were destroyed. That is a  real need that doesn't have any deadline. They needed it yesterday, and  we still haven't addressed it. I suppose if I wanted to use this tool-- and some maybe encouraged me to do that--I could come and say: I am not  voting on any funding for the government, and I will shut down the  government until we deal with disaster relief. The problem is, all 99  other Senators have a principled position as well. So basically all we  do is take hostages all day on every principled issue we have at every  opportunity we get. Well, you get the picture, and this is happening  more and more.   By the way, I say all this to you, understanding that if we passed a  long-term funding bill--let's say the bill before us funded government  through October, and I voted for that and disaster relief hasn't  happened yet, there is no guarantee we would get disaster relief. What  leverage would I have? So we have to be very judicious about how we use  it. I ultimately decided not to do it because I believe the government  shutdown ends up hurting the people I am trying to help with disaster  relief. There are Federal employees in Puerto Rico who got hit by a  hurricane a few months ago and now can't go to work on Monday. If they  go to work, they are not getting paid, and it is already difficult over  there.   There are Federal services in Florida. People are going to call our  offices around the country and in Florida on Monday, and even if I have  essential staff there to answer the call, there may not be an employee  at the Federal agency, where we can pick up the phone and intervene on  their behalf. It happens all the time. One of the very common things we  face in calls we get is someone has a loved one or relative who was  visiting somewhere around the world, maybe in the Western Hemisphere,  they were killed in an accident, and they want to bring their body home  to be buried. We have to deal with all the paperwork with the Embassy  or the consulate and the host country to bring them home. We are not  going to be there on Monday to do it because the people we have to call  might not even be there to answer the call. In the end, my view of it  is, you don't cut off your nose to spite your face, and at this point,  you don't shut down the government only to hurt them somewhere else.   At the end of the day, this really is not about leverage. It is not.  I say this with the highest respect. We disagree on a lot of issues,  but the Democratic leader is someone I know understands legislation and  understands politics. I personally do not believe this is about  leverage. He has to know this because this is really no different than  in December. We passed a short-term spending bill in December.  Democratic Members voted for that, and the DACA issue was unresolved at  the time.   By the way, we had a chance to deal with disaster relief in December  too. They sent a disaster relief bill over from the House to the  Senate, and the Republican leader chose not to take it up--I believe  because he wanted to hold it over for this debate. The more things that  are pending, the more leverage you have to pose to them. I mean we were  going to put additional things on the House bill and send it back. We  knew what those things were, but suffice it to say, everything is  unresolved, but I don't think this is purely about leverage.   Here is what I actually think this is about, and I am here to cite  some examples why. In December, as I said, before we got ready to leave  for the end of the year, there were a lot of activists involved in the  DACA issue that were really pounding on the Democrats to shut down the  government unless DACA was handled. To their credit, a number of  Democratic Senators didn't do so. They voted not to shut down the  government, and the end result was they unleashed a fury of assaults,  in terms of pressure and protests and sleep-ins and all kinds of  things. This really started in October.   I have a number of articles I want to cite. Let's go to October 2,  2017. This is an article that talks about--I will quote from it. I  underlined the key provisions. ``Democrats seeking an immigration deal  . . . are facing resistance from immigrant activists who are rejecting  any compromise that would tighten border security and demanding more  extensive legislation to protect . . . immigrants from deportation.''   It goes on to say: ``Despite Democratic leaders' declared commitment  to help so-called Dreamers . . . they are catching sustained flak from  immigration activists.''   It goes on to say the minority leader in the House, Congresswoman  Pelosi, ``faced a vociferous protest from Dreamers a few weeks ago,  when activists shouted down her speech and called her a `liar' who  helped create a `deportation machine.'''   If you haven't seen the video, she did a press conference in, I  believe, San Francisco. As she was there doing this press conference  for Dreamers, these other Dream activist people showed up and started  screaming at her.   For those of us on my side of the aisle, we view her as one of the  more liberal Members in Congress and certainly someone I have  identified as a supporter of the Dream Act. Then you have people saying  the Dream Act isn't enough, you have to cover other people. So they are  under a lot of pressure.   Here is a quote from an immigrant rights activist and a DACA  recipient. He said: ``I think Senator Schumer crumbles under pressure  just so he can deliver on something.''   These are harsh words from these activists, and this started in  October of last year.   Now, let's go to this article of December 19. This article begins by  saying:         Dozens of immigration advocates rallied outside Sen. Chuck       Schumer's Manhattan office Tuesday.        In both Spanish and English, speakers at the rally demanded       that the Senate minority leader ask his fellow Democrats to       refrain from supporting any legislation until a clean Dream       Act is passed.    A clean Dream Act means just vote for the Dream Act, nothing else--no  border security or, by the way, any legislation; don't vote for  anything until that happens. That is the pressure they were under.   The article goes on to say:         As Congress negotiates the budget, protesters called for       Schumer to help shut down the government if a Dream Act isn't       passed by the end of the year, chanting, ``If we don't get       it, shut it down.''    Those are the quotes. This was in December. So this article was  December 19; this must have been December 18, and the chant outside his  office in Manhattan was ``If we don't get it, shut it down.'' So the  calls for a shutdown began as far back as December, not 43 days before  the deadline but 60 or 70 days before the deadline.   Finally, the spokeswoman for the minority leader put out a statement  for, I believe, the protesters, and, I guess, the press was assembled.  She said:         We want to make sure nothing passes until we have the Dream       Act in there.    They were already telegraphing this in December, so this is not  something that has happened in the last 2 days or 3 days. This was  ongoing and sustained pressure.   There is more. On December 21, there was an article in the Washington  Post. The headline is ``In private meeting, Schumer angrily confronted  by Hispanic Caucus members as prospects for DACA deal slip again.'' It  begins:         Disagreements among Democrats over how to keep fighting to       enact legal protections for immigrant ``dreamers'' boiled       over in the office of Senate Minority Leader Charles E.       Schumer on Thursday as he met with members of the       Congressional Hispanic Caucus in what several participants       described as a tense and heated exchange.        With just a few minutes' notice, they showed up in the       lobby of Schumer's suite across from the Senate floor in       hopes of pressing him to persuade more Senators to vote       against the GOP spending plan that was set to be approved in       the coming hours.        The latest short-term spending plan was set for approval as       Democrats this week backed off a pledge to force a vote this       month over the fate of thousands of undocumented immigrants       brought to this country as children. The decision angered       immigration activists.   [[Page S391]]     Later in the article:         Several people who attended the meeting, granted anonymity       to describe what was expected to be a private exchange, said       the meeting with Schumer began with cordial remarks.        Rep. Luis Gutierrez . . . unloaded on Schumer, accusing him       and Democratic senators of not caring about the fate of       dreamers and ``throwing them under the bus.''        In response, Schumer raised his voice, telling Gutierrez       not to insult fellow Democrats.        Gutierrez shot back, telling Schumer, ``Don't raise your       voice.''        [A] few other caucus members made pointed comments toward       Schumer.    Later in the day, Gutierrez tweeted after all that: ``The fight  continues in January . . . I think [we] are [all] on the same page.''   Incredible pressure is being mounted the whole time.   There is one more thing I will cite here, and this is from the New  Yorker on January 18.         [M]any Democratic activists are demanding that Schumer and       other elected Democrats vote against the G.O.P. spending bill       even at the risk of a government shutdown. . . . On       Wednesday, three protesters from the Dream Action Coalition .       . . were arrested while demonstrating outside Schumer's       office in New York City.        Some Democratic activists and strategists are arguing that       the Party should take its stand now while the stench of       Trump's [alleged you-know-what] comment is still hanging in       the air.    So this is all about political pressure. That is the leverage point,  and that is why this is happening. It is untenable. The position they  have established is untenable.   Most people in America just wouldn't agree with this. If you are  being honest with yourself--I challenge anyone to go into any diner in  your State or call 10 people who just kind of follow politics a little  bit but are not activists or whatever and ask them: Do you think it is  right to shut down the government over an issue that we have until  March 5 to fix? Ask them that. Call people and ask them: Do you think  it is a smart thing to do to close the Federal Government over an issue  that we have another 43 days to address? You know what the answer is  going to be; you do. That is why the position they have adopted is  untenable, but that tells you the amount of political pressure they are  under to do this. This is all motivated by that. This is all motivated  by an incredible amount of pressure brought to bear on my Democratic  colleagues--in particular, on the Democratic leader--by activists, and  it brings us to this point.   By the way, I would also argue that the strategy, in addition to  being driven by that, is counterproductive. Yesterday, there was  supposed to be a meeting with the White House and congressional leaders  from both parties to keep working on this issue of DACA. The Democrats  didn't show up, probably because they were too busy dealing with the  shutdown. So this isn't making arriving at a deal for DACA easier; it  is making it harder.   On this argument that they don't trust--if we don't do this, we can't  trust the President is going to do this, I don't think that is true. I  think there is a balance of leverage here that exists that almost  guarantees something can happen if we want something to happen. So  let's begin with facts.    The President of the United States campaigned on a very specific  promise, and we know what that promise was. He was going to build a  wall and secure the border. The President knows that he needs 60 votes  in the Senate. The President knows that he is not going to get a border  wall and get increased security unless we do something about DACA. They  are well aware of that at the White House, and I think they have said  that openly.   What is important to remember, as well, is that there isn't going to  be a deal on DACA unless we have a deal on the wall. That is the way  our system works. I say that to you as someone who supports a wall and  supports dealing with DACA. But as I have already talked about earlier,  in this system of government, it is not a zero-sum game. It cannot be  ``I get the wall and you get nothing,'' and it cannot be ``We get DACA  and even more, and you don't get the wall.'' It is not going to work.   Right now, we have a lot of wasting of time going on, entertaining  ridiculous fantasies about what could be achieved here. A bill that  creates permanent status under DACA but would allow some future  Congress to stop funding the wall isn't going to pass. The President is  not going to sign that. Think about it. If you have a wall that takes  10 years to build and you have DACA that is permanent, the next year  they don't fund it, DACA stays, and the wall is not there. They are not  going to sign that.   A bill that creates a path to citizenship under DACA but then also  allows the recipients of that citizenship to use it to bring in their  parents who brought them into the country illegally--the President is  not going to sign that. That is just reality, and I say this to you as  someone who has tremendous sympathy for the young people who were  brought here as minors, yes, in violation of the law but through no  fault of their own. They didn't commit a crime, and now they find  themselves with no legal immigration status.   It would be a mistake, in my opinion, to allow their status to expire  without a replacement. There are practical reasons why it would be a  mistake. We have spent years and taxpayer money educating them. We  would be hurting their employers. These people are working somewhere  now, and overnight they can't work there anymore. They might own a  business, and you would be hurting the people who work for them. Maybe  they are married to a U.S. citizen; you would be hurting a U.S. citizen  who is their spouse. Maybe they have children who are U.S. citizens,  and these children need those parents. You would be hurting them. These  are the practical reasons we shouldn't let it expire.   There are more reasons we shouldn't let it expire. It is immoral to  have laws that punish anyone for the mistakes their parents made. It is  immoral to deport someone to a country they have never really lived in.  You were 2 years old when you came from Honduras, you don't even speak  Spanish, you don't know anybody there, and they are going to send you  there--it just doesn't feel right.   It is my deepest belief that if DACA expires and 700,000 young adults  who have spent the majority of their lives among us are forced to leave  this country, I think it would be a dark stain on our history. I think  future generations would look back at that and say that was a terrible  thing those people did back then. I think we have more support for what  I just said in the Republican Party than we have ever had in the 7  years that I have been here.   But I have to be fair and I want to be frank. It is also a mistake to  overreach on the other side of this argument. It is fair to argue that  we should deal with DACA because it is the moral and compassionate  thing to do. It is fair to argue that dealing with DACA is in our  national interest, but it is a big mistake to demand a right that does  not exist. There is no right to illegally immigrate to any country on  the planet. No one has a right to DACA, but dealing with DACA is the  right thing to do.   I think it is also overreaching to insist that not only must DACA  recipients be accommodated, but we also have to accommodate their  parents. Maybe because I personally know so many people under these  circumstances, I am personally open to figuring out something that  allows their parents to stay, especially if the children are minors. I  understand that is not a majority position in my party, and I have to  be honest with you that I believe that if we take the position around  here that we are not accepting any deal unless it takes care of both  the DACA recipient and the parent--if that is the hard position we  adopt and people aren't willing to move off of it, I think there may be  no deal at all, and that means that neither the recipients of DACA nor  the parents will have anything.   By the way, I also think it is overreach to oppose a border wall  because you find it symbolically offensive. First, America has a right  and, more importantly, a responsibility to protect its borders and  enforce its laws. Second, there is not going to be a DACA deal of any  kind without a wall, period. Donald Trump is not going to sign, cannot  sign, and will not sign a bill that doesn't have real enforcement. That  is a fact. That has to happen.   So what is the way forward? Right now, the government is shut down.  You won't really notice until Monday, but on Monday people will start  to notice. DACA expires 6 weeks from Monday.  [[Page S392]]  So on Monday, if we haven't done anything, the government will be shut  down, and we have 43 days to go until DACA. I think we need to fund the  government on a short-term basis--maybe it is February 9--and then we  spend the next 3 weeks working on an agreement on defense, an agreement  on disaster relief, and an agreement on border security and DACA.   For Democrats who are worried they don't have leverage, you have  plenty of leverage without shutting down the government. For example,  there are two Republicans who oppose short-term spending in general.  Then you have several Republican Members who oppose any longer term  spending without defense spending increases. In essence, this worry  that you have that they are going to fund the government for just 6  months and walk away from DACA--there are at least five Republicans who  are going to vote no on that, several because of defense and two  because of short-term spending. Then add to that, there are at least  three other Republican Members--myself being one of them--who will have  a lot of trouble voting for a long-term spending plan that doesn't  include disaster relief. That alone gives you leverage to ensure that  not only do those issues need to be dealt with, but all three of them  would have to be dealt with in order for there to be any long-term deal  that forecloses the leverage you want.   You have another piece of leverage: The President needs to fulfill  his campaign promise, which Americans supported at the ballot box:  Build a wall. He knows he can't do that without a DACA deal. So,  really, both sides here have leverage. But as long as the government is  shut down, we are wasting valuable time.   Monday could have been a day that people met and hashed out key  details of DACA. Instead, Monday will probably be all about the  shutdown--and maybe Tuesday and maybe Wednesday. We are wasting time we  do not have.   Finally, as for DACA, what is the way forward on that? There are a  lot of ideas going around. Here is what I would say to you: The  baseline in the core of any agreement is one that basically codifies  DACA, in essence, deals with the President's decision to suspend the  Executive order on it and funds in a way that can guarantee continued  funding the President's immigration enforcement plan. That is the core.  You codify DACA, and you do something to ensure that the wall is going  to be built and that they can't come back and cancel the funding. Then  the Senate can go into an open amendment process and debate any  additional matters you want put in there. For example, maybe there is a  deal that, instead of codifying DACA alone, it actually creates a  pathway to citizenship under DACA, but it eliminates not just DACA  applicants but future applicants from being able to sponsor parents. I  am not saying that it will pass, but that might be a debate that  happens.   Even if you can't reach 60 votes on any of these amendments people  are offering, even if all those amendments fail, in the end, you are at  least left with a bill that secures our border and gives permanent  certainty to close to 700,000 people who currently are registered under  DACA.   As Benjamin Franklin said after he agreed to the Constitution in  1787: We may all be left with a law in which none of us got everything  we wanted, but everyone got something that they needed.   The DACA recipients would have the certainty of knowing that they can  stay in America legally for the rest of their lives, and perhaps future  Congresses and future Presidents may build upon that, and the President  will have achieved a signature campaign promise and achieved something  Republicans--and many Democrats--have been promising to do but have  failed to deliver for over 15 years; that is, to secure the border and  build a wall.   There is a way forward on all of these things. If we remember how our  system works, we can start making it happen, but I think it will  require us to accept what it takes to make progress in a constitutional  Republic. We can't even begin to do it until we end the shutdown. And  that is what I hope we will do sooner, rather than later.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse).
