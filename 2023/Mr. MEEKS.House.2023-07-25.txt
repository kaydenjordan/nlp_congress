 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1684, the Haiti  Criminal Collusion Transparency Act of 2023.   Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that Haiti is in a dire situation. A  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report, released this year,  highlighted increasingly sophisticated and high-caliber firearms and  ammunition being trafficked into Haiti amid an unprecedented and  rapidly deteriorating security situation.   This level of criminal activity is the craft of experienced and well- connected individuals who have long utilized crises and instability in  Haiti to gain economic control and increase their political sphere of  influence.   There are as many as 200 gangs in Haiti who now control at least 85  percent of Port-au-Prince. Gang violence has resulted in the killing of  over 1,200 people in Haiti in the first 5 months of the year alone. In  just 11 days, the Baz Gran Grif gang murdered 69 people and injured  another 83, forcing authorities to abandon several police stations.  Authorities believe the gang is responsible for the killing of 14  Haitian National Police officers in late January as part of its ongoing  violence.   Political insecurity following Moise's assassination has only  furthered the declining security situation. The Haitian National  Government's last democratically elected officials' terms expired in  January, and new elections are postponed indefinitely.   While we continue to push for a Haitian-led solution to these  challenges, the United States must do what it can to not allow corrupt  officials that have contributed to Haiti's political and criminal  crisis to travel freely to the United States. I am committed to holding  corrupt officials accountable and prohibiting their travel to the  United States, and this legislation would help in those efforts.   H.R. 1684 authorizes the Secretary of State to sanction Haiti's  economic and political elite who regularly use gangs to leverage and  maintain power. The bill also ensures that Congress receives regular  reports on Haitian gang activity and related criminality.   The Haitian people need to believe that their voices matter and that  their government exists to improve their quality of life, not make it  more burdensome. We know these conditions are causing the rise in  migration out of Haiti as people seek freedom and safety at any cost.   Mr. Speaker, I believe we have a duty to make sure that we identify  and hold accountable those who relish in the chaos caused by supporting  gang activity, using kidnappings and rape to control and silence  communities, and using coercion to bring youth in and around Port-au- Prince into the service of criminal activity.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick).   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Meeks  for leading this and also Chairman McCaul.   Mr. Speaker, as the only Haitian-American Member in Congress, I was  proud to help introduce the Haitian Criminal Collusion Transparency  Act.   This bill would require the Secretary of State to submit an annual  report to Congress on the ties between criminal gangs and political and  economic elites in Haiti. It would also impose the necessary sanctions  on parties involved in such criminal activities.   Armed criminal gangs continue to wreak havoc across Haiti, fanning  the flames of a worsening humanitarian crisis and leading many to fear  for their own safety.   We see numerous accounts of rape against children, infants, and  women. The gangs have gained strength for years without any kind of  accountability. The assassination of Moise in 2021 added fuel to the  fire.   By shining a light on the connection between these violent criminal  enterprises and corrupt leaders, along with levying a series of  crippling economic sanctions, we can better address the chaos that has  engulfed Haiti for years now.   The instability impacts us right here at home. Traveling to Haiti has  become extremely unsafe. A few months ago, two of my constituents were  kidnapped while visiting Haiti and held for ransom by dangerous gangs.  No one should ever have to endure that by visiting Haiti.   Mr. Speaker, I will continue to support solutions that address the  country's political, economic, and health situations, and I will  continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put  an end to the reign of terror in Haiti. Once again, I thank our ranking  member, Representative Meeks, and also Chairman McCaul for helping us  push this forward.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Kamlager-Dove).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I introduced and marked up this bill with robust  bipartisan support. I thank my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle, Chairman McCaul and the chair of the subcommittee, Chairwoman  Salazar; my colleagues who just spoke, Representative Cherfilus- McCormick and Representative Kamlager-Dove; and others who worked in a  bipartisan way to ensure that Congress takes steps to address the  crisis created by Haitian gangs.   Mr. Speaker, the people of Haiti deserve to know which organizations  and individuals support destabilizing criminal activity, including  those who take advantage of desperate people who are already extremely  vulnerable, trafficking them throughout the region and making financial  gains at every stop along the way.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow these elites, those who are paying the  gangs, those who are incentivizing the gangs to create and do horrific  things, to just keep walking about with impunity.   We have to stand up and state that we are going to point them out and  sanction them to give the people of Haiti an opportunity to feel that  their government and their country can move forward.   We can no longer just talk about having elections without having the  gangs wiped out and away from Haiti because they would control the  elections.   This sends a message to those elites, those who are financing the  gangs, those who think that they can continue their criminal activity,  that the United States is going to sanction them and that they won't be  able to cross the borders and go back and forth.   This bill would require the Secretary of State to submit an annual  report to Congress regarding the ties between criminal gangs and  political and economic elites in Haiti and impose sanctions on  political and economic elites involved in such criminal activities.   I have a lot of Haitians in my district. They want some action. They  want some relief from the activities of these criminal gangs.   The message that this bill sends, and what the follow-up with the  administration would say, is that the United States House of  Representatives, in a very bipartisan fashion and working collectively  together, will not allow them to continue their corrupt criminal  activities.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
