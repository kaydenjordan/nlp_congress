 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Judiciary  Accountability Act of 2021. I thank Representatives Johnson, Speier,  Nadler, Torres, and Mace, along with my cosponsors, Senators  Whitehouse, Murray, and Durbin, for working with me to finally ensure  that employees of the Federal judiciary have strong statutory rights  and protections against discrimination, sexual harassment, retaliation,  and other forms of workplace misconduct.   More than 30,000 people work in the Federal judiciary. As with any  organization of this size, the judiciary is not immune from workplace  misconduct.   Over the years, however, a variety of factors have worked together to  prevent instances of workplace misconduct within the judiciary from  coming to light. There is a unique power imbalance between the Federal  judges who sit atop this vast organization and the clerks, staffers,  and other employees who rely on connections and recommendations to  advance their careers. The cloak of confidentiality ensures what  happens in chambers stays in chambers. And, perhaps most important,  there is a lack of legal recourse available to judicial employees who  are denied even the most fundamental workplace protections. Indeed, the  Federal judiciary is one of the few employers--private or public--whose  employees are not protected by state or federal civil rights laws.   Despite all these reasons to keep quiet, a number of victims have  bravely come forward to report serious harassment by Federal judges  over the past several years. In December 2017, six former law clerks  and staffers accused Ninth Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski of subjecting  them to a range of inappropriate sexual conduct and comments. In  September 2019, the Tenth Circuit Judicial Council issued an order  finding that District Court Judge Carlos Murguia had harassed multiple  employees over a period of years, including by subjecting them to  sexually suggestive comments; inappropriate text messages; and  excessive, non-work-related contact. In February 2020, a former law  clerk to the late-Ninth Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt accused the  judge of a months-long harassment campaign.   In the face of this egregious misconduct and Congressional pressure,  the federal judiciary has taken only small, limited steps to protect  its employees. It is not enough.   The Judiciary Accountability Act fills the void left by the  judiciary's inaction and extends to judicial branch employees the same  anti-discrimination rights and remedies other government sector  employees and private sector workers have had for decades. It also goes  further. Among other things, it would create an Office of Judicial  Integrity to administer a nationwide, confidential reporting system;  establish a Special Counsel for Equal Employment Opportunity empowered  to investigate all workplace misconduct complaints; form an Office of  Employee Advocacy to assist in judicial branch employees in matters  relating to workplace discrimination and harassment; protect  whistleblowers by prohibiting retaliation; and establish a  comprehensive workplace misconduct prevention program.   These reforms are not only necessary, they are long overdue. I  therefore encourage my colleagues to support the Judiciary  Accountability Act.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Judiciary  Accountability Act of 2021.
