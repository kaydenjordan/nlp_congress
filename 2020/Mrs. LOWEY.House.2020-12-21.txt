 Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a concurrent resolution  and ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a concurrent resolution  and ask unanimous consent for its immediate consideration in the House.  [[Page H7301]]    The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1271, I call up  the bill (H.R. 133) to promote economic partnership and cooperation  between the United States and Mexico, with the Senate amendment  thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the House amendment to the Senate  amendment to H.R. 133.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to present legislation that comprises all 12  fiscal year 2021 appropriations bills, a number of items agreed to on a  bipartisan basis between authorizing committees, and a coronavirus  relief package.   The 12 appropriations bills include a strong increase in nondefense  discretionary funding, allowing Congress to make important investments  for the people.   I am particularly proud that we have been able to fund better  education for our students; more affordable housing; food security  initiatives; safer communities, with funding to address America's gun  violence epidemic; clean air and water; action on the climate crisis;  and care for our veterans, with a special emphasis on suicide  prevention and gender-specific care.   As chairwoman of the Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and  Related Programs, I am also proud that this legislation bolsters  international security and stability. In particular, the Middle East  Partnership for Peace fund will support people-to-people exchanges and  economic partnerships between Israelis and Palestinians.   Turning to the coronavirus relief portion of the legislation, the  bill provides $892 billion to confront the pandemic.   While Republican intransigence means the legislation doesn't include  the State and local relief that is desperately needed, the amounts it  provides for education, public health, and transportation will greatly  benefit our local communities.   Of particular importance to me, the $4 billion for GAVI will help  children  [[Page H7302]]  across the world receive the coronavirus vaccine, though far greater  investments are needed to support international COVID-19 response.   President-elect Biden has spoken about the dark winter that we face  because of this pandemic. It is my hope that this bill will be a source  of light as we face that winter.   I am proud that, through the careful use of Federal funds, the  appropriations in this bill will help set our Nation on a course to  build back better.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the distinguished chairwoman of the  Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the distinguished majority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Defense, who has spent the last 35 years in the  Congress.   Mr. Speaker, we all share his knowledge, which he shares with us so  willingly, and we appreciate his service, not just to the committee,  but to the Congress, to the country, and we wish him the very, very  best. We thank him for his service in the Congress and on this  committee.   (Mr. VISCLOSKY asked and was given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the distinguished gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the chair  of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and  Related Agencies, and now the chair of the full committee, where I know  she will serve with her great knowledge with distinction.    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the distinguished gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the  chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans  Affairs, and Related Agencies.                                time  1845     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia, (Mr. Scott), the chairman of the Committee on Education and  Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pallone). We came to Congress together, and he is the  chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Waters), the chairwoman of the Committee on  Financial Services.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), a senior member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), my friend for 32 years in the House, the  outstanding Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and I  rise to address this House for the final time.   For 32 years, it has been my privilege to serve as United States  Representative from New York; and in the 116th Congress, it has been my  distinct honor to be the first chairwoman of the House Appropriations  Committee.   By wielding the power of the purse, this bill will make a profound  difference in the lives of millions of Americans and people around the  world.   I am proud to have worked with so many of my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to assemble this bill and other legislative successes. You  have challenged and inspired me, and I treasure the friendships that we  have made.   My dear friend, Kay Granger, it has been such an honor getting to  know you. Texas values, New York values, no matter what they say, we  became good friends and worked so well together. Thank you, thank you,  thank you.   I would be remiss if I did not thank the talented staff who have  worked so hard to put this bill together, led by Clerk and Staff  Director Shalanda Young, the extraordinary Shalanda Young, who is way  back there.   Thank you, Shalanda Young.   And also the extraordinary deputy staff director, Chris Bigelow. What  a team. They manage. No matter how much paper and no matter what the  challenge, they seem to be able to put it all together and get it  right.   Shalanda and Chris, I thank you--and always with an assist by my  chief of staff, Elizabeth Stanley.   I do want to thank the staff director of the State, Foreign  Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee, which I chair, Steve  Marchese.   There is one principle that has guided my 32 years in public service:  When you see a problem, whether it is here or in the district or in  another community, do something about it.   Too many people see a problem. They are good people, but they will  all go off to this personal activity or another personal activity.  Members of Congress know, when they see a problem, we have a  responsibility to address it and do something about it to make life  better for our community, the Nation, and the world. This bill does  something to crush this virus and set us on the course for a strong and  equitable recovery.   Mr. Speaker, for the last time and with a deep sense of gratitude for  the honor of serving in this House, I yield back the balance of my  time.
