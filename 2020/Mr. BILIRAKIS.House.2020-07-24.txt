 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, today is a sad and mournful day for worldwide  Christians, the most persecuted believers on Earth.   In accordance with Turkish President Erdogan's grand plan to  reconstitute the Ottoman Empire, the beautiful, majestic jewel of  Christendom for nearly 1,000 years, Madam Speaker, the Hagia Sophia,  Church of the Holy Wisdom, was converted to a mosque and Muslim  religious services were observed there today.                                time  1415    As the Christian faithful and their houses of worship continue to  dwindle in Turkey, this move by Erdogan was a step to extinguish  Christianity once and for all, sadly. But it also poisons respect  between religions and people of faith, Turkish citizens included.   Turkey must reestablish Hagia Sophia's status as a historic monument  of universal significance and as an unquestioned symbol of respect  between religions and among people.   The holy wisdom that we all call upon requires this approach, in the  interests of common humanity and goodwill.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), my  good friend, for yielding to me.
