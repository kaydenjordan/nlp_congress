 Madam Speaker, America is in the midst of an  energy and supply chain crisis, and President Biden is nowhere to be  found.   Instead, this week he will be jetting off to Europe for a climate  conference to brag to our European allies about how much he is  destroying America's energy economy.   In the past few months in office, President Biden canceled the  Keystone pipeline, which killed over 11,000 American jobs and paused  oil and gas leasing on U.S. lands and waters. The consequences of his  policy decisions have been dire for hardworking American families.   The numbers don't lie. Home heating costs are projected to rise by as  much as 54 percent. The national average for a gallon of gasoline  reached $3.38, and U.S. households are on track to spend $19 billion  more on energy by 2030.   Instead of working on bipartisan climate solutions, Democrats are  more focused on implementing their radical Green New Deal policies and  making us less energy independent.   From increased costs at the pump to heating bills, Americans are  feeling the pain of President Biden's anti-energy policy in their  wallets. The bottom line is socialism just does not work.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
