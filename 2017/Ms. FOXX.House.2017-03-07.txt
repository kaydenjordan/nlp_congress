 Mr. Speaker, for years Americans across the country have  struggled under a government takeover of health care. Because of  ObamaCare, insurance markets are collapsing, healthcare costs are  soaring, and patients' choices are dwindling. Simply put, the flawed  healthcare law is failing. It is hurting hardworking men and women  across the country, and the American people deserve better.   That is why Republicans promised to deliver the healthcare solutions  Americans desperately need. This week, we are making good on that  promise and moving forward with an effort that will provide a better  way on health care.   After a thoughtful and collaborative process, members of the Energy  and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee recently  unveiled a legislative plan that will repeal and replace ObamaCare. The  plan, the American Health Care Act, includes a number of positive,  commonsense reforms that will help create more choices, lower costs,  and give control back to individuals and families.   These reforms will create a new and innovative fund giving States the  flexibility they need to design programs that fit the needs of their  communities. They will responsibly unwind ObamaCare's Medicaid  expansion in a way that protects patients and strengthens the program  for future generations.   The plan will also dismantle ObamaCare taxes and mandates--including  the individual and employer mandate penalties and taxes on prescription  drugs, over-the-counter medications, health insurance premiums, and  medical devices. It will expand health savings accounts to empower  individuals and families to spend their healthcare dollars the way they  want and need. It will provide tax credits to those who don't receive  insurance through work or a government program, helping all Americans  access high quality, affordable health care.   At the same time, we on the Education and the Workforce Committee are  working to advance additional reforms that will help expand coverage,  make health care more affordable, and promote a healthy workforce.   One legislative proposal will empower small businesses to band  together to negotiate lower healthcare costs on behalf of their  employees. Another will protect the ability of employers to self- insure, providing greater access to affordable, flexible healthcare  plans for their workers. The third will give employers the legal  certainty they need to offer employee wellness plans, helping to  promote a healthy workforce and, again, lower healthcare costs.   These three legislative proposals reflect a few shared principles.  Families should have the freedom to choose the healthcare plan that  meets their needs. Americans need more affordable healthcare options,  not fewer. Healthcare decisions should rest with patients and their  doctors--not government bureaucrats. Instead of prescriptive mandates,  we should ensure employers have the tools they need to help their  employees afford health care.   These proposals--along with those in the American Health Care Act-- are exactly the kind of free-market, patient-centered reforms  Republicans promised, and they reflect the priorities of President  Trump and his administration. They are the products of a careful  process that took into account the ideas and concerns of men and women  from all walks of life, and they will now be considered through an  open, transparent process that provides policymakers on both sides of  the aisle an opportunity to share their views and offer their ideas.   I encourage everyone--my colleagues in Congress, as well as all  Americans--to join in this process. Visit readthebill.gop. See for  yourself the plan we have laid out, and help us move forward with these  positive solutions. Together we can help ensure all Americans have  access to the high quality, affordable healthcare coverage they  deserve.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, March is National Reading Month, and students  across the country often kick off this observance by celebrating the  birthday of treasured children's author Dr. Suess. Last week I visited  Forsyth Academy in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where I read  ``There's a Wocket in My Pocket!'' to first grade students.   Forsyth Academy is a charter school serving students from  kindergarten through eighth grade. The school was founded on the  principles of academic excellence, moral focus, parental partnership,  and student responsibility. Its leadership believes in setting high  standards, making expectations clear, providing meaningful instruction,  and watching children surpass expectations as a result.   It is always a pleasure to visit local schools and witness the great  things happening in classrooms across the Fifth District. Every student  in every school deserves an excellent education, but, unfortunately, we  are falling far short of that goal. Thankfully, innovative charter  schools like Forsyth Academy are providing thousands of families new  hope and opportunity.   School choice is a powerful tool to help children succeed, and I am  encouraged by the momentum that is building. I look forward to the work  ahead and exploring additional opportunities to provide parents more  choices for their children's education.                            ____________________
