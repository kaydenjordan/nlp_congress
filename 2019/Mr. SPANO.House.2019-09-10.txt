 Madam Speaker, I rise today to announce a bill I recently  introduced in the House, the Protecting Patients from Surprise Medical  Bills Act, which is a companion bill to Senator Scott's recent  legislation.   No one seeking medical care should ever have to worry about incurring  unexpected, crippling expenses, especially when they have done  everything right by obtaining health insurance. That is why then- Governor Rick Scott and I worked to pass a bill in Florida to solve  this issue.   This law takes patients completely out of the billing process,  protecting patients from surprise medical bills for emergency services  and for mistakenly seeing an out-of-network healthcare provider at an  in-network hospital.   This bill has experienced widespread success in Florida, which is why  we are  [[Page H7588]]  introducing legislation to apply these policies to healthcare plans  regulated at the Federal level.   I have personally known the fear of being rushed to the emergency  room. In that moment, no one should have to worry about their finances.   This bill not only seeks to save Americans money but also provides  the peace of mind for them to focus on healing.                            ____________________
