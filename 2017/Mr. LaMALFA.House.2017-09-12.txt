 Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to highlight the  importance of the Secure Rural Schools program. It was created to fill  a void in the economics left by restrictive forest management practices  and regulations that have basically cut off our Federal forests and  left many rural communities without the forests that once drove their  economy: timber harvest.   The program was established in 2000 as only a temporary program to  help rural America until we could restore active forest management,  which would allow communities to then be self-sufficient, create jobs,  work the land, and keep their schools running.   Indeed, the temporary program has not seen the practices towards  forest management, towards timber harvest that is needed, as we see the  West up in smoke once again.   We need, in Congress, to put policies in place that allow for timber  harvest, for better air quality, for the safety of the habitat, for the  economy, and for secure rural schools so they will see funding they  need, and for counties as well that rely on that for road money.   In Modoc County, they are afraid they may have to close one of their  high schools, which means another 50-mile drive through bad weather  over a ridge for some of the students there.   Congress must implement commonsense forest management for a myriad of  reasons: again, forest health, school funding, jobs, all the things  that make sense for the West. We need to pass Secure Rural Schools  funding                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
