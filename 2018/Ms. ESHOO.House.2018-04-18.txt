 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my good friend, for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule, and I want to  urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to defeat the previous  question so the House can vote on my bipartisan--I want to emphasize  that, bipartisan--legislation entitled, the ``Presidential Tax  Transparency Act.'' This bill codifies the longstanding bipartisan  tradition of Presidents and Presidential nominees disclosing their tax  return information to the American people.   Now, as was said previously, yesterday was tax day, and it is an  important reminder that, as millions of Americans fulfill their duty to  file their income tax returns, the President of the United States of  America still refuses to release his tax returns to the American  people.   I think holding the highest office in the land demands transparency,  yet the President refuses to honor what promotes trust with the  American people.   And as I said, both Republican and Democratic Presidential  candidates, going back to Richard Nixon, all voluntarily put their tax  returns out to the American people. Why? To establish trust that they  were transparent and that the American people could see whether there  were any potential conflicts of interest and many other things, because  tax returns are highly instructive. As I said, that has gone on for  decades.   I wrote this legislation because, in 2016--and I wrote it in 2016-- there were two candidates, one from each party, who refused to put out  their tax returns, and I did not think that that was honoring the  American people. Now, by refusing to make his tax returns public, the  President implies he is hiding important information from the American  people.   So what this legislation does--and, again, I want to reiterate, it is  bipartisan--it places into law disclosure by requiring the current  President and all Presidential nominees of both parties to release  their tax returns because, again, in a democracy, truth and  transparency should be the gold standard. Presidents and Presidential  candidates should be held to the highest standard of transparency to  ensure that the interests of the American people are met.   Now, tax returns contain vital information: whether the candidate has  actually paid taxes, what they own, how much they have borrowed, who  they have borrowed from, whether they have made charitable donations,  and what tax loopholes have they taken advantage of and exactly what  they are, if they have. They are also highly instructive as to any  conflicts of interest.   The current President has 564 financial positions in companies  located in the United States and around the world, according to the  Federal Election Commission, making him more susceptible to conflicts  of interest than any President in our history. Only a full release of  his tax returns will provide the public with clear information as to  his potential conflicts of interest and his potential entanglements  with foreign governments and foreign businesses.   This legislation, again, is bipartisan because transparency and good  governance are not partisan issues.    Mr. Speaker, according to a recent poll, 67 percent of  Americans believe the President should release his tax returns just as  all of his predecessors since Richard Nixon have done.   During the campaign, the President even promised he would do so  before falsely claiming that he couldn't release his tax returns  because of an audit. There is no such thing.   Yesterday's editorial board of the Washington Post wrote: ``The  President is setting a precedent--that Presidents can promise one  thing, do another, and end up dismissing essential  [[Page H3409]]  standards of disclosure. Congress should not accept this erosion of  good-government practice.''   So, Mr. Speaker, I couldn't agree more. And, again, I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle: Your constituents will reward  you for this because this is about transparency, about our democracy,  about transparency being the gold standard.    Mr. Speaker, I thank our beloved  John Lewis for yielding  time to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5444, the  Taxpayer First Act. This is bipartisan legislation, and it was  unanimously reported out by the Committee on Ways and Means on April  13. It includes a number of important provisions that will modernize,  as the Members have been saying, and improve how the IRS administers  the Federal Tax Code.   The legislation also makes permanent a popular IRS program that has  helped prepare 50 million free returns and e-filings over the last 15  years, saving taxpayers more than $1.5 billion--yes, with a B--in tax  compliance costs. That program is the Free File Program. It is an  effective partnership between the IRS and the tax preparation community  that provides free individual tax preparation and e-filing services to  taxpayers with incomes in the bottom 70 percent.   I have been a strong supporter of stand-alone legislation on this  issue over several Congresses, and I am really pleased to see that it  is included in H.R. 5444.   The Free File Program is also a product of the decentralized system  of private taxpayers that we have in place for the American public to  file their taxes each year. Consumers have a choice when it comes to  whom they choose to prepare their taxes, and choice is a product of  competition and the primary ingredient for innovation.   Some have argued that this should be a centralized system, requiring  all taxpayers to file their tax returns using one system housed under  one roof. But just yesterday, we saw the IRS electronic filing system  and e-services crash, and they remained out of service for most of the  day. I think taxpayers are better served when they have a decentralized  tax ecosystem that can continue to run smoothly in the face of large  and unexpected shocks to the system.   We live every day with the increasing threat of data breaches and  cyber attacks that threaten the financial stability of more and more  Americans, and it is even a greater argument against housing our tax  infrastructure under one roof. Imagine the target this could create for  the world's most dangerous cybercriminals.   So I am proud to support this bipartisan legislation, because I think  it is an excellent example of what both sides of the aisle, Republicans  and Democrats, can do when we work together for the good of the  American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on H.R.  5444.                                time  1400
