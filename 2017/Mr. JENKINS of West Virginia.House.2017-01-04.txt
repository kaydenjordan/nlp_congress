 Mr. Speaker, in this new year, we must  make things right for our miners and their widows. We must act now to  keep the promise. We must honor their work in the mines by protecting  the pensions and healthcare benefits they worked their whole lives to  earn.   We must pass legislation I have cosponsored to protect these hard- earned benefits for families like Rita Blankenship of McDowell County  who wrote me asking for help. Here is what she said: ``My husband was  promised healthcare coverage in 1975 when he went to work in the mines  and joined the union. I am asking if you could do everything possible  to get this passed so we will have health care,'' she wrote.   These miners and their families deserve no less than what they worked  their entire lives to earn: the peace of mind that comes with a pension  and secure health care.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting legislation to protect  our miners, their widows, and their families. We owe it to them to keep  our word.                            ____________________
