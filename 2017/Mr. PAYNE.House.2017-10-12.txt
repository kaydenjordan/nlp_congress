 Mr. Speaker, in New Jersey, nearly 231,000 children rely  on the Children's Health Insurance Program. CHIP gets them to the  doctor. CHIP gets them to the hospital. CHIP saves their lives.   But last month, Republican Members of Congress made a choice to put  on another repeal-and-replace dog and pony show and let CHIP expire.   Mr. Speaker, what do my Republican colleagues have against needy  children? Who thought it would be a good idea to put 9 million  children's health at risk for political gains? So much for  compassionate conservatism.   Mr. Speaker, CHIP is vital to the Nation's future. Along with  Medicaid, CHIP has cut the rate of low-income, uninsured children  nationally by half--from 14 percent to 7 percent. But if Congress  doesn't immediately reauthorize long-term CHIP funding, children will  not get to see their doctors. They won't have access to hospitals, and  some may die                            ____________________
