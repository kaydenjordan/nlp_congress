 Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration's  notoriously rocky relationship with Congress, and even his own party,  meant that he had to resort to overregulations to get stuff done. His  pen and a phone approach resulted in considerable executive branch  overreach.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support a nominee for Secretary of the  Interior who is the exact opposite. David Bernhardt is a lawyer who  understands exactly what powers and authorities his department is  granted under the law and will never overstep those authorities.   During the shutdown, for example, he expertly used the authorities  under FLREA--whatever those initials represent--to keep many of  America's parks open, even as other agencies were closed for business.  It is this kind of thinking--putting Americans and those who visit  public lands first during tough times--that makes David a talented  public servant. He will be an incredible Secretary of the Interior, and  I urge the Senate to speedily confirm him.                            ____________________
