 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, for over 80 years, our country has  recognized the week of Thanksgiving to be National Bible Week. This  week was first established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941  to create an annual event where Christians could celebrate the Bible.   The very first Psalm of David expresses the importance of the Bible:  Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly nor  stands in the path of sinners nor sits in the seat of the scornful, but  his delight is in the law of the Lord and in His law, he mediates day  and night. He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that  brings forth its fruit in its season whose leave also shall not wither  and whatever he does shall prosper.   King David found that his greatest counsel was not found in human  philosophy but rather in the words of God.   America is a Nation that from its beginning has respected the Bible.  The evidence is all around us here in Washington, D.C. Numerous  memorials that quote the Bible, the buildings that house our executive,  judicial, and legislative branches have Bible verses etched in stone.  More importantly, the values and principles that have made us a secure,  free, and prosperous Nation come from the holy Word of God.   In this hour, we will hear from Members of Congress from various  faith traditions and denominations speak about what the Bible means to  them. We are here in keeping with that 80-year tradition to recognize  National Bible Week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Allen for sharing from his  personal story.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of  Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), who is the chair of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great  State of Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from California comes  forward, I am going to give my own story. My own story shows a life  that was changed by the Bible.   When I went to college, I thought I knew what the Bible was all  about. In reality, I never read any of it for myself. When I was urged  to do so, I realized that it was different than what I had assumed.   I read the Gospel of John, and I realized I was separated from God  and that the way for me to find Him was through Jesus, who said He is  the way, the truth, and the life, and that no one comes to the Father  but through Him.   When I accepted Him as my Lord and Savior, my life changed  dramatically. I can attest to the reality of the Bible.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, Representative Aderholt made passing  reference to an early action of our Congress in authorizing publication  of a Bible in the 1700s. I am going to amplify on that just a little  bit here.   Many of the early American settlers who came to the New World wanted  to live out their faith in God and His Word, according to the  convictions of their own consciences. It is true that one of Congress'  first acts in the infancy of our Nation was the authorization of an  American-published Bible. The Revolutionary War with the British had  cut off all shipments of Bibles from England. Our Founding Fathers  understood how important it was for the American people to have access  to Bibles.   Robert Aitken, a private citizen, brought this need to the attention  of Congress. He said, in a letter, ``This work is an object worthy of  the attention of the Congress of the United States of America, who will  not negligent spiritual security, while they are virtuously contending  for temporal blessings.''   In 1782, Congress reviewed, approved, and authorized the first known  English language Bible to be printed in America, and the congressional  resolution for that read:   ``Resolved: That the United States in Congress assembled highly  approve the pious and laudable undertaking of Mr. Aitken, as  subservient to the interest of religion as well as an instance of  progress of arts in this country, and being satisfied from the above  report of his care and accuracy in the execution of the work, they  recommend this edition of the Bible to the inhabitants of the United  States, and hereby authorize him to publish this recommendation in the  manner he shall think proper.''   Mr. Speaker, can you imagine doing that today, authorizing a Bible  and recommending it to the people of the United States?   Our country has changed over the years and not always for the better,  I am afraid.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin  (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. It  is that time of year when we as Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus  Christ. Of course, His story is found in the Bible that we are talking  about tonight. So it all ties together very well at this time of year  especially.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of Georgia  (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so much for his  comments.   Mr. Speaker, I will mention something about archaeology. There are  many archeological discoveries which have validated biblical accounts  giving trustworthiness to the Bible that we are acknowledging now  during the recent National Bible Week.   Archeology has, time and time again, shown that the Biblical  personalities, locations, and events actually existed in time and  space. Claims by critics that a Biblical statement was simply made up  have been later debunked by archeological discoveries more times than  we can say.    For instance, the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in the late  forties and fifties proved the credibility and authority of Scripture.  The discovery of these scrolls shined light on the oldest records of  the worldwide flood and the longstanding authority and accuracy of the  Bible.   Jewish archaeologist Nelson Glueck has stated: It may be stated  categorically that no archeological discovery has ever controverted or  contradicted a Biblical reference.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of Texas  (Mr. Weber).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his words.   It has been an honor and a pleasure to commemorate National Bible  Week this evening. I am grateful to my colleagues who joined me to  honor the Word of God.   Mr. Speaker, I simply restate my gratitude for the Words of Jesus  about the Bible:         Therefore whoever hears these sayings of mine and does       them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on       the rock. The rain descended, the floods came, and the winds       blew and beat on that house; and it did not fall for it was       founded on the rock. But everyone who hears these sayings of       mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who       built his house on the sand. The rain descended, the floods       came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it       fell, and great was its fall.    So I am thankful for the Word of God that we have to live by. I thank  God for the stability and foundation the Bible has given in my life,  for the lives of those who have spoken here today, and for the life of  our great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
