 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  retired Police Chief Matt Doering of Brunswick, Georgia, who passed  away on September 4 at 56 years of age after a long battle with cancer.   Chief Doering dedicated his life to serving his community. He spent  34 years working with the Glynn County Police Department, and for 14 of  those years, he served as the chief of police. From directing high- profile investigations to personally patrolling the area during  hurricanes, Chief Doering was highly respected throughout Glynn County.   After being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, he retired from the  police department and began working with the Glynn County school  system.   I am proud and thankful to have had someone with the character of  Chief Doering serving his community in the First Congressional District  of Georgia.                            ____________________
