 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for yielding me  the time.   I rise in support of H.R. 5509, the Innovations in Mentoring,  Training, and Apprenticeships Act. This bill takes important steps in  addressing the growing need for a diverse and technically trained STEM  workforce.   Technological advances have transformed the workplace with almost 20  percent of all jobs in the U.S. economy requiring some level of STEM  training. These jobs are expected to grow nearly 9 percent over the  next decade, faster than any other employment category; and, of course,  we know these are also higher paying jobs, and we want more women and a  more diverse workforce here, also.   Unfortunately, we also know that we have been failing to keep  students in the STEM pipeline. Almost half of all students who start in  a STEM major do not graduate with one. Of those who do graduate with a  STE degree, only half go on to a career in a STEM field. It is  essential we address these challenges in order to ensure U.S.  competitiveness in the global economy.    In February, I chaired a Research and Technology Subcommittee  hearing, which looked at innovative STEM education and workforce  training models from across the country. These models demonstrated how  apprenticeships, mentoring, and on-the-job training are used to  successfully bridge STEM skills gaps.   I am happy to say that many of the lessons learned from that hearing  are reflected in this bill, including the point that most successful  programs are an integration of academia, technical training, and hands- on work experience.   H.R. 5509 directs the National Science Foundation to competitively  award grants to community colleges and 4-year institutions to develop  and improve STEM courses and degrees. These programs will combine  formal education with applied learning experiences, such as  apprenticeships and internships, by partnering with regional employers  needing to fill skilled and technical STEM jobs.   This bill also calls for NSF to competitively award grants to  determine best practices and measure student outcomes of distance  learning and simulated work environment courses for STEM education and  technical skills training.   Lastly, it directs the National Science Foundation to examine the  development and sustainability of skilled technical workforces from  across the U.S. and around the world, explore the feasibility of  surveying the U.S. skilled technical workforce, and research and  develop potential labor market analysis innovations.   These programs and important research will help support and build the  [[Page H8865]]  STEM pipeline and the STEM workforce that will drive American  innovation in order to meet the challenges of the 21st century economy.   I want to thank Leader McCarthy for introducing this legislation and  for the opportunity to cosponsor this. I also thank Chairman Smith and  Ranking Member Johnson for their great work in ushering this bill  through the committee on a bipartisan basis.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6229) to authorize the programs of the National Institute of  Standards and Technology, and for other purposes, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 6229, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to speak on behalf of my bill,  H.R. 6229, the National Institute of Standards and Technology  Reauthorization Act of 2018.   NIST's mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial  competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and  technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve all  Americans' quality of life.   Since its establishment in 1901, NIST has helped position U.S.  technology at the leading edge, making contributions to innumerable  products and services that rely in some way on technology, measurement,  and standards.   Such technology ranges from developing biometric standards for law  enforcement or new materials for protective equipment of our Nation's  firefighters to atomic clocks and earthquake-resistant skyscrapers.  This legislation authorizes NIST's industrial technology services,  construction activities, and bolsters the scientific and technical  research and services lab activities for 2 years.   NIST has the mission and capabilities to contribute to areas critical  to the U.S. global competitiveness. To this end, this legislation  authorizes increased investments in four emerging technology areas:  quantum science, artificial intelligence and data science, advanced  communications and the Internet of Things, and composites research and  standards development.                                time  2145    These investments will launch discoveries and technical advances that  will significantly affect the Nation's economy in the coming decades.  As we have heard in our committee, the potential for artificial  intelligence to help humans and further scientific discoveries is  immense.   By advancing our ability to store and process large and complex data  sets through AI and machine learning, computers are able to refine and  enhance future predictions. This advanced technology is already  creating tremendous developments in many fields, including medicine,  manufacturing, and finance.  [[Page H8867]]    This legislation also directs NIST to capitalize on its deep and  varied expertise in advanced composites. NIST is directed to connect  research that will provide the evidence and data needed to set industry  standards and design guidelines to encourage the safe adoption and  application of composite materials in U.S. infrastructure projects.   NIST plays a very important role in protecting the Nation from cyber  threats through its ongoing cybersecurity research. NIST is examining  the applications of blockchain technology, and creating voluntary  frameworks and standards to help reduce cyber risks to Federal  agencies, multiple industries, and critical infrastructure. Its  cybersecurity technical standards and risk management frameworks are  widely regarded as one of the best and most comprehensive in the world.   I want to thank Ranking Member Lipinski for cosponsoring this  important legislation with me. As the chairman has mentioned, he has  been an essential partner with us in getting so many of our bipartisan  bills put forward.   I would also like to thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson  for assisting in ushering this bill through the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee on a bipartisan basis.   As industry's national laboratory, NIST is dedicated to supporting  research and technology development in the areas of national importance  from communications technology and cybersecurity to advanced  manufacturing and disaster resilience.   This bill supports NIST's critical work of helping U.S. industries  and improving Americans' quality of life by developing new measurement  tools, providing authoritative data, and bringing stakeholders together  to find solutions to ensure U.S. competitiveness in the 21st century  economy.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.
