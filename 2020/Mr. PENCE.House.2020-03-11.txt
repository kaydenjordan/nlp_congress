 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Josh Speidel, an  extraordinary young man from my hometown of Columbus, Indiana.   Josh was an Indiana All-Star high school basketball player when he  was in a tragic car accident. Josh spent many months in hospitals and  rehab learning how to walk and talk again. It was a difficult journey,  but Josh's family never lost hope.   The University of Vermont honored Josh's basketball scholarship he  achieved before the accident and welcomed him back with open arms. I am  proud to say that Josh recently scored his first point in his college  basketball career and will soon be graduating from the university.   I wish Josh the best of luck in his future. He is an inspiration to  all of us.                                time  1030                          Ivy Tech CC Flight Program     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Hoosier State's  first community college flight program and to commend the partnership  between Ivy Tech Community College and the Columbus Municipal Airport.   Since 2017, Ivy Tech Columbus has been offering Ivy Tech's first  aviation associate's degree and an aviation management program.   This program is designed to give students hands-on pilot training. In  addition to flight time, students also train on a flight simulator at  the Columbus Municipal Airport.   I look forward to seeing more skill-based programs like this to help  our youth in their careers.                            Women's History Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today as we celebrate the importance  of Women's History Month. I would like to take this opportunity to  celebrate women throughout the Sixth District who make a difference in  our everyday lives.   I think of women business leaders, humanitarians, and activists in  our communities, like Jeanie Hahn, Jean Ann Harcourt, Sue Saunders,  Lisa Fisher and Celeste Calvitto.   We recognize Linda Ostewig, who leads a faith-based nonprofit for  struggling teens to learn healthy lifestyle patterns in our own Hancock  County.   I am reminded of the example set by Susan Stahl, who has led Girls  Inc. in Madison for over three decades.   We recognize leaders like Wendy Elwood in my hometown of Columbus,  who last year was named ``Woman of the Year'' by The Republic  newspaper.   Indiana's First Lady, Janet Holcomb, is also from our district in  Muncie.   The people of Indiana's Sixth District are blessed to have so many  women helping lead and inspire our communities.   We celebrate and honor them as part of Women's History Month.             Inclusion of Poultry in U.S.-U.K. Trade Negotiations     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support for one of  the biggest industries in my district--the poultry industry.   I urge the administration and Ambassador Lighthizer to include  poultry in any U.S.-U.K. trade deal.   As the second largest exporter of chicken and the largest exporter of  turkey, the U.S. will continue to gain momentum in this industry if the  U.K. is added as a new market.   Indiana is the fifth largest turkey producer and second largest egg  producer in the United States. A U.K. trade agreement will boost our  Hoosier poultry farmers, who are an essential part of our Indiana  economy.   As Indiana's Sixth District Representative, I will continue to  support our Hoosier farmers and fight for their access to free markets.                       Farming and Carbon Sequestration     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the great impact  that  [[Page H1595]]  farming and the agriculture community has on carbon sequestration.   The use of cover crops increased by 15 percent per year since 2012.  This means that 20 million acres across the U.S. are likely to be  planted in cover crops this year with the potential to sequester about  60 million metric tons of CO2, equal to the emissions of  over 12 million cars.   The use of ethanol and biodiesel is notably reducing greenhouse gas  emissions, the same amount as if 17 million cars were taken off the  road in 2018.   Mr. Speaker, I will continue to support the agriculture community and  its leadership in being stewards of our environment.                            ____________________
