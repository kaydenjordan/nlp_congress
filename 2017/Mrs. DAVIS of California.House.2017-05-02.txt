 Mr. Speaker, recently I met with leaders of  the San Diego medical research community who had a unified message: We  need to end the cuts in research that have slowed medical innovation  for the last decade.   This year I was proud to lead the bipartisan effort, along with over  200 of my colleagues, to push for an additional $2 billion in funding  for the National Institutes of Health.   This is a very personal issue. Almost all of us know someone who is  struggling with a disease where NIH funding is used to find a cure.  That person could be a mother, father, family friend, or even more  heart-wrenching, a child.   I am thrilled that the spending bill before us this week avoids the  cuts proposed by President Trump and actually increases NIH funding by  $2 billion. We have seen what can happen when leadership takes a  bipartisan approach: top priorities like medical research actually get  funded.  [[Page H3011]]    This isn't the bill that I would have written, but it is a compromise  that I am very happy to vote for. Let's hope that Speaker Ryan has  learned from this experience and will work with us on health care, on  transportation, and other priorities moving forward.                            ____________________
