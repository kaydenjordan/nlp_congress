 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Protecting the  Right to Organize Act.   The PRO Act empowers workers to exercise their right to organize and  holds employers accountable for violating workers' rights.   In my home State of Hawaii, unions successfully raised the standard  of living for thousands of our residents. I am proud to say that Hawaii  has the highest union membership rate in the Nation, at 23.7 percent.   We must pass the PRO Act to make sure all workers have a free and  fair choice to join a union.   Mr. Speaker, organized labor has opened the doors of opportunity for  millions of Americans, to help them buy homes, secure healthcare,  educate their children, and enjoy leisure time with family and friends.   Mr. Speaker, as an 11-year card-carrying member of the Air Line  Pilots Association, I know firsthand how unions can level the playing  field. Unions give us a stronger voice to advocate for higher wages,  better benefits, and improved workplace conditions. Unions put the  power in the hands of the workers.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will lift up American workers and strengthen  America's middle class. I urge my colleagues to support the PRO Act.                            ____________________
