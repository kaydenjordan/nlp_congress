 Mr. President, as I often have to come to the floor to  clear things up, I am back once again.   I have been seeing reports--reports that are wrong--that individuals  within our Federal law enforcement agencies who want to talk to  Congress about problems they have seen on the job have a fear that if  they do that, they could be punished. The reports say these individuals  then want to be subpoenaed by congressional committees rather than come  forward voluntarily. There is a perception that without a subpoena,  they have no legal protection against retaliation for their cooperating  with Congress.   That is nonsense, and that is a misrepresentation that has been  fomented by the FBI's and the Department of Justice's leadership for  many years under both Republican and Democratic administrations. I have  worked hard to strengthen legal protections, especially for FBI  employees. FBI employees have a right to cooperate with congressional  inquiries just as they have a right to cooperate with the inspector  general. Anyone who tells these FBI agents anything else is lying. FBI  agents and all Federal law enforcement are protected if they want to  provide information to the Congress. That is true whether it is by  subpoena or not.  [[Page S2899]]    If that is news to law enforcement people, including the FBI, I would  encourage you to research the law individually. It is found at title 5,  U.S. Code, section 2303.   As you will see in the law, nowhere in that language do its  protections require a subpoena, nor do they require the approval of an  agent's chain of command or congressional affairs staff approval.   Moreover, Federal appropriations law also forbids the use of  taxpayers' dollars to pay the salary of any individual who interferes  with or attempts to interfere with a Federal employee's right to  communicate directly with Congress.   The Government Accountability Office recently found that an Obama  Housing and Urban Development congressional affairs official did  interfere that way in 2013, so paying that salary violated the  restrictions Congress had placed on the money. Based on that ruling,  Housing and Urban Development initiated collection efforts to recover a  portion of the salary paid illegally, as a debt owed back to the United  States from this executive branch staffer, as a result of interfering  with somebody's right to talk to Congress.   Congress has the power of the purse, and bureaucrats need to  understand that funding for their salaries comes with strings attached.  Federal employees cannot be prevented from talking directly to  Congress--pretty plain--period.   There can be no interference with any Federal employee talking  directly to Congress. I should add that you shouldn't even try.   If unelected bureaucrats have so much contempt for an employee who  voluntarily informs the people's elected representatives of facts  necessary to do our constitutional responsibility of oversight, then we  still have a lot of work to do. That kind of thinking is dangerous. It  leads to irresponsible government, and is totally contrary to law. If  that perception is persisting throughout law enforcement, including the  FBI or, indeed, throughout government generally, then the leaders of  those agencies are not doing their job. They are failing in their  responsibility as leaders, they are failing the workforce, and they are  failing the American taxpayer.   I don't want anyone out there to be confused. It is pretty simple. If  you are a Federal employee and you want to disclose wrongdoing and  waste to the Congress or you want to cooperate with a congressional  inquiry, you are legally allowed to do so. You should not have to fear  retaliation. No FBI agent or other government employee should be afraid  to cooperate with Congress or with the inspector general.   Any FBI agent who has information to provide, or questions about  their rights to provide it, should not hesitate to reach out and ask.  Contact the committee. Contact the inspector general. There are people  there who can tell you more about what protections may apply to your  specific situation.   It seems to me that if you know something is wrong, you have a  patriotic responsibility to expose it. Transparency brings  accountability, and what we don't have enough of in the U.S. Government  is accountability.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2946         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
