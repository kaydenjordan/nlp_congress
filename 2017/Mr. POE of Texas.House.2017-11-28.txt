 Mr. Speaker, as most of us were sitting down for  our Thanksgiving meal with our turkey and dressing, there was an empty  chair at the Martinez home because, just a few days before  Thanksgiving, 36-year-old Texas Border Patrol Agent Rogelio Martinez  was killed manning Texas' often violent southern border.   Initial reports indicate Martinez and his partner were ambushed by a  group of illegal immigrants attempting to cross into the United States.  The illegals began throwing rocks, hitting the two officers over and  over again. Both agents suffered broken bones and major head trauma.  Martinez's partner is still in the hospital in critical condition.   Agent Martinez was killed by those seeking to enter the United States  illegally by whatever means possible, ultimately, by killing him. The  FBI is still investigating the homicide and seeks to bring those  responsible to justice.   Rock throwers are not that uncommon on the Texas-Mexico border. Since  2003, 39--39--border patrol agents have been killed while on patrol.   Our agents are outmanned, outgunned, and sometimes outfinanced by the  drug cartels trying to enter the United States. Our border protectors  deserve our total admiration and support.   We mourn the loss of Border Agent Martinez. May God bless his family.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
