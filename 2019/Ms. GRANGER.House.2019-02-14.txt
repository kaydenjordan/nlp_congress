 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 31, a bipartisan plan to fund  the Department of Homeland Security and the remaining appropriations  bills for fiscal year 2019.   Earlier this month, I had an opportunity to travel to the southern  border to see firsthand the situation we face and hear from experts on  the ground about the best way to address the crisis there. The  President is correct; this is a crisis that must be addressed, both for  the safety and security of the American people and for the well-being  of those who are coming here.   We have a responsibility to come together and support what experts on  the border say they need to address the security and humanitarian  crisis.   While this bill falls short of what I would like to see, it will  provide our Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs  Enforcement agents the tools necessary to continue combating the threat  we face.   In particular, the bill provides $1.375 billion for 55 new miles of  wall or physical barriers, as well as additional technology to combat  human and drug trafficking. It is a good downpayment that will allow us  to build new barriers in the areas that the Border Patrol says it is  needed most.   The bill also supports Immigration and Customs Enforcement priorities  by funding detention beds at a higher level than the amount enacted  last year. This will allow agents the flexibility to address surges in  illegal immigration and apprehensions.   It also does not include any limits on ICE enforcement actions that  could cause dangerous criminals to be released into our country.                                time  1945    The agreement prevents another unnecessary shutdown by including  funding for the remaining unfunded appropriations bills: Agriculture;  Commerce, Justice, Science; Financial Services and General Government;  Interior; State and Foreign Operations; and Transportation, Housing and  Urban Development.   By voting for these bills today and funding these vital areas of the  Federal Government, we will secure America and our allies, promote  economic prosperity, protect human life, promote the health and safety  of all Americans, and make vital investments in our Nation's  infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, it would take hours to go through all the bipartisan  provisions included in this bill, so let me take a few minutes to  discuss some of the highlights.   They increase funding for Federal law enforcement to combat  terrorism, espionage, drug traffickers, gangs, and violent criminals;  combat the financing of terrorism and terrorist groups; and strengthen  the development and enforcement of sanctions against Iran, North Korea,  Russia, and Cuba by providing increased funding for the Office of  Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.   We keep our commitment to Israel's security by fully funding the new  memorandum of understanding.   We encourage economic development and job creation in rural  communities across the country.   We boost growth and development of America's small businesses by  providing the opportunity to obtain capital through various Small  Business Administration loan programs.   We provide funding necessary to implement the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  of 2017. This will ensure that American families are keeping more of  their hard-earned dollars, our small businesses are empowered to grow  and expand, and investments are flowing to communities that need it  most.   We maintain all pro-life language included in the various bills  enacted during the 115th Congress under the Republican majority.   We advance drug treatment and recovery initiatives and improve  prevention and enforcement by investing in Justice grant programs that  support things like prescription drug monitoring and at-risk youth  programs.   We increase and focus funding on medical product safety, including  funding to fight opioid abuse. We advance drug and biological product  manufacturing within the United States and approve rare disease  medications. We modernize generic drug development.   We provide increased funding for the Department of the Interior and  U.S. Forest Service to fight devastating wildfires that threaten our  communities.   And we ensure rural areas have the same access to basic utilities  that urban areas do by investing in critical infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend, Chairwoman Lowey, for  all her hard work in these negotiations. As always, she has been an  honest broker and a tough negotiator throughout the process. I look  forward to continuing to work with her in this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank our partners on the other side of the  Capitol, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Shelby and Vice  Chairman Leahy, for their hard work, and all the members of the  conference committee, especially the House Republicans, Congressmen  Fleischmann, Palazzo, and Graves.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I thank the hardworking staff of the  Appropriations Committee for their tireless work, over the last 3 weeks  in particular.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this measure,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Rogers).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Simpson), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Joyce).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I support this conference agreement before  us today, and I urge a ``yes'' vote.   I yield back the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
