 Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the  ``Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act.'' I thank Senator  Capito for her cosponsorship as well as continued partnership on this  important legislation.   This bipartisan bill passed the Senate last Congress by unanimous  consent and then passed the House of Representatives in December 2020.  Unfortunately, then President Trump chose to veto the bill based on  misguided policy and inaccurate data.   I urge my colleagues to once again support this bill, which solely  affects California fishery management, but has far-reaching beneficial  impacts for a wide range of marine animals, including endangered  species. This legislation modernizes a commercial fishery to promote  sustainable fishery management and creates a win-win for conservation  goals and commercial fishing profitability.                                  The Issue    Large mesh drift gillnets, as defined in this legislation, have a  mesh hole size of 14 inches or greater and are used to target swordfish  and thresher shark off the California coast. However, alarmingly, these  nets utilized by this one fishery in Federal waters, according to NOAA,  are responsible for 90% of porpoise and dolphin deaths in all west  coast fisheries combined.   These substantially sized nets are between 1 and 1.5 miles long and  extend more than 100 feet below the ocean's surface. This creates a  ``net wall'' that ensnares approximately 60 non-target species, known  as bycatch, leading to severe harm or drowning of endangered marine  turtles, whales, dolphin, and numerous fish species.   In addition to being banned everywhere else in the United States and  in  [[Page S575]]  some international waters, these specific nets were also banned in  California's state waters in 2018. This bill would bring much needed  parity to state and federal laws on the west coast.   After the State ban, a large majority of the remaining commercial  fishery using drift gillnet gear voluntarily turned in their permits to  the State and received compensation to transition to alternative,  sustainable gear, such as deep set buoy gear.   This bill is critically needed to complete the transition of the  fishery and provide Federal partnership to the successful State  program. The Federal waters off the California coast are the last place  in the United States where these dangerous nets are still used.                           How our bill would help    This bill is identical to the legislation that passed in the 116th  Congress. It provides a common-sense solution by phasing out drift  gillnets over a five-year period from enactment in favor of more  sustainable alternatives, such as deep-set buoy gear. This sustainable  gear has already been proven to yield higher market prices for  fishermen and considerably reduces the amount of bycatch.   In fact, 2020 landings data from the PacFIN database for swordfish  shows that drift gillnet gear caught only 19.8 metric tons of swordfish  at an average of $3.62 per pound yielding a total of $157,728. In the  same fishing season, deep set buoy gear caught 79.4 metric tons of  swordfish at an average of $5.88 per pound for a total value of  $1,028,932. Important to note, deep set buoy gear also had an extremely  low bycatch rate--less than 2 percent--illustrating how this fishery  can be both more sustainable and profitable.   The transition program includes a grant authorization for Federal  funding to match State funds for local fishermen to exchange their  current permits and purchase new, sustainable gear.   This bill has broad support at the State and Federal level, as well  as national groups such as American Sportfishing Association and  Oceana.   In addition, this bill includes a provision important to the Pacific  halibut fishery in Alaska that I have worked with Senator Sullivan and  the Commerce Committee to include.   The provision would enable the Secretary of Commerce to approve  certain charter vessel operators who guide recreational anglers and  harvest Pacific halibut in certain federal waters to collect fees that  would fund the Recreational Quota Entity Program for the purposes of  halibut conservation and research.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to once again pass the  ``Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act'', and I urge them  to support the swift passage of this bipartisan bill.   Thank you once again to Senator Capito and to Commerce Committee  leadership, Senator Cantwell and Senator Wicker for their assistance on  this important legislation.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the Floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Burr, Ms. Smith, and Mr. Scott of          South Carolina):   S. 288. A bill to reauthorize the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research  Act of 2005, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.
