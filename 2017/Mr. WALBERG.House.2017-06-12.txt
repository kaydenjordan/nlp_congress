 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend from  Michigan, the chairman of the Energy Subcommittee, as well as the  ranking member of the subcommittee for this opportunity.   I also want to start off by thanking the Energy and Commerce  Committee staff on both sides of the aisle for their time and work on  this issue.   Additionally, I would like also to thank my colleague, Debbie  Dingell, for being an original cosponsor of H.R. 1109 and helping  advance this bipartisan and, might I add, commonsense rule.   Based on current statute, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  takes the position that approval from the Commission is necessary for  all mergers and acquisitions, no matter how small or insignificant the  value of the facilities involved, even down to zero.   FERC's interpretation has led to trivial paperwork that bogs down the  Commission and creates unnecessary red tape for American businesses,  ultimately increasing utility bills for the consumer. H.R. 1109 will  help reduce excessive paperwork burdens and bring down energy prices  for American families.   This bipartisan solution unties FERC's hands and allows the  Commission to ensure American consumers are getting the most affordable  and reliable electricity possible in a commonsense sort of way. Mr.  Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1109.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
