 Mr. President, I rise to ask unanimous consent that the  following materials in support of section 40209 of the bipartisan  infrastructure framework, the Advanced Energy Manufacturing and  Recycling Grant Program, be entered into the Record.   These sources, which include congressional testimony, disparity  studies, and other evidence, shed further light on the longstanding  barriers and disparities faced by minority-owned small business  entities in the manufacturing sector that have lingering effects today.  According to one study, while minority-owned businesses play a  significant role in U.S. industry, they are underrepresented in the  U.S. manufacturing industry and represent only 12.8 percent of all  manufacturing firms. And in testimony from a July 9, 2020, hearing  before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Diversity and  Inclusion, multiple witnesses spoke to the ongoing barriers that  minority-owned businesses face in accessing capital during the  pandemic. These sources further highlight the importance of and need  for the Advanced Energy Manufacturing and Recycling Grant Program.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Congressional Hearing, Access Denied: Challenges for Women-       and Minority-Owned Businesses and Accessing Capital and       Financial Services During the Pandemic (July 2020) (testimony       focused on pandemic capital access issues).
