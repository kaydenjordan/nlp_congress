Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on S. 3823.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Senator Durbin and Senator Grassley for their  work on this bill. I also thank my colleague on the other side of the  aisle, Representative Cline, for being the Republican lead on the bill.   The Bankruptcy Threshold Adjustment and Technical Corrections Act  shows that we can still come together in a bipartisan and bicameral way  and make commonsense changes to the law that help small businesses on  Main Street and everyday Americans.   Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Speaker, many sole proprietors and  middle-class families who live in high cost-of-living areas were  ineligible to receive chapter 13 bankruptcy protections because the  debt limits were far too low. For families forced into bankruptcy who  wanted to keep their homes, vehicles, or any essential property, and  were willing to pay off their debts under court supervision, chapter 13  is their only lifeline. The alternative for these families can be  devastating. Many have lost everything, including their homes.   The story is similar for small businesses. In 2019, the American  Bankruptcy Institute's Commission on Consumer Bankruptcy found that the  artificially low chapter 13 limits were driving people away from the  relief that they needed, and they called on this Congress to act.   Sole proprietors who could otherwise save their businesses and  protect their families have been forced to liquidate everything because  they exceeded the debt limits of chapter 13.   The Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019, the SBRA, as the  Speaker pro tempore knows, created subchapter V in chapter 11  bankruptcy, a voluntary option for small businesses in need of  expedited bankruptcy relief. But that low debt limit meant that many  small businesses simply could not take advantage of the program.   The travesty of the pandemic really brought the need to increase  these debt limits into stark relief. The CARES Act raised the debt  limit threshold under the SBRA. That was done on a bipartisan basis by  this House. It provided important protections to families and  homeowners, but those provisions were temporary.   My office has been contacted by countless professionals from all over  the bankruptcy community expressing the need for this legislation. The  National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges, an association of the  bankruptcy judges of the United States, has said that the SBRA was one  of the best modifications to the Bankruptcy Code in recent years. It  assisted nearly 3,000 small businesses across the country that were in  need of expedited relief through the pandemic. The Office of the United  States Trustee Program also reported that more than half of these small  business debtors received successful outcomes through a confirmed  reorganization plan in 6 months or less.   Despite the success of this program, the debt limit increase under  the SBRA expired earlier this year, just a few months ago, on March 27,  2022, which created an environment of uncertainty and unpredictability  within the bankruptcy arena. Today's legislation retroactively restores  that higher debt limit and extends it for another 2 years, allowing  more businesses to take advantage of these protections under court  supervision.   This bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent, and I certainly  hope that we can get a similar level of bipartisan support here in the  House. This bill will make a big difference by allowing families to  keep their homes, vehicles, and livelihoods intact while they repay  their debt.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I  will simply close by first thanking the distinguished chairwoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who is always so articulate and I am grateful  for her leadership and kind remarks.   I also thank Mr. Cicilline, the chairman of the subcommittee of  jurisdiction, whose leadership was pivotal; and as I mentioned before,  my Senate partners and Representative Cline.   At the end of the day, I think we have a real opportunity today to  honor American ingenuity, entrepreneurship, and innovation by providing  our small businesses across the United States in Main Street after Main  Street with the opportunity and the tools that they need to be able to  survive.   Mr. Speaker, I think this bill is a small step in that direction. It  is bipartisan. It passed the Senate unanimously, and I certainly hope  that it will pass this Chamber unanimously as well.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
