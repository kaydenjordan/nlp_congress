 Mr. Speaker, there are upwards of 800,000 DREAMers in our  country--young, de facto Americans, people who grew up here, are as  American as you or I, American in fact, albeit not in law. They are  able to work legally under the deferred action, or DACA program, that  President Obama has set up. That has been jeopardized by an  announcement that President Trump will be terminating that program  within 6 months.   Now we are down to about 4\1/2\ months, a challenge to this body,  Democrats and Republicans, to work together to rectify the legal  situation of 800,000 de facto Americans. This body must act. We can't  leave these young Americans in limbo with regard to what their future  prospects are to work.   Make no bones about it, if this body fails to act, over 800,000  aspiring Americans will no longer be able to go to work legally the  very next day after deferred action expires. In the interest of  unifying families, in the interest of these young people who are as  American as you or I, in the interest of our economic growth and  prosperity, I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  stop playing politics and finally pass a DACA fix, like the Dream Act,  into law to make sure that they can give back to the country that has  given so much to them.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. As my colleague noted,  Dr. Kirkpatrick was a psychologist at a VA medical center in Wisconsin.  In 2009, he was fired from his job after allegedly questioning the  overmedication of his patients, particularly related to opioids.  Tragically, that very same day, Dr. Kirkpatrick committed suicide.   I think we can all agree that protecting whistleblowers helps to  ensure that waste, fraud, and abuse in our government does not go  unnoticed or ignored.   It is our responsibility to empower and encourage whistleblowers to  come forward and speak out when something isn't right. No one should  have to live in fear of retaliation for bringing the truth to light. No  one should fear losing their job or career or their life simply for  following the rules.   The Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act increases  accountability by enacting mandatory punishments for any manager or  superior at an agency who has been found to have retaliated against a  whistleblower.   The bill also contains VA-specific reforms to better protect the  privacy of medical records. Employee medical records would now be  prohibited from being accessed in the case of potential retaliation  cases, which adds an additional level of accountability for  supervisors; and protecting the whistleblower from attacks and threats  based on their personal medical history, which would be completely  inappropriate.   Mr. Speaker, while there are strong and necessary reforms in this  bill, I want to make sure that you know that legislation can always be  improved through the amendment process or at least through conducting a  hearing and markup of a bill.   Sadly, but unsurprisingly in this Congress, this bill didn't have a  markup in committee; didn't have a hearing; is considered under a  closed rule, where amendments that were brought forward aren't even  allowed to be debated on the House floor.   This might be a surprise even to the chairman of the Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform, who himself requested a structured  rule that allowed for debate on amendments.   Much of my statement today echoes the sentiment of Oversight and  Government Reform Ranking Member Cummings and his testimony yesterday  evening in the Rules Committee. Though this bill isn't perfect, it can  be improved and strengthened by a few relatively straightforward  amendments, which, unfortunately, were shut  [[Page H7932]]  down in the Rules Committee last night.   The first amendment, which was blocked today, would have addressed  the bill's constitutional concerns first raised by the Office of  Personnel Management by revising the mandatory disciplinary procedures  to allow superiors their constitutional rights to due process in  responding to accusations of retaliation. It would have improved the  bill and made it more likely to stand up in court to challenge.   An amendment reaffirming the right to due process would have been  something at least worth voting on, and, in fact, could have preserved  the constitutionality of the core elements of this bill, ensuring that  it stays in place to protect whistleblowers.   Another amendment blocked under this rule would have addressed  privacy concerns contained in the bill. Specifically, the amendment  would have protected the privacy of a whistleblower who commits  suicide, by requiring the permission of the whistleblower's next of kin  before an agency can share information regarding the suicide.   Again, it seems like a straightforward fix to protect the privacy of  whistleblowers and their families. At the very least, even if Members  of this body disagreed with it, why didn't we at least bring it forward  for debate and a vote?   Another amendment that was blocked today contained the text of Mr.  Cummings' bill, H.R. 702, which was passed by the House of  Representatives unanimously. As you know, this bill would expand  protections for employees who face discrimination, and it solidifies  our commitment to protecting whistleblowers and other employees from  retaliation. It was a bipartisan bill. It passed the House unanimously.  We simply should have allowed it under this bill to become part of a  related effort.   Now, I know that my colleagues on the other side will say: Oh, the  Senate is slow. They won't take up this bill on time. It is better for  us to pass something now than have to wait for their approval.   But it only takes 10 minutes usually to debate an amendment. So we  could have allowed three amendments and spent no more than 30 minutes  debating them and still reported this bill out expeditiously.   Now, I happen to think that, while there are many on the other side  of the aisle who would agree the House needs to return to regular  order, it is time that Members actually started by voting according to  what they are saying. By voting ``no'' on this rule and rejecting it,  we can send the message to House leadership that we want an open,  regular order process.   Bills should come out of committee through markups. Republicans and  Democrats should have the opportunity to amend bills on the floor of  the House. Perhaps if we did that more often, the Senate would not  simply cast aside many of the bills that have passed the House, knowing  that they went through the process of deliberate consideration by our  body, rather than a bill that appears fully formed where Members of  this body simply get an up-or-down vote.   This bill will enjoy bipartisan support when it passes the House  later today, as it should, but it also begs the question of: Why are we  spending valuable time debating a noncontroversial bill, especially if  it is considered under a closed rule? Why not have simply put it up on  suspension in the first place?   To say things bluntly, we are actually running out of time this year.  By my count, we only have 30 legislative days left in the first half of  the 115th Congress, yet we are faced with so many important issues we  need to move forward on.   Nine million children face losing their health insurance because  Congress has not yet acted to reauthorize CHIP. Almost 1 million young,  aspiring Americans have no idea what their lives will look like 6  months from now because of the President's decision to end DACA and  Congress's continued inability to make it permanent law. The citizens  of Puerto Rico, American citizens, still have not been granted a  Federal aid package and are suffering from a lack of food, clean water,  healthcare supplies, and electricity, jeopardizing many of their lives  today.   Yet here we are debating a bill without even allowing an amendment  process that we could have passed under suspension vote yesterday so we  could move on to CHIP, to Puerto Rico, to DACA today, rather than spend  one of our 30 remaining days of business this year avoiding the topics  that the American people want us to take on.   Despite the important goals we have left to accomplish this year, it  is misleading to assume that regular order isn't feasible. We have all  seen how fast Congress can work when we are pushed right up to the  edge. It is past time that we show that same urgency and commitment in  considering legislation under regular order, even if it means we have  to stay here on Thursdays and Fridays, even if it means we are working  until 8 or 9 or 10 or midnight. The American people deserve no less.   Make no mistake, the Whistleblower Protection Act is an important  piece of legislation that will help protect whistleblowers and hold  Federal agencies accountable, but if we are going to devote this much  time to legislation that protects employees, let's take it a step  further and talk about expanding worker protections for an even greater  number of Americans.   For example, my legislation, the Giving Workers a Fair Shot Act-- which I introduced last session and this session, and has yet to  receive a hearing, no less a markup in the Education and Workforce  Committee--would protect workers from wage theft, prevent taxpayer  funds from going towards union busting, and establish first contract  arbitration to prevent companies from dragging on labor negotiations  unnecessarily to the detriment of workers.                                time  1300    We don't have time to waste. If we are going to consider an issue,  let's dive in. We can protect whistleblowers from retaliation and  strengthen the rights of workers at the same time. Given the minimal  amount of time we have left to work with, 30 days this year, we have an  obligation to do both.   By the way, the fact that we only work 30 more days this year here in  the United States Congress probably comes as a great surprise to many  hardworking Americans who are accustomed to working 5 days a week. We  have the rest of the month of October, November, December. Well, many  Americans might get Christmas Day off, perhaps even Christmas Eve, but  I don't think Americans realize that Congress is only going to work 30  days out of the next 78 days. That is less than a half-time job, Mr.  Speaker.   I think the American people deserve more from us in this body,  especially when so many issues like CHIP, like DACA, like Puerto Rico,  and many others have gone unanswered by us in this body, the House of  Representatives, or by colleagues across the way in the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump has been relentless on his attack on  immigrant Americans, generally, and, in particular, DREAMers since he  took office. Yet 82 percent of American voters, including about 70  percent of Republicans, believe DREAMers should be allowed to stay in  the U.S. and apply for citizenship. Yet President Trump has continued  to turn his back on these innocent young people.   Mr. Speaker, here is our chance to rectify President Trump's decision  and restore the American people's faith in us and our faith in our  aspiring Americans.   When we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to  the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act. This bipartisan,  bicameral legislation would help thousands of young people who are de  facto Americans in every way except for on paper.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania). Is there  objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, by defeating the previous question today, we  can bring forward the Dream Act, which I am confident would pass on the  floor of the House probably by a good margin.   What the Dream Act does is it allows young people who grew up in our  country, who know no other country, a pathway to become citizens. They  have gone to our schools, they have been on the football team or  cheerleaders like your own kids or grandkids, Mr. Speaker.   They are able to work legally in our country because of the deferred  action program, which is scheduled by President Trump to be canceled in  4\1/2\ months. We need to act now to give these young people the  certainty they need to live their lives as Americans, the only country  they know, and the only country that they are loyal to.   We simply don't have time to waste. We need to give these young de  facto Americans the certainty they need to continue with their lives to  be able to contribute to our country, join our military, pay taxes, and  all of the other responsibilities that Americans have.   Of course, Mr. Speaker, protecting whistleblowers is important. It is  critical to ensure that our democracy functions honestly and with  accountability and government is truly working in the best interests of  the people that it serves. But we could get there a better way, by  having an open process that allows Democrats and Republicans to suggest  further improvements to whistleblower protection rather than having a  bill that was never marked up in committee, that simply appeared fully  formed for the full House to consider without the opportunity for  Democrats or Republicans to make it any better.   The Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act will  strengthen the rights of whistleblowers and reaffirm their value and  importance to our country. But once again, this bill should have gone  through a regular process that allowed us to amend it.   The fact that this bill passed the Senate with bipartisan support  shouldn't stop us from making changes in this body, the House of  Representatives, to improve the bill and make it work even better. We  have an obligation to our constituents to thoughtfully consider every  piece of legislation in front of us and to amend where we see fit.   As we move forward on addressing the pressing issues in front of us,  such as finding a path forward on deferred action, which we will  present if we can defeat the previous question, reauthorizing CHIP, or  making improvements in our healthcare system, let's do it through a  regular process that allows Democrats and Republicans, the 435 of us  who serve here, to bring forward our ideas, not just the ideas of  leadership in making the country a better place.   We have good, smart, deliberate Members on both sides of the aisle  who want to work, want to legislate. It is ridiculous that we only have  30 days out of the next 78 in which Congress  [[Page H7934]]  will even be working, and I suspect for most of the 30 days, like  today, Democrats and Republicans won't even be able to offer their  ideas and have them considered. The American people deserve better.   We as an institution, as the United States Congress, can do better,  and we can begin by defeating the previous question and defeating the  rule.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
