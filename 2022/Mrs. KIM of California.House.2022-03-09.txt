 Mr. Speaker, I share concerns that others  have raised on the process of our getting here, but I rise today in  favor of banning Russian energy imports. And I urge the Biden  administration to work on an all-of-the-above domestic energy strategy.   While I am glad that we are stopping the flow of U.S. capital to the  Kremlin, I am concerned that prices will rise without a plan to support  domestic energy production. Our national security will also continue to  be at risk as the administration looks to countries like Iran and  Venezuela to fuel our communities.   The more we rely on authoritarian regimes, the more we hurt our  economy, national security, and environment.   Energy security is national security. We need responsible energy  solutions to expand domestic energy supply chains and lower costs for  consumers.
