 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  recognition. I want to recognize her as a great leader on the matter  before us today. This legislation, the America COMPETES Act, is  something that has come to the floor largely because of the investments  that she has made over the years in science and technology, keeping  America competitive, and now as the chair of the Committee on Science,  Space, and Technology. I thank her for the intellect that she has  brought to this and the reputation that she has enjoyed in the  scientific and academic community in support of her legislative  initiatives, this bill being a highlight of it all.   Madam Speaker, America has long been a beacon of excellence in  science and engineering in the world, forging innovations that have  been transformative for workers, businesses, and for our economy. By  investing in education and research, we were preeminent. We have been  preeminent in the world's arena. A number of years ago, maybe 20, maybe  longer, other countries followed our blueprint. They followed our lead.  They invested in education and recognized the value of investment in  research and new technologies. Now they threaten our position as the  world leader in science and innovation. We have been seeing that over  time.   The technology that we rely on each day and those that will take us  into the future must be made here in America or else we will be at the  mercy of those other countries, driving up costs for American families  and eroding our global competitiveness.   Madam Speaker, this situation is a challenge to the economic security  of our country, the financial security of our families, and the  national security of our Nation. It must be met head-on with bold,  strategic action that seizes the opportunity for progress. Today the  House is seizing that opportunity in passing legislation that meets the  moment by securing the preeminence of American manufacturing,  innovation, and economic strength with the America COMPETES Act.   To be preeminent in technology and innovation is essential so that  America becomes self-sufficient in the manufacture of critical goods.   The America COMPETES Act will do this, and transport our Nation into  the future, by: First, supercharging our investment in CHIPS for  America Act. Semiconductors are a key component to everything from  computers to cars to your personal phone, Madam Speaker. Cars contain  hundreds of chips; electric cars, thousands. Chips are the lifeblood of  modern technology.   Over the past 30 years, America's global share of manufacturing  semiconductors has been outpaced by other  [[Page H824]]  countries, leaving us dependent on those countries and vulnerable to  their supply chain issues, which drive up costs at home, for Americans.   The America COMPETES Act directs $52 billion for the CHIPS for  America Act. That is contained in this bill. It will address supply  chain disruptions that push up costs for families, bring back chips  production to America, and ensure that the United States leads the way  on semiconductor fabrication.   Madam Speaker, specifically, the bill provides financial assistance  to incentivize investment in facilities and equipment for semiconductor  fabrication, assembly, testing, advanced packaging, and research  development. This is very specific and very well thought out.   Secondly, the America COMPETES Act advances manufacturing at home in  our country and strengthens our supply chains. The pandemic has exposed  the vulnerabilities of global supply chains that rely on other  countries. We need to be making goods in America with American workers.  The America COMPETES Act authorizes $45 billion to support the  manufacture and acquisition of critical goods or industrial equipment  that are essential for national security and economic vitality  including components and products for public health in biological  preparedness. This is very important.   Madam Speaker, information and communications technology, energy and  transportation sector's industrial base, and agriculture and food  product supply chains, that affects everyone in our country.   The America COMPETES Act reduces our reliance on critical goods from  countries of concern and encourages the relocation of manufacturing  facilities out of those countries. It supports the creation of jobs  with competitive wages including by preserving existing collective  bargaining agreements and supporting union organizing efforts.   I will remind you that one and two were about supercharging our  investment in chips and advancing manufacturing at home and  strengthening the supply chains.                                time  1700    Three, the America COMPETES Act advances America's scientific  research and innovation excellence to ensure that we lead the  technologies of the future. It includes a suite of bipartisan science,  research, and technology bills to turbocharge American innovation  focused squarely on producing solutions and results. I reiterate, a  suite of bills that have been bipartisan in committee and on the floor  of the House.   It maximizes the American talent pool by strengthening and  diversifying our Nation's STEM workforce. This is very important  because we want many more people, women, people of color, other  previously underrepresented communities to be part of this.   And, fourth, the America COMPETES Act promotes U.S. global  leadership, ensuring that the 21st century is the American century,  positioning the interests and values of the United States to win on the  world stage. And there are competitors for that honor.   Central to the America COMPETES Act is the strong action taken to  hold the PRC accountable for its trade abuses, which hurt U.S. workers,  and for its human rights violations, including the genocide against the  Uyghurs. People have to understand the connection between human rights  violations and fairness to American workers. Actually, what is  happening in China with the Uyghurs is beyond human rights; it is  genocide to the nth degree.   This use of forced labor which they are doing with the Uyghurs is  immoral and horrific, yes, and it hurts U.S. workers who have to  compete with slave labor. So understand human rights there and fairness  to our workers here are connected.   The House bill reflects a rigorous, comprehensive process of  listening to the experts and crafting legislation that will truly rise  to this challenge, and I thank Madam Chair for doing that. Eleven  committees have fed into this legislation, so I know we have heard from  many of the chairs in the debate today, and we will hear from many more  Members as we go into the amendment process. But I want to congratulate  you, Madam Chair.   Well over 100 research and scientific institutions have already  endorsed this bill or its key components, from:   Academic institutions: Including the Association of American  Universities and dozens of top research universities, including the Ivy  League schools and leading public institutions, including the  University of California system.   Leading scientific groups: Such as American Association for the  Advancement of Science, American Nuclear Society, American Mathematical  Society, and American Society for Engineering Education.   Top innovation firms and business groups: The Chamber of Commerce,  the Semiconductor Industry Association, the National Association of  Manufacturers, and companies like Intel who invest in these chips.   Groups representing American workers--and this is very important.   Groups representing American workers, led by the AFL-CIO, and I  mentioned the Teamsters, who write, ``On behalf of America's supply  chain union,'' they call themselves, ``I applaud the House Democratic  leadership for moving forward with their own legislation that addresses  the crucial issue of competing with China in a way that benefits U.S.  working families for many years to come.'' Their statement continues,  ``I agree with President Biden that America COMPETES Act will bring  manufacturing jobs back home to this country and make America's supply  chains more resilient.''   The America COMPETES Act is built on bipartisan bills, many of which  have already passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan margins, my  colleagues, overwhelming bipartisan margins. And that includes the  National Science Foundation for the Future Act, the Department of  Energy Science for the Future Act, Rural STEM Education Act, Open RAN  Outreach Act, FUTURE Networks Act, Strengthening America's Strategic  National Stockpile Act, and many more.   In closing, I just want to say the America COMPETES Act recognizes  and meets the challenges of the 21st century, ensuring that America  cannot just compete but must win the global landscape. As I said in the  beginning, we were in the lead. We set a good example for the world.  Others followed our lead and became competitive with us.   A vote for this bill would be a vote for making more American goods  here in America with American workers. A vote for this bill would  strengthen our supply chains and lower costs for families. It would  bring forceful action to ensure that America, not the People's Republic  of China, but America writes the rules of the road for the 21st  century.   Madam Speaker, I urge a strong bipartisan vote for the America  COMPETES Act and for ensuring the global preeminence of America's  manufacturing for American workers and the American economy and our  security now and for years to come.   Again, congratulations to Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson and other  chairs who worked so hard to bring this very important legislation to  the floor and to the fore.
