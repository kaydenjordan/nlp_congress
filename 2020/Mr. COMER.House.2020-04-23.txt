 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Americans are suffering right now. Hospitals, families, and  businesses are figuring out what their next step will be.   But, instead of helping American families, Speaker Pelosi wants to  set up a new, costly, unnecessary select committee. This is an  outrageous attempt to yet again use Congress to smear President Trump  in an election year, just like the impeachment charade a few months  ago.   I am all about oversight. We already have an Oversight Committee that  is tasked with carrying out these very duties, and it is a very good  committee, a quality committee made up of outstanding members from both  sides of the aisle.   This is yet another political game from Speaker Pelosi using tax  dollars for political gain. Creating a new select committee is  completely redundant. We must stop these games and, instead, focus on  the real problems facing the American people.   Creating an entirely new select committee is an irresponsible waste  of time and resources that could be used elsewhere. Let's refocus on  getting this country back on track and moving forward for the American  people.
