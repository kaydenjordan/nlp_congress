 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from  California. Those are some very important insights from the West Coast.  We pray that America does not make those same decisions in the other  States. I am grateful for principled leadership out of California here  in the House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman),  my good friend and colleague.
