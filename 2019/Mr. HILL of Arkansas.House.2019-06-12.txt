 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendment  to the Labor-Health and Human Services appropriations package, which  strikes all guidance related to the obligation of funds for the  Affordable Care Act's navigator program. By passing this amendment, we  can prevent further wasteful spending on this failed and very  inefficient program.   For plan year 2017, navigators received a total of $62.5 million in  grants and enrolled 81,000 individuals. Each of these enrollments cost  taxpayers $767. Further, those 81,000 individuals accounted for less  than 1 percent of all the enrollment in ACA plans for that year.   Arkansas does not use the Federal marketplace, but I think it is  worth noting that according to CMS, only 2.3 percent of the people in  my district purchased their healthcare on the exchange in 2017.  Nationwide, less than 4 percent of the population bought Affordable  Care Act plans. With a little bit of math, we come to the conclusion  that we are spending $62.5 million to enroll less than three-tenths of  1 percent of the population.   The administration wisely decided that this money could be better  spent elsewhere and cut funding for the program to a more reasonable  level of $10 million. Yet for some reason, my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle would like to force the administration to spend $100  million on this, in my view, wasteful and ineffective program.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, well, we are all interested in  having affordable healthcare, and that is why we have more market-based  healthcare. If we open up this market and reduce constraints, then we  will get more affordable policies.   I would submit to the Chair tonight that the reason people don't  accept these policies is not due to a lack of advertising, Madam Chair,  but due to the expense, complexity, and unaffordability of these plans.   In this regard, Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. David P. Roe). My good friend is the ranking member on  the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Madam Chair, let me simply say that, simply  put, at $768 per enrollee, the navigator program is a waste of taxpayer  resources.   With ever-shrinking budget pressure, we are better off spending this  money on NIH research or doing something that will help long-term  health, as my friend Dr. Roe is interested in: drug abuse, mental  health attention. Those are the issues that are facing this country and  a better use of this money.   Madam Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I would like to return to the  topic today of apprenticeships that are so important to our workforce  across this country.   My amendment would strip a portion of the bill that would spend  hundreds of millions of dollars to only support Department of Labor- registered apprenticeship programs, a stipulation that has not been in  place in previous bills regarding apprenticeship grant funding.   So, let me be clear. I support Department of Labor-registered  apprenticeship programs. I am not here to speak ill of those programs  because they do a good job of equipping workers across this country  with the skills they need to be successful.   But I am here because I have a problem with the Congress telling the  American public that the only way to fill the skills gap and create  opportunities is through government-defined apprenticeship programs.   Right now, our economy is facing an enormous skilled workforce  shortage. According to the Department of Labor, there are 7.4 million  job vacancies, and, with our continued economic prosperity, that number  will only grow.   I speak with businesses in my district on a regular basis, in all  sectors. Many would like to expand, create new jobs; but a consistent  message, Madam Chair, is they are not able to because  [[Page H4572]]  they cannot find workers with the necessary skills.   It is an unfortunate fact that the registered apprenticeship programs  come up short of adequately skilling our entire workforce. For example,  in the construction industry, which uses more registered apprenticeship  programs than any other industry, only 26,000 people graduated from a  registered apprenticeship program in 2018.   Currently, the construction industry employs nearly 7.5 million  people, which means that less than 1 percent of the workers in that  industry went through a registered apprenticeship program.   Economic estimates have the number of current job openings in  construction at 444,000 in total. So, if we were to rely only on  registered apprenticeship programs, it would take 17 years to fill  those openings, Madam Chair.   That is why this amendment is so important: to offer flexibility and  to let other industry-related apprenticeship programs also get grant  funding.   We are not denying registered apprenticeship grant funding. We are  just simply saying that nonindustry- registered grant funding should be effective. They are safe, efficient,  and result in stackable and portable credentials.   Madam Chair, I would like to call on my friend from Kentucky,   Andy  Barr, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, a man who  chairs the Republican Study Committee's American Worker Task Force, and  ask him for his views.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Barr).    Madam Chair, I yield the gentleman an  additional 15 seconds.    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Madam Chair, let me say that I appreciate the  in-demand job work that the committee has put in place in the bill.  That is wonderful. And I appreciate my friend from Connecticut's  passion for this topic. I share it. I support DOL-supported  apprenticeships. That has nothing to do with it.   This simply says that we strike the word ``only'' and that, if there  is a gap somewhere in a local economy in this country, we have the  flexibility to have an industry apprenticeship receive a grant.   This is supported by the Associated Builders and Contractors, the  general contractors, the equipment manufacturers, the electrical  contractors, the home builders, the roofing contractors, so this bill  has full support.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record their letters.                                                 Associated General                                          Contractors of America,                                                      June 12, 2019.       AGC KEY VOTE: Vote ``Yes'' on Hill Amdt. No. 38 to H.R. 2740.       Hon. French Hill,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Hill: On behalf of the Associated       General Contractors of America (AGC), I write to urge you to       support Rep. French Hill Amendment No. 38 to H.R. 2740, which       would allow federal grant funds to be used for apprenticeship       programs registered with the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)       as well as industry-recognized apprenticeship programs.       Because workforce development is a critical issue for the       construction industry, AGC reserves the right to record your       vote on this amendment as a ``key vote'' for the education of       its membership.        All forms of apprenticeship, whether registered or       industry-recognized, are clear and  [[Page H4573]]       direct pathways to quality middle-class jobs. While the       construction industry is currently the largest utilizer of       apprenticeship trained workers, the industry continues to       experience a severe worker shortage. The U.S. Bureau of Labor       Statistics Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey identified       404,000 job openings in construction at the end of April, the       highest total for any month since the series began.        To help alleviate these challenges, grow job opportunities       and meet economic demand, AGC believes it is vital to build       upon the past successes construction apprenticeship programs       have achieved and allow them every opportunity to recruit and       train new talent into the industry, including access to       valuable federal grants. Ensuring workers are properly       educated and trained is essential to the future of the       construction industry as well as the nation's infrastructure       and economic growth.        While certain segments of the construction industry utilize       DOL's registered apprenticeship program, not all do.       Consequently, all segments of the construction industry       should ultimately be able to benefit from any DOL grants       programs. Many contractors have developed their own       apprenticeship programs in the private industry-recognized       market. Industry-led apprenticeships in construction have       strict standards of accountability and methods to ensure       quality, with penalties for noncompliance. All these programs       should have access to the same federal grant programs       regardless.        AGC supports creating quality jobs and training the skilled       workers to fill them. As such, federal grants should be       available to all quality programs. Again, AGC reserves the       right to record your vote as a ``key vote'' for the education       of its membership.            Sincerely,                                                Jimmy Christianson,      Vice President, Government Relations.                                   ____                                                      June 12, 2019.        Dear Representative: The undersigned organizations write in       support of an amendment offered by Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.)       to H.R. 2740--the Labor, Health and Human Services,       Education, Legislative Branch, Defense, State, Foreign       Operations and Energy and Water Development Appropriations       Act, 2020--which would allow Department of Labor grants to be       used for all forms of apprenticeships. This amendment would       open workforce development and skills education opportunities       for all Americans.        Currently, our nation has a severe skilled workforce       shortage. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,       there are 7.4 million job openings in the United States. The       BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey identified 404,000       job openings in construction at the end of April, the highest       total for any month since the series began. To close the       skills gap and provide career opportunities to the most       Americans possible, Congress should focus on expanding all       forms of apprenticeships, rather than only DOL-registered       programs.        Market-driven or industry-recognized apprenticeships are       the most widely used form of skills education in the       construction industry. They have proven to be safe, effective       and successful in providing students with stackable and       portable credentials that are accepted worldwide.        Many of the below organizations operate both industry-      recognized and DOL-registered apprenticeship programs.       Businesses and associations provide the most effective career       opportunities when they are able to choose the best form of       skills education for their respective value propositions.        Rep. Hill's amendment recognizes that DOL-registered       apprenticeship programs provide career opportunities, but       they cannot fill the skills gap on their own--according to       DOL, only about 26,000 individuals finished a registered       construction apprenticeship program in 2018 in an industry       that employs 7.4 million people.        We thank Rep. Hill for introducing this amendment to       provide career opportunities to all Americans and we       encourage all members of the House of Representatives to       support it.            Sincerely,      Associated Builders and Contractors.      Independent Electrical Contractors.      National Association of Home Builders.      National Roofing Contractors Association.      Opportunity America.                                   ____       Ms. Lesley Hill.        Dear Lesley: The equipment manufacturing industry is       growing and adding thousands of jobs each year, but like many       other industries, there simply aren't enough individuals with       the right skill-sets available to fill these jobs. The       Association of Equipment Manufacturers and its members       support a wide variety of training programs and initiatives       to develop the skill-sets of individuals so that that they       are job ready. This includes apprenticeship programs. AEM is       supportive of all apprenticeship programs that develop       tomorrow's workers, and so it makes no sense to limit the       government funding for these initiatives to only one type of       apprenticeship program. AEM supports amendment 38, sponsored       by Representative French Hill, which would remove limitations       on the type of apprenticeship programs eligible for grant       money under Title I of H.R. 2740, the appropriations vehicle       for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and       Education, and Related Agencies for fiscal year 2020.       Representative Hill's amendment is a common-sense change to       the legislation that will help train a broader group of       workers for careers in family sustaining jobs.        If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach       out.            Best,      Megan Evans,      Government Relations Manager, Association of Equipment       Manufacturers (AEM).     Madam Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote to offer  flexibility for contract apprenticeships across this country, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
