 Madam Speaker, as the song goes: If there is  something strange in your neighborhood, who you gonna call? If  something is weird and it don't look good, who you gonna call?   Madam Speaker, don't call Ghostbusters, call the police. During  National Police Week, we recognize it takes strength and courage to  wear a badge and answer the call. It takes commitment to respond to an  emergency, to run toward gunfire rather than away from it. For law  enforcement, that is just part of the job.   While crazy town continues to demonize law enforcement, we the people  know they are not the enemy; they are heroes.   Madam Speaker, on behalf of our country, I say two words to these  brave patriots, words they don't hear enough: Thank you.   I thank them for protecting our communities. I thank them for  protecting our families. To everyone who wears a badge and enforces our  laws, I and America will always back the blue.                            ____________________
