 Madam President, today, I would like to recognize  and honor the life of my friend and fellow aviator, Tom Poberezny,  after his passing earlier this week. It is no coincidence that this  week is the annual Experimental Aircraft Association--EAA--AirVenture  air show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, an event that Tom was monumental in  propelling to a world-level aviation event.   Tom and I got to know each other at this event, and I am grateful for  the fellowship we built over a shared love of aviation. Like his  father, the founder of EAA Paul Poberezny, Tom was first appointed  chairman to EAA AirVenture in 1977. At the time, it was simply a  national gathering of small plane enthusiasts. Under his leadership, it  grew into an international event with hundreds of thousands of visitors  every year.   Like me, Tom was a lifelong aviation enthusiast. There is no doubt  that Tom had a long-lasting impact on the aviation community, from his  involvement with the U.S. National Unlimited Aerobatic Team to his  presidency of EAA. As president of EAA, Tom had a leadership role  advocating for sport pilots and light-sport category aircraft, and he  spearheaded the construction of the current EAA Aviation Center  headquarters and museum complex in Oshkosh, WI.   Tom recognized the importance of growing the next generation of  aviators. In 1992, he led the creation of the Young Eagles program  designed to give young kids an opportunity to experience flight in a  general aviation airplane while educating them about aviation. In 2003,  Tom played a pivotal leadership role as a member of the Centennial of  Flight Commission to commemorate the Wright Brothers' historic first  flight.   When Tom retired from EAA, his work wasn't finished. He served on the  boards of several organizations including Angel Flight West, which  provides free air transportation for passengers in need of medical  treatment far from home.   Throughout the years, Tom was recognized for his notable  contributions to the aviation community. In 1996, he was inducted into  the Wisconsin Aviation Hall of Fame, and 20 years later, he was  inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame. Tom's dedication to  aviation serves as an example for us all, and his legacy will stand the  test of time.   Most aviators know Tom's history, but what they may not be aware of  was his close relationship with individuals in the aviation community.  I was with Tom at Oshkosh since 1979, the very first year I went with  my two young aviator sons. We didn't miss a single Oshkosh in 43 years,  and each reunion was one of my happiest moments. We are part of the Tom  Poberezny family, and for that reason, the relationship is very  special.   Kay and I join his family in their grief and in celebrating the life  of Tom Poberezny, a remarkable champion of aviation.                            ____________________
