 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yet again rise along with my  colleagues because Americans are dying and this House is doing nothing.  They are dying every day in their homes, in our schoolyards, and, yes,  even at events hosted by Members of this House. Still we do nothing.   Mr. Speaker, every day, 93 Americans lose their lives to gun  violence, and still this House has not acted.   If anything, last week, the majority passed through a dangerous bill  that will put more lives, especially the lives of law enforcement  officers, at risk.    Mr. Speaker, these are fathers and mothers, daughters and sons,  beloved friends and dear colleagues. These are people in every one of  our communities and in every one of our districts. Not one Member of  this House can come to the floor and say that their community--their  neighbors and their district--hasn't been affected by gun violence. Not  one Member, yet we still do nothing as bullets fly and mothers cry. We  do nothing as we lose children and  [[Page H9841]]  police officers. The death, destruction, and carnage continue, and  still we do nothing.   In less than a decade, two Members of this House have been shot and a  staffer murdered, and even that can't move us to act and save American  lives.   Mr. Speaker, at what cost does our continued silence come?   Earlier this year, I pledged to read the names of 5,950 gun violence  victims into the Congressional Record--a number that should have  special significance to the Speaker.   Today we continue honoring those taken from us by gun violence, and  we pledge to honor their legacy through action that saves lives.   So I asked my social media followers to share their personal stories  of how gun violence has torn their families and communities apart.  These are their names and stories:   Lenore Draper, a community activist working to stop the violence.   Kenneth D. Mitchell, Jr., served three tours of duty in Afghanistan,  Iraq, and Kuwait. He lost his life to gun violence here in America,  leaving behind three sons, one of whom will never meet his father.   Thomas R. Lee was killed in Harvey, Illinois, on August 13, 2008.   Patricia May Springer.   Malcolm Dowdy was killed leaving a Memorial Day party. He had just  purchased a home, was getting married, was on the dean's list, and was  the proud father of a 17-month-old. His mom, Michelle, asked me to read  his name.   Katie Kearns, just 24 years old, was murdered in rural Kankakee  County.   John Thomas Larimer, just age 27, gave his life protecting two  friends at the Aurora, Colorado, theater shooting.   Jessica Ghawi was also killed at the tragedy in Aurora, Colorado. Her  mother, Sandy, asked me to read her name today.                                time  1900    Jonathan Schaffer.   Camilo Senchyna-Beltran, killed while celebrating the completion of  paramedic school. Tomorrow should have been his 30th birthday.   Sterling ``Steelo'' G. McKenzie.   Rami Cooks.   Lashea Cretain was shot five times by a boyfriend in 1996, and  survived. She reached out on Twitter, asking me to tell her story. She  still lives with those bullets.   Steven Laurence, 21, a friend of my staffer, Mia.   Kenneth Bowens.   Diane Mokos Kriz, the mother of four girls, was murdered while  stopping at her church on the way to the hospital where she worked. Her  sister, Charlene, asked me to read her name.   Lindsay Key.   Calvin Thompson, Jr.   Kenzo Dix, just 15 years old, killed in an accident with a loaded,  but unlocked, gun.   Bill Venable, 17, and his father, Billy Venable.   Tim Boyd of Chicago Heights.   Kerry Parks was killed in a drive-by shooting. Her friend Lucy asked  me to read her name. She said that Kerry ``was my best friend and was  just playing out in her front yard like we always did. She was full of  life, love, and smiles.''   Maurice Hobbs.   Betsy Lowther, who left behind a husband, a daughter, and grandson.  Her niece Amy asked me to read her name. She said her aunt ``was a  generous, loving, vibrant woman who struggled with depression.''   James Williams, 21 years old.   Larry Perrine, 17 years old.   Galen Gibson, 18 years old.   Professor N. Saez.   Ricky Riggins.   Joyce Penebaker. I was asked to read her name by her son Khary. He  said: ``I chose to tell my daughter about my mom, her grandmother, and  how she died by suicide with a gun when I was very young. I wanted my  daughter to know what has motivated me to get active in the gun  violence prevention movement.''   Christy Owens.   Patrick Wyatt McKinley. His mother, Jeanette, asked me to read his  name. He was killed in front of his home on New Year's Eve 2004, a day  that should be a celebration of new beginnings.   Steven Shears.   Kimberlee Thomas and her father, Keith Thomas.   Kay Weins was taken while showing compassion to a stranger. She left  behind two sons and several beautiful grandchildren. Her cousin Edward  asked me to read her name.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the Commonwealth of  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark). Since her election, Congresswoman Clark has  been a dedicated leader in efforts to protect the health and safety of  American families. Congresswoman Clark cares deeply about this issue  and was the architect of the gun violence prevention sit-in.    Mr. Speaker, I am sorry the Congresswoman had  to read all of those names. Maybe, as we go on, things will change. We  will learn and things will change.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of  California (Ms. Lee), a member of the Appropriations Committee.  [[Page H9842]]    Since her election to Congress, Congresswoman Lee has been a fearless  and dedicated leader on ending poverty and health disparities in our  Nation's communities, including gun violence.   Like many who serve in this House, she is someone who has attended  too many funerals and comforted too many grieving mothers, fathers, and  colleagues because of gun violence.    Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman Lee's words remind  me of what I hear sometimes: we need to wait before we do anything;  this group or that group or someone just died, and we are already  talking about what we are going to do. It has been 5 years since  Newtown, and we still have done nothing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings).  She sees this issue through a number of lenses: a mom, a wife of law  enforcement, and a career law enforcement officer herself.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Demings for  those remarks, and I thank her for reminding us of the law enforcement  officers who have lost their lives protecting us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty),  from the town of Newtown. Congresswoman Esty is a tireless advocate for  [[Page H9843]]  commonsense legislation that will save American lives. She knows all  too well the cost that gun violence takes on our communities and on our  families. Like many who serve in this House, she is someone who has  attended funerals, comforted, and continues to comfort so many grieving  mothers and fathers because of gun violence.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Esty for  her words, her commitment, and her voice in making sure that those 26  lives will never be forgotten.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I have been reading names for nearly  half an hour, and we still have stacks and stacks of names--the names  of Americans taken by gun violence--to still read. And, tragically,  every day the list of names grows and grows as we do nothing to stop  it.   Children are murdered in their kindergarten classroom and we remain  silent. Mothers and their children are killed in Cracker Barrel parking  lots and we still do not act.   Hadiya Pendleton, a smart, charming, and talented young woman who  performed at Barack Obama's inauguration has been resting for nearly 5  years. How much longer must she wait, Mr. Speaker?    Country concerts, nightclubs, and even a congressional baseball  practice have been shooting galleries, and the majority callously often  calls for thoughts and prayers and moments of silence.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to crawl out from under the gun lobby  checkbook and do something--anything--to save American lives.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 24 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, December 13, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
