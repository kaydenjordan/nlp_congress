 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Paycheck  Fairness Act.   I want to commend Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro for her extraordinary  efforts and commend Chairman Scott for bringing this timely policy to  fruition.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act.  I think most of us can agree that every American should earn equal pay  for equal work.   This legislation takes meaningful steps toward ensuring that every  American, regardless of gender, receives fair compensation for their  work.   We have seen over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic that essential  workers are the lifeblood of our society. We have seen women on the  frontlines in the hospital, in the classroom, and at our essential  retail stores, and it is time that all of these ``sheroes'' are  compensated at the same rate as their male counterparts.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the International  Brotherhood of Teamsters urging passage of this legislation and  highlighting the persistent wage gaps between genders.                                           International Brotherhood                                                    of Teamsters,                                     Washington, DC, April 13, 2021.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than 1.4 million       members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, I urge       you to support fundamental fairness by combating wage       discrimination on the basis of sex by passing H.R. 7, the       Paycheck Fairness Act. I urge you to vote yes on H.R. 7 and       to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act without any weakening       amendments.        The Paycheck Fairness Act would address the persistent wage       gap based on sex by eliminating loopholes that hinder the       effectiveness of the Equal Pay Act of 1963. H.R. 7 would       update and strengthen the Equal Pay Act in important ways.       The bill closes loopholes that have allowed employers to pay       women less than men for the same work without any important       business purpose related to the job. It would require       employers to demonstrate that wage gaps are truly the result       of factors other than gender. Importantly, it would prohibit       retaliation against workers who share salary information or       inquire about their employer's wage practices. H.R. 7 would       also bring the remedies and procedures of the Equal Pay Act       into conformance with those available for other civil rights       claims. The Paycheck Fairness Act holds employers accountable       for pay discrepancies between their male and female employees       while strengthening incentives to prevent pay discrimination.       And, it would preclude pay discrimination from following       women from job to job.        While some progress has been made since the passage of the       Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, the wage gap still       persists, and disparities are evident at every educational       level. Nationally, women still earn only 82 cents for every       dollar earned by their male colleagues. For women of color,       the wage gaps are even larger.        Passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act will provide women and       all other workers the tools necessary to challenge       discrimination against them. It is an important step in       making real progress in the fight to eliminate the gender       wage gap and to provide economic, and retirement, security to       women and their families.        It is well past the time to end pay discrimination in the       workplace. The Teamsters Union urges you to reject weakening       amendments and to vote yes on final passage of the Paycheck       Fairness Act.            Sincerely,                                                    James P. Hoffa,                                                 General President.    Mr. Speaker, the gender gap is clear, and the Paycheck  Fairness Act will address this disparity. Not only will this  legislation help women in Georgia, but it will help families across the  Nation.                                time  1300
