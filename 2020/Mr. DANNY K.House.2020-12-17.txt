 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, to live to become 109  years old in this country, or any country, as a matter of fact, is  quite a feat. Such has been the life and legacy of Mrs. Rosie Atchison,  who was born on August 15, 1911, in Bolivar, Mississippi, and passed  away on November 23, 2020.   Her birth mother passed away when Rosie was just 6 weeks old. She was  taken into the care of her father, Mr. Henry Liner, who raised her as  the second oldest of 27 children whom he fathered.   Rosie grew up in Clarksdale, Mississippi, where she lived a typical  life of Blacks in that area. She worked the fields, went to church, got  married, had two children, lost a child, got tired of the fields and a  failed marriage, and took her two children and migrated to Chicago,  looking for a better life. That is exactly what she found.   With faith in God, she joined the Greater Salem Missionary Baptist  Church, where the renowned gospel singer Mahalia Jackson was a member,  and she also sang in the choir.   She met and married her second husband, Mr. Andrew Atchison, who  worked for the Diamond Glue Factory. She found a job cleaning railcars  for the Pennsylvania Railroad and worked there until her retirement in  1970.   Mrs. Atchison and her husband became very productive citizens and  developed a reputation for helping others less fortunate than  themselves. She became known to many as Big Mama, not because of her  stature, but because she embraced any and everyone who needed help that  she could help.   She and her husband lived in the heart of the Bronzeville community  until they were forced out to make room for the Illinois Institute of  Technology. They protested and held marches around city hall but lost.   After her husband died, she purchased a two-flat building in the  Englewood community and kept on helping people.   On November 23, 2020, after 109 years and 3 months, Rosie passed  away, leaving 2 daughters; 15 grandchildren; 60 great-grandchildren; 95  great-great-grandchildren; 24 great-great-great-grandchildren; 1  sister, Ms. Josephine Liner Wilson; and a host of nieces, nephews,  cousins, friends, and extended family.   What a life and what a legacy.                         Paying Tribute to Lee Raybon    Mr. Speaker, I also pay tribute to Mr. Lee Raybon, a pioneer West  Side of Chicago business and community leader.   Whereas the Almighty God has called to his eternal rest Mr. Lee  Raybon, a skilled mechanic and business leader who became a legend on  the West Side of Chicago in the automobile repair business, and whereas  I met Mr. Raybon in the late 1960s when one of my staffers, Ms. Arlene  Granderson, introduced me to Mr. Nate Irwin, who was her mechanic and  working at Raybon's Automotive Repair shop, Mr. Irwin became my friend  and my mechanic.   I had a reputation in my community for keeping cars a long time. I  drove one car for 19 years, and everybody in the neighborhood knew the  car. Mr. Raybon and his mechanics kept my cars running for more than 50  years. Whatever it was that I drove, they had it running.   Ultimately, he and his colleagues developed a little group of  businesspeople: Garfield Major; Willie Barney; the Knox family at the  hardware store; Cliff Duwel White at the fish market; Walker Harris,  the iceman; Dave at the hotdog stand; and Reverend Murphy at the Rose  of Sharon Cleaners. They were the heart of the business support group  in that area.   After he no longer worked, Mr. Raybon would come to the shop, sit  around, and give people advice. He loved his community. He loved his  business. He loved what he did.  [[Page H7239]]    He will be greatly missed. I am sure I will never find another  mechanic who can keep my cars running for 50 years.                            ____________________     DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong  support of the Julius Rosenwald and the Rosenwald Schools Act, and I  thank leadership for putting it on the suspension calendar.   This bill starts the process to establish a Julius Rosenwald and  Rosenwald Schools national historical park to focus on the incredible  impact of Julius Rosenwald, a successful entrepreneur and renowned  philanthropist who made a lasting contribution to the advancement of  African-American education during the 20th century.   Mr. Rosenwald was the president of Sears, Roebuck and Company during  its heyday. He used his fortune to enhance the lives of others,  establishing museums, community centers, and housing, as well as  helping Jews in Europe and new immigrants coming to the United States.  One-third of all African-American children in the South during the  1920s, 1930s, and 1940s were educated in Rosenwald schools.   Although I did not attend a Rosenwald school, I grew up in rural  America, rural Arkansas, and actually attended a one-room school where  one teacher, Ms. Beadie King, taught eight grades plus what we call the  little primer and the big primer all by herself.   In many of the rural towns where African Americans lived during that  time, there were no schools. If there were, they only went to the sixth  grade and sometimes to the eighth grade. So the impact of these 5,300  schools that Julius Rosenwald helped to build--he was a friend of  Booker Washington, and Booker Washington helped him understand that it  was great for people to get to Tuskegee, but there were thousands of  African Americans in these rural areas who never had a first grade,  second grade, third grade to get to.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted that leadership put this bill on the  calendar today. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And as you can  tell, I am very passionate about this bill.   I also live in the area where the international headquarters for  Sears, Roebuck and Company existed at that time. So the name ``Julius  Rosenwald'' is an entity that our country should never, ever forget,  and we ought to have as many ways of expressing it as we possibly can.
