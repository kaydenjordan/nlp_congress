 Mr. Speaker, when the Endangered  Species Act was signed into law in 1973, its goal was simple: safeguard  endangered species and assist in the recovery of their population.   Until last week, no recent attempts have been made to reform this  essential piece of legislation. Over the past several years, the  Congressional Western Caucus has been working together to determine  what parts of the Endangered Species Act are broken and to develop  solutions to repair this law.   The Endangered Species Act is in dire need of modernization and  reform, which is why, last week, the Western Caucus, which I am proud  to belong to, rolled out some solutions; among them is to address the  broken litigation process that incentivizes litigation for profit at  the expense of the taxpayer, address the lack of clear listing and  delisting criteria, addressed the lack of transparency in Endangered  Species Act decisionmaking and data collection, consider the needs of  States more seriously, and address the unnecessary impediments to  economic development and land management that affect endangered  species.   Mr. Speaker, as far as statutes that require costly litigation, the  Endangered Species Act was the third most expensive for the Department  of Agriculture and the most expensive for the Department of the  Interior.   Endangered Species Act litigation cost the Department of Agriculture  and the Federal taxpayers $1.63 million from 2000 to 2010. It cost the  Department of the Interior $22 million from 2000 to 2010, all at the  expense of the taxpayer. These frivolous lawsuits have severe  consequences on local economies.   Additionally, the absence of State consultation weakens the overall  data that can be used to justify the Endangered Species Act listings  and recovery plans, a complete lack of transparency. State and local  expertise is needed to strengthen and streamline the Endangered Species  Act listing and delisting process.   I am happy to say that these issues are addressed in some of the  bills that were introduced last week. I proudly cosponsored a number of  the bills that will make progress on this front, including the LOCAL  Act, which was introduced by my colleague Scott Tipton. This bill would  set up new incentives and opportunities for voluntary conservation by  establishing a private party conservation grants program and a habitat  conservation planning loan program for State and local governments.  These programs will save the taxpayers money while boosting  conservation.   Mr. Speaker, we know that the majority of the recent species that  have been delisted happened not as a result of the Endangered Species  Act or the Fish and Wildlife Service, but through voluntary  conservation with the leadership of the Department of Agriculture.   The LAMP Act, introduced by my colleague Congressman  Don Young,  permits the Secretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative  management agreements with States, local governments, Tribes, and other  non-Federal persons in order to better manage species and improve  habitat conservation. The bill also empowers States with robust species  conservation programs already in place to take the lead in managing and  preserving such species when meeting certain qualifying conditions.   Mr. Speaker, these are just two examples of great pieces of  legislation that have been introduced in the House to upgrade,  modernize, and bring into the 21st century the Endangered Species Act.   The Endangered Species Act is in dire need of modernization, and I am  eager to work with my colleagues to address these needs and reform this  outdated law. I urge my colleagues to examine these commonsense bills,  look at the facts behind them, and cosponsor them today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, soon, the House will vote  to go to conference with the Senate on the 2018 farm bill. As vice  chair of the House Agriculture Committee, I urge my colleagues to vote  in favor of moving this important process forward.   As chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee, I am proud of the  provisions we have included to give many Americans the skills needed to  obtain a family-sustaining job and ultimate food security.   Food insecurity exists for so many in America today, and the  workforce and job training provisions in the bill represent a  significant opportunity to help millions of Americans find employment.   The Agriculture Committee has done its work. In fact, the Nutrition  Subcommittee hosted 21 hearings on SNAP  [[Page H6475]]  and heard from more than 80 witnesses on how we can improve the program  and work toward the ultimate goal of ending hunger in America.   Mr. Speaker, the House farm bill makes a historic investment in work  programs so SNAP recipients have a chance to learn new skills and climb  the rungs on the ladder of opportunity and escape poverty once and for  all.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                            ____________________
