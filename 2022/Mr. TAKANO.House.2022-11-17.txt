 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Transgender  Awareness Week.   Trans Americans made history this year by running and winning in more  elections than ever before. Breakthrough representations in media have  [[Page H8555]]  led to historic numbers of transgender and nonbinary characters on  screen. In many ways, transgender Americans are more visible than ever.   At the same time, the trans community has been forced to withstand  severe attacks from laws that would strip fundamental rights to  dehumanizing vitriol deployed by elected officials and public figures.  These attacks treat trans people as threats to society rather than  neighbors, parents, children, friends, and loved ones.   There are more than 2 million people in the United States that  identify as transgender or nonbinary. Trans Americans exist in all  walks of life all across the country. This transgender week, I call on  my colleagues to turn awareness into action.   To the trans community, you have allies in Congress. Let it be known  that there has been no greater friend of trans people in this country  or LGBTQ people than Speaker Nancy Pelosi.   We will not cease the fight to protect and advocate for our  transgender siblings, not just this week but all year long.                            ____________________
