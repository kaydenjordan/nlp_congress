 Mr. Speaker, I want to give a quick shout- out and recognition to our guest chaplain today, Deacon Dan Borne.   Not to take anything away from the Almighty Father, but I think  Deacon Borne's voice is often confused with the Almighty in Tiger  Stadium in ``Death Valley'', as over and over again fans hear, ``First  Down, Tigers,'' ``Chance of Rain? Never,'' and ``Touchdown, Tigers,''  to the frustration of our guest teams.   Borne has been a longtime friend, along with his wife, a Catholic  schoolteacher. His son, Jason, was one of my best friends in high  school. David and Elizabeth are the other kids in the family. Deacon  Borne has been leading them in a life of faith and is now leading our  entire community as deacon in the East Baton Rouge Catholic Church.   I appreciate him being here. I welcome him and certainly welcome his  prayer, as we need much more of that here today.                            ____________________
