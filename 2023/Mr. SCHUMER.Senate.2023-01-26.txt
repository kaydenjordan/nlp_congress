 Mr. President, I just wanted to add another word for  Pastor Bernard before he leaves.   He is such an extraordinary leader to so many, not just the thousands  who are--tens of thousands who are members of his church, Christian  Cultural Center, but for the Nation.   And he has been a great spiritual guidance for me during times of  difficulty. We have shared our joys and our sorrows together--but for  the whole country.   He has done an amazing thing, as CCC, Christian Cultural Center, has  been a beacon for so many different congregations throughout the  country, as a way to lead, as a way to combine the temporal and the  secular.   He has done an amazing, amazing job. So I just wanted to, again,  thank him for being here but, more importantly, thank him for all he is  doing.   Pastor Bernard is a blessing--a blessing to CCC, a blessing to our  borough of Brooklyn, to our city, our State, our Nation, and our world.   May God give him strength to continue in his ministry.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, first, before I get to my remarks and  housekeeping, I understand there are three bills at the desk due for a  second reading, en bloc.    Mr. President, in order to place the bills on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceedings, en bloc.    Mr. President, if the 118th Congress is going to do its  job and raise the debt ceiling later this year, there is one very big,  very important question that all of us need to answer: Republicans,  where is your plan? It is the first question that must be asked, so let  me ask it again. Republicans, where is your plan?   For weeks, we have heard lots of howling at the Moon from House  Republicans on the MAGA fringe about sabotaging the credit of the  United States but little in the way of actual solutions. Republicans in  the House, especially the MAGA ones, seem disturbingly at ease with  taking our economy hostage in exchange for gutting vital programs, but  when asked to explain to the American people what kind of cuts they  want, suddenly these Republicans seem stumped.   This is reckless. Few issues require more bipartisanship, more  cooperation, and more serious-mindedness than protecting the full faith  and credit of the United States. We have never failed to pay our debts  on time, and the debt ceiling has consistently been a bipartisan  endeavor. The radical MAGA crowd running the show in the House seems  unable to grasp this truth.   So let me try it again. House Republicans, where is your plan? You  want to gut Federal spending, so show us what that means. Show us what  it means to the average American family in specific detail. It is your  responsibility on such a weighty issue to do just that.   Speaker McCarthy. Speaker McCarthy has an obligation--an obligation-- to explain to the American people what Republicans actually plan to do  about raising the debt ceiling. Until we get a clear answer from House  Republicans about what their plan is, there is no point in speculating  about anything else, because if Republicans really want to starve the  American people of vital services, the American people have a right to  know what that will mean for their daily lives. Otherwise, the American  people will be left with only questions and no answers.   Republicans say they want cuts. Do Republicans want to cut Social  Security and Medicare? Do Republicans want to cut military funding? Do  they want to cut aid to veterans? Do they want to cut funding to police  and firefighters and first responders? Do they want to cut education,  public health, science and research?   Saber-rattling about the debt and grandiose statements without any  specifics are not going to cut it. They have been doing that for a  while. It doesn't work. Lay out the plan. Show us your plan.  Republicans need to show us the math. They need to level with the  American people. They need to show us their plan.   Now, here in the Senate, some Members from the MAGA faction-- particularly Senator Rick Scott--have taken it upon themselves to fill  the void that House Republicans have created. The bad news is, the plan  they came up with is about as unhinged as they come.   Yesterday, the junior Senator from Florida--the very same Senator who  thought that tax hikes on middle-class families was a winning formula  for Republicans last November--released a proposal that would put the  interests of the Chinese Communist Party before the needs of American  families. Senator Scott calls it the Full Faith and Credit Act, but it  is legislation that does not even deserve partial credit.   Bondholders in Beijing would get their money, while Floridians,  Alabamians, Wisconsinites, and so many other American citizens would be  left out to dry. Does he want to pay China before he pays  schoolteachers? Does he want to pay the Chinese Communist Party before  he pays our police officers? There is no end to the negative impacts of  this piece of legislation, and it is no substitute for real action to  avoid default. Worse yet, reports suggest that Speaker McCarthy has  promised MAGA radicals in the House that he will hold a vote on a  similar proposal to this one.   Seriously, Mr. President, just when we thought we had seen the limits  of MAGA extremism, Senator Scott has swooped in and reminded us that  when it comes to MAGA insanity, there is no bottom. And who--who--is  going to pay the price? The American people.   Now on the national sales tax--I mean, you can't make this stuff up,  but it goes on and on and on, these really ludicrous, way out of line,  way over to the extreme Republican plans. They keep coming at us.  Another one they put out is a national sales tax.   While Republicans refuse to show what they plan to do about the debt  ceiling, they spend a lot of time talking up one of the worst policy  proposals in existence--a 30-percent national sales tax on all consumer  goods. The House Republicans just can't seem to get out of their own  way. House Republicans call it the Fair Tax Act, but let's call it what  it really is--a disaster for middle-class families.   There is nothing fair about a tax that punishes average families for  buying essential goods while giving the rich another chance to lower  their tax burdens. That is what is behind most of these Republican  plans--a desire to help the very wealthy. And if it comes out on the  middle class and most Americans, they don't give a hoot. They don't  give a hoot.   The Fair Tax Act is truly foul stuff. The Republican tax plan would  raise the cost of buying a house by $125,000. It would raise the cost  of buying a car by $10,000. It would raise your average  [[Page S107]]  grocery bill by $3,500 a year at a time when people are already worried  about the high price of groceries. How can they do this? Things like  eggs are already too expensive, but Republicans want to slap another  $1.50 on that price. The plan would make a gallon of milk cost another  $1.70 more.   The shock waves go way beyond trips to the grocery store, as painful  as those have been. The Republican tax would erode the value of  retirement plans, Social Security, pensions and 401(k)s by nearly one- third, an insulting way--insulting--to treat people who have spent  their entire lives saving up in order to retire with some degree of  dignity.   In all my years in office--in all my years in office--I have rarely  seen such an extreme proposal be taken seriously by a governing  majority. It is another reminder of how radical, how out of touch, how  unserious MAGA Republicans are about governing. All they want to do is  help their very ultrarich friends. And the fact that the House  leadership is catering to the delusional whims of MAGA extremism should  send a shiver down every one of our spines.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now finally on guns, it is another tragic  week of mass shootings, but gun manufacturers continue to stoop to  disgusting and morally bankrupt new lows. I am talking about a weapon  currently for sale that is actually being marketed by one gunmaker to  children. It has a disgusting, horrifying name: the JR-15. The JR-15.  You heard me right. That is what they call it. The JR-15 is a spinoff,  a child-sized version of an AR-15, which, according to the company  marketing it, ``functions like a modern sporting rifle'' but is  ``geared to smaller enthusiasts.'' Smaller enthusiasts? That is a code  for ``young children.''   Look at what just happened a few weeks ago in Virginia, where a 6- year-old student shot his teacher at school. We are talking about a kid  in the first grade who looked at his teacher and pulled the trigger.  When weapons are marketed to children, it makes horrors like what  happened in Virginia more likely. Even if the weapons are marketed to  adults to give to their children, it creates these terrible, terrible,  terrible situations.   So later today, I and a group of my colleagues will ask the FTC to  investigate the company that makes and advertises the JR-15. I want to  be clear that this probe is not intended to be a cure-all for gun  violence. We have a lot more to do in that regard. But we must shed  more light on the prevalence of guns in our society, and regulators  must take stronger steps to keep guns out of the hands of children. I  hope it will pave the way for future action in Congress.   I can't believe I have to say this: The last thing we need to be  doing is reducing in size deadly weapons of war and marketing them to  young children. Every parent in America, every citizen in America  should be outraged and demand the FTC to take action.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
