 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, before I get into my speech this evening, I just want to  take a moment.   I just heard a colleague on the other side of the aisle call me,  essentially, a master of deceit. This country is sick and tired of this  type of divisive rhetoric. I am here to tell you that it is time to put  the American people first.   I understand that we sit sometimes in this Chamber in the biggest  political theater in the United States of America, but at some point in  time I have got to say enough is enough.   To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I would ask us and  the American people back home to look at the legislation that we have  done in the committee.   The bottom line, in the House bill, hardworking taxpayers in my  district are going to see $1,600 of their hard-earned dollars remain in  their pocket with the government not taking that money away from them.   There are differences between the House bill and the Senate bill. I  think there are legitimate parts to the Senate bill we should consider  in this conference committee that we are going to entertain here very  shortly. They are things like the medical expense deduction, things  like, potentially, the historic tax credit. But that is how legislation  is drafted. We have a body in the Senate, we have a body in the House,  and we come together to put the best product forward for the American  people.   I will tell you, as I have heard from my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle, if reducing taxes is not a part of economic growth, then  you disagree with every Governor in the United States of America,  because every Governor's economic development plan across this country,  what does it do?   You see the commercials as you travel around this country: Come to  New York State; we are open for business because we have lowered our  taxes for opportunities and growth. I see it in Illinois. I see it in  California. I see it in Texas.   So what we have done with the proposal in the House is exactly that.  We have focused relief on hardworking taxpayers, and we have lowered  the tax burden overall so that people can invest in their businesses,  invest in their families, and grow the economy, which, at the end of  the day, do you know what that means for an American person?   It means more money for them, but, most importantly, it means a job-- a job not only to make money, but it is good for the soul. It is good  for the heart. It brings you pride in knowing that you did an honest  day's work to get an honest day's amount of pay. That is what growth is  about. It is not about numbers. It is about people and opportunity.   I ask my colleagues, join us in rejecting this motion to instruct,  and let's get to the business of the people and finish the job once and  for all.                                time  1930
