 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize  Drew Kennedy for his congressional staff service to the Second District  of South Carolina.   Drew has been a valued team member for over 10 years, and both his  contributions and presence will be missed. Upon graduating from the  University of South Carolina, Drew served constituents at the Midlands'  office and then moved to Washington. Drew quickly became an expert in  many policy areas, advising on committee issues, preparing legislation,  working on markups, and more. His competence earned him the position of  deputy chief of staff.   Drew has become a respected leader among his peers and industry  leaders. Our loss is the gain of the House Armed Services Committee.  Multiple generations of Drew's family are appreciated, with  grandparents Jane and Richard Kennedy being founders of the modern  Republican majority in South Carolina, with his civic leader parents,  Judge Cathy Kennedy and Dr. Attorney Rick Kennedy.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________
