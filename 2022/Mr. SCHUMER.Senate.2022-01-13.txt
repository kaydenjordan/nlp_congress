 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, before I begin my remarks, I see my  dear friend, the President, sitting there--the Senator from Nevada--and  I am just thinking, last night, as we watched Harry Reid leave the  Senate for the final time: Harry, we miss you, but we know you are  still here to guide us. Thank you.                            ____________________     Madam President, on defending democracy--something  Leader Reid would have been passionate about, if he were still with us  here, and he is telling us that now--over the next few days, the U.S.  Senate will face a critical and unavoidable question: Are its Members  going to act to protect our democracy and protect voting rights or will  its Members choose the path of obstruction, inaction, and side with the  Big Lie overtaking our precious experiment in self-rule?   We had two professors come to us 2 days ago, the authors of ``How  Democracies Die,'' and one of the main ways that democracies die is  when one political party refuses to accept the results of an election  that was run freely and fairly. That is what is happening here. They  showed how important this is and how there is unfortunate historical  precedent in doing what we did.   And earlier this week, President Biden made that clear. He made clear  to the Nation--and to all of us who serve in the Senate--that the time  to answer the question about whether allowing the Big Lie, so ruinous  to a democracy, to overtake our precious experiment in self-rule will  prevail.   As the Senate has done many times in its history, it must soon act  again to safeguard democracy from the dangers of the present day: the  power of dark money, voter suppression, and efforts to subvert the  democratic process from the bottom up.   I commend President Biden for offering a strong speech, and I look  forward to having him join Senate Democrats later today at our caucus  meeting to discuss the path forward.   Yesterday, I shared with my Democratic colleagues our plan for what  the next few days are going to look like in this Chamber and how I, as  majority leader, will move to finally begin, at last, a floor debate on  the voting rights legislation.   Later today, the House of Representatives will pass a message that  will include the language of the two bills Republicans have  filibustered for months--the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis  Voting Rights Advancement Act.   As permitted under the existing rules, we will have the ability to  proceed to the legislation and debate it on a simple majority basis-- something that has been denied to us four times in the last several  months because Republicans didn't want to move forward. Then the Senate  will finally hold a debate on the voting rights legislation for the  first time in this Congress, and every Senator will be faced with a  choice of whether or not to pass this legislation to protect our  democracy.   There has been a lot of gas-lighting here on the floor lately from  the other side about power grabs, about takeovers, but precious little  in terms of substance. I have not heard them mention what Republican  legislatures are  [[Page S196]]  doing. That is not the thrust of their speech. They say: Oh, it is a  power grab. Oh, it is a takeover.   Well, my friends, if there was ever a power grab, it is what is  happening in the State legislatures right now, where Republican  legislators are taking away people's sacred right to vote and aiming it  particularly at certain groups--people of color, young people, people  in urban areas, older people, disabled people.   So let me remind my colleagues what these bills actually do. The  Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act  are balanced, effective, and commonsense bills that build on the work  that this Chamber has done in the past to protect democracy, and it was  often done with bipartisan votes. The transformation of the Republican  Party in the era of Donald Trump is apparent and nasty, and, most  importantly, really dangerous to our democracy.   These laws set basic standards for all American citizens to vote  safely and vote securely, while protecting elections from attempts at  subversion. What is wrong with that? How is that a power grab, to  allow people to vote? It is the people who should have the power, not  politicians and State legislative bodies to take it away.    The bill also fights against the power of Big Money that has cascaded  into our system, and so much of it is now being used to try and  intimidate legislators, Senators, and Congressmen from preserving this  right to vote.   And the bill ends partisan gerrymandering. We have all seen  situations--the legislature of Wisconsin, the State Assembly, where 53  percent of the people voted for Democratic legislators in 2020, but  only about a third of the seats are Democratic due the severe nature of  this gerrymandering.   And, so importantly, these bills restore the critical preclearance  provisions that were once part of the Voting Rights Act that many of my  Republican colleagues supported in the past, which a conservative  majority on the Supreme Court shamefully gutted roughly a decade ago.   Democrats have tried for months--months--to convince our Republican  colleagues to join us on a bipartisan basis to begin debate on these  bills, to no avail. We presented these reasonable, commonsense  proposals, as I said, many of which had been voted on by Republicans in  the past. We presented them on the floor in June, August, October, and  November. Each time I promised my Republican colleagues they would have  the opportunity to voice their concerns and offer germane amendments. I  wouldn't limit the germane amendments that they wished to offer.   We have lobbied Republicans privately and tried to engage them in  both the Senate Rules Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Every step of the way--every step of the way--we have been met with  near total resistance. To date, none of our efforts have produced any  meaningful engagement from the other side of the aisle.   But Members of this Chamber were elected to debate and to vote,  particularly on an issue as vital to the beating heart of our democracy  as this.   I have said for months that just because Republicans have refused to  work with us to protect voting rights does not mean Democrats would  stop working to move forward on our own. The matter is simply too  important. It is the wellspring of our democracy, the right by which  all other rights are secured--voting.   I am reading the biography of Grant, by Chernow. The No. 1 thing the  southern segregationists, who happened to be Democrats at the time,  wanted to take away from the newly freed slaves was the right to vote.  They knew that, if Black people didn't have the right to vote in the  South, they would have no power--no power over our laws, no power of  where resources go, no power to decide the directions of the country.  And that was the No. 1 thing they wanted to prevent.   So it is so vital to keep people's right to vote, particularly when  some of the laws--too many--are aimed at the people of color, reminding  us that racism is the poison of America still.   So we will move forward. The path I have laid out sets up a process  by which Senators can finally make clear to the American people where  they stand on protecting our democracy. Republicans will have a chance  to show where they stand on preserving the right of every eligible  citizen to cast a ballot.   Republicans will have a chance to make clear where they stand on  fighting efforts to empower partisan actors to subvert the election  process and create more Big Lies in the future. Republicans will have a  chance to make clear where they stand on fighting the power of dark  money, which so many Americans oppose--Democrats and Republicans. And  Republicans will have a chance to show where they stand on ending  partisan gerrymandering.   Of course, to ultimately end debate and pass anything, we will also  need 10 Republicans to join us, ultimately, on cloture. If they don't,  we will be left with no choice but to consider changes to Senate rules  so we can move forward. And changing Senate rules has been done many  times before in this Chamber. This is not the first, second, or third  time that this is happening.   All of us must make a choice about whether or not we will do our part  to preserve our democratic Republic this day and age. We cannot be  satisfied in thinking that democracy will win out in the end if we are  not willing to put in the work, strength, and courage to defend it.   Last night, I read the op-ed published by President Obama that  eloquently laid out what really is at stake here. I encourage my  colleagues to read it if they haven't already. He reminded us that  democracy is not a given. It is not self-executing. But it can indeed  survive and thrive if we are prepared to follow in the footsteps of the  great Americans who did their part to defend democracy before us, many  of them giving their lives. We are now being called upon to do our  part.   Madam President, I now ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record the Obama op-ed, which I will bring to the desk shortly.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              [Jan. 12, 2022]    Former President Obama In USA Today: We Need To Follow John Lewis'                    Example and Fight for Our Democracy                     [By Former President Barack Obama]         ``The world, and future generations, will be watching,''       Obama writes as he calls on Senate to ``do the right thing''       and pass legislation to protect voting rights.        When I spoke at John Lewis' memorial service two years ago,       I emphasized a truth John knew better than just about anyone.       Our democracy isn't a given. It isn't self-executing. We, as       citizens, have to nurture and tend it. We have to work at it.       And in that task, we have to vigilantly preserve and protect       our most basic tool of self-government, which is the right to       vote.        At the time, various state legislators across the country       had already passed a variety of laws designed to make voting       harder. It was an attack on everything John Lewis fought for,       and a challenge to our most fundamental democratic freedoms.        Since then, things have only gotten worse.                slow unraveling of basic democratic principles         While the American people turned out to vote at the highest       rate in a century in the last presidential election, members       of one of our two major political parties--spurred on by the       then-sitting president--denied the results of that election       and spun conspiracy theories that drove a violent mob to       attack our Capitol.                   protesters attack the capitol on jan. 6         Although initially rejected by many Republicans, those       claims continued to be amplified by conservative media       outlets, and have since been embraced by a sizable portion of       Republican voters--not to mention GOP elected officials who       do, or at least should, know better. Those Republican       officials and conservative thought leaders who have       courageously stood their ground and rejected such anti-      democratic efforts have found themselves ostracized,       threatened and subjected to primary challenges.        Meanwhile, state legislators in 49 states have introduced       more than 400 bills designed to suppress votes. Some of these       bills we've seen before: legislation that would discourage       voters, including racial minorities, low-income voters and       young people from casting a ballot. Others aim to treat       certain polling locations differently, creating one set of       rules for voters living in cities and another set for people       living in more conservative, rural areas.        We're also seeing more aggressive attempts to gerrymander       congressional districts. Gerrymandering, which essentially       allows politicians to choose their voters instead of the       other way around, isn't new--and both parties have engaged in       it.        But what we're seeing now are far more aggressive and       precise efforts on the part of Republican state legislatures       to tilt the playing  [[Page S197]]       field in their favor. In states that have approved new       congressional maps, there are now 15 fewer competitive       districts than there were before. Fewer competitive districts       increases partisanship, since candidates who only have to       appeal to primary voters have no incentive to compromise or       move to the center.        Finally and perhaps most perniciously, we've seen state       legislatures try to assert power over core election processes       including the ability to certify election results. These       partisan attempts at voter nullification are unlike anything       we've seen in modern times, and they represent a profound       threat to the basic democratic principle that all votes       should be counted fairly and objectively.        The good news is that the majority of American voters are       resistant to this slow unraveling of basic democratic       institutions and electoral mechanisms. But their elected       representatives have a sacred obligation to push back as       well--and now is the time to do it.        Now, there are bills in front of the Senate that would       protect the right to vote, end partisan gerrymandering, and       restore crucial parts of the Voting Rights Act. Bill sponsors       have diligently reached out to their Republican colleagues to       obtain their support. Sadly, almost every Senate Republican       who expressed concern about threats to our democracy in the       immediate aftermath of the Jan. 6 insurrection has since been       cowed into silence or reversed their positions. When one of       the bills in front of the Senate today was introduced in       November, every Democrat supported it. And every Republican       but one voted against moving it forward.        Protecting our democracy wasn't always a partisan issue.       The Voting Rights Act was the result of Democratic and       Republican efforts, and both President Reagan and President       George W. Bush signed its renewal when they were in office.       But even if Senate Republicans now refuse to stand up for our       democracy, Democrats should be able to get the job done with       a simple majority vote. There are already 50 Senators who       support bills to safeguard elections. The only thing standing       in the way is the filibuster--a Senate procedure that allows       a minority of just 41 Senators to prevent legislation from       being brought up for a vote.        The filibuster has no basis in the Constitution.       Historically, the parliamentary tactic was used sparingly--      most notably by Southern senators to block civil rights       legislation and prop up Jim Crow. In recent years, the       filibuster became a routine way for the Senate minority to       block important progress on issues supported by the majority       of voters. But we can't allow it to be used to block efforts       to protect our democracy. That's why I fully support       President Joe Biden's call to modify Senate rules as       necessary to make sure pending voting rights legislation gets       called for a vote. And every American who cares about the       survival of our most cherished institutions should support       the president's call as well.                    protecting our democratic institutions         For generations, Americans of every political stripe have       taken pride in our status as the world's oldest continuous       democracy. We have spilled precious blood and spent countless       treasure in defense of democracy and freedom abroad. But as       we learned during the Jim Crow era, our role as democracy's       defender isn't credible when we violate the rights and       freedoms of our own citizens. And at a time when democracy is       under attack on every continent, we can't hope to set an       example for the world when one of our two major parties seems       intent on chipping away at the foundation of our own       democracy.        No single piece of legislation can guarantee that we'll       make progress on every challenge we face as a nation. But       legislation that ensures the right to vote and makes sure       every vote is properly counted will give us a better chance       of meeting those challenges. It's how we can overcome the       gridlock and cynicism that's so prevalent right now. It's how       we can stop climate change, and reform our broken immigration       system, and help ensure that our children enjoy an economy       that works for everyone and not just the few.        Now is the time for all of us to follow John Lewis'       example. Now is the time for the U.S. Senate to do the right       thing. America's long-standing grand experiment in democracy       is being sorely tested. Future generations are counting on us       to meet that test.     Finally, as we continue this important conversation  about the future of our democracy, I ask my Democratic colleagues to  consider the following: If the right to vote is the cornerstone of our  democracy, then how can we in good conscience allow for a situation in  which the Republican Party can debate and pass voter suppression laws  at the State level with only a simple majority vote but not allow the  United States to do the same?   Let me repeat that.   If the right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy, then how  can we in good conscience allow for a situation in which the Republican  Party can debate and pass voter suppression laws at the State level  with only a simple majority vote but not allow the U.S. Senate to do  the same?   In the coming days, we will confront this sobering question.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have a short announcement about the  schedule.   Due to the circumstances regarding COVID and another potentially  hazardous winter storm approaching the DC area this weekend, the Senate  will adjourn tonight. However, we will be postponing recess so the  Senate can vote on voting rights. We will return on Tuesday to take up  the House-passed message containing voting rights legislation.   Make no mistake, the U.S. Senate will, for the first time this  Congress, debate voting rights legislation beginning on Tuesday.  Members of this Chamber were elected to debate and to vote,  particularly on an issue as vital to the beating heart of our democracy  as this one, and we will proceed.   If the Senate Republicans choose obstruction over protecting the  sacred right to vote, as we expect them to, the Senate will consider  and vote on changing the Senate rules, as has been done many times  before, to allow for the passage of voting rights legislation.   I will close with this: If the right to vote is the cornerstone of  our democracy, then how can we, in good conscience, allow for a  situation in which the Republican Party can debate and  [[Page S218]]  pass voter suppression laws at the State level with only a simple  majority vote but not allow the U.S. Senate to do the same?   In the coming days, we will confront this sobering question, and  every Member will go on record.   Finally, Members should expect that the next State work period would  begin on the week of January 24.                                Nord Stream 2    Mr. President, now on Nord Stream, a few minutes ago the Senate voted  against passing legislation proposed by Senator Cruz to address Nord  Stream 2.   Probably every single one of us in this Chamber agrees that the  United States must be strong in confronting Putin and his destabilizing  tactics in Eastern Europe and in Ukraine. But as my colleagues made  clear this morning, Senator Cruz's bill, in our opinion, is the wrong  answer at this time to deter President Putin's aggression. I commend my  colleagues who came to the floor to make the case against today's  misguided proposal: my friends Chairman Menendez, Senator Shaheen, who  cochairs the Senate's NATO Observer Group, and Senator Murphy.   After today's vote, this issue is not behind us. The work is not  done. President Putin remains a threat, and we must address this  matter.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work with Chairman  Menendez and Chairman Brown to support Chairman Menendez's  comprehensive sanctions, security, and humanitarian aid package.   I believe the Menendez bill is the answer and an important step in  the right direction. But, of course, I am willing to consider  reasonable additions and modifications.   From interfering in elections to conducting a plethora of cyber  attacks that target us here in the homeland, to what is happening today  on the border of Ukraine, President Putin has left no doubt of his  desire to stir up instability. His action with respect to Ukraine calls  for a robust and severe deterrent action.   I hope my Republican colleagues will come forward and work with the  chair so we can truly confront Putin's dangerous aggression.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 6 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
