 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the select committee  on China.   In February of last year, President Xi of China and President Putin  of Russia issued a joint statement redefining democracy proclaiming:  ``A trend has emerged towards redistribution of power in the world.''   We must take this statement seriously.   Also, in February of last year, the White House released its annual  report on domestic supply chains, highlighting the heavy reliance of  many U.S. industries on China.   For example, China provides more than 70 percent of certain  pesticides, and three Chinese companies account for 96 percent of the  world's dry cargo. The recent COVID pandemic underlined our  dependencies on vital medications, like 90 percent of U.S. antibiotic  imports are from China.   Such heavy dependencies on any country would be a major risk but  being dependent on a communist country with expansionist policies is a  significant national security risk.   We must address it.
