 Madam President, last night, the Senate took a vote on  whether to proceed to a debate on infrastructure. Unfortunately, our  Republican colleagues blocked the Senate from taking this first  entirely procedural step.   I understand that the effort to finish the text of the bipartisan  bill has progressed since I announced this vote last week. The  negotiators have made significant progress, but there are still some  outstanding issues. Therefore, at the end of the vote yesterday, I  changed my response to a no so that I may move to reconsider the vote  at a future time.   My colleagues on both sides of the aisle should be assured, as  majority leader, I have every intention of passing both major  infrastructure packages, the bipartisan infrastructure framework and a  budget resolution with reconciliation instructions, before we leave for  the August recess. I laid out that precise schedule at the end of June,  and I intend to stick with it.   A new report by the chief economist at Moody's, Mark Zandi, hardly a  liberal economist, someone who actually served as an economic adviser  to Senator McCain, concluded that both major infrastructure proposals  are essential to maximize our economic potential--not just one, both.  And, together, they would give a massive boost to the economy, ease  inflation pressures, create jobs, increase productivity, and reduce  income inequality.   These are incredibly worthy goals, and the Senate is going to keep  working on both tracks of infrastructure in order to achieve them.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on another matter, today in the  Energy and Natural Resources Committee, President Biden's nominee to  lead the Bureau of Land Management, Tracy Stone-Manning, will receive a  vote to advance her nomination to the Senate floor.   While it sometimes flies under the radar, the Bureau of Land  Management is responsible for overseeing nearly 250 million acres of  public lands and 700 million acres of mineral rights, a vast track of  the United States of America. No Agency is more important to the  maintenance of public lands for public use. BLM, the Bureau of Land  Management, that is, will play a huge role in the fight against climate  change as well.   Over the past 4 years under Donald Trump, the Agency abandoned its  mission, shrunk public lands, targeted our national monuments, and  opened up those beautiful landscapes for corporate industrial  development. In short, the next leader of the Bureau of Land Management  has a tall order in restoring and protecting America's public lands.   Ms. Stone-Manning is exceedingly qualified to take on this important  job.  [[Page S5028]]  After serving on Senator Tester's and Governor Bullock's staff, she  went on to lead the environmental agency in Montana, where she was  respected not only by conservationists but by ranchers and fossil fuel  interests as well. She developed a reputation as an honest broker,  someone who is firm in their principles but always willing to try and  build consensus.   Yet the members of the Republican minority on the committee are  trying to turn this consensus-driven, well-respected nominee into  another partisan flashpoint, dredging up a letter she forwarded while  in graduate school and claiming it was evidence that she is ``an echo- terrorist.'' The claim is just as hysterical as it sounds.   Ms. Stone-Manning has the full support of the chair of the committee,  the Senator from West Virginia; Mr. Tester, the Senator from Montana;  and from me.   We need someone like Ms. Stone-Manning to manage our public lands, a  staunch advocate for conservation but also an honest broker, someone  who will repair the damage of the last 4 years and be a faithful  steward of America's national treasures, someone who understands that  conservation policy has a critical role to play in the fight against  climate change. Ms. Stone-Manning has all of those qualities, and I  look forward to moving her nomination to the Senate floor.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 122.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum call for the cloture motion filed today, July 22, be waived.    I move to proceed to legislative session.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished  Republican leader, Mr. McConnell, I send to the desk a resolution  authorizing representation by the Senate Legal Counsel and ask for its  immediate consideration.   Mr. President, this resolution concerns third-party subpoenas to a  Senate employee from Alfa Bank, the plaintiff in a lawsuit pending in  Florida State court. The plaintiff, a large Russian bank, alleges in  its lawsuit that unnamed defendants used cyber tools to create internet  log data appearing to show communications between computer servers of  the plaintiff and the Trump Organization, causing negative publicity.  Alfa Bank is conducting third-party discovery to identify the unnamed  persons it alleges conspired against it. As part of that attempted  discovery, it has issued two subpoenas to a staff member of the  Committee on Armed Services seeking testimony and Committee documents  regarding his work for the Committee in examining the publicly-reported  allegations about possible clandestine internet communications between  plaintiff and the Trump Organization.   Because the subpoenas seek testimony and documents relating to  information gathering activities the staff person undertook as part of  his duties for the Committee, they request information that is  absolutely privileged under the Speech or Debate Clause. In addition,  sovereign immunity precludes enforcement of State court subpoenas  against officials and employees of the Federal government. This  resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the  Committee on Armed Services and its staff member and move to quash the  subpoenas, at the request of the Committee.   In addition, to demonstrate to the court the applicability of the  Speech or Debate Clause privilege in this matter, the resolution  authorizes the Majority Staff Director of the Committee to provide a  limited declaration in support of the motion to quash. By submitting  this limited declaration solely to establish its privilege, the  Committee is not waiving, and, indeed, continues to assert, its  absolute Speech or Debate Clause privilege against being compelled to  produce any information in this matter.                            ____________________
