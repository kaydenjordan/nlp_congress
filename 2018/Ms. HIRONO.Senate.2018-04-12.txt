 Mr. President, last year, Democrats kept the Senate in  session all night to protest the nomination of Scott Pruitt to lead the  Environmental Protection Agency.   We took this unusual step to protest Mr. Pruitt's hostility to the  EPA's core mission and to highlight how his close ties to the fossil  fuel industry could lead to serious conflicts of interest and breaches  of the public trust.   Over the past year, Mr. Pruitt has exemplified the toxic mixture of  corruption and hostility to government we have come to expect from the  Trump administration.   Mr. Pruitt has radically changed the EPA's mission during his time in  office.   He has abandoned the Agency's traditional mission to protect human  health and the environment--a commitment that spanned administrations  of both parties--in favor of serving the narrow interests of his  friends in the fossil fuel industry.   During his tenure, Mr. Pruitt has begun work to repeal the Clean  Power Plan, roll back vehicle fuel economy standards, and eliminate  commonsense protections for our air and water.   These actions are only three examples of the damage he is doing to  our country and environment as the Administrator of the EPA.   Through his actions, Mr. Pruitt confirms he does not understand why  Congress and President Nixon established the EPA in the first place.   Mr. Pruitt's policy agenda is damaging enough, but we can scarcely go  a week without learning about a new scandal or breach of the public  trust at the EPA.   Mr. Pruitt is already being investigated for his first-class travel,  spending tens of thousands of dollars on a soundproof phone booth, and  providing massive pay increases to his political appointees.   Earlier this month, we learned that Mr. Pruitt got a sweetheart deal  from an energy lobbyist to rent an apartment on Capitol Hill at way  below market rate.   Scott Pruitt should be fired for cause, but I also find myself  agreeing with former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for once. Scott  Pruitt never should have been appointed EPA Administrator in the first  place.    Earlier today, the Senate voted to confirm Andrew Wheeler to be the  Deputy EPA Administrator. I strongly opposed and voted against his  nomination.   At a time when the current EPA Administrator is under siege for his  lack of ethics, we don't need a Deputy Administrator who will  prioritize the interests of the fossil fuel industry over the public's.   Prior to his confirmation, Mr. Wheeler worked as a fossil fuel  lobbyist at a major DC law firm.   His lobbying clients included Murray Energy, the largest privately  owned coal firm in the United States.   Bob Murray, the head of the company, is one of President Trump's  biggest supporters in the industry.   We certainly don't need another fossil fuel ally undermining the  EPA's mission to protect public health in a senior leadership position  at the Agency.   During his confirmation hearing last November, Mr. Wheeler continued  to question the overwhelming scientific consensus about climate change.  He was voted out of committee on a narrow, party-line vote.   There is a serious ethical cloud hanging over the EPA, and I am  disappointed that the majority leader forced a vote on Mr. Wheeler's  nomination before we had a chance to question the nominee about the  ongoing turmoil at the Agency.   Although we weren't successful in blocking Andrew Wheeler's  nomination today, I will continue to hold the EPA accountable for the  damage it is doing to our environment and our country.                            ____________________
