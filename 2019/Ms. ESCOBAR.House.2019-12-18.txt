 Mr. Speaker, our country faces a great tragedy and  moment of truth. We have witnessed the President of the United States  abuse his public office for personal political gain and invite foreign  governments to interfere in our elections, putting the integrity of a  government of, for, and by the people at great risk.   The evidence is overwhelming and clearly shows that President Trump  will continue to abuse his office and obstruct Congress if left  unchecked.   The Intelligence Committee conducted a robust investigation into the  President's misconduct. Members interviewed 12 witnesses in public  hearings, totaling over 30 hours; conducted 17 depositions, totaling  over 100 hours; examined text messages and emails; reviewed the  President's own words and actions; and published a 300-page report  detailing their findings.   All of this, despite the fact that, under the President's direction,  12 current and former administration officials refused to testify, even  ignoring subpoenas, and 71 document requests were denied.   The Judiciary Committee then reviewed the evidence and concluded that  two Articles of Impeachment, which I support, were warranted.   The evidence shows that President Trump is a clear and present danger  to our free and fair elections and our national security. The most  powerful evidence of this pattern has come from the President himself.   In 2016, we heard him when he called on Russia to interfere in our  elections. He said: ``Russia, if you're listening. . . .''   He then repeated this call for election interference on the July 25  call with the Ukrainian President, and we heard him again, on the White  House lawn, further adding China to that mix.   I stand ready to protect our sacred Republic, support these Articles  of Impeachment, and pray that my colleagues have the courage to do the  same. We must uphold our oath of office and defend the Constitution and  our fragile democracy, because no one is above the law.
