 Mr. President, today I have the distinct privilege and  honor to recognize Kobye Noel for over two decades of faithful and  unwavering service to the U.S. Senate.   Kobye, a native of the Old Line State, has held the line during 23  years of service to the Senate, always striving for equity,  transparency, and diligence in all she does. From her time on the  Democratic Policy Committee supporting the work of Leader Harry Reid  that would lead to our country's most recent budget surplus, to her  work as a staffer on the Senate Budget Committee supporting the  committee's work to pass the Affordable Health Care Act, ushering in a  new era of healthcare in our country, Kobye has never wavered in her  commitment to this body or to helping the American people.   When not working on committee, Kobye has served a host of Senators  including Senator Doug Jones of Alabama, Senator Heidi Heitkamp of  North Dakota, and Senator Ossoff of Georgia. I am especially grateful  Kobye and her wealth of experience has been able to serve on my staff  as mail manager for the past 10 months. In her time overseeing our  office's correspondence, we have sent over 200,000 correspondence  messages to Georgians, updating them on the issues and legislation  critically important to their lives.   It is written that the harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are  few. I congratulate Kobye on retirement with such distinguished service  and wish her a bountiful harvest for all of her labor on behalf of the  U.S. Senate and the people of Georgia.                            ____________________
