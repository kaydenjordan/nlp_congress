 Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Casey's  motion to strike provisions from TrumpCare that would harm individuals  with disabilities by reducing their access to affordable healthcare or  limiting coverage or benefits under Medicaid or in the private health  insurance market.   Today, as Senator Casey noted, we celebrate the 27th anniversary of  the Americans with Disabilities Act, recognizing the enormous  contributions that Americans who experience disabilities have made in  communities in New Hampshire and across our Nation.   Unfortunately, Senate Republicans are proposing massive cuts to  traditional Medicaid, which threaten the support that individuals who  experience disabilities need to thrive in their homes, their schools,  and their communities.   A few weeks ago, I visited an organization called Granite State  Independent Living in Concord, NH. It is a nonprofit that helps  individuals with disabilities of all ages to try to have an independent  life for themselves. What struck me the most was the consistent theme  that I heard over and over from  [[Page S4259]]  different people who experience different disabilities. They said that  because of services like personal care attendants, transportation help,  and other medical supports, they were able to work and live more  independent lives.   Many shared their biggest fears about what would happen if they  didn't receive the support--a real possibility if plans to decimate  Medicaid go into effect. Their biggest fear is that independence would  go away. There were fears of becoming a burden for their families or  having family members have to give up their jobs or having to be put in  a nursing home because that would be the only way they could survive.   Person after person talked about how much they wanted to contribute  to American life--to their communities, to their States, and to our  economy. I kept thinking that all of these people were expressing such  an American value with their desires to roll up their sleeves, do  everything they could to make a difference, to be self-sufficient, to  be independent.   The ability for Americans who experience disabilities to reach their  full potential is truly put at risk with some of these TrumpCare  proposals, and just a little while ago on the floor, I heard a  discussion that perhaps there might be a proposal put forward on the  floor--maybe this evening--that would record a sense of the Senate that  the Senate wants to make sure that whatever action it takes will not  hurt people with disabilities. It will support people with  disabilities.   There is no doubt that a kind word can go a long way on a difficult  day, but as someone who has raised a child who has experienced severe  disabilities, as someone who has spent a lot of time talking to people  with disabilities and their families, I can tell you that sympathy and  empathy only go so far.   The people I know who experience disabilities want to do everything  they can to support themselves, to be independent, to be able to reach  their full potential. There is a difference between charity and  justice, and while none of us would ever reject the kindness that so  many people demonstrate to people with disabilities, what we really  should be working toward is making sure people with disabilities have  the same access to healthcare, to education, to the workforce that will  allow them to have what every American wants, which is an independent  life where they are free to chart their own course, support themselves,  move forward.   We celebrate the 27th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities  Act today--one of our great moments in this country, as we have  reminded ourselves of our Founders' vision. Our Founders said that  every single person counts, and while they didn't honor that principle  perfectly at our founding, while they did not count everyone at first,  they have had the confidence that every generation of Americans would  move forward, bringing in more and more people from the margins into  the heart and soul of our democracy, our communities, our economy, and,  in doing that, we would unleash the talent and energy of more and more  Americans. It is that talent and energy that has been the secret of our  country's success. It is our vision that continues to drive us forward.   On this day of all days, when we celebrate the progress we have made  to honor the freedom, strength, and productivity of Americans who  experience disabilities, the last thing we should do is pull the rug  out from under those very people by decimating the Medicaid Program  that provides them the kind of support that actually allows them to be  free, to work hard, to be with their families, to make a difference, to  be treated like every other American, to have the rights of every other  American, and to feel like every other American.   We can't afford to go back to the days when we marginalized or didn't  assist some of our most vulnerable people--people who want to  participate and contribute to their communities and to the country they  love. So I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Senator Casey's  motion and make clear that individuals with disabilities deserve the  right to receive the support they need at home, at school, and in their  communities, so they can be free and thrive.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.    Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record. The motion is supported by Senators Casey, Baldwin, Brown,  Booker, Franken, Kaine, Stabenow, Duckworth, Leahy, Coons, Blumenthal,  Durbin, Warren, Wyden, Peters, Warner, King, Markey, Cardin, Menendez,  Nelson, Reed, Udall, Carper, Bennet, Hirono, Cantwell, Heinrich, and  Van Hollen.   I would like to take a moment to thank my colleagues for their  support.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Ms. Hassan moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) ensure that no provision in the bill would reduce or       eliminate the amount, duration, or scope of Medicaid services       available in schools under current law.     Madam President, today I wish to recognize Senator Lou  D'Allesandro and congratulate him on his 20 years of service in the New  Hampshire Senate and to honor his extraordinary career of public  service to the State of New Hampshire.   Senator D'Allesandro is serving his 10th term in the New Hampshire  Senate representing Manchester and previously served three terms on the  New Hampshire Executive Council and two terms in the New Hampshire  House of Representatives. Serving with distinction, he has always  sought to best represent his constituents and is well known in New  Hampshire for his leadership, his willingness to work constructively to  better the Granite State, and for the responsiveness and care he has  shown throughout his years in public service.   In addition to his many legislative achievements, Senator  D'Allesandro served our country honorably in uniform in the U.S. Marine  Corps and is an accomplished educator. Senator D'Allesandro was  instrumental in getting NCAA status for SNHU and has remained extremely  involved in New Hampshire education, having served as chairman of the  New England Board of Higher Education. Appointed the first basketball  coach in Southern New Hampshire University history in 1963, Senator  D'Allesandro led the SNHU Penmen to three straight titles and compiled  a record of 114-40 in 7 years of coaching collegiate athletics. He  holds honorary doctorates from Franklin Pierce University, Daniel  Webster College, and the New Hampshire Institute of Art, as well as  degrees from the University of New Hampshire, Rivier University, New  England College, and the New Hampshire Institute of Art. He is a member  of the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame, Inc., and  is a director of the New Hampshire Hockey Hall of Fame.   As one may gather, Senator D'Allesandro is passionate about bettering  the lives of New Hampshire's young people through education, and I  sincerely thank him for his years supporting, in so many ways, our  colleges and universities. I also thank his wonderful wife, Pat, who  has stood by Lou's side and, in doing so, has also served the people of  New Hampshire. I am honored to call Lou D'Allesandro a friend, and as  Senator for New Hampshire, I join my voice with the voices of so many  other Granite Staters to express gratitude to Senator D'Allesandro for  his extraordinary commitment to public service, his selfless  contributions to higher education, and the positive impact he has made  on the State of New Hampshire. Of course, I join all Granite Staters in  wishing Lou a great American day.                            ____________________
