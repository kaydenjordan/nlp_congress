 Mr. President, I rise today to honor an  exceptional American and an exceptional member of the U.S. Capitol  Police Force, Officer Roderick Jennings. Officer Jennings is retiring  from the U.S. Capitol Police on December 28, 2021, after 31 years of  service, and today, I wanted to take a moment to honor his years of  service to the U.S. Capitol Police and to our country.   While he has served in many roles during his tenure, Officer Jennings  most recently has been assigned to the U.S. Capitol Police Senate  Division. I would often see him stationed in the basement of the  Russell Senate Office Building, as well as other locations throughout  the Senate complex. Whenever I saw Officer Jennings, he was always  friendly and consistently maintained a sense of utmost professionalism.  I always enjoyed seeing him throughout my day, and I know other members  and staff feel the same. The Senate community will miss Officer  Jennings.   We must do everything we can to support and honor our law enforcement  officers for what they do for us each and every day. The Capitol Police  make tremendous sacrifices and put their lives on the line for us, and  for that, we owe them a debt of gratitude. Officer Jennings showed an  unwavering commitment to keeping others safe, and these halls  undoubtedly remained safer because of his service and the entire  Capitol Police force. Officer Jennings represents everything that is  great about our country, and we are all better off for his selfless  sense of duty and his tireless commitment to our safety. I thank  Officer Jennings for his  [[Page S9300]]  years of service, and I wish him all the best in his  retirement.                            ____________________
