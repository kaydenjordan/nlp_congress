 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, our Democratic colleagues in the House  and, to some extent, here in the Senate have talked about how the so- called Build Back Better legislation is popular, but I think the main  reason it is popular is because, frankly, many Members of Congress and  certainly the public at large don't know what is in it. So I would like  to spend just a few minutes talking about that.   First of all, there is the size of the bill. Originally, the Budget  Committee chairman, the Senator from Vermont, floated a $6 trillion  spending bonanza. This, of course, was on top of about $5 trillion we  spent last year in a bipartisan fashion dealing with the COVID-19  pandemic. But, of course, this $6 trillion more was designed to be  passed with a pure party-line vote through the reconciliation process.   After some pushback, the $6 trillion figure that Chairman Sanders  proposed was cut back to 3.5, and now our colleagues in the House and  elsewhere are touting a new pared-down bill which spends only--and I  underline the word ``only''--$1.75 trillion. I dare say that is a  number that none of us can fully comprehend given its magnitude, but it  has become--sort of rolls off our tongues like everybody understands  what a trillion dollars is like everybody knows what a million is or a  thousand or a hundred or ten dollars. But it is an enormous number.   As our colleagues have slimmed and trimmed this bill to reach a  pricetag that could get consensus in the House, some of their favorite  provisions have fallen off the chopping block. They realize that  programs like free college actually cost a whole lot of money. So to  live within this new number, which I will talk about in a moment,  Democrats in the House kept cutting and cutting, but they found-- instead of real cuts, they found another solution to their problem of a  topline. What they have basically done is to create the illusion of a  lower pricetag without making any real, substantive, long-term cuts.  How do you do that? Well, it is the old-fashioned way; it is called  budget gimmicks.   Rather than remove these expensive programs entirely, they chose to  create a number of arbitrary cliffs, sunsets, and expirations. That  way, they could pretend to pass these bills at a lower cost with the  tacit promise to continue them at another time and on another day.   One example of this was the expanded child tax credit. Our Democratic  colleagues originally crafted this as a temporary measure in their  partisan bill that became law in March, just 8 months ago. The first  payments had barely gone out the door when they decided to call for  making those temporary provisions permanent in the BBB, the so-called  Build Back Better bill. Our colleagues knew that a permanent extension  and expansion would have been far too expensive to meet their topline,  so they pretended to cut it by making it a temporary extension.   Earlier drafts of this bill would have extended this policy through  2025. As time went on, the pricetag was still too high, so it was  scaled back to a 1-year extension. But the truth is, nothing has really  changed. Calls to make the expansion permanent have not gone away. I  have seen no indication that our colleagues across the aisle are  content to let this extension expire after just 1 year.   The same is true of the earned income tax credit, which also was  expanded in March. A number of our colleagues have spoken here on the  Senate floor about the need to make this expansion of the earned income  tax credit permanent.   But the not-so-temporary extensions don't end there. This bill  extends the Affordable Care Act's premium tax credits through 2025,  which our colleagues claim will enable more Americans to afford  healthcare coverage. But at the same time, this bill cuts funding to  safety net hospitals and States that did not expand Medicaid. If their  goal was to expand access to low-income individuals under the Medicaid  Program, their bill cuts that funding to safety net hospitals in States  like mine that did not expand Medicaid. These cuts specifically target  hospitals that treat underinsured and uninsured patients.   In short, our colleagues are manipulating the budget process in a way  that appears to extend access to healthcare while at the same time cuts  funding to our most vulnerable patients--all in the cause of pushing  America closer to a single-payer system, something like Medicare for  All. I have no doubt that our colleagues across the aisle will, if  possible, not let these temporary provisions expire.   In the immortal words of Ronald Reagan, though, ``The closest thing  to eternal life on earth is a [temporary] government program.''   We have seen this movie before, time and again. It is smoke and  mirrors. It is budget gimmickry. It is starting new programs and  claiming to cut them off after a year, knowing that, inevitably,  Congress will be tempted to extend them much, much longer.   Well, before this bill comes to a vote in the Senate, I hope our  Democratic colleagues will agree with me that we need to know precisely  how much this bill will cost the American people. We know that our  colleagues across the aisle have struggled to try to make a $6 trillion  bill appear to be a $3.5 trillion and now a $1.75 trillion bill, but I  don't think anybody is really fooled or confused. Because they have  strategically chosen start dates, sunsets, and expiration dates to make  it appear that these programs cost less, we know that eventually, if  they have the votes, they will be extended through eternity.   Our colleagues gamed the Tax Code to partially fund the bill while  handing out massive tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires. I am  glad to see the chairman of the Budget Committee say that we really  shouldn't be focused on tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires in  blue States and cities like New York or San Francisco, which is exactly  what the Democratic bill tries to provide--tax cuts to millionaires and  billionaires in blue States.   This bill is really chock-full of inconsistencies. It claims to  extend access to healthcare while cutting off access to Medicaid or  some of the safety net programs in States like mine. It claims that,  well, we are going to tax the rich folks while at the same time  providing  [[Page S8812]]  tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires in blue States by lifting or  eliminating the SALT deduction--the State and local tax deduction-- which allows taxpayers, these millionaires and billionaires in blue  States, to deduct their State and local taxes, which means not only do  they get a tax cut, but the rest of us end up subsidizing them because,  in order to get the revenue needed, that means regular working folks  are going to have to pick up the gap.   The best evidence of this maneuvering is the fact that there is not a  single year over the next decade in which each tax provision would be  used at the same time. Let me say that again. Of all of the gaming in  the Tax Code, the fact is, under the proposal by the House of  Representatives--that we at some point will consider here--the fact is  there is not a single year over the next decade in which each of these  tax provisions would be used at the same time. This is nothing but  gimmicks and sleight of hand accounting.   In my previous life, I was the Attorney General of Texas. We had  something called the Consumer Protection Division. If anybody in the  private sector would falsely advertise, like the Federal Government and  Congress are trying to do in this so-called Build Back Better bill, we  would go after them with a vengeance for defrauding consumers.  Unfortunately, that doesn't apply to Congress. I wish it did.   We often talk, at least intermittently, about needing to know what is  in a bill before we actually vote on it. At one time or another,  Senators on both sides of the aisle have griped about voting on  thousand-page bills that were completed just hours before the vote.  Knowing the true cost of this legislation is no different. Before  voting on it, we have the duty to understand how it will impact our  debt and deficits and how big of a bill the American people will be  stuck with.   There is also this ugly animal rearing its head called inflation.  Seventy percent of the public said--I think in a recent public opinion  poll I have seen--that inflation is eating away more and more of their  income and is actually reducing their standard of living. It is a  silent tax on working families. I would think that, if we are concerned  about the welfare of those families, we ought to be very concerned  about making inflation worse by pouring more and more money into our  economy, chasing fewer and fewer goods and services.   That is part of the problem now. There is so much money sloshing  around as a result of the spending by Congress--much of it associated  with COVID-19, but not all of it. Some of it is with the American  Recovery Act that was passed with the $1.9 trillion in the early days  of the Biden administration. But the truth is inflation is eating our  lunch, and we should not be making it worse by spending a lot more  money, as our Democratic colleagues are proposing we do in the  Build Back Better bill.    So we need a cost estimate by the Congressional Budget Office, the  official scorer of these spending bills, because we know that what we  have seen so far is full of gimmicks, tricks, phony cliffs, phony  expiration dates, as I have said, and is, basically, a misleading of  the public and Congress into knowing what exactly is in this bill and  how much it will cost.   Well, the cost estimate provided by the CBO, we know, given these  phony assumptions, is not an accurate statement of the true cost of the  bill. This isn't a reflection of the folks who work at the CBO but of  the scoring rules they must follow. So, despite the fact that our  Democratic colleagues have explicitly said that temporary programs will  be extended at the first opportunity beyond the terms laid out in the  bill, the Congressional Budget Office has to play along and act like  that is true, but we know it is not true.   Fortunately, there are groups on the outside that have conducted  their own analysis. Assuming all of these phony cliffs and expiration  dates and the 1-year creation of programs that will later be extended,  they don't have to buy this sort of smoke-and-mirrors approach to the  budget. These groups have conducted their own analyses and have told us  what they think the true cost of this $1.75 trillion bill, so-called,  that passed the House will be.   For example, the budget experts at the University of Pennsylvania's  Wharton School of Business have analyzed this legislation as if these  temporary provisions would be made permanent, which, I think, is the  safest assumption to make. So, instead of $1.75 trillion, they have  pegged the cost as close to $4.6 trillion over 10 years--more than 2\1/ 2\ times the amount the Democrats have claimed.   Then there is the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget that  thinks that the number could even be a few hundred billion higher than  that. They estimate the true cost of this bill, now claimed to be $1.75  trillion, to be approximately $5 trillion. This is a massive, massive  jump from what the Democrats have said the cost of this bill will be.   Even one of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle has  acknowledged that this is disingenuous--and I would just use the word  ``false''--advertising. The true cost of this legislation is much  closer to Chairman Sanders' original $6 trillion request than the so- called scaled-back proposal of the current bill.   Before this legislation comes to the Senate floor, we need to see a  true cost estimate based on reasonable assumptions, not a fairy tale  scenario. It defies all common sense to vote on a bill without knowing  how much it is going to cost ahead of time.   To this end, last week, I sent a letter to the leaders of the  Congressional Budget Office and of the Joint Committee on Taxation  requesting an updated estimate based on more reasonable assumptions. If  the temporary provisions of this bill are extended--and I fully expect  them to be if our Democratic colleagues have the votes to do it--this  legislation will cost a whole lot more than what the American people  have been told; and we need to know, as close as we can, exactly how  much that will be.   Well, it is obvious what is going on here. These not-so-temporary  provisions won't expire in a year or 4 years or 10 years. We need to  operate under rational assumptions that our Democratic colleagues, when  the chance is provided to them, will make these programs permanent and  come up with a true and honest score for the bill. If this legislation  is all of a sound investment as our Democratic colleagues claim, they  shouldn't have anything to be afraid of.   We do have a duty, I believe, as Members of Congress, in voting on  legislation of this magnitude, to know what we are doing before we are  asked to vote on it. I don't think anybody, really, should have  anything to be afraid of, unless they are afraid of a true accounting  as opposed to the smoke and mirrors we see so far on this phony,  gimmickry bill.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:27 p.m., recessed until  2:15 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer  (Ms. Sinema).                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to start by thanking my colleagues  for being willing to stand up and defend innocent human life.   I remember, recently, watching a young woman walk across one of the  downtown bridges in Austin, TX, carrying a sign that read: ``Abortion-- any time, any reason.''   That is what she was advocating for. I was shocked when I saw it  because I thought even the most ardent advocates of abortion would not  take that position of denying the humanity of this unborn child, but,  apparently, that is what it has become here--48 years after the Supreme  Court first created a right to abortion out of whole cloth as a  constitutional right.   You look, in vain, in the Constitution of the United States, as well  as in the amendments to the Constitution, for any reference at all to  abortion. What you will find, if you read the Declaration of  Independence, is a familiar statement to all of us. On July 4, 1776,  the 13 States then that made up America wrote: ``We hold these truths  to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are  endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among  these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.''   By the way, there is no asterisk--there is no footnote--that says, if  you are an unborn human life, that you are denied this unalienable  right to life.   Such noteworthy figures as Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was probably one  of the most aggressive advocates for abortion rights on the U.S.  Supreme Court, later in life decried the fact that, by the Supreme  Court's holding a right to abortion as a constitutional right, it  denied the very sort of give-and-take debate by which our differences  are resolved in the States and at the national level.   I would just like to point out some of the misinformation that you  hear and read about Roe v. Wade.   If Roe v. Wade is no longer the precedent by which abortion rights  are decided, it will not mean that abortion will not be available in  many, if not all, of the States. What it will mean is that it will be  decided, under our Federal system, on a State-by-State basis,  [[Page S8822]]  according to the decisions made by elected State leadership, including  the legislature.   In 1973, Richard Nixon was inaugurated for the second time as  President of the United States. Suffice it to say that a lot has  happened since then--a lot. I think it is entirely appropriate that the  U.S. Supreme Court revisits its precedents, including Roe v. Wade-- decided in 1973--and decide if that precedent has stood the test of  time.   By the way, in serving on the Judiciary Committee, we frequently have  nominees for the Supreme Court of the United States come before the  committee, and many of my pro-choice colleagues will say: Do you agree,  Judge or Future Judge, that Roe v. Wade is the precedent of the U.S.  Supreme Court?   Of course, that is along with Casey and the other decisions that have  been decided since then, but they act as if the U.S. Supreme Court  cannot revisit bad decisions and correct those bad decisions.   To act as though Supreme Court precedent is somehow sacrosanct would  still leave us with the likes of Dred Scott, which treated African  Americans as less than fully human. Obviously, we fought a Civil War,  and 600,000 Americans died--that would be the equivalent of 3 million  people today--in a bloody Civil War that tore our country apart.   So being able to revisit those precedents, especially in light of the  passage of time and over long experience, is entirely within the  purview and entirely appropriate for the Supreme Court to do.   Well, we have heard from my other colleagues that, since Roe was  decided in 1973, more than 60 million abortions have been performed in  the United States. As originally was decided, Justice Blackmun wrote an  opinion and established an event he called viability. Basically, the  argument by the proponents of Roe is that somehow, in this decision by  Justice Blackmun's saying that abortion should be widely available pre- viability, we should not be able to reconsider or take a look at that.  The truth is, Justice Blackmun admitted this was an arbitrary standard.   What does ``viability'' mean?   We have heard that seven countries around the world have more  permissive or equally permissive abortion laws as the United States. I,  frankly, don't want to be in the same company as North Korea or the  People's Republic of China, governed by the Communist Party. I would  hope that America would aspire to something different and better and  more humane, more in line with our fundamental statement about the  unalienable right to life.   But, as to the fact that America is only one of seven countries that  allows elective abortions after 20 weeks, which, as I said, puts us in  the same category as communist China and North Korea, you would think  that would raise a huge red flag as to say something is terribly wrong  here.   How is it that we are in the same category as communist North Korea  and as communist China when it comes to the value we place on unborn  life?   Well, unfortunately, we have seen the right to life become a partisan  issue in the U.S. Congress when you take a look at the pro-life  legislation which has been introduced over the last years.   We saw last year, for example, our Democratic colleagues filibuster  legislation to outlaw elective abortions after 20 weeks, which is when  science tells us that an infant can feel pain. Then they blocked a bill  requiring physicians to provide lifesaving care to infants who survive  abortions. This is care that any other newborn baby would receive, and  yet our colleagues--so concerned about the backlash among their pro- abortion constituents--blocked it, denying a child born alive after a  botched abortion the same sort of care that any other newborn would be  entitled to. They blocked it.   And the latest attack on an unborn baby's right to life is the  Women's Health Protection Act. This bill would undermine State laws  limiting abortion, even after viability, and undercut the Supreme  Court's ruling that defines our current definition of ``viability.''   What does ``viability'' mean?   Even at 20 weeks, can an unborn child live without medical attention  and support from their mother or medical personnel?   Of course not.   This was an arbitrary line drawn by the Supreme Court in 1973. As we  have heard from many of my colleagues, medicine has, thankfully,  advanced considerably since that time.   Well, even though the U.S. Congress seems to be stuck when it comes  to the issue of abortion and respecting the right to life of unborn  babies, thankfully, the States have taken the issue up, which is why  States, like Mississippi, have passed their own legislation to protect  unborn babies.   Pro-abortion advocates say, well, 15 weeks--which is what the  Mississippi law says. They say that a right to abortion only for the  first 15 weeks of a pregnancy violates constitutional rights. But it is  interesting. It is no less arbitrary than this notion of viability,  which suggests that a child can live--which they cannot--outside the  mother's womb even if they are 20 weeks or 24 weeks of gestational age.  Interestingly, in a number of States, like Massachusetts and Nevada,  abortions are restricted after 24 weeks. California, Washington,  Illinois are among States that explicitly restrict abortions after  viability.   The American people clearly stand behind the protection of unborn  life. This summer, a poll found that 65 percent of Americans believe  that abortion should be illegal in the second trimester. That is the  second 3-month period of a 9-month pregnancy.   Opposition to third-trimester abortion is even stronger, as 80  percent of Americans are opposed to a third-trimester abortion. Indeed,  the Supreme Court of the United States upheld a Nebraska law banning  late-term abortion, which is essentially producing a delivery while the  child is still alive, killing the fetus, and then completing that  abortion. The Supreme Court of the United States upheld a ban on that  third-trimester, late-term abortion--that brutal and barbaric practice  that even the Supreme Court could not abide.   Last June, a baby born at 21 weeks and 2 days, this last summer,  celebrated his first birthday. That is what is at stake here when you  are dealing with more than just one person--or you are dealing with  more than just one person.   The question is: How do you balance and deal with the rights not only  of the woman seeking the abortion, but also of the unborn child?   Right now, under its current jurisprudence, that unborn child is not  even considered a human.   America cannot be its best if we devalue the lives of the most  vulnerable among us. I believe that babies with heartbeats,  fingerprints, and taste buds deserve some protection under the law.   I am proud of the efforts led by our colleague Senator Lankford and  others to make sure that we actually have a discussion about this issue  and don't just sweep it under the rug and we don't just let the pro- abortion lobby mischaracterize what we are talking about, as if  eliminating Roe would eliminate abortions in America. It would just  allow the States to do it on a State-by-State basis.   But, actually, Roe was made up right. It created a constitutional  right that is not even stated in the Constitution itself, and it  created an arbitrary time limit in which abortions could be performed  or not as a matter of constitutional right.   So I join the rest of the body and this country awaiting the Supreme  Court's ruling. I believe that it is more than appropriate for the  Supreme Court to revisit its precedence that essentially disparaged and  denigrated the right to life of an unborn child.   I would yield the floor to my friend from Oklahoma.
