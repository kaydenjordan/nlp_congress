 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor one of  our fallen servicemembers in Iraq, Sergeant First Class Edward Kramer.   Sergeant Kramer was a North Carolina National Guard soldier killed in  action by an IED on his last day of combat operations while he was  deployed to Iraq, leaving a family and young children behind.   General Soleimani's brutal reign of terror was responsible for the  deployment of the IEDs that killed and wounded soldiers such as  Sergeant First Class Kramer. In fact, Soleimani's reign of terror  killed and wounded over 600 servicemembers in Iraq.   We can never fully repay the families of our fallen soldiers, but we  can seek justice. Terrorism must never prevail over American freedom  and identity.                            ____________________
