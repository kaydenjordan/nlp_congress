 Mr. Speaker, some Members of this House have embarrassed  themselves, our Congress, and our country by bringing a baseless  impeachment resolution against Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General  of the United States of America.   Mr. Rosenstein has done his job lawfully and appropriately according  to Hoyle. They want him to release information which, if he does it,  will be releasing matters that are classified and confidential and  could jeopardize the investigation that Robert Mueller is leading and  Mr. Rosenstein is over and harm that investigation.   Prosecutors will not release their information of who their witnesses  are, where they are going, or whom they have interviewed. They can't  and should not give away sources and methods. To do so would be in  dereliction of duty.   To file impeachment resolutions is to hurt Mr. Rosenstein, to hurt  the investigation, hurt Mr. Mueller, and keep the truth from being  known by the American public. If they weren't concerned about the  truth, they wouldn't be going after the investigator so much. You do  that when you can't deal with the data.   I hope when we come back Mr. Mueller is still safe in his job, Mr.  Rosenstein is still safe in his job, and the United States of America  still stands for the rule of law and democracy.   God bless America.                            ____________________
