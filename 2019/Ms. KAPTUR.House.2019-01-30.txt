 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the Federal  Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act.   Our federal public servants dedicate their lives to serving their  fellow Americans.   Today, let's thank them for their dedicated service to our country by  providing them and their families an overdue pay raise that they have  earned.   The Trump shutdown exposed the all-too-real economic reality for many  Americans. Millions live paycheck-to-paycheck, including many of our  public servants. They did not choose a life of public service to make  it rich, but rather to serve and improve the lives of their fellow  citizens.  [[Page H1304]]    The shutdown also crystalized the daily impact federal workers have  on all our lives. 85 percent of all federal workers live outside of  Washington, and their paychecks drive the economies of communities  across the U.S.   This increase of 2.6 percent will help federal workers, 1 in 8 of  whom make less than $40,000 a year, make ends meet while stimulating  local small businesses across the nation when federal employees spend  their earnings.   Mr. Chair, it is unacceptable that their pay has not reflected the  increased demands of cost of living for years. It's time we give our  hardworking federal employees the pay raise they deserve and earn every  day.
