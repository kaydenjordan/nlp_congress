 Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues and all  Americans in celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month and the innumerable  contributions of the Hispanic American community. There is much to  celebrate. Although Hispanic Americans comprise 18 percent of the U.S.  population, Latino-owned businesses, by some estimates, are responsible  for approximately 86 percent of this country's small business growth.  What is more, their economic influence is unrivaled by any other  demographic since the baby boomers, representing a $1.5 trillion  segment of the consumer market, according to a recent Stanford  University state of Latino entrepreneurship, and perhaps, most notably,  Hispanic Americans play an increasingly important role in our  democracy, with a record 27 million Latinos eligible to vote in last  year's election.   It has never been clearer that Hispanic Americans represent an  impressive cultural and economic force. Ultimately, however, their  value to this country is not in their statistics. It is in their  character. A love for family, a commitment to community, and an  unparalleled penchant for hard work are the tenets of Hispanic  heritage. They are also the building blocks of America. This is no  coincidence: Hispanic Americans helped build and sustain our Nation.  They are an irreplaceable thread in the fabric of American society.  With their knack for innovation, with their fearless pursuit of better  lives, and sometimes with their bare hands, they have shaped this  country from the ground up, and we are all the better for it.   While we use this month to reflect on their dignity and importance to  this country, this year, in particular, the Hispanic American community  is best served through actions not just words. Congress must pass the  Dream Act. President Trump's order to rescind the Deferred Action for  Childhood Arrivals, DACA, Program has shaken the Hispanic American  community and most American to their core. Dreamers were brought to  this country as children, with no decision in the matter. More  importantly, they are quintessentially American in every way, except  for their immigration status. They have lived, played, worshipped, and  gone to school alongside our children most of their lives. They are our  children's classmates and neighborhood friends and teammates. They are  the college students studying at the library. They are the young  serviceworkers at our favorite restaurants, studiously saving up for  next semester's tuition. They are young men and women in uniform,  serving in harm's way, defending our freedoms.   Dreamers were raised here, and most know no other home except the  United States of America. If Congress does not act to protect them, the  President's actions will force many of them out of work, into hiding  and into poverty. This will not make America stronger. What makes  America stronger are the Dreamers themselves. Their spirit, character,  and will to overcome represent what is best about our country. We  should be proud to call them our own. We shouldn't be sending them  underground or into exile.   There is another urgent matter demanding our full attention:  hurricane relief for Puerto Rico. The pictures coming from Puerto Rico  are heartbreaking. The devastation that has hit the island as a result  of Hurricane Maria deserves the same commitment and support that would  go to any other location in the United States. Puerto Rico's 3.4  million residents are American citizens, and they should be treated  just the same as residents of Florida, Texas, and Louisiana. The Senate  should quickly take up the emergency supplemental appropriations  request as soon as possible after the Columbus Day recess.   Voting rights, access to quality, affordable healthcare, higher  education, tax reform, these are also issues critically important to  Hispanic Americans because they are the issues important to the  country. There is no breathing room between the two. Our national  interests are their personal interests, so their interests must also be  ours.   Americans are a diverse group; we do not all look the same or worship  in the same way. We are, each and every one of us, united by far more  profound things: a love for the freedoms this country affords us;  respect for the power and peace we derive from our diverse communities;  and an unshakable belief in every person's right to life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness. What makes us Americans is our moral fiber  and our shared love for the United States. Any other litmus test is a  discriminatory one; yet every day, and sometimes at the hands of our  own government, Hispanic Americans are tested and questioned, profiled,  and met with suspicion, out of sheer ignorance and baseless prejudice.  Still, they march on. They meet the challenges of systemic  discrimination with grace, grit, and courage. Indeed, the Hispanic  American community often reflects the best of America, even when  America offers less than its best in return.   Now more than ever, Hispanic Heritage Month must be about standing up  and declaring support for Hispanic Americans. Now more than ever,  Congress must use its collective voice to magnify their voices, to  affirm Hispanic Americans' rightful place in this Nation and to  proclaim a commitment to representing their interests right here in  this Chamber.   We must begin fulfilling that commitment by immediately passing the  Dream Act. But our commitment must extend further. We must support more  equal representation of Hispanic Americans in our society, including in  Congress. We must address the healthcare disparities that  disproportionally affect the Hispanic community, an issue that begs  Congress to work together toward more universal, affordable coverage.  We must acknowledge the difficulties Hispanic American students face in  affording college. Finally, we must stand firm against the tidal wave  of bigoted rhetoric that has flooded the national dialogue in recent  months. Whenever and wherever Hispanic Americans are degraded,  belittled, or oppressed, basic morality demands that we speak up and  speak out. Tolerance and respect, like a muscle, require effort and  exercise. We must not allow these values to atrophy on our watch.  Diversity and inclusion are American virtues and proud features of  Hispanic heritage alike; we must now, and always, be their steward.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a  Marylander, John Gabriel Smith, whose courage not only broke barriers  for himself but also advanced the cause of the betterment of humanity.  We celebrate and honor Mr. Smith, known as Gabe, because he was the  very first African American to graduate from Gonzaga College  Preparatory High School, located just a few blocks from the Capitol  Building, with the class of 1954.   Gabe was born in the turbulent times of the early 1940s in St. Mary's  County,  [[Page S6355]]  MD, where he and his two sisters were introduced to the ugly world of  racism. His hard-working parents committed their children to a Catholic  education and religious fellowship at St. Peter Claver, a predominantly  African-American church in rural Ridge, MD. As an eighth grader, Gabe  decided to serve as an altar boy; little did he know that it would  change his life and place him in the annals of American history.   The head pastor of St. Peter Claver was a humble man by the name of  Father Horace B. McKenna, S.J., a White Jesuit priest who had been  serving the segregated and neglected African-American community in  Southern Maryland for two decades. Father McKenna would later found So  Others Might Eat, SOME, a ministry which continues to feed the hungry  here in Washington, DC. One day, Gabe listened intently as Father  McKenna described the spiritual journey many men had taken on the way  to priesthood. Gabe, who was interested in pursuing this vocation,  asked Father McKenna how he could become a priest too. Father McKenna  told Gabe that he would, at a minimum, need to learn Latin.  Unfortunately, there were no schools in St. Mary's County or the  surrounding areas that Gabe could attend which taught Latin, let alone  provide the other instruction necessary to launch his vocation, so  Father McKenna told him about a school in Washington, DC. where he  could learn Latin and all the other requisites. That school was Gonzaga  College High School.   Racial segregation was the barrier that would have prevented Gabe  from attending Gonzaga, but that was about to change. Gabe often speaks  about the angels who have been in his life, including Father McKenna,  football coach Joe Kozik, and Archbishop Patrick A. O'Boyle, a man who  quietly but diligently worked to break the racial divide here in the  Nation's Capital. Several years before the Brown v. Board of Education  decision in 1954 to end segregation, Archbishop O'Boyle ordered the  integration of all Catholic schools and churches in the Archdiocese of  Washington. Thus, in 1951, John Gabriel Smith was one of the first  African Americans to enter Gonzaga, one of the Nation's elite prep  schools.   Gabe moved in with his sister, who lived around the corner from the  school. He had observed and experienced abusive conditions under  segregation in St. Mary's County; thus, he was on guard among his peers  at school. Fortunately, during his time at Gonzaga, his classmates  welcomed him in the classroom and stood with him in the face of  adversity and strife when they walked outside the school's walls.   As a member of the Gonzaga Purple Eagle football team, he encountered  yet another angel in his life, a football coach named Joe Kozik, who  stood by Gabe, along with his teammates. Whenever the Eagles played an  opponent opposed to integrated teams, Coach Kozik and his teammates  always stuck together like a family to overcome hate and ignorance.   In June of 1954, the year of the Brown decision to end segregation in  public schools across the Nation, Gabe completed his education at  Gonzaga College High School as the first African-American graduate.  Poised with a thorough education, including a command of Latin, he  entered Howard University, where he choose to pursue a different  vocation and graduated with a degree in pharmacy. He became a  pharmacist and worked for over 40 years, retiring just this past spring  with Shopper's Food Warehouse in Fort Washington, MD, where he spent  most of his career.   Gabe has been married to Mrs. Jeanette Graves Smith for 50 years and  has five children; his eldest, Pamela, passed away several years ago.  Gabe is a proud Marylander and a proud resident of Prince George's  County. He has long led his neighborhood association as president and  served as an active member in good standing of the Mt. Ennon Baptist  Church Men's Ministry.   Even though more than 60 years have passed since Gabe attended  Gonzaga, he still comments, ``I had angels who helped me through and  they continue to be with me today.'' To this day, Gabe sees his life as  an example of the power of love in the pursuit of the greater good.  Gabe's life shows us that, despite dark times and dark moments, where  there is light through our good deeds and good intentions, there is  hope.   John Gabriel Smith was the first of over 1,100 African-American  students to graduate from Gonzaga College High School so far. He will  leave an outstanding legacy for the State of Maryland, the halls of  Gonzaga, and for the United States as an example of what happens when  we seek inclusion and love for humanity. He shows us that living by  faith and love, everyone can succeed. I commend Gabe Smith for his  leadership and life of service.
