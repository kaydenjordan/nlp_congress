 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Hastings), my friend, classmate, and wonderful colleague, for yielding  time to me.   I rise today in opposition to the rule and the underlying bills. I  urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that this  bipartisan bill that I have written, the Presidential Tax Transparency  Act, can be made in order for immediate floor debate and a vote.   The Presidential Tax Transparency Act would require the President and  all future Presidents and Presidential nominees of the major parties,  Democrats and Republicans, to publicly disclose their tax returns. It  came as a surprise to many Americans, during the 2016 campaign, that  this disclosure was not required by law. Instead, we have had a  tradition of voluntary disclosure among every President of both parties  since the post-Watergate era. Until now, our Presidents have recognized  that those who seek or hold the most powerful office in the world  should be held to the highest standard of transparency.   Donald Trump is the first President to refuse to release his tax  returns since Gerald Ford, a man of the House. I remember when his  remains were brought to the Capitol where he rested in the rotunda but  came by the doors of the House. He was a man of the House and a man of  integrity.                                time  1245    He along with a host of others, Democrats and Republicans,  voluntarily released their tax returns. But Mr. Trump's 2016 candidate  filing with the Federal Election Commission shows that he has 564  financial positions in companies located both in the United States and  around the world, including relationships with state-affiliated  businesses in several countries.   Why is this important to note? The President had an opportunity to  resolve these potential conflicts of interest by divesting and placing  his business assets into a true blind trust, as other Presidents have  done, Republicans and Democrats. Instead, he chose to turn over control  of his business to his sons in an arrangement that the Director of the  nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics called ``wholly inadequate''  and ``meaningless from a conflict of interest perspective.'' Since he  is taken office, these ethics concerns have been borne out in the form  of his and his campaign's connections to Russia, deeply, deeply  troubling to all of us and to the American people, legitimately so; his  family's potential new business dealings in the Dominican Republic and  Uruguay; and the hiring of a ``director of diplomatic sales'' at his  Washington, D.C., hotel to attract high-priced business among foreign  diplomats. This is deeply unsettling, to say the least.   Simply put, the President's business empire makes him more  susceptible to conflicts of interest than any other President in the  history of our country. Three of the President's nominees have already  withdrawn their names from consideration due to potential financial  conflicts of interest. Only a full release of the President's tax  returns will provide the public with clear information as to his  potential conflicts of interest and his potential entanglements with  foreign governments and foreign businesses.   Last night, here on the floor, the House voted along party lines,  unfortunately, to block an effort to obtain the President's tax returns  under the House's existing authority. Today, we have another chance to  honor the will of the American people and write this important  disclosure tradition into law--into law.   According to a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, 74 percent of  Americans believe the President should release his tax returns--74  percent. The top petition on the White House website has over 1 million  signatures to it, calling on the President to release his tax returns.   I think the voice of the people, the American people, is clear. As  their representatives, they deserve to have us take action on this  because we all want a conflict of interest-free President.   I urge my colleagues to reject the previous question so we can hold  an immediate vote on the Presidential Tax Transparency Act.
