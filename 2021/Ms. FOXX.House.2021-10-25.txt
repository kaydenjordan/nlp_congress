 Mr. Speaker, once again this year, a local farm in North  Carolina's Fifth District has been selected to provide the White House  Christmas tree.   Rusty and Beau Estes, the owners of Peak Farms in Ashe County, are no  strangers to this prestigious selection process.   In both 2008 and 2012, Peak Farms provided Fraser firs to the White  House, and in 2018, the farm was selected to deliver the Christmas tree  to the residence of Vice President Mike Pence.   Mr. Speaker, this is a terrific accomplishment, and it represents the  best that North Carolina has to offer.   Congratulations to both Rusty and Beau. Mr. Speaker, yet again, Rusty  and Beau have proven that North Carolina's Fifth District is the  premier provider of Christmas trees throughout the country.                            ____________________
