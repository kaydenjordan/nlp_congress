 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Fiscal Year  2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which reflects the hard  work of the House Armed Services Committee to craft legislation that  ensures that the military has the resources needed to defend our  nation. I was particularly pleased that the legislation included a pay  increase for servicemembers, repeal of the Survivor Benefit Plan/ Indemnity Compensation Offset to provide Gold Star Families with their  full, earned benefits, and changes to allow access to justice for  military members and their families harmed by medical malpractice.   I want to take a moment to clarify the intent behind Section 1101 of  the legislation. Like my colleagues on the Committee, I feel strongly  that the finances of the Department of Defense must be subject to  meaningful audit and oversight. It is clear to me that requiring  accounting firms supporting this critical mission to disclose ongoing  disciplinary proceedings, including Public Company Accounting Oversight  Board (PCAOB) proceedings, to the Department of Defense is a backdoor  attempt to begin intruding on a process that Congress determined as  part of Sarbanes-Oxley and should remain confidential. Section 1011 of  the NDAA makes clear that these disclosures should not impinge on the  confidentiality of PCAOB proceedings governed by Sarbanes-Oxley. The  best way to reconcile these two statutes, which I believe has been  done, is to require accounting firms to disclose the existence of a  proceeding to the Department when those proceedings are relevant to the  important work of the Department and such a disclosure is consistent  with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important  legislation.
