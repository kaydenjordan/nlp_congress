 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Hyde amendment.   For over 40 years, the Hyde amendment, which prevents taxpayer-funded  abortions has had strong bipartisan support. However, the Biden  administration aims to end this longstanding bipartisan tradition by  striking the amendment in the fiscal year 2022 budget request.   The Hyde amendment is one of the longest standing Federal pro-life  policies and has prohibited publicly funded abortions since 1976. After  decades of support, it is gravely concerning that President Biden has  reversed his position on this important pro-life protection.   I vehemently support life and defending the unborn. I encourage all  my colleagues, both Democrat and Republican, to support this important  protection for the lives of the unborn.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and Judiciary be discharged from further  consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate consideration in  the House.
