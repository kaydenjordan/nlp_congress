 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Judicial Conference of the United States.                                              Judicial Conference of                                               the United States,                                   Washington, DC, December 7, 2020.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Leader: I write on behalf of the Judicial       Conference of the United States, the policy-making body of       the federal Judiciary, to express our continued strong       opposition to H.R. 8235, the Open Courts Act of 2020       (``OCA''), which is scheduled for floor action on Tuesday,       December 8, 2020. This legislation--which will take years to       implement--rushes forward without appropriate and necessary       assurances and provisions regarding the budget for such an       enormous undertaking. The bill as drafted will have       devastating budgetary and operational impact on the Judiciary       and our ability to serve the public.        We very much appreciate that you, along with House       Judiciary Courts Subcommittee Chairman Hank Johnson,       intervened last week after my helpful conversation with       Chairman Johnson to prompt more dialogue between the       branches. The many hours of staff conversations, through the       weekend, that followed your encouragement led to some       significant textual changes to the bill. We are grateful for       those efforts which addressed some of our concerns with the       previous version of the bill. Very serious concerns remain,       however, and further dialogue is much needed.        The fact is that our preliminary estimates for the cost of       this bill is orders of magnitude higher than the bill's       proponents have presumed--currently we are $2 billion apart--      and CBO's hurried and preliminary estimates of the cost of       developing and implementing a new electronic filing and       public  [[Page H7019]]       access system, in our view, vastly underestimates the cost of       the bill. Critically, some of the bill's revenue streams are       also untested, difficult to administer and/or impossible to       estimate reliably in advance.        In our cost estimates are correct--or even marginally       closer to correct than the bill's proponents'--there is no       scenario in which the revenue generated by the bill could be       sufficient to cover those costs. This will force the       Judiciary to slash funding for staff and other critical       operations. Moreover, the Judiciary's backbone case       management system, and therefore the Judiciary itself, could       grind to a halt. In anticipation of a funding shortfall, the       bill now provides for an emergency pause in the transition to       the new system required by the bill. This might be preferable       to the forced accommodation of significant unbudgeted costs,       but such a pause in the middle of a massive transition of       systems would result in its own substantial disruptions.        Better information on the costs of this bill and the       revenues it would generate is needed to ensure that the       Judiciary and public users of this system avoid devastating       consequences. We believe we will have a much clearer picture       of cost projections in early Spring 2021, at the conclusion       of the first phase of a study for a replacement case       management system to be performed by GSA.        The Judiciary has other major concerns with the bill,       including issues of technological feasibility, security, and       governance, but the threat of devastating budget consequences       for the Third Branch simply cannot be overemphasized.        The Judiciary is committed to working collaboratively with       the next Congress to improve our systems for filing, storing,       managing, and making available to the public all relevant       court records. We recognize and share Congress' bipartisan       interest in a modern, effective, fair and successfully funded       system. The current version of the Open Courts Act, however,       is not the way to accomplish those goals. We look forward to       working through these shared goals with you in the future.            Sincerely,                                                     James C. Duff,                                                         Secretary.     Mr. Speaker, let me first just acknowledge the well- intentioned goals of this legislation and my colleagues from Georgia in  a bipartisan way working together. I applaud their efforts to attempt  to modernize the judicial branch and make judicial records more  accessible to the American people. Nevertheless, I regrettably rise  with reservations, as a former practitioner in Federal court, regarding  H.R. 8235, the Open Courts Act of 2020.   According to the Judicial Conference of the United States, the bill,  as drafted, would have devastating budgetary and operational impacts on  the judiciary's ability to serve the public. Current estimates for the  cost of the bill from the Judicial Conference are currently $2 billion  apart from the Congressional Budget Office's preliminary estimates of  the cost to develop and implement a new electronic filing and public  access system.   Should these cost estimates be correct, there is no scenario in which  the revenue generated by the bill would cover costs, forcing the  judiciary to slash funding for staff and other critical operations.  This bill has a $2 billion price tag, and the entire budget of the  Federal judiciary is only $8 billion, annually.   Additionally, despite the bill's cap on increases to filing fees, it  authorizes the judiciary to raise filing fees if the other revenue  sources in the bill prove insufficient to cover costs.   I know my colleagues do not want to deny access to the Federal  courts. Ultimately, this bill does not resolve some of the judiciary's  most fundamental concerns, and, as a result, I regrettably urge my  colleagues to consider these issues and the bill's impact on the  judiciary.   I know the Judicial Conference is willing to work with Congress to  resolve some of these outstanding issues and to get at the sponsors'  goals--which are very laudable, indeed--and that is to modernize the  judicial branch and to make judicial records more accessible to the  American people.   I will say that, under current law, low-income Americans can access  many of these records without cost, and the vast majority of those  organizations and individuals that are paying for these records and  underwriting the costs are institutions that have the means to do so.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to consider these issues and  the bill's potential impact on the judiciary, and I encourage my  colleagues on the other side of the Capitol to work with the Judicial  Conference to resolve these outstanding concerns.
