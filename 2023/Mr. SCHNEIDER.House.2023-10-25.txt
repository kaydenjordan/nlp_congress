 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking  Member Meeks for leading on this resolution.   Hamas is a terrorist organization that is backed by Iran, driven by  hate, and committed to genocide. Since its founding, Hamas has been  dedicated to the destruction of Israel and the murder of Jews.   All who cherish life, value democracy, and seek justice must  resolutely condemn Hamas, condemn its heinous attack on October 7, and  condemn its war with Israel.   Israel has the right and the responsibility to defend itself against  Hamas, to protect its citizens, to secure its borders, and to rescue  its hostages no matter how long it takes.   Peace will only come after Hamas releases the hostages, ceases  launching rockets at Israeli neighborhoods from Palestinian  neighborhoods, schools, and hospitals, and Hamas no longer governs Gaza  or threatens Israel. Until then, Palestinians and Israelis cannot know  peace.   Three points: Hamas is a murderous organization and its aspirations  are no different than al-Qaida or ISIS. Twenty-two years ago, the  United States went to war halfway across the world. Today, Hamas is not  halfway across the world, but is entrenched on Israel's border.   Point number two: Israel must be able to defend itself and protect  its citizens.   Point number three: The United States, the United States Congress,  and the American people stand with Israel. Our relationship is  unbreakable. Our commitment to Israel's security to a Jewish democratic  State is ironclad.   Israel has no better friend than the United States and the United  States has no better friend than Israel.   To those who cheer Hamas, who turn a blind eye to murder, rape,  torture, and kidnapping, you cast your lot with the barbarians and  share in their shame.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
