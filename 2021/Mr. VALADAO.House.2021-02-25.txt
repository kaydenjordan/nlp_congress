 Madam Speaker, I rise today as the co-chair of the  American Sikh Congressional Caucus to recognize and create national  awareness about the Saka Nankana Sahib massacre.   The Sikh community across the world is observing 100 years of this  horrific event. The massacre refers to the grim episode during the  Gurdwara Reform Movement in which a peaceful batch of reformist Sikhs  was subjected to a murderous assault on February 20, 1921, in the holy  Gurdwara at Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of the founder of the Sikh  religion, Guru Nanak.   More than 260 Sikhs were killed, including children as young as 7.  Sikhs pay tribute to all those martyred on this day. Their valor and  sacrifice will never be forgotten. Their memory inspires us to work  even harder to voice for religious freedom and the right of worship.                            ____________________
