 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great Kansan,  Rich Felts, and to congratulate him on his retirement from a career of  service to Kansas farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers.   Rich has always been a tireless advocate for agriculture. He earned  his degree in animal science from Kansas State University, after which  he began his service to Kansas Farm Bureau at the county level, holding  many different leadership and volunteer positions. Now, after having  served as the president of Kansas Farm Bureau for 8 years, Rich will be  retiring on December 5.   As a partner in Felts Farms, a grain and livestock operation near  Liberty, Kansas, Rich has been through it all, and he brought his  firsthand experience with him to Kansas Farm Bureau, where he never  failed to empathize with local producers.   Congratulations on a job well done, Rich. Thank you for stewarding  the legacy of Kansas Farm Bureau so well. I know that Shirley and your  children, Cynthia, Darren, Ryan, and Kimberly are so proud of you. Your  leadership has been an inspiration and a model to us all.  Congratulations.                            ____________________
