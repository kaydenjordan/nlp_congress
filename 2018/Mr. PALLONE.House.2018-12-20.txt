 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill we are considering  under suspension of the rules, S. 2322, the Codifying Useful Regulatory  Definitions Act, or the CURD Act.   This bill has not proceeded through regular order and codifies into  the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act a highly prescriptive  definition of ``natural cheese'' that should be determined by the FDA,  not by Congress.   This legislation creates a statutory definition for a specific  category of cheese and expressly distinguishes what shall be considered  natural cheese from the other standards of identity for processed  cheese currently defined in regulation. The bill then codifies these  regulatory standards of identity into the statute and expressly  preempts any non-Federal definition of the term ``natural cheese.''   The FDA has the authority to define this term, yet proponents of this  legislation prefer legislative expediency over sound regulatory  decisionmaking. Supporters insist that this definition is needed in  statute immediately to assure it quickly applies. However, instead of  waiting to proceed through regular order or following the regulatory  process, stakeholders are asking for an immediate statutory change  because of ongoing litigation that this bill will help to resolve for  some stakeholders.   Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that by rushing this legislation through  we have not been given adequate time to consider the implications for  this change or how this definition might impact consumers and other  industry stakeholders. The FDA is best positioned to consider the  public health impacts of defining this term and how it would interact  with other agency efforts regarding nutrition labeling, such as a  broader definition for the term ``natural.''   Additionally, I am concerned by the precedent this legislation  creates and believe that passing this bill only encourages stakeholders  to seek additional statutory changes or definitional clarity for the  products when they believe the FDA has not acted as expeditiously as  they wish or when they are facing litigation.   We should be making changes to the Federal statute when they are  necessary and in order to protect the public health, not when industry  is seeking a favorable outcome that could be achieved through  regulatory process. I do not believe this change is warranted in this  circumstance.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I strongly believe that legislation like the  CURD Act should be considered through regular order, and I am opposed  to this bill, given that the House of Representatives has held no  hearings on this issue and has not marked up the bill under  consideration today. The Senate passed this bill in the dead of night,  with no discussion or debate on the floor. I believe we are abdicating  our duty to fully consider the implications of this statutory change if  we pass this bill today.   On the substance, Mr. Speaker, the Center for Science in the Public  Interest, Consumer Reports, and The Good Food Institute are all opposed  to this legislation and have raised serious concerns about the impact  of this change on consumer confusion and transparency. I include in the  Record letters in opposition to the bill from all three.                                                 Center for Science                                          in the Public Interest,                                  Washington, DC, December 19, 2018.        Dear Member: The Center for Science in the Public Interest       writes to urge you to oppose the CURD Act (H.R. 4828, S.       2322). This misguided bill would define ``natural cheese'' in       a way that actually muddles, rather than clarifies, the term.       For example, it would allow the use of artificial colors and       additives in ``natural cheese'' and would also make labeling       for cheese inconsistent with U.S. Department of Agriculture       (USDA) labeling requirements and possibly also with the Food       and Drug Administration's (FDA's) labeling requirements for       other ``natural'' foods. The bill could also prevent the term       ``natural'' from being used on non-dairy cheese alternatives       that may otherwise rightly be considered natural by       consumers.        The stated purpose of the bill is to draw a clear line for       consumers between ``natural cheese'' and processed cheese.       Yet we have seen no evidence that consumers are confusing       processed cheese with natural cheese in the marketplace. The       FDA's current standards of identity for processed cheese       types already require that these cheeses include a specific       statement of identity on the label indicating that they are       ``process cheese.'' And there are currently strong incentives       for the manufacturers of process cheese to avoid ``natural''       claims, as this could expose cheesemakers to liability.        Rather than protecting consumers, the bill would confuse       them by permitting misleading ``natural'' claims on products       that most Americans would not consider natural. For example,       a nationally representative telephone survey conducted in May       2018 by Consumer Reports found that more than 80 percent of       consumers say ``natural'' should mean no artificial       ingredients were used. Yet the CURD Act allows for the use of       synthetic food dye, artificial flavors, and other artificial       additives in so-called ``natural cheese.'' Similarly, an       overwhelming majority of Americans surveyed felt that use of       the term ``natural'' should be reserved for foods that deploy       natural agricultural practices to produce the food's       ingredients, including by limiting the use of hormones,       pesticides, and antibiotics. In contrast, the bill would       allow the term ``natural cheese'' to appear irrespective of       the agricultural practices used to produce the cheese's       ingredients.        The bill would also make labeling for ``natural cheese''       inconsistent with USDA and with likely future FDA       requirements for ``natural'' on food labels in general. The       USDA currently permits the use of the term ``natural'' on       products that contain no artificial ingredient or added color       and which are only minimally processed. In addition,       understanding that ``natural'' can have many meanings, the       USDA requires a brief statement of meaning on labels to avoid       confusion, stating, that the food is ``*no more than       minimally processed and contains no artificial ingredients.''       The FDA is also currently considering adopting a definition       of ``natural'' and may create similar requirements based on       comments in its public docket on the issue. Yet the bill       would authorize the claim ``natural cheese'' to be used on       cheese in a manner that fails to align with either the USDA's       current rules or prospective FDA requirements, leading to       inconsistency and confusion across the marketplace.        Finally, the bill defines ``natural cheese'' in a manner       that could be interpreted to prohibit use of the term on non-      dairy alternatives intended for consumers who are vegan,       lactose intolerant, or who otherwise wish to avoid dairy       cheeses. Use of the term ``natural'' should not be prohibited       on these products, provided the products otherwise meet       consumer expectations for use of this term.        The FDA is currently working on a definition of ``natural''       that would be non-misleading, based on consumer       understanding, and apply uniformly to all FDA-regulated       foods, including cheese. Congress should not act prematurely       to carve out a definition for ``natural cheese'' before the       agency has taken action to define ``natural'' for other       products.        For these reasons, we urge you to vote ``no'' on the CURD       Act.            Sincerely,      Sarah Sorscher,        Deputy Director of Regulatory Affairs, Center for Science       in the Public Interest.                                   ____                                                 Consumer Reports,                                                  December 20, 2018.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: Consumer Reports (CR), an independent,       nonprofit member organization that works side by side with       consumers for truth, transparency, and fairness in the       marketplace, urges you to vote no on S. 2322, the Codifying       Useful Regulatory Definitions (CURD) Act. This bill would       only add to consumer confusion at the supermarket and       undermine ongoing efforts to make food labeling clearer and       more consistent.        S. 2322 would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic       Act to set a definition of ``natural cheese'' and prohibit       food from being labeled as ``natural cheese'' unless it meets       that definition. Unfortunately, this seemingly mundane bill       would allow cheese to be labeled ``natural'' even if the       cheese includes artificial ingredients or synthetic       substances, such as yellow food dye, or if the cheese was       produced using methods or pesticides that consumers do not       consider ``natural'' according to our recent survey.        Generally, S. 2322 would permit misleading food labeling on       cheese that is inconsistent with consumers' understanding of       the term ``natural.'' According to Consumer Reports'       nationally representative April 2018 survey of 1,014 U.S.       residents, most Americans think ``natural'' should mean: (1)       that no artificial ingredients were used (81%); (2) that no       added hormones were used during food production (81%); and       (3) that no chemical pesticides were used during food       production (79%). The CURD Act would allow the label       ``natural cheese'' on products with any of these       characteristics.        We also oppose S. 2322 because it would undermine ongoing       work at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to define       ``natural''  [[Page H10427]]       through a process that prioritizes the public interest and       involves the input of all stakeholders. This effort intends       to define the term ``natural'' in a way that is not       misleading and based on consumer understanding, and that       applies to all foods in the marketplace overseen by the       agency. We support this initiative, especially because our       April 2018 survey found that 88% of Americans think that all       companies should meet the same standard for the ``natural''       label. Congress should not short-circuit this important work       by setting a special definition of ``natural cheese.''        The CURD Act ultimately places the interests of cheese       producers ahead of the broad need for consumers to understand       what they're buying and feeding their families. We urge you       to support a clear, consistent, and accountable food       marketplace for consumers, and vote no on S. 2322.            Sincerely,      Jean Halloran,        Director, Food Policy Initiatives Consumer Reports.      Charlotte Vallaeys,        Senior Policy Analyst Consumer Reports.      William Wallace,        Senior Policy Analyst, Consumer Reports.                                   ____                                          The Good Food Institute,                                  Washington, DC, December 19, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, House Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Energy and Commerce,           Washington D.C.      Re Opposition to the Codifying Useful Regulatory Definitions           Act (``CURD Act'').         Dear Chairman Walden and Rep. Pallone: The Good Food       Institute (``GFI'') is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization       that serves as a think tank and accelerator for plant-based       foods and cell-based meat. GFI is comprised of scientists,       entrepreneurs, lawyers, and policy experts focused on using       food innovation and markets to create a more sustainable food       supply. More specifically, we support policies that ensure a       level playing field for plant-based foods and cell-based       meat. We write today to express our opposition to the CURD       Act (S. 2322).        A marketplace that serves consumers well is one in which       products compete on their merits, not on their political       connections. The role of the government in this marketplace       is to ensure that products bear clear, accurate, and       consistent labels that present essential information without       confusing or misleading consumers.        In our view, the CURD Act has three significant flaws.       First, the Act would override FDA's regulatory definition of       milk as it pertains to standards of identity for cheeses by       explicitly including ``the lacteal secretions from animals       other than cows'' but not plant-based milks. The agency's       current definition, 21 C.F.R. Sec. 133.3, states that milk       used in cheese is obtained by the ``complete milking of one       or more healthy cows.'' Of course, there are a wide variety       of cheeses in the marketplace that are made from other kinds       of milks, including goat's milk, sheep's milk, and cashew       milk. The word cheese is allowable so long as these products'       labels clearly communicate to consumers the identity of the       product (that it is made from goat's milk, sheep's milk, or       cashew milk)--just as terms like soy milk, almond milk, and       chocolate milk are allowable on milk cartons. The CURD Act's       expansion of the definition of milk to include lacteal       secretions of other animals, but not plants, suggests that       its intent is protectionist: to permit producers to use the       label ``natural cheese'' when their products contain       ingredients that are not natural (e.g., synthetic dyes) while       simultaneously attempting to deny producers of plant-based       cheeses access to the same term.        Second, the CURD Act would establish a product-specific       definition of the term ``natural'' instead of a consistent       definition set by FDA that would apply to all the food       products it regulates. Setting a product-specific definition       of ``natural'' would likely conflict with how FDA uses it in       other contexts and could result in consumer confusion.        Third, the Act would create a rift between FDA and USDA       regarding the use of ``natural'' on labels. This too could       increase consumer confusion. Since the term ``natural'' can       mean different things to different consumers, USDA currently       requires USDA-approved labels to briefly explain on-label       what a ``natural'' claim applies to. The CURD Act does not       require any such explanation, giving ``natural cheese'' a       free pass to claim it is natural without giving further       information to consumers.        To ensure a fair marketplace that works for consumers, food       labels must be clear to consumers and not privilege one set       of producers over another. By that measure, the CURD Act       fails. We therefore respectfully urge you to oppose the bill       at this time.        Thank you very much for your consideration of this request.            Sincerely,      Jessica Almy, Esq.        Director of Policy, The Good Food Institute.      Kenneth Forsberg, Ph.D.,        Senior Policy Specialist, The Good Food Institute.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, we should not displace the important role  of the FDA in determining the correct terminology and approach to  regulating and labeling food products like cheese. Changes to the  statute should be considered in broad daylight, with robust discussion  and significant input from consumer, industry, and government  stakeholders.   That has not happened in this case, and for these reasons I oppose  the bill and urge my colleagues to oppose the bill as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
