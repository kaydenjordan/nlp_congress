 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Jonathon  Clark, an outstanding resident and community advocate of Michigan's  13th Congressional District.   Jonathon Clark was known for his unwavering commitment to helping  others in need and ministering to the spiritual needs of his neighbors.   Whether tending to his beautiful family he shared with his wife, Dawn  Wilson-Clark; leading worship at City Covenant Church in Detroit; or  lending his talents to several community works, he was an unbelievably  beautiful human being.   In his work, he served as a mentor to so many of our young people,  and he never shied away from offering them help and guiding them in the  right direction.   He also founded an early children's literacy program, called Talking  is Teaching, as a coordinator for City Covenant's summer camp.   In honor of his memory, please join me in recognizing his outstanding  contributions to Michigan's 13th Congressional District.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this supplemental.   I will not support an effort to enable and support war crimes, human  rights abuses, and violence.   We cannot continue talking only about Israeli's need for safety at a  time when Palestinians are living under a violent apartheid system and  are dying from what Human Rights Watch has said are war crimes.   We should also be talking about the Palestinian need for security  from Israeli attacks. We must be consistent in our commitment to human  life, period. Everyone deserves to be safe there.   The bill claims to be ``a replenishment'' for weapons apartheid  Israel used in a crisis it manufactured when it attacked worshippers at  one of the most holiest Islamic locations, al-Aqsa Mosque, committing,  again, numerous war crimes.   Yet, $1 billion in American taxpayer dollars that my colleagues want  to give represents, to me, an absurd and unjustifiable 140 times  increase to U.S. funding for the Iron Dome.   I firmly believe our country must oppose selling weapons to anyone  anywhere without human rights law compliance.   The Israeli Government is an apartheid regime--not my words, the  words of Human Rights Watch and Israel's own human rights organization  B'Tselem.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues: Please stand with me in supporting  human rights for all.   I include in the Record this Human Rights Watch article.                       [From BBC News, Aug. 23, 2021]    Israeli Strikes on Gaza High-Rises May Be War Crimes--Human Rights                                   Watch         No-one was hurt in the attacks, but a report by the       campaign group says dozens of families were left homeless.        The Israeli military said Palestinian militant groups were       using the towers for military purposes and turning civilians       inside into human shields.        But HRW said it had not provided evidence to support those       allegations.        At least 256 people were killed in Gaza, according to the       United Nations, and 13 people were killed in Israel during 11       days of fierce fighting.        It began after weeks of spiralling Israeli-Palestinian       tension in East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a       holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas--the       militant Islamist group which rules Gaza--began firing       rockets after warning Israel to withdraw from the site,       triggering retaliatory air strikes.        Between 11 and 15 May, Israeli strikes destroyed the       Hanadi, Jawhara, Shorouk, and Jala towers in Gaza City.        In each case, the Israeli military warned tenants of       impending attacks, allowing for their evacuation, according       to HRW's report.        Israeli authorities said the buildings housed offices of       Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups, including the       headquarters of certain units and military intelligence. One       tower included offices for ``the most valuable Hamas       technological equipment'' for use against Israel, it says.        HRW's investigation was based on interviews with 18       Palestinians who witnessed the strikes or were affected by       them, along with analysis of videos and photographs.        It found no evidence that members of militant groups       involved in military operations had a current or long-term       presence in any of the towers at the time they were attacked.        Even if there were such a presence, the report says, the       attacks appeared to cause foreseeably disproportionate harm       to civilian property.        The strike on the 12-storey Jala Tower, which housed the       offices of the Associated Press (AP) news agency and the Al       Jazeera broadcasting network, provoked widespread outrage.        In June, Israel's ambassador to the US told AP executives       that the building was being used by Hamas to develop an       electronic jamming system against the Israeli military's Iron       Dome missile defence system.        But the AP's executive editor said it had never had any       indication that Hamas militants might be in the tower.  [[Page H5112]]         ``The apparently unlawful Israeli strikes on four high-rise       towers in Gaza City caused serious, lasting harm for       countless Palestinians who lived, worked, shopped, or       benefitted from businesses based there,'' said Richard Weir,       HRW's crisis and conflict researcher. ``The Israeli military       should publicly produce the evidence that it says it relied       on to carry out these attacks.''        In response to HRW's report, the Israeli military told the       BBC: ``Hamas and the other terror organisations deliberately       and unlawfully embed their military assets in densely       populated civilian areas, in order to make it more difficult       for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to attack their military       assets.''        ``The assets Hamas tried to hide inside these multi-storey       buildings . . . were often of particularly high military       value, and successfully striking them was of strategic       importance to the IDF,'' it added.        The military stressed that it provided ``significant       advance warnings and took efforts to ensure civilians had       evacuated'' in all four cases.        HRW has published two other reports on the conflict that       accused both sides of carrying out attacks that apparently       amount to war crimes.        The first said an investigation into three Israeli strikes       that killed 62 civilians found no evidence of military       targets nearby, while the second said the firing of 4,000       unguided rockets and mortars towards Israeli cities and towns       by Palestinian militants constituted indiscriminate attacks       on civilians. Both the Israeli military and Hamas denied the       accusations.
