 Mr. Speaker, the administration's reckless  use of tariffs are inflicting harm in all of our communities, including  mine in western New York, and the harm is real and immediate.   Welded Tube, a Canadian company with a factory in Lackawanna, New  York, in my district, reports the cost of moving goods between the  United States and southern Ontario has increased from $0 last week to  $214,000 this week.   The company is reporting they may be forced to close without tariff  relief.   From small firms like Niagara Transformer to auto manufacturers like  Ford and GM, the harm is real and widespread.   The United States and Canada are the world's largest trading  partners. Canada has been a reliable ally in fighting terror and has  been a good friend to the United States.   We need to stand with our allies and friends, not abandon them.   China's trade actions threaten our national security. Canada does  not.                            ____________________
