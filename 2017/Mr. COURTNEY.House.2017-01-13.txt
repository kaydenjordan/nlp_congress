 Mr. Speaker, last night Speaker Ryan told a national  audience on CNN ObamaCare is crumbling. Donald Trump has said over and  over again ObamaCare is a disaster. I would like to share just a tiny  fraction of the emails my office has received in the last few days to  demonstrate that the opposite is true:   Peter, a 63-year-old farmer from Ellington, Connecticut:         ACA has allowed me and my wife access to quality health       care. If this law is repealed, either I sell off my land and       livestock or go without insurance.    Becky, a 41-year-old small-business owner and single mom from  Enfield, before ACA hadn't seen a doctor in 4 years. Now, she and her  kids have a plan for $315 a month.   George, a 53-year-old freelance designer from Niantic: the past 2  years, he and his wife with preexisting conditions have been covered by  an affordable plan.   Michelle, a registered nurse with health issues from Killingworth,  has the same message.   Sue from Vernon, her husband has cancer.   Barbara from North Stonington, a 59-year-old registered nurse, has a  chronic condition.   All are watching this destructive process with outrage. For these  people, the only thing that is crumbling is their confidence in  Congress to do the right thing and stop this rush to repeal.   As George from Niantic said:         I have never been so worried for my country.    Vote ``no'' on repeal. Vote ``no'' on the rule.
