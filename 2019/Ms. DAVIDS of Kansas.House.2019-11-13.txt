 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and  colleague from Illinois for yielding.   The first thing I would like to do is thank Chairwoman Velazquez and  Ranking Member Chabot for continuing the Small Business Committee's  bipartisan efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  H.R. 3734, the Successful Entrepreneurship for Reservists and Veterans  Act, or the SERV Act, which I introduced with Ranking Member Chabot.   This bipartisan piece of legislation helps veteran business owners  succeed by studying the barriers they face, including lack of access to  capital and credit. It also helps ensure that veterans are aware of all  of the resources available to them through the Small Business  Administration.   I was fortunate enough to spend this past weekend on Veterans Day at  home in the district I represent in Kansas. I was meeting the brave men  and women who have served our country and was hearing about the issues  and opportunities that they have.   After everything our veterans have done for us, we must have their  backs. They deserve nothing less than access to jobs, healthcare, and  the services that they deserve.   That includes the ability to start and grow a small business.  Veterans possess many of the leadership and entrepreneurial skills to  start and grow small businesses, but they face unique challenges,  including difficulty accessing capital and credit.   Since it is tough to accumulate the type of credit needed to start a  business during your time in service, those issues are exactly what the  SERV Act is intending to address. The SERV Act requires a report from  the Comptroller General of the United States on the ability of veteran  and reservist small business owners to access credit.    The report will include new information and analysis on the sources  of credit that veterans and other reservists use to start and maintain  their businesses, as well as how deployment and other military  responsibilities affect a veteran's and reservist's credit.   Studying the problem of access to credit for veterans and reservists  is a crucial first step in finding the right solutions. This  legislation also helps connect veterans to existing programs in the  Small Business Administration that are aimed at helping veterans  transition their military skills from service to business, like Veteran  Business Outreach Centers, Boots to Business, or the Service-Disabled  Entrepreneurship Development Training.   These programs provide vital resources for veterans, but they are  only useful if veterans know about them. Without understanding the  programs, veterans are not going to be able to access them.   That is why the SERV Act requires the Interagency Task Force on  Veterans Small Business Development to develop a plan for outreach and  promotion of these incredible programs.   The task force is responsible for coordinating Federal efforts to  improve capital access, business development, and contracting  opportunities for veteran and service-disabled small businesses. But  the task force has not submitted a report to Congress since 2015. That  is why the SERV Act would require an annual report to Congress on its  appointments and to outline its plan for outreach on the many programs  available to veterans, service-disabled veterans, reservists, and their  spouses.   I urge all of my colleagues to support the SERV Act and help set our  veteran entrepreneurs up for success.                                time  1330
