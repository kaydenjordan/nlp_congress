 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, on Saturday, millions of Americans around the Nation  [[Page H640]]  spoke with a collective voice, opposing President Trump's plans to  trample women's rights. Yet here we are, the first week of the new  administration, voting on a bill to scale back women's health benefits.   Let's be clear: this bill is not about preventing Federal funds from  going to abortions. Sadly, current law already prevents that. In  reality, this bill would affect millions of women who purchase coverage  with their own money. It will make it nearly impossible for insurance  providers to offer plans fully covering women's reproductive health. It  would harm low-income women who need access to an abortion, turning  back the clock on women's reproductive rights.   It is day five of the Trump Presidency and women are already being  attacked at every corner. I promise my colleagues this: the American  people are watching. They will remember this vote.   Vote ``no'' on this bill.
