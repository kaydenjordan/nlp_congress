 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to  commemorate two Medal of Honor recipients who passed away last month.  Every Medal of Honor recipient has served his country with  extraordinary valor and with little or no regard for his own life and  safety.   Air Force Col. Joe Jackson and Army LTC Charles Kettles were no  exceptions. They were both pilots and both served honorably in the  Vietnam war. Both were responsible for extraordinary rescue missions of  American soldiers trapped deep behind enemy lines against incredible  odds. These two men were patriots who by chance, skill, and strength of  character became true American heroes. They are gone now, but their  legacies and examples will always live on. It is up to us to learn from  them.   Col. Joe Jackson passed away on January 12 at the age of 95.   Jackson enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1941, serving as a gunnery  instructor for the duration of World War  [[Page S1529]]  II. But he may never have been a pilot--may never have been a hero--if  not for a chance event in that war.   One of his friends, a flight engineer, fell ill right before a B-25  bomber flight. Jackson agreed to take his place. During the flight, one  of the engines caught fire. The pilot didn't know what to do, but  Jackson did. His timely instructions helped extinguish the fire,  possibly saving the aircraft. Emboldened by this incident, Jackson  decided to become a pilot--and he did, flying 107 missions as an F-84  Thunderjet pilot during the Korean war and becoming one of the very  first pilots of the U-2 spy plane.   That in itself would be a pretty distinguished career of honorable  service, but Joe Jackson returned for more, decades later. At the age  of 45 he answered the call of service once again, volunteering with the  Air Force's 311th Air Commando Squadron to fly cargo planes in Vietnam.  It is not often a cargo pilot gets a chance to distinguish himself in  combat, but it was in that very role that Joe Jackson earned the  Nation's highest honor.   May 12, 1968, was supposed to be a routine cargo mission for Joe  Jackson and the crew of his C-123. That all changed when the American  special forces camp at Kham Duc was attacked by the North Vietnamese.  As the Viet Cong overran the camp and established firing positions just  off the landing strip, an emergency evacuation began of the much  smaller American contingent.   The evacuation quickly turned into a turkey shoot. Eight aircraft and  helicopters were shot down or destroyed on the runway during the  desperate evacuation of Kham Duc. In a horrible tragedy, one cargo  plane was shot down by North Vietnamese forces shortly after takeoff.  All aboard the aircraft perished--the American air crew, plus some 150  South Vietnamese civilians. Eventually, the airlift succeeded in  evacuating nearly all of the camp's survivors. But as the last  scheduled plane left the runway and the order was given to bomb the  remainder of the camp, a horrible discovery was made: Three American  soldiers had accidentally been left on the ground. Joe Jackson's plane  was the closest to the area, so he made a split-second decision.  ``We're going in,'' he said.   The C-123 cargo plane was not known for its agility, but Joe Jackson  tested its limits as an aircraft. He banked the plane into a  breathtaking turn and descent, dropping 9,000 feet to the runway in a  matter of seconds. The plane instantly drew fire from the enemy,  including an anti-armor rocket that crashed just shy of the aircraft  but, providentially, did not detonate. The three beleaguered soldiers  boarded Joe Jackson's aircraft, and he gunned it, lifting them to  safety.   That terrible assault on Kham Duc exacted a high toll in American  lives. But thanks to Joe Jackson's quick wits and skillful flying, that  toll was much lower.   Joe Jackson remained in the Air Force until 1974, when he retired as  a full colonel. He taught at the Air Force Air War College so that  future pilots could learn from his example. Then he worked for Boeing,  helping that great company build airplanes for use in peacetime, not  just wartime. He ultimately settled in Kent, WA, with Rosamund, his  wife, to whom he was married for 74 years and with whom he had two  children.   Joe Jackson was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Lyndon  Johnson in January of 1969. He later described the heavy burden that  recipients of that honor must shoulder. He said:         I have to represent the thousands of Americans who have       served the country. You have to make them proud of what you       have done and what they have done.    As a former soldier and as an American, let me state that there can  be no finer representative of courage under fire than Joe Jackson. May  he rest in peace.   LTC Charles Kettles passed away on January 21 at the age of 89.   Kettles was a helicopter pilot with the Army's 176th Assault  Helicopter Company, 14th Combat Aviation Battalion, Task Force Oregon.   Flying was in Kettles' blood. He was born in Ypsilanti, MI, to a  father who had flown for the Canadian Royal Air Force in World War I  and later for the U.S. Army Air Corps in World War II.   Kettles was drafted in 1951, which began a whirlwind of Active Duty  tours in Korea, Japan, and Thailand. He returned to the armed services  in 1963, volunteering as a pilot. That is one thing to note about  Charles Kettles. He was always willing to volunteer for dangerous  assignments. Vietnam would give him many opportunities to volunteer.   On May 15, 1967, then-Major Kettles volunteered to lead a flight of  six Hueys to reinforce the brigade of the 101st Airborne Division that  had been ambushed by a battalion of North Vietnamese.   The situation was pretty hairy. It pitted Americans against hundreds  of the VC, and the Americans were taking heavy fire. Worse still, they  were trapped in little cover in what was called ``Chump Valley,'' so  nicknamed because only a chump would go there.   Major Kettles and his team landed under heavy fire from the enemy.  One of the aviators later recalled that the tracers were ``like rain .  . . coming straight out of the wood line.'' So intense was the enemy  fire that several Americans were killed as they approached the  evacuation zone. Nevertheless, Major Kettles stayed until  reinforcements were offloaded and wounded soldiers were brought on  board.   After that insertion, Major Kettles returned to the battlefield a  second time when his helicopter was raked front to back by machine-gun  fire. Mechanics later counted 40 holes in his Huey. Major Kettles'  gunner was seriously wounded in this trip, but Kettles piloted his  aircraft, limping back to base streaming fuel.   Those two flights would be a full day's work and then some for any  aviator, but Major Kettles wasn't done yet.   Later that day, with the situation in the valley growing yet more  desperate, Kettles volunteered for a third time to evacuate the  remaining 44 soldiers. So dangerous was the situation that Kettles was  ordered to stand down. However, he disobeyed that order.   Kettles led six helicopters on a third landing as fiercely contested  by the enemy as the previous two. Soon the last helicopter reported all  personnel were evacuated off the ground, and the helicopters evacuated  the area. The all clear had been given too soon; a small group of  American soldiers who were bravely fighting a rearguard action had been  left behind.   One of those soldiers later recalled the feeling when he saw the  helicopters disappear over the jungle canopy: ``If it's possible for  your heart to fall into your boots, that's what mine did.''   There were now eight Americans stranded in Chump Valley against  hundreds of Viet Cong. Those are long odds even for the Screaming  Eagles of the 101st.   So for the fourth time that day--the fourth time--in a split-second  decision, Kettles turned around his aircraft to land in a hot LZ. This  time he returned alone with no gunship support.   When he landed, a mortar exploded near the front of his aircraft,  blowing out his Huey's chin bubble, windshields, tail boom, and rotor.  His helicopter returned with 40 holes and was 600 pounds overweight  because all eight American soldiers were onboard. They all attribute  their survival to his brave actions.   Kettles was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his  extraordinary courage and self-sacrifice, but he wasn't immediately  awarded the Medal of Honor. There is one thing Charles Kettles wouldn't  volunteer for--the spotlight. He accepted the Distinguished Service  Cross and moved on with his life, retiring from the military in 1978  after another tour in Vietnam.    Kettles moved back to Michigan, where he taught aviation management  at Eastern Michigan University and worked for Chrysler Pentastar  Aviation. He married twice and had nine children, who survive him,  along with his wife Ann.   That is how the Kettles' story may have ended if not for a local  historian who persuaded Congress and the Army to reopen the file. When  they did, it became apparent to all that he deserved the Nation's  highest honor. Charles Kettles was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2016  at the young age of 86. Kettles did what he could to downplay his role  in saving his comrades in arms. According to him, ``The bottom line of  the whole thing is simply that those 44 [soldiers] did get out of there  and are  [[Page S1530]]  not a statistic on that wall in DC. The rest of it is rather  immaterial, frankly.''   Pardon me here if I disagree for once with Lieutenant Colonel  Kettles. It was due to his bravery that those 44 soldiers returned  alive and back to their families. On the battlefield, valor is hardly  immaterial; it is essential. Charles Kettles proved that on his four  volunteer rescue flights that fateful day.   May he rest in peace. May both of these great warriors rest in peace.   Madam President, I yield the floor.
