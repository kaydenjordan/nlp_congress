 Madam Speaker, I rise today to reemphasize  the urgent need for the U.S. Senate to pass the HEROES Act.   Communities across the country have been and continue to be ravaged  by the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. One $1,200  check is not enough to cover 3 months of expenses for millions of out- of-work Americans, and many families are still missing a check.   Millions of Americans are behind on rent and unable to pay their  bills, worried they may be evicted from their homes. Frontline workers  are risking their lives and the lives of their loved ones to ensure  that our communities and our people can continue to thrive.   The coronavirus is resurging across the country, and this  administration is shutting down Federal testing sites in impacted  communities.   The HEROES Act will provide payments to families, create a national  moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, provide hazard pay for  frontline workers, and provide billions for testing and contact  tracing.   While Americans suffer from this crisis, the leadership on the Senate  side sits behind his desk, refusing to hold votes on a bill that will  provide support and relief for millions of Americans in need.   Madam Speaker, it is time for Senator McConnell to lead with empathy  and pass this legislation.   As a representative of one of the hardest hit communities by the  [[Page H3045]]  coronavirus, I know, now more than ever, we must pass this landmark  bill into law, and do it now.                            ____________________
