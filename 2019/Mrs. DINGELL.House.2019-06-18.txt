Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3253.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3253, the Empowering  Beneficiaries, Ensuring Access, and Strengthening Accountability Act of  2019.   This Saturday, June 22, marks the 20th anniversary of the landmark  Supreme Court decision in Olmstead, which held that people with  disabilities must receive services in the most community-integrated  setting possible. It is fitting that, today, the House of  Representatives will pass legislation that helps advance the promise of  Olmstead by ensuring that there are programs in place to help people  transition to and live in the community with their families and  friends, while keeping them safe from abuse and neglect.   It also ensures people will continue to be able to receive mental  health and substance use disorder treatment when they need it the most,  and, finally, it makes commonsense improvements to ensure that drug  companies pay their fair share in rebates to the Medicaid program.   I am proud to say that this bill provides much-needed funding to  support the highly successful Money Follows the Person program, while  making important program improvements that will help the program better  serve the people it is intended to help.  [[Page H4708]]    Money Follows the Person helps ensure that seniors and people with  disabilities are able to live in their homes and in their communities.  It provides States with vital funding and supports to ensure that they  continue to help people move out of institutions.   Earlier this year, I held a roundtable discussion in my district with  patients, providers, and advocates to talk about the challenges we face  in providing long-term care in this country. Every participant  supported reauthorizing Money Follows the Person because it makes it  easier for people to get care in the setting of their choice. By  passing this bill today, we are giving hope to those who need it.   I want to thank my friend and colleague, Representative Guthrie, for  his commitment to this program and his leadership on this issue. It has  been an honor to work with him on it.   Next, this legislation ensures that partners of people receiving home  and community-based services will have the resources they need to meet  their living expenses. Without this important protection, married  beneficiaries would face the awful choice between impoverishing the  spouse or entering an institution. I am proud that we will be able to  further extend this protection.   I also want to thank my friend on the other side of the aisle, my  fellow Michigander, Fred Upton, for his continued leadership and  support on this issue.   H.R. 3253 also ensures that people receiving home and community-based  services receive the same protections from abuse and neglect as people  in nursing facilities. By allowing Medicaid Fraud Control Units to  investigate home and community-based services providers as well as  nursing facilities, this bill extends an important protection to some  of our most vulnerable populations.   This bipartisan bill would not have been possible without the  leadership of Representatives Welch and Walberg, and I want to thank  them for their hard work to protect Medicaid beneficiaries from abuse.   This bill also extends the promising Excellence in Mental Health  demonstration for an additional 2 years. As we continue to struggle  through the opioid epidemic, this program ensures that people with  substance use disorder and mental health issues can receive critical  treatment when they need it the most. The early results of the  demonstration have been promising, and this extension will allow States  to build on that success.   I want to thank Representatives Matsui and Mullin for their ongoing  support of this program.   Finally, this legislation adopts a commonsense proposal to ensure  drug companies pay their fair share in Medicaid rebates. It will help  provide additional funds to State Medicaid programs that are struggling  to pay for increasingly expensive prescription drugs.   I want to thank Representatives Kennedy and Jason Smith for their  leadership on this issue.   I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 3253, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to echo the words of my  colleague, Mr. Guthrie, and thank all of those who helped bring this  bill to the floor today. I give particular thanks to Chairman Pallone  and Ranking Member Walden for their leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 3253.   As a caregiver, I have met so many people in the last few years who  are desperate and scared and who need us to care. This bill does that.  I hope the House today will show this country we can act bipartisanly,  giving hope.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, our servicemen and -women suffer from arthritis at  disproportionally high rates compared to the civilian population.  Arthritis is the leading cause of disability among our veterans and the  second leading cause of medical discharge among members of the Army.  However, there is currently no dedicated funding for researching  arthritis among our servicemembers and veterans.   This bipartisan amendment, which my friend from West Virginia,  Congressman McKinley, and I have worked on as co-chairs of the  Congressional Arthritis Caucus, would provide dedicated funding for  arthritis research in the military.   Establishing this line of funding within the CDMRP will help improve  our understanding of arthritis in the military. While some CDMRP money  is already used to research arthritis, this funding can fluctuate from  year to year and is not specified in statute. Our researchers need  stable, consistent funding in order to complete the long-term studies  needed to better understand this disease.   I am proud that our amendment is supported by over 20 veterans  service organizations.   I thank Chairman Visclosky for his consideration of this proposal and  for his commitment to continue working with us on future appropriations  bills to include arthritis research. With this commitment, we are  prepared to withdraw the amendment.   Madam Chair, I withdraw my amendment.
