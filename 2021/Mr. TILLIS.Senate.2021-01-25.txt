 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to  Garland Shepheard, who retired as the North Carolina House sergeant-in- arms at the beginning of the year. Mr. Shepheard is a proud North  Carolinian who was committed to keeping North Carolina legislators  safe.   Garland Shepheard is a lifelong resident of Tarboro, NC, where he  resides with his wife Betty Jo. Mr. Shepheard was successful car  salesman and additionally served as Edgecombe County Republican Party  chairman. He also served two terms on the Tarboro Town Council and has  contributed a lifetime of service to his community.   Before representing North Carolina in the U.S. Senate, I had the  pleasure of interacting with Mr. Shepheard serving as North Carolina  speaker of the house. Widely known for his brightly colored jackets and  distinct Eastern North Carolina accent, Garland was loved by members  from both sides of the aisle.   As the U.S. Senator from North Carolina, I am grateful for Garland's  service to our State and Nation. I hope he enjoys his much-deserved  retirement back in Eastern North Carolina, and we will never forget his  commitment to keeping North Carolinians safe.                            ____________________
