 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the Jacob  Leinenkugel Brewing Company on their 150th anniversary. I am so pleased  to honor this great Wisconsin company.   Throughout its history, family has always been at the core of the  Leinenkugel business. The family's brewing tradition began well before  they came to America. Jacob's father, Mathais, was a brewer and  brandymaker from Meckenheim, Germany, who settled with his family in  Sauk City, WI. Mathais passed his craft on to his four sons who, in  turn, opened their own breweries throughout Wisconsin. Their passion  for brewing quality beer remains at the heart of the Leinenkugel family  150 years later.   While it is now the fourth-largest craft brewer in the United States,  the nascent company had only two employees: Jacob Leinenkugel and his  partner, John Miller. Jacob brewed the beer, and John delivered it.  Their German brewing methods, combined with excellent grains grown in  rich Wisconsin soil and the State's pure water, made Leinenkugel's  small brewery an instant success. The hard-working lumberjacks in the  logging town of Chippewa Falls were Jacob's first loyal customers. Word  of Leinenkugel's beer spread quickly, and its popularity expanded  rapidly throughout Northern Wisconsin.   When Jacob passed away in 1899, running the company fell to his son- in-law, Henry Casper, and then to his eldest son, Matt, in 1907.  Working alongside his sisters and brothers-in-law, the second  generation of Leinenkugel's leadership quickly took the company to new  heights.   The brewery experienced its first major test with the passage of  Prohibition in 1919. While many American breweries cut their losses and  closed shop during this period, Leinenkugel's adapted to the new  American reality and began brewing Leino, a nonalcoholic version of  their popular beer. Unfortunately, Leino was no match for the real  thing and was soon discontinued. Thanks to quick thinking, they pivoted  once again and began bottling soda water. By the end of Prohibition,  Leinenkugel's was the largest bottler of soda water in the area.   After the repeal of Prohibition, Matt Leinkugel's wife, Katherine,  and his sister, Rose, mortgaged their homes to finance updates to the  brewery's equipment to save the company. Thanks to the resourcefulness  of these women, the Leinenkugel family was able to restore the brewery  to its pre-Prohibition glory. Leinenkugel's expanded yet again in the  mid-20th century to the greater Midwest area and developed new  varieties of beer that would meet the diverse needs of its newest  customers.   In 1988, the Miller Brewing Company purchased Leinenkugel's, allowing  the brewery to distribute products across the country. Today the  brewery is an industry leader that produces 25 different styles of  beer. For every 10 shandy-style beers consumed in the United States,  nine are produced by Leinenkugel's.   Despite their national success, the Leinenkugels have never forgotten  their Wisconsin roots or their commitment to their hometown of Chippewa  Falls, WI. Jake Leinenkugel, who led the company until his retirement  in 2015, said he and his wife, Peg, will always live in Chippewa Falls.  The couple was named ``Chippewa Valley Philanthropists of the Year'' in  2007 for their ongoing contributions of time and money to local causes.   The Leinenkugel family has also maintained a strong commitment to the  conservation of natural resources, particularly the freshwater that is  a key component in Leinenkugel's products. The family created Canoes  for a Cause, a stewardship program aimed at preserving waterways by  removing trash, debris, and invasive plant species. They have held  Canoes for a Cause events in Milwaukee, Madison, Chicago, Denver,  Minneapolis, and Cleveland, often collecting more than 1,000 pounds of  trash in a single day.   Today, C.J., Ellie, Matt, and Kirk Leinenkugel carry on the  Leinenkugel's legacy. They are the sixth generation of Leinenkugels to  continue Jacob's tradition of excellence, taking a small, local brewery  and turning it into one of the most successful breweries in the Nation.  No matter how many employees or distributors join the team,  Leinenkugel's will always remain a family company that, to its core,  defines what it means to be kind, hard-working Wisconsinites and  genuine Americans.                            ____________________
