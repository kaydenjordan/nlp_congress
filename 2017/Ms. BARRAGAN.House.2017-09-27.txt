 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to sign  the discharge petition to force a vote on the Dream Act. I believe this  legislation would pass today if the Speaker would put it to a vote.   Survey after survey confirms that a vast majority of Americans  support DREAMers and believe they should be allowed to stay in the  United States, the only country they have known since childhood.   Let's be clear: DREAMers' lives are not bargaining chips, DREAMers'  future is not a real estate deal. DREAMers have started businesses,  they have bought homes, they have mentored high school students, they  have found work in nonprofits.   They give back to their community every day. They are teachers, they  are nurses and doctors, they are our neighbors, our friends, and, for  some of us like me, they are family.   Failing to extend legal protections for DREAMers would be a historic  betrayal, a permanent stain on our country. If you have yet to sign the  discharge petition, I urge my colleagues to do so now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today because there are nearly a  million young men and women known as DREAMers who are depending on  Congress to take action to protect them so they are not deported.   DREAMers were brought to this country as children. Many barely  remember their birth country. They are our teachers, our nurses, and  our doctors. They are our neighbors, our friends, and for some of us,  like me, they are our family.   They also contribute to our economy. The Los Angeles Area Chamber of  Commerce estimates that DREAMers in Los Angeles County alone contribute  $5.5 billion annually to California's economy. Across the country,  DREAMers would add billions to GDP over the next decade.   Americans overwhelmingly want Congress to take action, and the vast  majority of Members would support legislation to protect DREAMers.   Let's not wait another moment. Let's bring the Dream Act to the floor  for a vote so that we can protect these young men and women. I urge a  ``no'' vote on the previous question so we can bring the Dream Act to  the floor.
