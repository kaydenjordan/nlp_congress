 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th  anniversary of the Richmond Municipal Building in Richmond, Indiana.   This week, Richmond has the honor of hosting the Indiana Conference  of Mayors, where over 70 hometown leaders from across the State will  come together to share ideas on how to better serve Hoosiers in their  communities.   The city has so much to be proud of, and this occasion will give them  an opportunity to showcase their hard work. From upgrades to Veterans  Park to connectivity projects throughout the Depot District, Richmond  is an all-American city with a small town charm.   I want to congratulate the president of the Indiana Conference of  Mayors, Mayor Dave Snow of Richmond, for his hard work on behalf of all  Hoosiers.                            ____________________
