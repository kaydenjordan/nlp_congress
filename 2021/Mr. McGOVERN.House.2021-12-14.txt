 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  [[Page H7654]]  call up House Resolution 849 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 849         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 5665) to       establish in the Department of State the Office to Monitor       and Combat Islamophobia, and for other purposes. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived. In       lieu of the amendments recommended by the Committee on       Foreign Affairs now printed in the bill, an amendment in the       nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules       Committee Print 117-23, modified by the amendment printed in       the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs       or their respective designees; and (2) one motion to       recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time  as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time  yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, today, the Committee on Rules met and  reported a rule which would provide for the consideration of H.R. 5665,  the Combating International Islamophobia Act, under a closed rule.   It provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.  It self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairman Meeks and provides  for one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today at a time when anti-Muslim hatred has  risen to epidemic proportions. That is not my opinion; that is  according to the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Religious Freedom and  Belief.   Epidemic proportions, we see it all around the world: in China, as  the government there commits atrocities against the Uyghurs; in Sri  Lanka, where its President silences dissenting voices; in India, as  government-led crackdowns leave entire neighborhoods virtually empty;  in Hungary, where anti-Muslim sentiment continues to build.  Unfortunately, I could go on, all around the globe.   Mr. Speaker, this isn't about the actions or misguided beliefs of a  few. The U.N. Human Rights Council has found that an average of 37  percent of the population in Europe held unfavorable views of Muslims.  We are talking about millions of people and a rising tide of hostility,  violence, and discrimination that we, the Government of the United  States, must call out and condemn. To stand firmly and loudly for human  rights demands nothing less.   Mr. Speaker, I am also proud to announce today that we have reached a  bipartisan, bicameral agreement on the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention  Act that will allow us to move quickly to get this bill through  Congress and to the President because this isn't a partisan issue. It  is a human rights issue, and America must lead.   Mr. Speaker, just as we hold other nations to account, we must hold  ourselves to account as well because the United States is not immune to  these trends. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has documented  over 500 complaints of anti-Muslim bias nationwide in just the first  half of this year. That includes things like hate crimes, harassment,  school bullying, and antimosque violence.   Sadly, this uptick is part of a larger trend. A poll conducted by the  AP and released this year ahead of the anniversary of 9/11 found that  53 percent of Americans have unfavorable views toward Islam. This is  the reality of what is happening in America today.   Mr. Speaker, to be honest, we have even heard disturbing rhetoric  from some right here in this institution. A Member of this House has  told a completely fabricated story again and again that implies a  Muslim colleague is a terrorist just because they are Muslim.   It may have rolled off her tongue like some kind of laugh line, but  this is a deadly serious matter because it led to our colleague,  Representative Omar, who has already been the victim of years of anti- Muslim bias, receiving even more heinous voice mails and even death  threats. One man went so far as to tell her: ``There's plenty that will  love the opportunity to take you off the face of this'' blanking Earth.   Mr. Speaker, I hesitated to even quote that here on the floor, but we  all must understand the gravity of what we are dealing with. To hear a  Member of this Congress say those things, is there no bottom anymore?  Have things sunk that low?   Two decades ago, it was a Republican President, George W. Bush, who  told the world: ``America treasures the relationship we have with our  many Muslim friends, and we respect the vibrant faith of Islam, which  inspires countless individuals to lead lives of honesty, integrity, and  morality.''   Today, it is a Republican Congressperson who made headlines for  comments that disrespect not only Congresswoman Omar and fellow Muslim  Members but is a stain on this entire institution. And virtually the  entire Republican Conference has said nothing.   Mr. Speaker, what on Earth has the Republican Party become?   I think this House is better than the worst actions of a few here,  and I think the Government of the United States can still stand for  human rights here and around the globe. This rule and the underlying  resolution is our chance to show it.   Let's pass this measure so we can bring the full weight of our Nation  in encouraging other nations to also confront and condemn the growing  stain of Islamophobia.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for my friend from Pennsylvania,  but I want to provide a little bit of a history lesson on the Uyghur  Forced Labor Prevention Act.   We actually passed that bill a year ago in the last Congress, and the  Republican Senate and President Trump killed it. I didn't hear a peep  out of any of my Republican colleagues urging that the Senate take the  bill up then.   Last week, the House passed by an overwhelming vote--only one  Republican voted ``no''--my bill on the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention  Act.   By the way, it is a stronger bill than the one that was passed in the  Senate. Senator Rubio and I have come to an agreement on reconciling  the differences. That bill will be voted on, perhaps even as early as  today, and be sent over to the Senate, where I think they will take  quick action on it and send it to the President's desk for signature.   That is real. That is the strongest bill to deal with the horrific  treatment by the Chinese Government of the Uyghurs that has ever gone  to any President's desk. I am proud of the bipartisan support for the  bill in the House and the Senate. Let's not politicize an issue that I  think we have come together on. My hope is it will be done today.   The bill that is before us is very similar to the bill that was  passed in a previous Congress to create a post to deal with anti- Semitism in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge my Republican friends, who I hope share our  view, that anti-Semitism is intolerable wherever it may exist, and we  need to do more to combat it. Please call your friends in the  Republican Senate to stop holding up President Biden's nominee for  special envoy.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a CNN story, ``Senate Democrats  Say Republicans Are Holding Up Nomination For Anti-Semitism Post.''                          [From CNN, Dec. 8, 2021]    Senate Democrats Say Republicans Are Holding Up Nomination for Anti-                              Semitism Post                             (By Jessica Dean)         (CNN) Democrats in Congress told CNN that GOP senators are       continuing to hold up the nomination of the woman President       Joe Biden tapped to become the next US Envoy to Combat and       Monitor Antisemitism, five months after she was nominated.        Biden nominated Deborah Lipstadt, an Emory professor of       Modern Jewish History and Holocaust Studies, on July 30.       Lipstadt has thus far not even been offered a hearing by the       Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Lipstadt has previously       worked with both Democratic and Republican administrations       and enjoys strong support from a wide range of Jewish groups.        ``Our Republican colleagues have refused to give her a       hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations committee,''       Committee Chairman Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey,       told CNN. Typically both Democratic and Republican members of       the committee agree to have a hearing for a nominee.        Menendez said they're approaching a time when he may go       against tradition to bypass the committee and move to       discharge Lipstadt's nomination straight to the Senate floor       where Democrats hold the majority.        Republicans denied that they were stalling the confirmation       process.        ``I wouldn't say we're holding it up,'' said Republican       Sen. Jim Risch, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign       Relations Committee, adding they are waiting on additional       materials from Lipstadt. An aide said they had spoken with       Lipstadt on Tuesday.        When asked if he thinks they will ultimately give Lipstadt       a hearing, Risch replied, ``I think so'' but offered no       timeline.        What's the hold up?        Risch said there has been some concern from members over       Lipstadt's previous tweets.        In one tweet from March 14, Lipstadt reacted to comments       from Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who sits on       the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, writing, ``This is       white supremacy/nationalism. Pure and simple.''        Lipstadt was referring to Johnson's comments that he might       have been concerned for his well-being during the January 6       attack had the protestors been affiliated with Black Lives       Matter instead of being a largely white, pro-Trump crowd.        When asked about Lipstadt's nomination and the tweet,       Johnson said, ``I feel like we have so many nominations       floating around right now, I really can't comment at this       point.''        Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who is also a       member of the committee, said he was not familiar with       Lipstadt's nomination.        ``I am not sure I have reviewed that nomination yet. To be       frank, it doesn't ring a bell,'' Rubio told CNN.        ``I want to make sure that whoever is there is someone we       can count on to be heard around the world and whatever they       have said in the past won't undermine their ability to do       their job,'' Rubio said. ``But I just don't want to comment       on a nomination that I haven't fully reviewed yet.''        Menendez said there was nothing in her background that       should be a problem.        ``If calling out anti-Semitism in the past is somehow an       obstacle to this nomination, and that would be an amazing set       of circumstances, because that's what we want this person to       do,'' he said.        Strong support from the Jewish community        In a rare joint statement, the Anti-Defamation League, the       Jewish Federations of North America, and the Union of       Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America sent a letter to       Senate Foreign Relations Committee on November 4 urging its       members to act.        ``There is no question that Prof. Lipstadt has the       credentials to deserve a proper hearing before the Committee       on Foreign Relations--and that hearing is now overdue,'' the       letter read.        The unified support of Jewish groups is important to note.        ``To find this level of agreement about someone on such a       contentious issue as anti-Semitism is rare,'' Yair Rosenberg,       a writer who covers anti-Semitism for The Atlantic, told CNN       in an interview.        ``And it's very rare to see that and it's rare to see       people then say, 'Well, we don't care what all these Jewish       groups think,''' Rosenberg said.        In an attempt to move the nomination along, a number of       House Democrats who sit on the House Bipartisan Task Force       for Combating Anti-Semitism--led by Reps. Kathy Manning of       North Carolina and Ted Deutch of Florida--wrote a letter to       Menendez and Risch pressing them for a hearing for Lipstadt.        ``In recent months, we have witnessed growing threats       against Jewish communities in our own country and       worldwide,'' the group wrote. ``We believe it is vital to       have a Special Envoy in place to confront these  [[Page H7656]]       threats and ensure that the United States continues to lead       the world in the fight against antisemitism.''        Rosenberg told CNN the stalled nomination is ``a much       broader effort to stall Biden's nominees and prevent their       confirmations.''        ``It's typical partisan warfare, but this time, it's not a       victimless crime, right? There's the nominees themselves, and       then in this case, there's Jewish communities abroad that are       protected by the antiSemitism envoy position. And right now       that office is short-stringed because the Republicans will       not move forward on this confirmation.''     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).  [[Page H7657]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are considering the Combating International  Islamophobia Act right now, and my good friend from Pennsylvania in the  very beginning made reference to the fact that Republicans are all  united in condemning hate, prejudice, and bigotry wherever it exists.  But I just want to point out why this bill is so important. It is  because the last Republican President who we had, unfortunately, it was  like gasoline on a fire in terms of promoting Islamophobia.   In 2015, Donald Trump said that he would look at closing mosques in  the United States. That same year he was open to the idea of creating a  database of all U.S. Muslims. As President, he instituted a Muslim ban.  So that is the Republican Party's recent history in terms of combating  Islamophobia. Instead of combating it, he, again, threw gasoline on the  fire and fanned the flames.   So the reason why this is important is so that we can show the world  that that is not who we are and that we reject bigotry, hatred,  discrimination, and prejudice wherever it exists. The statistics are  clear: we see a rising tide of Islamophobia all throughout the world.   This should not be controversial. This, quite frankly, should be a  suspension. That it has been politicized by some of my friends on the  other side of the aisle is unfortunate, but I hope that some of them  will at the end join with us in voting to pass it.   I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a September 7 Associated Press  article titled ``Two Decades After 9/11, Muslim Americans Still  Fighting Bias.''                          [From AP, Sept. 7, 2021]        Two Decades After 9/11, Muslim Americans Still Fighting Bias         New York (AP)--A car passed, the driver's window rolled       down and the man spat an epithet at two little girls wearing       their hijabs: ``Terrorist!''        It was 2001, mere weeks after the twin towers at the World       Trade Center fell, and 10-year-old Shahana Hanif and her       younger sister were walking to the local mosque from their       Brooklyn home.        Unsure, afraid, the girls ran.        As the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks       approaches, Hanif can still recall the shock of the moment,       her confusion over how anyone could look at her, a child, and       see a threat.        ``It's not a nice, kind word. It means violence, it means       dangerous. It is meant to shock whoever . . . is on the       receiving end of it,'' she says.        But the incident also spurred a determination to speak out       for herself and others that has helped get her to where she       is today: a community organizer strongly favored to win a       seat on the New York City Council in the upcoming municipal       election.        Like Hanif, other young American Muslims have grown up       under the shadow of 9/11. Many have faced hostility and       surveillance, mistrust and suspicion, questions about their       Muslim faith and doubts over their Americanness.        They've also found ways forward, ways to fight back against       bias, to organize, to craft nuanced personal narratives about       their identities. In the process, they've built bridges,       challenged stereotypes and carved out new spaces for       themselves.        There is ``this sense of being Muslim as a kind of       important identity marker, regardless of your relationship       with Islam as a faith,'' says Eman Abdelhadi, a sociologist       at The University of Chicago who studies Muslim communities.       ``That's been one of the main effects in people's lives . . .       it has shaped the ways the community has developed.''        A poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public       Affairs Research conducted ahead of the 9/11 anniversary       found that 53% of Americans have unfavorable views toward       Islam, compared with 42% who have favorable ones. This stands       in contrast to Americans' opinions about Christianity and       Judaism, for which most respondents expressed favorable       views.        Mistrust and suspicion of Muslims didn't start with 9/11,       but the attacks dramatically intensified those animosities.        Accustomed to being ignored or targeted by low-level       harassment, the country's wide-ranging and diverse Muslim       communities were foisted into the spotlight, says Youssef       Chouhoud, a political scientist at Christopher Newport       University in Virginia.        ``Your sense of who you were was becoming more formed, not       just Muslim but American Muslim,'' he says. ``What       distinguished you as an American Muslim? Could you be fully       both, or did you have to choose? There was a lot of grappling       with what that meant.''        In Hanif's case, there was no blueprint to navigate the       complexities of that time.        ``Fifth-grader me wasn't naive or too young to know Muslims       are in danger,'' she later wrote in an essay about the       aftermath of 9/11. ``. . . Flashing an American flag from our       first-floor windows didn't make me more American. Born in       Brooklyn didn't make me more American.''        A young Hanif gathered neighborhood friends, and an older       cousin helped them write a letter to then-President George W.       Bush asking for protection.        ``We knew,'' she says, ``that we would become like warriors       of this community.''        But being warriors often carries a price, with wounds that       linger.        Ishaq Pathan, 26, recalls the time a boy told him he seemed       angry and wondered if he was going to blow up their       Connecticut school.        He remembers the helplessness he felt when he was taken       aside at an airport for additional questioning upon returning       to the United States after a college semester in Morocco.        The agent looked through his belongings, including the       laptop where he kept a private journal, and started reading       it.        ``I remember being like, `Hey, do you have to read that?'''       Pathan says. The agent ``just looks at me like, `You know, I       can read anything on your computer. I'm entitled to anything       here.' And at that point, I remember having tears in my eyes.       I was completely and utterly powerless.''        Pathan couldn't accept it.        ``You go to school with other people of different       backgrounds and you realize . . . what the promise of the       United States is,'' he says. ``And when you see it not living       up to that promise, then I think it instills in us a sense of       wanting to help and fix that.''        He now works as the San Francisco Bay Area director for the       nonprofit Islamic Networks Group, where he hopes to help a       younger generation grow confident in their Muslim identity.        Pathan recently chatted with a group of boys about their       summer activities. At times, the boys ate watermelon or       played on a trampoline. At other moments, the talk turned       serious: What would they do if a student pretended to blow       himself up while yelling ``Allahu akbar,'' or ``God is       great?'' What can they do about stereotypical depictions of       Muslims on TV?        ``I had always viewed 9/11 as probably one of the most       pivotal moments of my life and of the lives of Americans       across the board,'' Pathan says. ``The aftermath of it . . .       is what pushed me to do what I do today.''        That aftermath has also helped motivate Shukri Olow to do       what she is doing--run for office.        Born in Somalia, Olow fled civil war with her family and       lived in refugee camps in Kenya for years before coming to       the United States when she was 10.        She found home in a vibrant public housing complex in the       city of Kent, south of Seattle. There, residents from       different countries communicated across language and cultural       barriers, borrowing salt from each other or watching one       another's kids. Olow felt she flourished in that environment.        Then 9/11 happened. She recalls feeling confused when a       teacher asked her, ``What are your people doing?'' But she       also remembers others who ``said that this isn't our fault .       . . and we need to make sure that you're safe.''        In a 2017 Pew Research Center survey of U.S. Muslims,       nearly half of respondents said they experienced at least one       instance of religious discrimination within the year before;       yet 49% said someone expressed support for them because of       their religion in the previous year.        Overwhelmingly, the study found respondents proud to be       both Muslim and American. For some, including Olow, there       were occasional identity crises growing up.        `` `Who am I?'--which I think is what many young people       kind of go through in life in general,'' she says. ``But for       those of us who live at the intersection of anti-Blackness       and Islamophobia . . . it was really hard.''        But her experiences from that time also helped form her       identity. She is now seeking a seat on the King County       Council.        ``There are many young people who have multiple identities       who have felt that they don't belong here, that they are not       welcomed here,'' she says. ``I was one of those young people.       And so, I try to do what I can to make sure that more of us       know that this is our nation, too.''        After 9/11, some American Muslims chose to dispel       misconceptions about their faith by building personal       connections. They shared coffee or broke bread with strangers       as they fielded myriad questions--from how Islam views women       and Jesus to how to combat extremism.        Mansoor Shams has traveled across the U.S. with a sign that       reads: ``I'm Muslim and a U.S. Marine, ask anything.'' It's       part of the 39-year-old's efforts to teach others about his       faith and counter hate through dialogue.        Shams, who served in the Marines from 2000 to 2004, was       called names like ``Taliban,'' ``terrorist'' and ``Osama bin       Laden'' by some of his fellow Marines after 9/11.        One of his most memorable interactions, he says, was at       Liberty University in Virginia, where he spoke in 2019 to       students of the Christian institution. Some, he says, still       call him with questions about Islam.        ``There's this mutual love and respect,'' he says.        Shams wishes his current work wasn't needed but feels a       responsibility to share a counternarrative he says many       Americans don't know.        Ahmed Ali Akbar, 33, came to a different conclusion.        Shortly after 9/11, some adults in his community arranged       for an assembly at his school in Saginaw, Michigan, where he       and other students talked about Islam and Muslims. Akbar       poured his heart into the research. But he recalls his       confusion at some of the questions: Where is bin Laden?       What's the reason behind the attacks?        ``How am I supposed to know where Osama bin Laden is? I'm       an American kid,'' he says.        That period left him feeling like trying to change people's       minds wasn't always effective, that some were not ready to       listen.        Akbar eventually turned his focus toward telling stories       about Muslim Americans on his podcast ``See Something Say       Something.''        ``There's a lot of humor in the Muslim American experience       as well,'' he says. ``It's not all just sadness and reaction       to the violence and . . . racism and Islamophobia.''        He has also come to believe in building connections of a       different type. ``Our battle for our civil liberties (is)       tied up with other marginalized communities,'' he says,       stressing the importance of advocating for them.        For some, 9/11 brought a different kind of racial       reckoning, says Debbie Almontaser, a Yemeni American educator       and activist in New York.        She says many Arab and South Asian immigrants came to the       U.S. seeking the American Dream as doctors, lawyers,       entrepreneurs. ``Then 9/11 happens and they realize that       they're brown and they realize that they're minorities--that       was a huge wake-up call,'' Almontaser says.  [[Page H7660]]         Some racial tensions play out today in U.S. Muslim       communities. The racial justice protests sparked by the       killing of George Floyd, for instance, brought many Muslims       to the streets to condemn racism. But they also spurred an       internal reckoning about racial equity among Muslims,       including the treatment of Black Muslims.        ``For me, as a Muslim African American, my struggle (in       America) is still with race and identity,'' says imam Ali       Aqeel of the Muslim American Cultural Center in Nashville,       Tennessee.        ``When we go to (Islamic) centers and we have to deal with       the same pain that we deal with out in the world, it's kind       of discouraging to us because we're under the impression that       (in) Islam, you don't have that racial and ethnic divide.''        Amirah Ahmed, 17, was born after the attacks and feels like       she was thrust into a struggle not of her making--a burden       despite being ``just as American as anyone else.''        She recalls how a few years ago at her Virginia school's 9/      11 commemoration, she felt students' stares at her and her       hijab so intensely that she wanted to skip the next year's       event.        When her mother dismissed the idea, she instead wore her       Americanness as a shield, donning an American flag headscarf       to address her classmates from a podium.        Ahmed spoke about honoring the lives of those who died in       America on 9/11--but also of Iraqis who died in the war       launched in 2003. She recalls defending her Arab and Muslim       identities that day while displaying her American one and       says it was a ``really powerful moment.''        But she hopes her future children don't feel the need to       prove they belong.        ``Our kids are going to be (here) well after the 9/11       era,'' she says. ``They should not have to continue fighting       for their identity.''     Mr. Speaker, a recent poll, as I mentioned earlier,  found that 53 percent of Americans, unfortunately, hold negative views  of Muslims--53 percent. Islamophobia isn't just a problem abroad. We  need to combat it here at home as well.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a December 9 report released by  the Department of Justice titled ``2020 Hate Crimes Statistics.''                        2020 Hate Crimes Statistics         In August 2021, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)       released Hate Crime Statistics 2020, an annual compilation of       bias-motivated incidents in the United States. Though the       number of reporting agencies decreased by 452 since 2019, the       overall number of reported incidents increased by 949,       contributing to a total of 8,263 hate crime incidents against       11,126 victims in 2020. While annual law enforcement agency       participation may fluctuate, the statistics indicate that       hate crimes remain a concern for communities across the       country.        According to this year's data, 62% of victims were targeted       because of the offenders' bias toward race/ethnicity/      ancestry, which continues to be the largest bias motivation       category. Participating agencies reported 5,227 race/      ethnicity/ancestry-based incidents in 2020, a 32% increase       from 2019. Anti-Black or African American hate crimes       continue to be the largest bias incident victim category,       with 2,871 incidents in 2020, a 49% increase since 2019.       Additionally, there were 279 anti-Asian incidents reported in       2020, a 77% increase since 2019. The other largest categories       of hate crimes include anti-Hispanic or Latino incidents,       with 517, and anti-White incidents, with 869 in total.        Incidents related to religion decreased 18% from 2019, with       1,244 total incidents reported. The largest category       included:        683 anti-Jewish incidents, down 28% since 2019;        110 anti-Muslim incidents, down 38%;        15 anti-Buddhist incidents, up 200%; and        89 anti-Sikh incidents, up 83%.        Incidents related to disability decreased 17% from 2019,       with 130 total incidents reported. By category:        Anti-mental disability incidents decreased by 29% since       2019, and        Anti-physical disability incidents increased by 8%.        Incidents related to gender and gender identity increased       since 2019 with increases in gender-related incidents by 9%       and gender identity-related incidents by 34%. There were:        50 anti-female incidents, a decrease of 4% since 2019;        25 anti-male incidents, an increase of 47%;        213 anti-transgender incidents, an increase of 41%; and        53 anti-gender non-conforming incidents, an increase of       13%.        See the Hate Crimes website for more highlights from the       data: https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/hate-crime-  statistics. The full data set can be found on the FBI's Crime       Data Explorer website at https://crime-data-      explorer.app.cloud.gov/pages/explorer/crime/hate-crime.        The FBI Hate Crime Statistics is an annual compilation of       bias-motivated incidents in the United States. For the       purpose of the report, a hate crime is defined as a criminal       offense which is motivated, in whole or in part, by the       offender's bias(es) against a person based on race,       ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation,       disability, gender, and gender identity. The 2020 data       provides information voluntarily submitted from 15,136 of       18,623 law enforcement agencies around the country on       offenses, victims, offenders, and locations of hate crimes.     Mr. Speaker, according to FBI statistics, in 2020 there  were 110 anti-Muslim incidents, and there were an additional 89 hate  crimes against Sikhs who are often wrongly identified as Muslim.   We know that hate crimes often go under-reported, so the actual  number is likely much higher, which is another reason I think passing  this bill is important.   I include in the Record a September 10 Business Insider article  titled ``House Republicans Mocked Ilhan Omar's Bill to Establish an  Envoy to Combat Islamophobia Worldwide.''                 [From the Business Insider, Dec. 10, 2021]    House Repubicans Mocked Ilhan Omar's Bill To Establish an Envoy To                       Combat Islamophobia Worldwide                              (Bryan Metzger)         In the wake of Rep. Lauren Boebert's Islamophobia comments       suggesting that Rep. Ilhan Omar was a suicide bomber, House       Republicans spent much of a Thursday hearing mocking a bill       put forth by the Muslim Minnesota congresswoman to combat       Islamophobia worldwide.        ``I have many Pennsylvania Dutch that feel that they're not       treated properly,'' said Rep. Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania,       sarcastically calling for their inclusion in Omar's       Islamophobia bill. ``How about those that are gay, you know,       the LGBTQ community? That should be part of this bill.''        ``Let's keep going, you know, there are people that are       overweight, and there are skinny kids that get picked on,''       Meuser added. ``Why aren't they included in this as well?''        Rep. Omar's bill, which she introduced in late October       alongside Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, would       require the State Department to establish a special envoy for       monitoring and combating Islamophobia and is modeled after a       similar position created in 2004 to combat anti-Semitism.        ``For over a decade we have seen increasing incidents of       violent Islamophobia both in the US and worldwide--from the       genocide of the Rohingya in Burma, and Uyghurs in China, to       the attacks on Muslim refugees in Canada and New Zealand,''       Rep. Schakowsky said at the time.        ``Hate crimes against American Muslims saw a 17% spike in       2017, when then-President Trump imposed a travel ban most       focused on majority-Muslim nations.        The bill ultimately passed the House Foreign Relations       Committee on Friday, with every Democrat voting in favor and       every Republican opposed, and is expected to head to a full       House vote on Tuesday. Democratic leadership is reportedly       considering a vote on the bill as way to respond to the       Boebert controversy, even as progressive lawmakers have       introduced a resolution to strip Boebert of her committees.        House Republican leaders, including Minority Leader Kevin       McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise, have declined to       forcefully condemn Boebert's Islamophobia rhetoric or take       any meaningful action against her.                         `Shameful and embarrassing'         On Thursday evening, Republicans used both proposed       amendments to Omar's bill and comments during the hearing to       mock both the bill and Omar herself, in addition to       downplaying Islamophobia.        Republican Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio, who accidentally       posted an image from an anti-Semitic website in 2017, said       that Omar's bill would ``trivialize'' anti-Semitism, given       the existence of another State Department post to combat that       form of bigotry. ``We should avoid such a dangerous false       equivalency at all costs, as it could be used by some       extremists to actually justify further anti-Semitic       activity,'' said Chabot.        ``If you ask 20 different people what Islamophobia means       today, especially in the Democratic Party, you're going to       get 20 different answers,'' said the Florida Republican.       ``And that answer is going to be what they decide best fits       their political narrative to go out there and attack you.''        And Republican Rep. Ken Buck of Ohio offered an amendment       to specify that it ``shall not be considered Islamophobia for       an individual to criticize a brother marrying a sister for       the purpose of committing immigration fraud in the United       States,'' an apparent reference to long-standing right-wing       conspiracy theories about the congresswoman.        As of publication time, the amendment was no longer       available on the House Foreign Relations Committee website       and was presumably withdrawn. Rep. Buck's office did not       respond to Insider's request for comment.        But other amendments by Buck, including one mentioning       female genital mutilation, remained online. Another amendment       offered by Republican Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania sought       to exclude ``any action (to include counter-terrorism       measures) taken by the Israeli Government'' from the bill.        In a statement to Insider, Omar condemned Republican       behavior during the hearing.        ``It is shameful and embarrassing that the Republican       Party's response to blatant Islamophobia and incitement of       violence is  [[Page H7661]]       to double down on anti-Muslim rhetoric,'' she said. ``Instead       of engaging in a good faith discussion on how to address the       rise of Islamophobic violence, Republicans engaged in ad       hominem attacks, belittled Muslims, and minimized the pain of       Muslim communities around the world.''        And Democrats on the committee sought to defend Omar's       bill.        ``One reason the United States is doing a diplomatic       boycott of the Olympics in China is because China's engaging       in a genocide of Muslims, of the Uyghurs, because of their       religion,'' said Rep. Ted Lieu of California. ``The Rohingya       in Burma were slaughtered because they were Muslims.''        He also called attention to Boebert's Islamophobic remarks.        ``We had a congressmember from the Republican Party joke       about a congressmember in the Democratic Party, that somehow       she was a terrorist simply because of a religion,'' Lieu       said. ``That's Islamophobia.''     Mr. Speaker, I don't know what the hell is going on in  some corners of the Republican Conference, but to have Republican  Members mock this bill, as they did during a recent committee hearing,  is disgusting. This is no laughing matter. In fact, it is a matter of  life and death.   We are talking about violence, death threats, bullying, desecrating  mosques, and worse. Instances like that just show why we need to pass  this bill.   Again, my Republican friends, as they do oftentimes when we have  important matters like this up, they want to talk about everything  except what is on the floor. But the reason why this is important is  because I think we should show the world that we speak with one voice;  that we are against hatred; that we are against bigotry; that we will  not stand by silently in the face of Islamophobia; that we want to be  an example, and we want to lead the rest of the world.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   You know, we face a lot of challenges in this country and, in large  part, we are still trying to come out of a pandemic that the previous  administration tried to ignore.  [[Page H7662]]    We actually have done some good things. We passed a major  infrastructure bill. In the previous administration we had  infrastructure week and infrastructure month, and a press conference,  but we actually passed a real infrastructure bill with bipartisan  support over in the Senate and a handful of Republicans here.   I say to the previous speaker, to suggest that the American people  don't care about Islamophobia, I think, is insulting. I mean, you say  that to the Muslim student being bullied in a classroom because of  their faith, or say that to a Muslim worshipper at a mosque that has  been attacked, or say that to a Muslim family that has been belittled  because of ignorances being promoted by some, including some in this  Chamber.   I mean, please, the American people are good and decent. They do not  want to accept prejudice and bigotry and hate and discrimination. They  expect better.   We heard some talk earlier about the Uyghurs, and we need to do more  for the Uyghurs, which we are doing, but I got a little whiplash saying  that we need to move faster to combat the atrocities against the Muslim  Uyghur population, but then on the other hand, we are told that nobody  cares. You can't have it both ways.   But to suggest that the American people are indifferent to prejudice  is something I won't accept.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the fact that the gentleman yielded the gentlewoman more  time because that made absolutely no sense to me.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say to the gentleman from Pennsylvania on  the Uyghur thing; let me repeat the history again so it is clear to  him. A year ago, we passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in  the House. It went over to the Senate. Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump  killed it. Nobody said a word.   The bill that passed last week that the gentleman was referring to is  my bill. The bill that we are going to take up later today is my bill  that we negotiated the differences between the House and Senate with  Senator Rubio. The gentleman will be happy to know that the bill that  we are passing today is stronger than the Senate-passed version. Maybe  he would prefer a weaker version because that is what a lot of  corporations that are very friendly to my Republican friends are now  lobbying very hard for: a watered-down bill.   So this bill is not watered down. It is a stronger bill than passed  the Senate. I would even like it to be stronger. But please, don't  politicize human rights in a way where I think, to be fair, my friend  is mischaracterizing what the history of this issue is. I don't take a  back seat to anybody when it comes to human rights or it comes to human  rights with regard to the Uyghurs. We have been fighting for this for a  long time and we finally have a Speaker of the House and a President of  the United States who will sign this bill when it gets there. And I  want to thank the leadership in the Senate. I want to thank Senator  Rubio. I want to thank Congressman Smith here in the House, Ranking  Member McCaul, and Chairman Meeks for their cooperation.   But we are moving a bill forward that has teeth, that is real, that  is tough. It is the strongest bill we have  [[Page H7663]]  ever passed on this. But please don't politicize it. I have been  working on this too long.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say again that this really shouldn't be  controversial at all, and I am sad that it is being politicized by some  of my friends on the other side of the aisle. We have heard one  objection after the next to this bill which condemns Islamophobia as if  somehow condemning Islamophobia is some sort of a radical idea.   I never thought I would yearn for the Republicanism of George W.  Bush. But maybe things have gotten so out of control in the Republican  Party today that Members cannot even stand here and publicly defend a  Muslim from bullying or worse. I pray that is not the case.   Some things are about more than petty partisanship and towing the  party line. This should be one of them.                                time  1400    We have kids being bullied in school, hate crimes on the rise,  mosques targeted for violence. That is just here in America. Around the  world, Muslims are being silenced from public discourse, forced into  detention camps, or disappeared altogether.   We are a Nation founded on the right to freedom of religion and  freedom of worship. It is a fundamental part of being the United States  of America. We must stand up and say that this is not right, the rise  in Islamaphobia that we see globally.   I want to recognize the leadership of Congresswoman Omar,  Congresswoman Schakowsky, and Chairman Meeks. They understand that this  is the right thing to do. It is the American thing to do. They have  worked tirelessly to get this bill to the House floor.   Now, we must get this bill over the finish line and on to the Senate  because even today, even in this highly partisan era, the United States  must and can still stand for human rights at home and abroad.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this rule  and the underlying legislation.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 849         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 6235) to provide for the development of a plan to       increase oil and gas production under oil and gas leases of       Federal lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of       Agriculture, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of the       Interior, and the Secretary of Defense in conjunction with a       drawdown of petroleum reserves from the Strategic Petroleum       Reserve. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; and (2) one       motion to recommit.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6235.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Meeks for  yielding me the time and for his leadership on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad that we are able to move this compromised  Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act so quickly after the House passed my  bill, H.R. 1155, last week. And I want to thank my partner in this  effort in the Senate, Senator Marco Rubio, for working quickly and  diligently with us to negotiate this agreement. I wanted to especially  thank Speaker Pelosi for her strong moral leadership in getting this  done. No one in this body--and I mean no one--has had a more consistent  and principled position in standing up for the human rights of the  people of China and Tibet. She has been a critical part of nearly every  single piece of China human rights legislation focused on China that  Congress has passed in recent years, and her steadfast commitment to  getting this bill across the finish line is why we are here today.   Forced labor is a serious human rights abuse. It is illegal under  United States law to import goods made with forced labor. But we are  compelled to move this legislation by the genocide and crimes against  humanity being committed by the Chinese Government against Uyghurs and  other Muslim minorities, of which forced labor is a key factor.   We must pass this legislation to give Americans the peace of mind  that the clothes they wear, the food they eat, and the technology that  they use are not tainted by forced labor perpetrated by the Chinese  Government.   This bill combines my legislation, which passed the House by a vote  of 428-1 last week, and Senator Rubio's bill, which passed by voice  vote, into a version that both Chambers can support. This is a strong,  bipartisan, bicameral consensus bill. This bill shortens the time the  forced labor import ban goes into effect to 180 days, from the Senate's  300 days.   It requires a strong, clear and convincing evidence standard for  exceptions to the rebuttable presumption.   It empowers the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force to devise and  oversee the strategy to prohibit the import of forced labor goods from  Xinjiang.   In short, this is a good bill. It is a tougher bill than what passed  the Senate, and I want to thank my House colleagues for this report.   I want to thank Chairman Meeks again. I want to thank Ranking Member  McCaul, Chairman Neal, and Chairwoman Waters for their work. I want to  thank Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey for all of his support.   On the Senate side, I want to thank Senators Rubio and Merkley for  their leadership. And, again, I want to thank Speaker Pelosi for her  strong and steadfast commitment to getting this done.   So let's stand up for human rights. Let's stand against genocide and  against crimes against humanity. And let's get the Uyghur Forced Labor  Prevention Act to the President's desk as soon as possible.
