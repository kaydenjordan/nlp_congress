 Mr. President, this Congress and this President have  delivered a historic series of achievements for the American people. We  took an ax to the redtape holding back our economy. We used the  Congressional Review Act a record 15 times to pave the way for job  creation. After years of broken promises to our veterans, we delivered  VA reform legislation to begin giving our heroes the more accessible  care, greater choice, and workforce training they deserve. We confirmed  outstanding judges to the Federal bench. We advanced efforts to address  the opioid crisis. And, of course, we passed the most significant tax  overhaul in a generation.   Already, tax reform is increasing take-home pay for American workers.  Already, businesses are investing more, expanding more, and creating  more good-paying jobs right here at home. Over the past year, we have  built a record of successes for middle-class families and a stronger,  safer country.   But among all the work that still remains, one critical piece of  unfinished business is now really close to the finish line. If we act  now, we can start rebuilding our military and provide our troops the  training and equipment they need to defend the homeland and protect the  American people.   The crisis in our military is acute. Just this week, headlines  revealed that two-thirds of the Navy's F/A-18 aircraft are not prepared  to fly. The fleet, which must secure sea lines of communication across  the globe and patrol the Persian Gulf and the South China Sea, has  shrunk to the smallest ship count in nearly three decades.   We have become too reliant on Special Operations forces and have  radically drawn down our conventional force structure.   This has not been lost on China or Russia. They are improving their  conventional forces and intimidating their neighbors. Our force faces a  complex collection of threats and challenges from Iran, China, Russia,  and North Korea to ISIL, al-Qaida, and their affiliates.   The need for our forward presence has not diminished in the Persian  Gulf or in the South China Sea and the wider Pacific, neither has our  responsibility to our NATO allies in Europe or to the Republic of  Korea. No, we have not asked our all-volunteer military to do any less  for our country. They have just been forced to make do with less.   And all of these short-term funding bills have handicapped our  military leaders' ability to make long-term plans and investments. In  December, the Navy Secretary said the inefficiencies from continuing  resolutions have cost his Department enough money to pay for an entire  squadron of fighter planes or two destroyers.   Let me say that again. The Secretary of the Navy said that the  inefficiencies from continuing resolutions have cost his Department  enough money to pay for an entire squadron of fighter planes or two  destroyers.   Here is how General Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  put it. He said: ``The U.S. military's competitive advantage against  potential adversaries is eroding.''   Yesterday, I announced a bipartisan budget agreement that will  finally bring this to a close. The agreement will allow for the funding  levels recommended by the NDAA conference report--authorization levels  secured by the stalwart leadership of Chairman John McCain and our  colleagues on the Armed Services Committee.  [[Page S794]]    So what does this mean for our men and women in uniform? It means  putting a stop to the decline in combat readiness. It means knowing  that our weapons systems will be delivered, maintained, and kept on the  cutting edge.   Take it from Secretary Mattis. Yesterday, he explained just what this  agreement will do. Here is how he put it: It will ``ensure our military  can defend our way of life, preserve the promise of prosperity, and  pass on the freedoms you and I enjoy to the next generation.''   Our volunteer servicemembers aren't the only Americans this agreement  will help. It also builds on the progress we have made for veterans and  military families by providing for better care and helping to cut the  VA's maintenance backlog.   It offers reinforcements to families on the front lines of our  Nation's struggle with opioid addiction and substance abuse. According  to the CDC, opioid overdose deaths increased fivefold just between 1999  and 2016. On average, this epidemic takes more than 100 American lives  every single day. This agreement provides for new grants, prevention  programs, and law enforcement initiatives to bolster existing national  and State efforts.   The legislation secures relief for families who are still struggling  to rebuild in the wake of last year's spate of natural disasters. This  provision was only made possible by tireless work from several of my  colleagues. Thanks to the leadership of Senator Cornyn, to Senator  Cruz's advocacy for Texas, and to Senator Rubio, who led on behalf of  Florida and spoke up forcefully for the people of Puerto Rico, help  will soon be on the way.   The agreement also provides for new investment in our Nation's  infrastructure, a shared bipartisan priority.   Now, I am confident that no Senator on either side of the aisle  believes this is a perfect bill, but I am also confident that this is  our best chance to begin rebuilding our military and to make progress  on issues directly affecting the American people.   This is a bill for brave Americans serving our country, including the  many servicemembers based in my home State of Kentucky. They deserve  the pay raise we promised them and the confidence that when they leave  our shores, they are combat-ready.   This is a bill for our distinguished military commanders, who have  sounded the alarm on sequestration more times than any of us can count.   This is a bill for our heroes who have come home. They should be  greeted by a better funded, streamlined Veterans' Administration that  is equipped to meet their needs.   This is a bill for American families who have been victimized by  brutal storms or the scourge of drug addiction. They deserve the  assistance this agreement secures.   I hope each Senator will carefully review this bipartisan bill and  support it. We need to build on our historic year, seize the  opportunity, and keep moving forward.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move that the Chair lay before the  Senate the message to accompany H.R. 1892.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, here we are at a quarter to 6.  Funding for the government expires in just a few hours. A bipartisan  agreement before us funds our troops at the level requested by the  Pentagon. It addresses the opioid crisis, which is extremely big in the  Commonwealth of Kentucky and around the country. It funds our veterans  and many other shared priorities. The Speaker of the House supports the  bill. He is waiting for it to pass the Senate. The President of the  United States supports the bill and is waiting to sign it into law.   I understand my friend and colleague from Kentucky does not join with  the President in supporting the bill. It is his right, of course, to  vote against the bill, but I would argue that it is time to vote.    Madam President, I propose that we give the Senator  from Kentucky an opportunity to make a budget point of order, which  would give him a vote on the substance of the matter he is concerned  about.   Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, at  6 p.m. today, the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the  motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R.  1892 with a  [[Page S817]]  further amendment; further, that if cloture is invoked, all postcloture  time be yielded back and Senator Paul be recognized to make a budget  point of order; that the majority leader or his designee be recognized  to make a motion to waive; and that following the disposition of the  motion to waive, the Senate vote on the motion to concur with further  amendment with no other intervening action or debate.
