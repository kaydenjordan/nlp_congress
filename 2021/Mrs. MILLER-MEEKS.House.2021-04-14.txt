 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank a young girl in  my district for her charitable actions this year.   For their birthday, most 6-year-olds ask their parents for gifts--a  dollhouse, a puppy, or a trip to Disney World. But Dempsey Wagner of  Lee County has decided to use her special day to raise funds to help  keep Iowans safe.   Dempsey, who tragically lost two relatives to drowning in 2017, is  using her sixth birthday to help raise money for the Lee County Rescue  Boat. The rescue boat, along with a trained dive  [[Page H1747]]  team, have the capability to save many lives on the Mississippi and Des  Moines Rivers and surrounding Lee County lakes.   Last year, Dempsey used her fifth birthday to raise $3,000 for Lee  County Crime Stoppers Police Puppies. But this year, Dempsey has used  her sixth birthday to more than double her record, raising over $13,610  for the Lee County Rescue Boat. My husband, Curt, and I were proud to  contribute to this worthy cause.   It is ``Iowa nice'' stories like this that make me more proud to  represent Iowa and the Second District.   Keep up the good work, Dempsey, and thank you for making both Lee  County and Iowa safer.                            ____________________
