 Madam President, yesterday, we all received the awful  and frightening news that one of our dear friends, Senator Ben Ray  Lujan of New Mexico, suffered a stroke last Thursday after experiencing  dizziness and fatigue while back in his home State. Our thoughts, our  prayers, and our most fervent well-wishes go out to Ben Ray and his  family.   I was glad and relieved to hear that he is expected to make a full  recovery, and all of us are rooting for him every step of the way  between now and the day he makes his return to the Senate.   Senator Lujan has served in this Chamber for only a year, but already  he has become one of the most beloved Members of this body. Public  service literally runs in the family, and you will be hard pressed to  find someone who fights for their home State like Ben Ray does for New  Mexico.   As Senator Lujan begins his path to full recovery, I want to offer  encouragement and praise for his superb staff, who will continue their  work providing vital constituent services for the people of New Mexico.   In the days to come, we will continue working and communicating with  Senator Lujan's staff about his recovery process, and all of us are  hopeful and optimistic that he will be back to his old self before  long. In the meantime, the U.S. Senate will continue to move forward in  carrying out its business on behalf of the American people.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previous  order be modified so that the cloture vote on Executive Calendar No.  495 occur following the cloture vote on Calendar No. 474 and that all  other provisions of the previous order remain in effect.    Mr. President, I am asking the Members to stay here in  the Chamber or in close proximity of the Chamber so we can get these  votes done expeditiously. And, in that regard, I ask unanimous consent  that we move the remaining votes from 15 minutes down to 10.    Thank you.                            ____________________     Yes, Mr. President, it is good news. People will want to  hear it.   I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the cloture motions with respect  to the Camarillo and Hunter nominations and that the Senate resume  consideration of the nominations and the Senate now vote on the  confirmation of the nominations in the order listed, with all other  provisions of the previous order in effect.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    For the information of the Senators, we have one vote  tonight; there will be three votes tomorrow at 12:30.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 571, Shelly C. Lowe, of  Arizona, to be Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities  for a term of four years; that the Senate vote on the nomination  without intervening action or debate; that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate; that any statements related to the nomination be printed in the  Record; and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, finally, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.  on Thursday, February 3; that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Baker nomination, notwithstanding rule XXII; and  further, that the Senate recess from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. for the all- Senators briefing.
