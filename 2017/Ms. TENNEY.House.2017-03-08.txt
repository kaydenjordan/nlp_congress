 Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to rise and recognize and  congratulate the new Section 4, Class B boys' basketball champions, the  Norwich Purple Tornadoes. The hard work, dedication, and sportsmanship  of these young men helped lead their team to claim the Section 4  victory for the second year in a row.   In the game against the Waverly Wolverines, senior forward Chris  Jeffrey scored 17 hard-fought points, taking Norwich into the second  half leading 18-17. In the final half, Norwich took the court by storm  to claim the title of Section 4 champion with a final score of 49-35.   On behalf of the 22nd District, congratulations to Norwich and Coach  Brian Collier on an outstanding win. We wish you luck in the State  quarterfinal on March 11 against the Section 3 champions.                            ____________________
