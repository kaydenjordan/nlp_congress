 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because it has been  35 days since the deadline for Congress to pass a budget, but the  majority party has done nothing. The American people's government has  no plan to rein in spending, while Members of this body are proposing  trillions of dollars in new spending.   Families in Missouri live within their means and balance their books  every day, and they expect their government to do the same, which is  why it is troubling that Members are advocating for the Green New Deal  and a government takeover of healthcare without any way to pay for it.   To pay for just these two items alone, we would have to take every  penny from every American household, and we would still come up $20  trillion short. This is why the majority has failed to put forth a  budget, because there is simply no way to pay for these wild ideas.   Mr. Speaker, a budget is the primary responsibility of governing,  which is why I serve on the Budget Committee.   The Speaker of the House likes to say that a budget is a statement of  your values, so what does it say about their party?                            ____________________
