 Mr. Speaker, one of the great things about our job is we  have all these wonderful young people come to us from all over the  world. And in school, they read about the social contract. They read  John Locke. They read Thomas Hobbes. They read Rousseau. The whole  premise of the social contract is that we will be safer in civil  society together than we would be if we stay in the state of nature,  which Hobbes described as solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.   But we are failing the elemental test and obligation of civil  government because we are not keeping our people safe when a teenager  can access an AR-15, go into a school, and assassinate at point-blank  range 17 teachers and students.   And what are we doing here in Congress?   Nothing. Here in the House of Representatives, we have not had a  single hearing on gun violence. We have not had a single hearing on a  universal criminal and mental background check, which is supported by  97 percent of the American people. It is almost unanimous, and we can't  even have a hearing about it.   We are demanding a hearing, and we are demanding, with the young  people who are coming to Washington on Saturday, March 24, serious  treatment of the gun violence problem which does not belong in a civil  society.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to thank the  distinguished Congresswoman from New York for her comments about  Francis Bellamy, the great Christian abolitionist and socialist who  authored America's Pledge of Allegiance. He was a great patriot who  wanted to unify the country in the wake of the Civil War during the  Reconstruction Period. We, indeed, owe him a great debt of gratitude  for everything he did for America.   Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about a matter of pressing importance and  urgency to the people of America today. It is the question of gun  violence and what Congress is doing about the problem of gun violence.   I want to start by invoking something that all of the schoolchildren  of America know about, which is the idea of a social contract.   You can go back and read John Locke or Thomas Hobbes, or Rousseau,  but all of them began with the idea that, in the state of nature, we  are all in a dangerous and perilous condition because there is no law.  It is the rule of the jungle. Hobbes said that the state of nature was  a condition that was solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. Because  of that, people enter into civil society to create a government.   The first principle of government is that we have got to protect our  people. As Cicero put it, the safety and good of the people must be the  highest law. That is why we have a social contract.   But, Mr. Speaker, in America today, our social contract is bruised  and battered and damaged and tenuous because of the gun violence which  has come to our public schools, to our universities, to our churches,  to our movie theaters, to the public square.   America's high school students have woken us up to the fact that this  is not a normal condition. America is an absolute outlier nation in  terms of the levels of gun violence that we permit to take place in our  own society. Our social contract is threatened by the gun violence that  is a menace to every single American citizen.   Now, we have a social contract, we have got a social covenant, and it  is the Constitution of the United States. We know that we have an  amendment in there which deals specifically with the question of guns,  the Second Amendment, which says: ``A well regulated Militia, being  necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to  keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.''   That is the Second Amendment.                                time  1700    Now, some people would have us believe that, because of the Second  Amendment, there is nothing that we can do about the problem of gun  violence. If you remember nothing else about what I am about to say,  please remember this: this is demonstrably, absolutely, categorically  false, and we know it is false because the Supreme Court has told us  that it is false.   In its 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme  Court adopted the individual rights view of the Second Amendment. There  was a contest between those who said, no, you only have a right to bear  arms in connection with militia service versus those who said that it  is an individual right. The individual right won in a 5-4 decision.   But in the course of making that 5-4 decision, the majority on the  Supreme Court agreed, readily, that the right to bear arms is one that  can be conditioned on all kinds of regulation by the government. That  is true of all of the rights in the Bill of Rights.   Think about the First Amendment, which guarantees all of us the right  to speak. You have a right to go protest across the street from the  White House, but do you have the right to go protest across the street  from the White House at 2 in the morning with 20,000 people without  getting a permit? Of course, you do not.   The Supreme Court has said that the exercise of First Amendment  rights is conditioned by reasonable time, place, and manner  restrictions. And in the same sense, the Second Amendment right to keep  and to bear arms is conditioned on reasonable time, place, manner, and  use restrictions by the government. We know that to be the case. The  Supreme Court told us that in Heller.   In Heller, the Court said everybody has a right to the possession of  a handgun for purposes of self-defense; everybody's got a right to a  rifle for purposes of hunting and recreation. But nobody's got a right  to possess a machine gun, even though someone might describe it as an  arm; nobody's got a right to possess a sawed-off shotgun, much less  does anybody have a right to access a weapon without going through a  background check, without going through the government's policy for  determining that you are not going to be a danger to yourself or to  other people. The Supreme Court was very clear about that.   Those people who were out there saying, ``We can't allow any gun  safety regulation or we are going to lose the right to have guns, our  guns are going to be taken away,'' are engaging in a knowing falsehood.  There is no way that the guns of the people of America--the hundreds of  millions of guns that are out there--could be confiscated. They can't  be confiscated.   People have a right to them for purposes of self-defense and for  purposes of hunting and recreation, but it doesn't give you a right to  an AR-15. It doesn't give you a right to carry weapons of war into  public schools and into movie theaters and into public places, and it  does not give you the right to access guns without a background check,  yet that is precisely what the law is today. We have a huge gaping  loophole where terrorists can go to a gun show and simply buy a gun  without any background check at all.   Now, here is the good news that people want to keep from you. We have  great news, America. Mr. Speaker, we know there is good news, and here  is the good news.   We have a consensus about what to do in America, starting with a  universal criminal and mental background check, supported by, no  longer, 95 percent of the American people. In the wake of the Parkland  massacre, it is 97 percent of the people who think that you should not  be able to access a weapon without first passing a background check.   That is the vast majority of the people, maybe almost a unanimous  verdict by the American people. Almost everybody believes that we need  to close the gun show loophole, we need to close the internet gun sale  loophole, we need to close the 7-Eleven parking lot loophole, and we  need to close the loophole that would allow criminals and gangsters and  terrorists to go to a gun show and purchase a gun. Ninety-seven percent  of the American people agree with that.   Sixty-seven percent of the American people agree with the call of the  young people who survived the massacre in Parkland, which took the  lives of 17 students and teachers, the call for a ban on assault  weapons. Sixty-seven percent of the American people, more than two- thirds of the American people, agree with a ban on the sale of  military-style assault weapons.   And 75 percent of the American people say that Congress must be  acting to reduce gun violence. So we have a consensus over what to do.   But what is happening now?   Well, I serve on the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Speaker, and we  had a vote today that had nothing to do with guns. It was about  collecting data on  [[Page H1470]]  bail policies, which is not to say that that is unimportant; but,  seriously, millions of people in America are demanding action from  Congress, and we can't even have a hearing on the problem of people  accessing assault weapons and going to public schools and assassinating  our school children at pointblank range.   Now, I had the good fortune of meeting some of the young people from  Parkland who have awoken the conscience of the country. One of them was  asked a question: Why, suddenly, is America waking up in the wake of  the Parkland massacre, which took the lives of 17 people, but it didn't  in the same way after the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, at Sandy  Hook, which took the lives of even more people, 26 people?   She had a fascinating answer. She said: Most of the people killed at  Sandy Hook were first graders, and first graders can't start a  revolution against the political power of the NRA; but high school  students know how to do it because they understand how to contact  people, and they know social media. They know Facebook and Twitter, and  they have enough education so that they can speak with authority about  the recklessness and the negligence of government not addressing the  problem.   Congress now is the outlier. Congress will not act.   Are we a failed state such that when more than 95 percent of the  American people agree that something needs to be done, Congress cannot  act?    Are we abandoning our social contract?   Are we abandoning our primary commitment to defend the lives of our  own people?   Well, it is a very serious moment. We are having our Special Order  hour on the problem of gun violence, the failure of Congress to act,  but the need for Congress to act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my distinguished colleague from the State of  Washington (Ms. Jayapal), with whom I serve on the House Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, we are so grateful for Congresswoman Pramila  Jayapal from Washington, for her powerful leadership and her lucid  discussion today of the gun violence problem.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for placing emphasis on the fact  that we have had no hearings in our Congress since we arrived here more  than a year ago on the problem of gun violence in the House Judiciary  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for placing emphasis on the  Dickey amendment, which forbids the expenditure of any public money  even to research the epidemiology of gun violence and gun violence  epidemics in the way that certain outbreaks of gun violence and mass  shootings will trigger others.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman also for placing emphasis on the  fact that the Newtown families who come to lobby in Washington, the  families from Parkland, just want to see us break the logjam; they just  want to see us end the paralysis and do something. And why not start  with the thing that is backed by more than 9 out of 10 Americans, a  universal criminal and mental background check so that people who are  carrying guns in America are the lawful gun owners who can do it  responsibly? That is something that the overwhelming majority of  American people believe in, yet this Congress seems to be completely  stuck, totally hamstrung.   Mr. Speaker, please help us dislodge this legislation.   Now, Congresswoman Jayapal praised her home State of Washington,  rightfully, for the actions they have taken recently to ban the bump  stocks and to pass other commonsense gun safety reforms.   I would like to talk about what has happened in my home State, the  great State of Maryland, which is touching Washington, D.C., where we  all are right now.   In 2013, after the catastrophe took place in Newtown, Connecticut, at  Sandy Hook, where an AR-15 was used to assassinate 26 people at  pointblank range, we acted in Maryland. We passed a ban on the sale of  military-style assault weapons. We passed a ban on high-capacity  magazines.   We gave our State police the right to engage in frequent and  unannounced inspections of the gun dealers so that bad apple gun  dealers couldn't be dealing firearms directly into the underground.   Then we said if a firearm is lost or stolen, it has got to be  reported within 48 hours, and if not, that is a misdemeanor, because  what was happening was they were selling guns to criminals, they would  surface in a homicide investigation 10 months later, we would trace it  back to the gun dealers, and the dealers would say: Oh, yeah. That was  stolen. We forgot to report it.   Or they would say: We lost that, but, yeah, we never filed a report.   So now, in our State, you have got to file a report--commonsense gun  safety supported by people across the spectrum--so we don't have a  leaky system where guns are getting into the wrong hands.   Now, our opponents on this, of course, marched and protested and said  they were opposed to all of it. They said this was an attempt to  confiscate everybody's guns, which, of course, it was not. And  responsible law-abiding gun owners have all the guns that they had  before, they have still got them, but it was challenged in court. They  said it violated the Second Amendment.   I raise it because I want America to notice this. They sued in the  United States District Court in Maryland, and they lost. And the court  said, reading the District of Columbia v. Heller decision in 2008, that  the Second Amendment permits reasonable gun safety regulation that does  not infringe on the fundamental right to bear arms for self-defense or  to have rifles for hunting or recreation, but there is no right for  civilians to be carrying military-style hardware and weaponry in  public.   They appealed it to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Fourth  Circuit affirmed the ruling of the district court.    Then they brought it to the United States Supreme Court, and the  Supreme Court let that ruling stand.   So there is a perfect example of how you can enact reasonable gun  safety regulation and it doesn't infringe anybody's Second Amendment  rights and it doesn't impinge on the right of reasonable, law-abiding  gun owners to have guns for lawful purposes.   So why are we involved in this terrible, atrocious situation where we  have rates of death and fatality and injury greater than six times  higher than any other modern industrialized country on Earth?   In the U.K., it is less than 50 people a year who die by gun; in  Japan, it is less than 50 or 60 people a year. We are losing tens of  thousands of Americans every year.   Is it because we have mental illness and they don't? No. They have  got mental illness, too. Is it because Americans are more violent than  other people? I don't think so.   It is simply because of the ready access to firearms wherever you go,  and anybody can get them almost anywhere. Okay? So we need to follow  the rest of the world in terms of enacting reasonable gun safety  legislation.   Now, we have got our Second Amendment, so nobody's handguns are going  to get taken away. The Supreme Court said it in the Heller decision and  reaffirmed that 2 years later, that it applies not just in the District  of Columbia directly against Congress, but it applies in the States, in  a case that came out of Chicago.   So we know that nobody's handguns are going to be taken away and  nobody's rifles are going to be taken away.   All we are talking about is keeping our children and our  grandchildren  [[Page H1472]]  safe; keeping people safe at concerts, like in Las Vegas; keeping  people safe in church, like in South Carolina; keeping people safe in  their public schools, like in Parkland, Florida; keeping college  students safe, like at Virginia Tech. That is what we are talking about  doing.   Now, we don't know why Congress won't act. Some people are starting  to hypothesize that America has become a failed state, that we can't  respond to an almost unanimous demand by our own people to legislate in  the interests of public safety, which is the most elementary  requirement of a civilized society under a social contract.   Some people say we have become a failed state, like failed states we  see around the world. You know that authoritarianism is on the march  all over the world, whether it is in Putin's Russia or Duterte's  Philippines or Orban's Hungary or Erdogan's Turkey, where it is all  about enriching the people in power--ignoring the needs of the people,  ignoring the rights of the people, but instead, using government as a  money-making operation for a tiny group of people.   Have we become a failed state? Is that what we are? I don't think we  are a failed state.   We have had other periods in American history where Congress has  refused to deal with pressing public policy problems. One of the most  famous ones, beginning in the 1830s, was when a proslavery faction  within Congress said it would refuse to have any hearings at all and  would refuse to entertain any petitions against slavery from anywhere  in the country. It was a direct assault on the right to petition  Congress for redress of grievances, it was a direct assault on the  freedom of speech, but they imposed this stranglehold on Congress so  there could be no debate on the most pressing issue of the day.   Now, I am not likening slavery to gun violence. Okay? I want to be  clear about that. But I am saying that there are other times in  American history where Congress has acted as a chokehold against the  ventilation of serious public concerns and grievances. There have been  times when Congress has refused to engage in debate, discussion, and  analysis of the most pressing problems of the day, and that is where we  are right now on gun violence.   All we are saying, Mr. Speaker, to the majority in Congress, is let's  have some hearings on this, let's have some hearings on a universal  criminal and mental background check being demanded by nearly every  American right now. Let's start with that. Is that one thing we can all  agree on, that there should be a background check before people go out  and obtain weapons of war that they then carry into the hallways and  the schoolrooms of our country? Can we have a hearing on that?   If you don't want to vote for it, you can stand up with the 1 or 2  percent of the people who are against it, but allow those of us who  want to represent the 97 or 98 percent of the people who are for it to  have a vote, because we don't think that terrorists and criminals  should be able to go to a gun show and purchase firearms, including AR- 15s, without a criminal background check. We don't think that.   So, Mr. Speaker, we have got a consensus in America on this. Let's  not stifle the consensus. Let's not choke off the ability of the  American people and their representatives to govern. That is why we  were sent here, to legislate.   The essence of legislation is hearings. We have to hear the American  people, we have to hear the experts, we have to collect the evidence.  We have got to overturn the ban on the collection of statistics about  gun violence that was imposed a few decades ago on the CDC. We have got  to collect the information, and we have to act.   The time for just prayers and meditation about the problem is long  gone, as the young people from Parkland, Florida, have told us.   They were told in the wake of the massacre: It is too early to start  debating gun policy.   They turned around, and they said: No. It is too late to be debating  gun policy. This should have been done after Las Vegas. It should have  been done after San Bernardino County. It should have been done after  the Sandy Hook massacre. It should have been done after Virginia Tech.   How many more massacres do we have to await before this Congress  decides something really must be done? How many more massacres? That is  what America is asking us, Mr. Speaker.   Please, let's do our job. We have sworn an oath to the American  people. Let's go and represent the public will, let's make it  consistent with the Second Amendment, because it is very easy to do so.  We proved it in the State of Maryland, and the Supreme Court has told  us we can pass reasonable commonsense gun safety measures without  violating anyone's rights.   We have got a consensus in America. In Congress, we have got to do  our job and let that consensus become the law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Perlmutter very much for  yielding for just a moment. I was very moved by his comments. We know  that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, and I want to salute  him for his vigilance and his zealousness in defending American freedom  and our democratic process against foreign and potentially domestic  enemies, those who would subvert and undermine our political processes.   It seems to me that, in Congress, we have two jobs that we need to do  now. One is to defend the Mueller investigation and the Department of  Justice against unfair attacks and attempts to subvert and undermine  investigation; and two, and perhaps more importantly now, is we have  got to work to fortify our election systems against a repeat in 2018.    The U.S. intelligence agencies, they told us, in January of 2017,  that there had been a campaign of cyber espionage and cyber sabotage  and cyber propaganda against the American elections. They have told us  that the Russians are very likely to be doing the same thing with  respect to the 2018 election. And, by the way, it is not just the  Russians now. They may have just set the template for other bad actors  who want to stick their nose into American elections, too.   You know, James Q. Wilson wrote this book called, ``Broken Windows,''  [[Page H1475]]  where he said if somebody throws a rock into a window and you have got  a broken window and nobody does anything about it, it is an invitation  for more people to come along and break some more windows. Well, right  now, the U.S. Government has done nothing.   As you have said, we have not spent the money in the State Department  to try to defend ourselves against the foreign subversion of our  elections and cyber espionage and sabotage. And when we had the  Attorney General come to the Judiciary Committee, we asked him what had  he engaged in to try to defend our elections across the country against  another attack, and he said basically nothing. And followup efforts by  members of the committee to get the Attorney General to meet with us  have resulted in nothing.   So, this week, we have asked for $14 million from the appropriators  to go to the Election Assistance Commission, which is the only Federal  body we have got that is charged with trying to help State election  administrators defend themselves against cyber attack. That $14 million  is urgent and necessary, and it is obviously a very small sum of money,  given the amount of money we spend on defense in America, but this is  defense of our elections.   We are also asking for $400 million to help update outmoded and weak  election technology in the States today. That is another badly needed  infusion of cash to the States so we can fortify our elections. We know  that at least 22 States suffered attempted electronic probes by foreign  actors in 2016, and they are coming back in 2018, and everybody wants  to know what are we doing about it, and we have no coordinated plan. At  the very least, we should get this money to the Election Assistance  Commission so we can help the States harden themselves.
