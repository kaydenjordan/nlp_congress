 Mr. Speaker, I want to say, in support of the position that  was adopted by my friend, Mr. Shimkus, there are a lot of things that  the appropriators do around here that I don't like.   I rise today in full support of H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act of  2019. This important piece of legislation will significantly help  communities around the country that have contaminated water supplies  due to their PFAS chemicals.   This bill is also an extension of the good work that the House  accomplished last year with many provisions relating to PFAS  contamination in the National Defense Authorization Act.   One community in my district, Westfield, Massachusetts, has been  particularly affected by these substances because of the past use of  certain types of firefighting foams for the aircraft fires at Barnes  Air National Guard base. Unfortunately, the situation at Westfield is  hardly unique. For years, cities and towns around the Nation have been  trying to resolve this problem with very little help from the  Environmental Protection Agency.   Provisions in this bill, however, will ensure that the EPA finally  does their part to set safe drinking water standards and to include  these hazardous chemicals in the Superfund regulations.   Additionally, this regulation will require health testing for all  PFAS substances and establish a grant program to help those communities  affected to clean up their water supplies.   Mr. Speaker, as someone who has worked for many years with the city  of Westfield, and heard from my constituents aggressively on this  issue, I am glad the House is providing some aid to many of these  communities and ensuring our drinking water is clear of these  chemicals.   As a member of the Congressional PFAS Task Force, I want to applaud  the hard work that has gone into this legislation and the effort of  citizens from areas affected by PFAS for their advocacy.
