 Mr. Speaker, today I want to wish Jacinto City  and community in my district a happy 75th anniversary. Jacinto City is  a beloved community in our district full of hardworking Americans who  contribute to our economy and work every day to build a country we  love.   In the 1940s the city became the meeting point for immigrant families  who worked in shipyards, nearby steel mills, and war plants. These  workers were here seeking the American Dream, a dream that became a  reality thanks to the entrepreneurial spirit of its immigrant  community.   This is inspiring, and it reminds us now more than ever that our  workers play a vital role in empowering and transforming our country.   Today, Jacinto City is a beacon of hope for the State's great economy  and for our Nation. Its diverse community is led by a Latina mayor, Ana  Diaz. It is an example of our country's social fabric and how our  immigrants make us a stronger and more vibrant country.   I couldn't be prouder to represent this great community, and I am  thankful to the families for their hard work and their contributions to  our country.
