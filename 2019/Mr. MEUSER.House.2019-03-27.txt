 Madam Speaker, we, our country, over the past 2 years  have lived through persistent and daily accusations against our  President of Russian collusion in his election, accusations made by  many Democrats and the media. Our President was accused of nothing  short of high crimes and misdemeanors.   A 2-year, thorough investigation was carried out. Last Friday,  perhaps the most thorough investigation in recent history concluded.  The investigation enjoyed not only complete, unlimited access to  witnesses, but the resources of the entire Federal Government,  including the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the intelligence  community.   The Mueller investigation reached a conclusion that no Russian  collusion took place nor was there any evidence of any participation by  any persons in the campaign.   The verdict is in. Nevertheless, our Democrat colleagues continue to  talk about a further investigation. Any further investigations would  not have the fraction of resources of the Mueller investigation.   I ask: Seriously? Another investigation? This one was not enough? Or  are we prolonging for the sake of prolonging this issue?   We owe it to the American people to accept the facts from a 2-year  investigation, move on, and do the work we were sent here to do. We owe  this to the American people.
