Res. 71 (115th       Congress).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, we are here today at a moment of extreme hardship for  families across the country. Last week, both the House and the Senate  passed bipartisan legislation that would provide relief for people who  are struggling to make ends meet. That package includes a wide variety  of provisions that will allow Americans who are at the end of their  ropes to stay in their homes and to put food on the table.   Despite the fact that the Trump administration was part of the  negotiations for the legislation and approved of all the measures that  it contained, the President unexpectedly decided to delay signing the  package into law for several days. This stalling was an act of theater  that cost the American people millions of dollars in terms of pandemic- related unemployment assistance that they desperately need.   Fortunately, last night, the President finally signed the bill. At  last, workers and families can exhale a bit, knowing that aid is on the  way.   The primary reason that the President provided for holding up his  signature was the enactment of this important legislation that we are  about to undertake in the next 40 minutes.   Democrats agree that families deserve more, and that is why I  introduced the CASH Act on Christmas Eve to increase the payments in  the relief package to $2,000, the exact amount the President said he  wants.   Madam Speaker, I introduced this legislation on Christmas Eve with  the following parable in mind. Jacob Marley forewarned that the three  ghosts would visit Ebenezer Scrooge to warn him about the path to  redemption. He started with Christmas Past, and we might start here  with Christmas past, acknowledging that, 3 years ago, one of the  largest tax cuts in American history that overwhelmingly came to people  at the very top, including a top individual rate cut of 39 percent to  37.5 percent and a corporate rate cut from 36 percent to 21 percent,  were part of that endeavor.   In the Christmas present, there are 20 million Americans who are  receiving unemployment insurance, more than 350,000 dead, and 19  million people infected with this pandemic.   For Christmas Future, Marley warned Ebenezer Scrooge that there was a  way for redemption, and that was through a new generosity and a new  kindness. We could emulate that here this afternoon by raising that  impact payment from $600 to $2,000. The miracle of this season would  remain the triumph of light for those who desperately need our  assistance.   Madam Speaker, we could have passed this bill 4 days ago, but our  colleagues on the other side went against the President's wishes, and  they blocked it. So, here we are today, back again to try to get a  bigger check for the American people. I sincerely hope that the House  Republicans have had a change of heart and will join us in passing the  CASH Act.   Madam Speaker, let's pass this bill and do what is right for our  neighbors back home as they simply try to survive each day.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Suozzi), who did a great job on the surprise billing  legislation that passed in the COVID Act.    Madam Speaker, might I remind the gentleman that this is  not about creating a path to prosperity. This is about creating a path  to liquidity, which subsequently creates a path to demand for people at  the lower end of the economic spectrum, 20 million of whom are not  working at the moment through no fault of their own.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Beyer), an excellent member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, let me remind the Members of this Chamber why we are  here today.   The CARES Act passed this House with, I think, five dissenters in the  entire Chamber. That was months and months ago. People exhausted the  $1,200 that we allocated, based upon our tax system. And even the  difficulty we had in trying to find adequate identification for those  in America, as joint filers, making under $24,000 a year, single filers  making under $12,000 a year.   Who can live on $12,000 a year? That is $1,000 a month.   People have exhausted that benefit. They have tried earnestly and  seriously to overcome these obstacles that were created for them, not  because of anything they did. We are not here because of malfeasance,  speculation that derailed Wall Street in 2008, or corruption. We are  here because of an international pandemic, and members of the American  family at the lower end of the economic spectrum are hurting.   When we sought advice on putting together the CARES Act, the Speaker  and myself, in particular, in those very earnest days with Secretary  Mnuchin, sought the advice of the best economists--former Treasury  Secretaries, members of the Federal Reserve Board, people who do this  every single day--and they all said you need to act with speed and  determination, speed to get that money into the hands of the people who  will actually spend it.   And that is precisely what we did. We got it to people at the lower  end of the economic spectrum.                                time  1630    As we proceed now to the new year, these people need another infusion  of cash. I am going to go back to this point that I think is something  that we need to remember. Three years ago, this House, over the  objection of myself and many others, passed a tax cut that clearly  benefited the people at the very top of the economic spectrum, the top  1 percent, in particular--dividends, buybacks, a top cut in the  corporate rate from 36 percent to 21 percent, and the top rate on the  individual side from 39 percent to 37 percent.   And we can't find it in our hearts in this holiday season, again,  based upon the Charles Dickens' parable of ``A Christmas Carol,'' to  provide $2,000 worth of assistance to our brothers and sisters at the  bottom end of economic income? This Chamber is better than that.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am glad the ranking member reminded us of  what we were able to accomplish together in the CARES Act, and I think  that is what we are asking here again this evening.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   I acknowledge the good efforts of Ranking Member Brady on the energy  front in the tax package, as well. It is a series of compromised  measures. He did a terrific job, I think it is fair to say, on surprise  billing, and not to mention USMCA. Those were very substantial  accomplishments that the Ways and Means Committee led on in the 116th  Congress.   Mr. Brady, as he was closing, mentioned that this measure he did not  want to see treated as stimulus, and he is right; this is not about  stimulus.   This is about stability.   This is about building a bridge for those people who are really  hurting as we turn the page on this year.   This is about those who are wondering how they are going to make the  next rental payment, sustenance for the American family, how they might  repair that automobile that sits in the garage idle because they  couldn't afford it.   That is what this is really about this evening.   I started with Charles Dickens and ``A Christmas Carol'' and the  lessons of Jacob Marley, but let me conclude with a very simple  description in ``The Epic of America.''   When asked what it was that set America apart from the rest of the  world, it was suggested it was a habit of the heart, a kindness and a  decency and a goodness. And let me close the debate on that basis and  urge passage of the CASH Act and $2,000 for the American people.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
