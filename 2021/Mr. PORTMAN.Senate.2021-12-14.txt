 Mr. President, first, I want to offer my congratulations  to Bryn Stewart.   That was a beautiful speech about the public service that he has  contributed to Wyoming and to the U.S. Senate. I thank my colleague  from Wyoming for that.                                   Kentucky    Mr. President, I also want to say that over the weekend, I had the  opportunity to travel to Kentucky.   I live in Ohio so Kentucky is our neighboring State. I went down to  help some of our neighbors get back on their feet after these  devastating tornadoes. It was very emotional, partly, obviously, seeing  people's lives just be devastated--houses ruined and family heirlooms  lost and, unfortunately, some loss of life--as the tornado hit some of  the residential areas in Western Kentucky, but also another emotion,  which is gratitude for the people who came forward as volunteers to  help, neighbor helping neighbor.   As always happens when you have one of these natural disasters, the  only silver lining is that people do come together in providing water  and food and help getting people out of their homes through urban  search and rescue teams, like Ohio Task Force One, that went down to  Kentucky chain-sawing trees down so that people can get their cars out  and try to repair some of the damage, get their lives back together.   It was a terrible thing to see the devastation but also a wonderful  thing to see people coming together to help one another to get through  a tough time.                                  Inflation    Mr. President, I am on the floor today primarily to talk about the  legislation that has been proposed by the Biden administration and by  the Democratic leadership.   This is the 11th consecutive week that I have come to the floor to  talk about this because, every week since it was introduced 11 weeks  ago, I have wanted to talk about what is actually in this legislation,  how it would impact our communities, how it would impact our economy.  [[Page S9151]]    So, today, I am here to talk a little about some of the new numbers  we have in terms of inflation and how this would impact inflation and  some of the new numbers that just came out since last week from the  Congressional Budget Office, which is the nonpartisan group up here  that analyzes these legislative efforts, and what they are saying about  what the cost of this bill will be.   So I think it is worth having this conversation before Congress--the  Senate and the House--votes on this massive tax bill, a massive  spending bill that could fundamentally change the way our economy works  and, I think, put us in a very difficult position as it relates to  inflation and the economy and our debt and our deficit.   Democrats want to push this through under what is called  reconciliation, which is a special procedure here in the Senate where,  instead of getting the normal supermajority of 60 votes, they could do  it with only 50 votes and then have a tie-breaker be the Vice President  in her role as President of the Senate. So I have concerns about the  substance of the legislation but also in terms of the process.   Wouldn't it be great if this could actually go through committees and  the committees could vet some of these proposals? Last week, I talked  about some of the tax proposals, for instance, which I think have  inadvertent impacts on pensions--defined benefit plans, in particular-- inadvertent effects on businesses that aren't going to be able to write  off expansions and plant equipment, which we want them to do.   Maybe some of these things are inadvertent, but it also has a change  in the tax policy where it says that the State and local tax deduction  would no longer be capped at $10,000. This is a Federal deduction  people are able to take on their State and local taxes, but they would  raise that to $80,000, that cap.   The impact of that and a couple other things in the legislation means  that 70 percent of millionaires--people who make over $1 million in  income a year--would get a significant tax cut under this legislation;  whereas, if you only make 30,000 bucks a year, only 30 percent of those  people get a tax cut.   And that is in the first year. In the second year, it goes down to  about half that. And in the third year, it goes down to 10 percent and  below. So it really is skewed toward providing tax relief for the  wealthy at a time when, obviously, we are concerned about those people.  Given the economic uncertainty, given the COVID issues, given the  natural disasters, given the other issues that we face, you would want  to help those who need the help the most. That is not what this  legislation does.   Again, if it had gone through the process of the committees of  jurisdiction--in this case, the Finance Committee, the Ways and Means  Committee--I don't think we would be seeing this. All these issues are  ones that could have been ironed out had it not been jammed through on  this reconciliation process without any committee consideration.   So I am upset that Congress is being thwarted from doing its work,  and I think, if we had, it would be a very different piece of  legislation.   This plan is also going to hurt, in my view, with regard to  inflation. We are looking at the highest inflation we have had in  decades. I think everybody knows that now, not because they are looking  at the numbers, which I will talk about in a second, but because when  they go to the grocery store, they are paying a lot more for a  hamburger or for milk or for bread; or when they go to fill up their  car with gas, they are seeing the prices at the pump.   I filled up my pickup truck--I took it to Kentucky on the trip I just  talked about--and it was almost a hundred bucks to fill it up. That is  a lot for people who are on a fixed income or young people or someone  who has to commute to work. That really takes a bite out of your  budget. But that inflation is across our economy right now, and it is  tough on people.   The work shortages that we see, the workforce shortages, the supply  chain delays, the inflation--all of these things are problems in our  economy right now. All of them get worse, in my view, if we do it the  way the Democrats propose because, by adding more fuel to the fire,  more stimulus spending--in this case, trillions of dollars--you are  going to stimulate more demand in the economy. And inflation happens  when demand outstrips supply. So you have a lot of demand for  something, but you don't have the supply for it, and it raises  inflation.   And that is exactly what many of us predicted would have happened  back in March of this year when Congress did the same thing--$1.9  trillion. A lot of it was stimulus spending. And people said, ``This is  going to cause inflation,'' and, sure enough, it did. It wasn't just me  and other Republicans. It was some Democrats as well.    So that trend of rising inflation, which has made things so costly  and expensive for so many people in my home State of Ohio, shows no  sign of slowing down. Late last week, the Labor Department reported  that the Consumer Price Index, or the CPI, rose by 6.8 percent over the  last 12 months. That is the biggest year-to-year inflationary increase  in 39 years--39 years.   And last month, the number for inflation--1 month alone--was 0.8  percent. So get on your calculator and do the math: 0.8 percent in 1  month. Do that times 12 months, and you end up with inflation of 10  percent on an annualized basis. That is just from last month, if we  just extrapolate that out over the year.   Ten percent inflation? For those who lived through inflation in the  late 1970s, early 1980s, you know what that does to your economy. So  the notion that the Biden administration has that this is going to be  temporary or transitory, that is just not true. And, by the way, the  Federal Reserve has now said that is not true. It is going to be here  for a while.   Although we are hearing a lot of stories these days about businesses  paying higher wages to attract workers, average wages went up by 4.3  percent last year. So with all of the labor shortages and the increase  in wages, wages went up 4.3 percent. Again, inflation went up 6.8  percent in the same 12-month period.   So this is why, if you are getting a raise at work and you feel  pretty good about it--getting the raise--but then you go to the grocery  store or go to the gas pump or buy some clothes and you don't feel so  good about it, it is because your inflation is higher than your wage  gain. So unless your wage gain is over 6.8 percent over the last year,  on average, you are losing out. And that is a real problem.   By the way, in 2020, as we got into the COVID-19 crisis, we had a  very different economy. In February of 2020, we had the 19th straight  month of wage gains of 3 percent or more, and inflation was 1, 1.5  percent. So people were feeling: Hey, I am making more money, and it is  not being eaten up by inflation.   That is not the case now, unfortunately. Wages are not keeping pace  with these higher prices, and people are finding that their paychecks  just don't go as far as they used to.   We can see by some data that just came out from a survey of consumer  expectations from the New York Fed that an increasing number of people  are reporting that they are struggling more financially than they did a  year ago. That is from the Fed, the New York Fed. And fewer are  expecting their financial situation to improve by this time next year.  That is not a great feeling as we approach the holiday season. That is  a real concern.   The other report we have had since I was on the floor last week is  with regard to the Producer Price Index. We have talked about the  Consumer Price Index. The Producer Price Index is about businesses:  What are businesses seeing in terms of inflation on business-to- business purchases, for instance?   The new number out this week on that is the largest increase year  over year since we started keeping track of this number, which was  about 11 years ago, 12 years ago. So the Producer Price Index is also  going up, and the Consumer Price Index is already up.   What this means is that that Producer Price Index number is  eventually going to be reflected in higher consumer costs--right?-- because businesses are going to pass that along. So this is not a good  week because we just got that data, and I was very sorry to see it  because what you want to see is the Producer Price Index going down;  [[Page S9152]]  meaning that, in the future, the consumer prices are going to go down  too. Instead, we are seeing a situation where it is likely that prices  are going to keep going up.   Again, Republicans warned of this when the $1.9 trillion was spent,  mostly to stimulate the economy, saying this is going to overheat the  economy--more demand, less supply, partly because of COVID. In other  words, COVID made it harder to get supply in. If demand goes up, you  are going to have inflation. And sure enough, that is what happened.   Larry Summers is the former Secretary of the Treasury under President  Obama, former Chair of the national Council of Economic Advisers.  Actually, he was Treasury Secretary for President Clinton and Chair of  the National Economic Council for President Obama, a respected  economist. He, too, warned of this. So it is not just a partisan issue,  not Republicans and Democrats. It is the reality of what is happening  when you increase demand much more than supply can handle. You get  inflation. So it is not a surprise that it happened. Unfortunately, his  prediction came true: overheated economy, demand outstripping supply.  We found ourselves in this spiral of rising prices.   That was 9 months ago. I think it is fair to say that the inflation  that people said was transitory is going to stay here for a while. That  is a real cause for concern.   So why are we doing this? Why are we, again, spending trillions of  dollars? And what is the cost?   Something that happened since we talked last week is that the true  cost of the Build Back Better plan is now being revealed by this group  on the outside from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, by  the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, and by others, but now  by the Congressional Budget Office itself.   So the Congressional Budget Office is the nonpartisan group up here  in Congress that tells us what the fiscal impact is, what the spending  impact is, what the taxing impact is, what the economic impact is of  legislation.   And the number that has been cited for the cost of this Build Back  Better legislation is $1.7 trillion over 10 years. That is a lot. That  would make it the second most expensive bill ever passed by Congress,  the first being the $1.9 trillion we talked about in March.   But it is worse than that because it turns out that even those  staggeringly high costs we just talked about--$1.7 trillion--miss the  mark based on the analysis that just came out. Just as prices for  everyday goods and services are going up, the estimates we are seeing  for the true cost of Build Back Better are increasing with every  analysis we see.   These studies have shown us that because the legislation sunsets  programs, if you actually assume those programs are not going to be  stopped after--let's say with the child tax credit--1 year or 2 years  or 3 years, but you continue it through the life of the legislation, it  is going to be much more expensive.   So people tell me: Well, Rob, that is fine, but the child tax credit,  as an example, only costs $185 billion--only.   And I say: Well, actually, if you take it out over time, that becomes  trillions of dollars--like $1.6, $1.7 trillion.   They say: Well, we are just going to do it for 1 year.   Well, that is just not what happens here in Congress. The history of  this is that once we put a program like that in place, it continues to  live on year after year.   Let me give you the best example of that. You have probably heard a  lot of Democrats saying over the past few weeks: We have to pass this  Build Back Better legislation by the end of this year.   Why? Because the child tax credit--it is already in law based on the  March legislation--is expiring. So there is a tremendous amount of  pressure, right? They are saying you have to extend it.   Well, that makes our case. So you have to extend it this year? That  means, I assume, you have to extend it next year and the next year and  the next year and the next year.   And anybody who says that they don't want to extend it--on the other  side of the aisle--I would like to hear from them because I don't think  they are going to say that. And so, if you assume it is extended, then  you have this huge cost. The spending is going to continue to increase,  and the program is not going to sunset. The total cost of the bill goes  from $1.7 trillion that we talked about to about $4.5 trillion based on  the Penn Wharton study I talked about.   Under the Congressional Budget Office analysis, it actually goes even  higher--even higher--to $4.9 trillion. And when you add interest on the  debt, it goes actually over $5 trillion.   So it is difficult to understand these numbers we are talking about  because they are so huge. You know, $4.5 trillion is $4,500 billion. We  have never spent this kind of money before. I mean, if it is $5  trillion, that is the size of our budget, more or less--the whole  budget for the entire country for a year, in one bill.   Now, people say: Well, it is paid for. Well, the 1.7 part, you could  argue, is paid for--although we can talk about that, too, because some  of the things in the pay-fors are not sustainable in my view,  including, again, the impact on pension funds or the impact on being  able to write off investments or the impact of the SALT issue. So there  are lots of things that need to be worked out on the spending side but  also on the revenue side.   So let's assume it is $1.7 trillion, but that is not going to cover  it because you have these expenses--like the child tax credit--that  will continue.   So I am glad that my colleague Senator Lindsey Graham, who is the  ranking member of the Budget Committee, a top Republican, and Senator  John Cornyn, another colleague, asked the nonpartisan Congressional  Budget Office to do their analysis, because they showed that, without  the sunset, the 10-year cost of the child tax credit goes from $185  billion to $1.6 trillion.   They also found that, in line with another study by the nonpartisan  Joint Committee on Taxation, the revenue lost would be $1.6 trillion,  either taking us further into debt by $1.6 trillion or requiring new  tax hikes.   So that is just one part of the legislation. It would be the  costliest expenditure by Congress in our history, but it is just one  part of the legislation. The hundreds of billions in funding Democrats  are proposing as an example for childcare under a new approach to  childcare, which we can also talk about, the substance of that, but it  is going to hurt a lot of our State the way they are doing it. But that  will end up costing double the written amount over the next decade if  they remain in place, for example.   So all in all, the Congressional Budget Office looked at 18  supposedly sunset social spending programs and found that they will end  up costing the taxpayers nearly $3.5 trillion over the next decade when  they get extended, if they do. Again, the history around here is that  they would. So, you know, the price tag goes up and up and up.   When you add that spending to another program in Build Back Better,  the CBO says the total spending in the legislation, again, goes to $4.9  trillion; $4.9 trillion is bigger than the economy of any country in  the world, with the exception of the U.S., China, and Japan.   Again, these numbers are just astronomical. But think about that. It  is bigger than the entire economy, the entire GDP of any country in the  world except for the three of us: the United States, China, and Japan.   We are seeing record debts and record deficits right now, as you  know. The Congressional Budget Office says that the American people can  expect Build Back Better, if the sunsets don't hold, to add another $3  trillion to the Federal deficit.   So if we continue to debate this in Congress, which way should we go,  we just ought to know these numbers. We ought to analyze them. And  again, if people on the other side of the aisle are going to say we  don't want to have the child tax credit be extended, we need to know  that. But my sense is, just as they want to extend it right now, they  will want to extend it next year and the next year and the next year.   So is this the right time to do that? Is this the right time to add  that kind of stimulus to an economy that already is overstimulated,  where you have more demand chasing not enough supply, do you want to  add more to the demand side? That is what is going to happen if we pass  this.   I hope that we will not make that mistake, and I hope that we will  slow  [[Page S9153]]  down and look at these numbers and analyze where we are in terms of our  spending. We just extended the debt limit. No Republican voted for it,  but all the Democrats voted for it, and that is all they needed to be  able to extend the debt limit because it was under a special 50-vote  margin. That debt limit was just extended for basically 1 year. So  after the elections next year, $2.5 trillion more debt. We had to make  room for $2.5 trillion more debt, in 1 year.   It is clear that a lot of Americans are nervous about that. When you  look at the polling data, it says that. But just talking to people-- over the weekend, I was also in southeast Ohio, part of our State that  is very rural, a lot of people are hurting in terms of the economy  because they don't have access to broadband and so on. So we are  talking about how they feel about the economy, and there is a lot of  nervousness. They feel the surging inflation. They are paying more for  everything.   And, you know, common steps, people are saying, Let's just slow down  and think about this. They may end up thinking at the end of the day  they are for some of this, but they don't want to move forward  precipitously and make a mistake and have this add more inflation and  more problems for our debt and deficit for our kids and grandkids. They  are saying, Let's do the right thing for the country and put the brakes  on this.   And if we do put the brakes on this unprecedented spending and  taxing, it will help us to avoid some of these economic challenges that  we otherwise are going to be facing. If we go ahead with it, it is  going to make the economic challenges like inflation even worse.   My hope is that we will put the brakes on, and these economic  challenges will not worsen, and instead, we can get the country back on  the right track.   I yield the floor.
