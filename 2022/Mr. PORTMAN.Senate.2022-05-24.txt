 Mr. President, today marks exactly 3 months since Russia  began its war on Ukraine. I have come to the Senate floor for what is  now the 13th straight week since that time while the Senate has been in  session to talk about this unprovoked, illegal, and brutal war that  they are waging on our ally Ukraine, a democratic and sovereign  country.   Since I spoke last week, we had a very important development. At the  end of last week, the Senate came together in a strong bipartisan vote  to pass what is called the supplemental funding bill for Ukraine. The  vote was 86 to 11. It passed the House the week prior with a similar  strong bipartisan vote. Congress, in this legislation, actually went  above what the President had requested. He initially requested $33  billion and Congress decided to provide $40 billion to ensure that the  Ukrainians had the funding they needed through this fall.   In combination with the help from about 40 different countries around  the world, Ukrainians now have the ammunition and weapons, as well as  the humanitarian and economic support they need to survive and also to  continue their fight for the next several months. Importantly, the  supplemental spending bill will replenish what is called the  Presidential Drawdown Authority. It was depleted. That is the authority  that lets us very quickly transfer weapons from our own surpluses to  the Ukrainians and it has been very effective. The legislation raised  the Presidential Drawdown Authority cap to $11 million, $3 billion over  the President's request. Again, the notion is this is going to be  needed.   The bill also includes $6 billion for what is called the Ukraine  Security Assistance Initiative, a program I first authored in 2015 to  enhance the Ukrainian military's ability to fight off Russian  aggression. When we started that program, Russia was only in this part  of Ukraine and the line of contact was here in eastern Ukraine.   Here are a couple of maps that show the progress that has been made  in  [[Page S2654]]  pushing back as Russia has invaded Ukraine starting on February 24. All  this area here that is in blue was controlled by Russia at one point,  as was this lighter red area. The darker red area was what Russia took  back in 2014 after Ukraine chose to look to the West rather than to  Russia for alliance and support.   This is what they took in 2014. Then they came in on February 24 with  the hope of taking the entire country, and they did control this  territory. Everything you see in blue has been pushed back. It is no  longer Russian-held territory. It is now back in Ukrainian hands. So  this is the map of today.   There is progress being made around Kharkiv. This is a beautiful city  in this part of Ukraine. The blue you see here is where Ukrainian  military have recently pushed back the Russian forces--in one case,  right up to the Russian border. You also see the same here in the  eastern and southern--more southern parts of Ukraine, where some  progress has been made.   But there is fierce fighting all in this region. And, in fact,  recently, you can see where the Russians have made some progress in  trying to cut off some of the Ukrainian troops. Initially, they had  hoped to make a bridge here to cut off troops in this area. Thousands  of them now are pushing through right here and making some progress.   It is a hot war, and the Ukrainians are desperate to have enough  ammunition to continue to fight that war to protect their homeland and  to have better weapons to be able to push back against Russia.   The end of this war has to be that Russia is pushed out of Ukraine.  That has to be our objective. It is certainly one that the Ukrainians  share.   The successes against Russia in the battlefield are a testament to  the bravery and the effectiveness of Ukrainians who are fighting to  defend their freedom, fighting to defend their families, defend their  homeland.    But it is also a success that is due to the effectiveness of our  help, and particularly, the Ukraine Security Initiative over the past 7  years, especially the training element of it. It was money well spent  by U.S. taxpayers to ensure that--along with other NATO countries who  provided funding for this, as well--that there was a training component  to ensure the military would be more effective. And you can see the  results of it. They are outgunned, outnumbered, and yet have been able  to push Russia out of all this part of Ukraine and are making some  progress in these areas.   The supplemental spending bill I talked about also includes $4  billion in foreign military financing to allow Ukraine to get American- made weapons and equipment through a lend-lease-type program.   Importantly, the supplemental also includes $3.9 billion to support  enhanced U.S. troop deployments to Europe. That is critical to me  because it has never been more important than now to ensure that we  have the troops we need along the border here to be able to ensure  Russia knows that if they go beyond Ukraine, we will respond and  respond forcefully as NATO--all 30 countries of NATO. So we have  reinforced our troops' presence in Eastern Europe, places like Poland,  places like Slovakia, Romania, and around the region to be able to  ensure that our article 5 agreement under NATO--which is a mutual  defense commitment--can be kept.   Again, it is not just us, but it is all the members of NATO. If  Russians make a further mistake and do what President Putin has talked  about doing--going to places like the Baltics, Lithuania, Latvia,  Estonia--NATO will be there, and that should be a big deterrent. Of  course, this legislation, the supplemental, was not inexpensive. Forty  billion dollars is a lot of money. It has to be subject to appropriate  safeguards for transparency and accountability.   Last week, I spoke about many of these safeguards that some of us  helped get into the legislation, including the critical role that  Congress will play in providing regular oversight over these funds. I  expect the administration to keep Congress promptly informed of how it  intends to spend this money as required by this law.   Effective oversight of Ukraine will also require a strong diplomatic  presence on the ground. We have people there watching how the money is  being spent and can report back. I am pleased that the administration  heeded the Senate's call to reopen our embassy in Kyiv last Sunday.  Kyiv is the capital of Ukraine, here in the middle of Ukraine. It now  has a U.S. embassy presence. The officials at the embassy were here in  Poland. Some have gone to Lviv in the last few weeks, but now, as of  this last week, we are back in Kyiv and we are open for business.   By the way, the same day the embassy opened, we reported out the new  ambassador nominee for Ukraine. We haven't had an ambassador there for  way too long--about a year and a half or so. And we actually then voted  on her on the Senate floor--it may be the fastest nomination ever  through this place. That is very important. We unanimously confirmed  Bridget Brink to be the Ambassador. She was the Ambassador to Slovakia.  She has been in Ukraine before as a Foreign Service Officer. I think  she is a very good choice. She is leaving her post in Slovakia and  going right into Ukraine. Our diplomatic presence there is once again  going to be in a strong position and, therefore, telling the rest of  the world that the United States is here and here to stay.   Now that Congress has provided this $40 billion to support Ukraine  and to support our troops in the area, it is up to the administration  to ensure that it is used effectively, particularly with regard to the  military assistance.   I encourage the administration to use these funds in accordance with  the needs on the ground in Ukraine. We have to be sure that we are  giving them what they actually need. We have to listen to the  Ukrainians who are fighting on the front lines. To me, this would  include, as an example, what is called the mobile Multiple Launch  Rocket Systems, or MLRS, that they are asking for. This enables them  and Ukraine to sit back a little further and not be subject to shelling  from the Russian forces, and yet to provide damage to some of the  artillery Russia is using against these cities--flattening these  beautiful cities and killing so many civilians.   We cannot delude ourselves into thinking if we stop providing certain  weapons systems like the MLRS, that somehow we will, therefore, not be  provoking Russia and that President Putin will gracefully acknowledge  that gesture and cease his assault or lessen his assault on Ukraine.  That is not going to happen. Let me be clear. Russia's unprovoked and  brutal invasion of a sovereign and democratic Ukraine is the  provocation here; not us, not the military assistance we are providing  Ukraine just to be able to defend their homeland and their families.   President Biden must be forward-leaning in providing military  assistance to the Ukrainians that they need and make it clear that we  are in this conflict until it ends--until Russian troops leave, until  the bombardments end. If President Putin senses weakness or  equivocation on our part or the part of our allies, he will intensify  his attacks on Ukraine.   I want to speak for a moment about the broader situation in Europe.  Back in 2014, Ukraine made this decision to ally with us, with Europe,  with freedom, with democracy, rather than Russia and authoritarianism  and tyranny. Russia did not take that well. Again, that is when they  annexed Crimea here and parts of the Donbas, Luhansk, and Donetsk. When  they did that, the reaction of the West was, frankly, underwhelming.  When President Putin launched this war--comprehensive war--on February  24, he probably expected the same feckless response. The global  community, when these two happened, really did not respond  as forcefully as we should have. Instead of getting the same response  that he expected, President Putin initiated an abrupt reversal,  particularly in European diplomacy and military policy.    Previously, Europe prioritized avoiding any conflict with Russia by  following practices that they believed would be seen by the Kremlin as  nonconfrontational. The European and the global approach, including the  U.S. approach, to Russia and Ukraine changed when this unjustified and  brutal assault began.   Just as President Putin has weakened Russia's position with his  unprovoked invasion, the NATO alliance that he tried to undermine has  [[Page S2655]]  only grown stronger. In fact, two new countries, Finland and Sweden,  have now officially applied for the 30-member-strong NATO membership.   In the aftermath of Russia's invasion, public support for joining  NATO skyrocketed in Finland and Sweden. This is especially remarkable  in Sweden, whose policy of neutrality dates all the way back to the  Napoleonic Wars, well before World War II. But as President Putin has  indiscriminately killed innocent men, women, and children in Ukraine  and flattened some of the most beautiful cities, the Finnish and  Swedish people have seen the benefit of NATO as a security blanket for  them too.   I am glad Finland and Sweden applied to join NATO. It is the world's  most successful military alliance in history. Each of these two  countries has an impressive military and a commitment to higher defense  spending, so they have a lot of value to add to the NATO alliance.  Their membership will further tilt the power base in Europe in NATO's  favor and that is good for peace and tranquility. It is good for the  United States, and it is good for our allies.   I was pleased that President Biden hosted the leaders of both those  countries last week and that Leader McConnell also visited Finland and  Sweden when he was overseas just a couple of weeks ago. I join the  leader in calling for the Senate to approve their membership bids to  NATO before the August recess. Let's make the United States the first  country to approve their applications for NATO membership.   I understand that all 30 of our NATO allies have been supportive,  with one exception, Turkey. They have expressed concerns about Finland  and Sweden joining the alliance for issues unrelated to NATO, in my  view. I trust these issues can be worked out among the three countries  and encourage the administration to take a lead in moving this  application forward. Joining NATO is a serious matter of war and peace.  No one should be playing politics here. I look forward to supporting  Finland and Sweden's NATO application when they are voted on here in  this Chamber.   The Russian military has suffered substantial losses in this war  already. Exact estimates are impossible to come by, but it appears in  just the first 3 months of this war, Russia has lost as many soldiers  as it did in the 9-year war that they waged in Afghanistan.   Let's remember that President Putin thought this would be an easy  victory. He thought Ukraine's defenses would be torn apart and  shattered in a matter of days and the Ukrainians would lose all hope  and all morale. And he thought his actions would split NATO, that the  alliance would be unable to respond. Clearly, the opposite has been the  case.   And within Russia, there has been dissent, as well. Last week, Boris  Bondarev, Counselor at the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation  to United Nations in Geneva resigned his post. His letter to his  colleagues is telling. This is from a senior Russian official:         For 20 years of my diplomatic career, I have seen turns of       our foreign policy, but never have I been so ashamed of my       country as on February 24 of this year--    Referring to the date the invasion was launched.         The aggressive war unleashed by Putin and the entire       Western world is not only a crime against the Ukrainian       people, but also, perhaps, the most serious crime against the       people of Russia, with a bold letter Z crossing out all hopes       and prospects for a prosperous free society in our country.    He is right. There have also been reports of many rank-and-file  Russian soldiers who oppose this war and refuse to fight. And there is  a recent report of a Russian officer who became so disillusioned with  the lies he had been told, he resigned in protest. His own words are  telling:         We had a radio receiver, and we could listen to the news.    He said this to CNN, by the way.         That's how I learned that shops are closing in Russia and       the economy is collapsing. I felt guilty about this. But felt       even more guilty because we came to Ukraine.    And he should. This resignation is telling as Russians from every  part of society are beginning to see this war for what it is-- unprovoked, tragic, shameful acts of aggression that have brought  international condemnation and shame to Russia as a nation. I am  confident this is the first of many acts of conscience by senior and  junior Russian officials as they seek to restore some level of honor  and dignity to their Nation. Kremlin officials and commandos on the  ground should know that the world is watching and the war crimes are  being recorded. It is not too late to say no to orders to attack and  kill your innocent neighbors in Ukraine.    Now, as I have mentioned over the last several weeks as we talked  about that, there are a number of very important sanctions that are in  place. We talked about trading sanctions; eliminating Russia's tax  status; banking sanctions to crush the economy in Russia; the desperate  need right now for us to focus more on energy and boycotting energy  supplies because that is the single most important sanction that has  not been put in place in the way it needs to be. It is funding the  Putin war machine. Europe is making progress on this. In fact, by  August, we are told, they will no longer be buying Russian coal, for  example. But Russia is still getting from Europe $870 million a day in  energy receipts, and that is funding the Putin war machine.   Especially when Russia not only continues its onslaught on Ukrainian  defensive combatants but on noncombatants, these sanctions must be  tightened. And what they are doing is committing war crimes. I call on  the International Criminal Court, which has announced an investigation  already, to follow in Ukraine's footsteps and immediately begin a war  crimes tribunal now--don't wait--because it can have a deterrent effect  if it is done now.   We continue to hear the stories every day, and the stories get worse  and worse. I was glad to hear that a court in Kyiv began hearings  against Sergeant Vadim Shishimarin, the first Russian soldier to go on  trial for alleged war crimes. He is accused of shooting and killing a  62-year-old civilian man in the northeastern Ukrainian region of Sumy  in late February just a few yards from his home. He pled guilty, and  just yesterday--yesterday--he was sentenced to life in prison.   Again, Russian officials and commanders need to see this. These war  crimes are being committed, they are being prosecuted, and there will  be consequences.   Sadly, this one case we talked about is just a drop in the bucket.  Ukraine's Prosecutor General has said that her office is currently  investigating more than 10,000 alleged war crimes by Russian forces  involving more than 600 suspects. It will take a vast amount of time  and resources to hold these criminals to account, and the United States  should help Ukraine in this regard. The supplemental spending package  we talked about includes money to do just that--to investigate and  document war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Russian  forces in Ukraine.   My hope is that holding these Russians accountable will have that  deterrent effect.   Because of these terrible actions, I believe Russia also deserves to  be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism. I believe the Senate  should vote on that. In Chechnya, in Syria, and now in Ukraine, Russia  has committed atrocities that reflect a complete disregard for the  value of human life. It has terrorized its neighbors and committed  clear war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.   Let me be clear. What the Russian military is doing in Ukraine is not  just the product of individual undisciplined units; tacit approval for  acts like these come from the top of the command chain.   I have mentioned America's leadership stateside and what everyday  Americans have done in light of this Russian aggression and their  support for Ukraine. It is truly impressive. It is happening in my  State of Ohio and around the country, the contributions in so many  ways: the medical supplies that have been sent, the personal vanity  kits that have been sent, the amount of food that has been voluntarily  given through the World Central Kitchen and others. But tonight I want  to close with a few thoughts on our leadership abroad as President  Biden is wrapping up his first trip to Asia.   First, I commend the President for taking this trip and for working  with  [[Page S2656]]  our allies. As China continues to advance its interest not only  throughout the Indo-Pacific but around the globe, it is so important  that the United States help lead freedom-loving countries in countering  their malign actions too.   I visited the region last month with some of my colleagues, and my  takeaway was that our partners in the region have a newfound interest  in working with us, allying with us, particularly with what is going on  with regard to China's aggressive behavior in the Indo-Pacific region.   I also think one of the best ways to push back against what China is  doing and considering doing, particularly with regard to Taiwan, is for  us to win in Ukraine. Russia being defeated in Ukraine will affect what  happens in the Indo-Pacific region.   China right now is entirely aligned with Russia. Their joint  statement earlier this year says, as the invasion was being planned,  ``Friendship between [our] two States has no limits, there are no  `forbidden' areas of cooperation.''   We are now seeing China's attempt to extend their reach with a base  in the Solomon Islands, as an example. We heard about this when we were  over there. They have negotiated in secret a security agreement to  allow Beijing to send military personnel to this new Pacific ally of  theirs and base naval vessels potentially on the islands. This would be  terrible for the region, particularly for Australia--their eastern  border is only about 1,200 miles away from the Solomon Islands.   In Ukraine, we have shown strong leadership. We must not stop now  when it comes to our allies across the globe. It doesn't matter if it  is Russia or China--we must be the beacon of strength for the free  world and help bring people together. To do so, we must also start  thinking about what it will take to aid Ukraine in the long term. I am  not talking about nation building here, but I am talking about helping  them in terms of this protracted conflict with Russia and ensuring that  we do rebuild a democratic and free Ukraine. Thinking ahead in this  fashion may seem premature to some, but I do believe it can save  resources in the long run by thinking about how to plan for that now.    In short, we should plan for the possibility of a longer conflict  than we had originally anticipated.   Again, our role in Ukraine is essential, but it is a role that  combines us with so many other partners around the world. Again, over  40 countries are helping right now in terms of assistance to Ukraine.  We are not the world's policeman, but we are kind of like the world's  sheriff, and bringing in that posse of other freedom-loving countries  is so critical for us to do, whether it is in the Indo-Pacific region  or whether it is in regard to Ukraine. We have had tremendous success  in terms of bringing people together to stand for freedom, to stand for  democracy, and to stand for the rights of the Ukrainian people.   With that, I yield the floor.
