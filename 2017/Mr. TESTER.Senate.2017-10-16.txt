 Mr. President, today I wish to honor George James Wright,  a resident of Laurel, MT, and a veteran of the Second World War.   George, I would like to thank you and your family on behalf of  Montana and the United States of America for your service to our Nation  in times of war.   George was born on June 14, 1923, in Hinsdale, MT.   Like many Montanans from Valley County, he made a living off the land  farming and ranching. He worked hard alongside his older brother, where  he remembers driving the tractor and looking up into the big blue  Montana sky.   Also, like many Montanans, he did not back down from answering the  call to serve his Nation when we needed him most.   In 1943, George enlisted in the Army, making him the first in his  family to serve in the military.   He spent over 2 years fighting in the jungles and on the beaches of  the Philippines and New Guinea as a proud member of the 32nd Infantry  Division.   He braved the mud. He braved the rain. He braved the bugs, and he  braved the bullets.   He saw the unimaginable, as Japanese kamikaze pilots slammed their  airplanes into American ships.   He did the unbelievable, driving Army bulldozers into the unknown,  making sure our soldiers got the supplies and food they desperately  needed.   He served our Nation with bravery, courage, and dignity, working his  way up to the rank of T5.   After America's victory, George came home, and returned to those same  Montana fields and skies.   After seeing the war's destruction firsthand, he knew that the world  needed to be rebuilt, and he knew he was the person for the job. He  took what he learned on the battlefield and spent his next years doing  construction work.   He married the love of his life, Vivian, who we remember today, and  they had two children Roland and Sharon.   At the time, he did not receive the recognition that he was due for  his service to our Nation, but we are here today to make that right.   Now, a proud father, grandfather of two, and great-grandfather of  seven, he will get that long overdue acknowledgement.   I have the proud honor of presenting him with the following: Bronze  Star Medal with one Bronze Service Star, Good Conduct Medal--Army,  American Campaign Medal with three Bronze Service Stars, World War II  Victory Medal, Philippine Liberation Ribbon with one Bronze Service  Star, and Honorable Service Lapel Pin--WWII.   George, you are a Montana farmer through and through, whether feeding  Americans at home or soldiers in the field.   I am proud to call myself a farmer, if only because it means I have  something in common with a man like George Wright.   George, you have spent your life providing for Montanans at home and  protecting Americans overseas.   These medals serve as a small token of our Nation's appreciation for  your service and your sacrifice. You are an American hero and one of  Montana's best. Thank you for your service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor Gerald Robert  Zelmer, a veteran of the Vietnam war.   Gerald, I would like to thank you, on behalf of the State of Montana,  and the United States of America, for your service to this Nation.   Gerald, known by his friends and family as Gerry, was born in  Bismarck, ND, on June 25, 1947.   He married the love of his life, Dora Jean or D.J., on October 12,  1968, in Worden, MT, at the height of the Vietnam conflict.   Two months later, Gerry was off to war.   He attended boot camp in Fort Lewis, WA, and then moved on to  advanced infantryman training in Fort Eustis, VA.   He deployed soon thereafter, serving proudly with the 101st Airborne  Division out of Camp Eagle.   Gerry served as a helicopter crew chief, ensuring that pilots and  crews were safe as they flew aerial missions. His skills on the  battlefield ensured that rotary-wing aircraft were fine-tuned and ready  to take off for their missions.   Gerry is a fixer and a problem solver.   In Vietnam, he fixed helicopters and kept our birds in the air,  covering our soldiers on the ground.   When he returned from war, he worked as a maintenance foreman at  Montana Sulphur and Chemical.   It is his skills on the battlefield, his bravery and courage, and his  service to our Nation that earned him these commendations decades ago.  It is my honor to finally deliver them today.   As a father to Carrie and Cody and grandfather to two grandchildren  Sienna and Aden, he will get that long overdue acknowledgement.   I have the proud honor of presenting you, Gerry, with the Bronze Star  Medal for your meritorious service in connection with ground operations  against a hostile force.   I am also presenting you with copies of your previous awards: Army  Commendation Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service  Medal with Silver Service Star attachment, Expert Badge with Auto Rifle  Bar, and sharpshooter badge with rifle bar.   Gerry, these medals are but a small token of our Nation's  appreciation for your service and your sacrifice. You are an American  hero, and Montana is proud to call you one of our own.                            ____________________
