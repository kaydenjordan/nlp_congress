 I thank Senator Tester, Senator Isakson, Senator  Gillibrand, and Senator Blumenthal.   This is the cost of war. This is simple. If you were exposed to  poison while serving our country, you deserve the benefits you have  earned--no exception. My office holds roundtables with veterans all  over the State. We have held more than a dozen over the past several  months. We hear Ohio veteran after Ohio veteran raise this issue time  and again.   Joe Benedict from Cleveland talked about how important these benefits  are to veterans like him. Last week, I met with Mike Kvintus, another  blue water Navy veteran from Cambridge, OH. He is 71 years old, and he  drove 4 hours from his home in Eastern Ohio to get here. He talked to  Members of Congress about what a burden the senseless policy is for so  many veterans he knows who have already sacrificed for this  [[Page S7382]]  country. He urged us to put politics aside.   That is what Senator Tester and Senator Gillibrand and Senator  Isakson have asked us to do. Last year, we introduced the Blue Water  Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, which would guarantee that all Vietnam  veterans exposed to toxic Agent Orange chemicals have equal access to  the care and benefits they have earned.   A number of us, myself included, raised the issue with VA Secretary  Wilkie, both in private meetings in our office and in the Veterans'  Affairs Committee, pressing him to expand benefits to all veterans.   Mr. Kvintus and Mr. Benedict and all of the veterans in our States-- Georgia, Connecticut, Montana, New York, and Ohio--we all hear this. We  all know that these veterans put themselves in harm's way. It is the  cost of war.   We need to show the American people we can work together. We should  start by putting partisanship aside, passing this bill tonight, and  finally getting the care for veterans that they deserve.   I yield the floor.
