 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7217, the  IMPROVE Act, which includes several important Medicaid provisions,  including the ACE Kids Act. I have been a cosponsor of the ACE Kids Act  since its first introduction.   Mr. Speaker, in the Tampa area, we have St. Joseph's Children's  Hospital. They run a Chronic-Complex Clinic for children. This medical  home is a great model that the ACE Kids Act is trying to build on.   This integrated care model, where the care is built around the needs  of the patient, has made a huge difference in the lives of so many  children. I am excited that, finally, we have reached the finish line  on the ACE Kids Act.   I thank former full committee chairman and also, I guess--well, I am  not sure, but he is a great guy. Yes, he is vice chairman of the  committee. I thank him for all of his hard work on the ACE Kids and the  IMPROVE Acts. I also thank my colleague Kathy Castor for being  relentless. The two of them are relentless on behalf of our children.   I thank all the children that came up and advocated for this bill as  well.   So, in any case, we are going to get this done. We couldn't do it  without these two, so thank you very much.
