 Mr. Speaker, surely the new Speaker cannot remain  committed to his macabre choice of providing military assistance to  Israel while denying it to Ukraine, which is fighting against Putin's  invasion in the largest land war in Europe since the Second World War,  or Taiwan, whose people are fighting so valiantly to oppose Communist  Chinese encroachment on their sovereignty.   While posing for photos, the Speaker claimed he cannot identify  adequate funds, so he wants to raid the Internal Revenue Service of  sophisticated accountants who hold billionaires and corporate tax  cheats accountable for not paying their fair share of taxes, including  illicit criminal groups funding terrorists.   These cuts will decrease revenue--are you ready?--$26.7 billion. You  heard me right.   Extremist Republicans kneel before the thrones of Wall Street scions  while blocking military assistance to valiant nations and people  fighting for liberty against evil empires that hate liberty, like Xi's  China and Putin's Russia.   Mr. Speaker, that is what I call warped thinking. The Speaker should  go back to the drawing board.   Liberty and justice first and always.                            ____________________
