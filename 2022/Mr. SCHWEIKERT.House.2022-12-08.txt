 Mr. Speaker, you got to admit, a lot of people love  Representative Keller. It has been fun, actually, watching them come up  to the microphone and say actually sweet things about him. But the best  thing is his granddaughter, my little girl just loves playing with her.   That is something I do hope this body does more of in the future--our  kids. In the last couple of years they haven't been here. Before the  pandemic, we would look out and people would have their families here.  I will tell you, that helped in the relationships.   My little girl would go and jump on Maxine Waters' lap because she  loved her necklace. I still have a great picture of that. Until this  day, every time I see Ms. Waters she asks about my little girl. In some  ways, it is those family units and how you build human relations in  this body.    Just a thought for what is left of the majority and those things. We  need to sort of think about the things that bind us together once again  as people.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Keller giving me a little bit of time  here.   Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons we are doing this is we have been  trying to do a series of presentations, and I keep being fussed at that  I should do them shorter because we are trying to throw out lots of  ideas.   For the last year, I have been coming behind the microphone and  walking through just how terrified I am, and how terrified I believe  all of us should be, on what is going on in the numbers. We are going  to do the routine again. The beauty here is there is hope, and I am  going to keep bringing ideas that do a couple things.   Number one: Make us freer, healthier, wealthier, but also show a path  that we can grow, and we don't have to be crushed by the coming debt.  Let's sort of walk through some of this.   We always start with this slide because this one really bothers  everyone. This one makes everyone angry and it is the math. Today, we  have $31 trillion of debt. In the next 30 years we add $114 trillion of  borrowing. Every dime of that $114 trillion that is coming, 75 percent  of it is Medicare, 25 percent is Social Security. The rest of the  budget actually has a positive balance.   We got old.   Is the graying of America Republican or Democrat?   It is neither. It is just demographics; it is what we are. The  unwillingness to deal with the reality that if you want to save the  country--if you do not want my 5-month-old little boy that we are  adopting, my 7-year-old little girl that plays together with others, if  you want to save their future--do understand, today, 25 years from now  we have to double their tax rates; we have to double your tax rates; we  have to double corporations' tax rates just to maintain the baseline  spending, and that is still with us going to like 140 percent of debt  to GDP.   Do we understand how bad the numbers are?   It is demographics. So what do you do?   I am trying to pitch sort of a unified theory for us to think about.  I am sorry this upsets people, but the math will always win. Instead of  the craziness that goes on around here with where ``I got my feelings  hurt,'' maybe the most powerful thing we can do is demonstrate we give  a damn.   Growth is moral. Growth helps Democrats and Republicans, it helps  poor people, it gives opportunity to the middle class. It is good for  all of us. We are trying to say, okay, I have been spending lots of  time behind the microphone talking about technology that can crash the  price of healthcare. We are going to do a little more of that today.   But I am going to also talk about other ways we can do regulation  that keeps us still healthy and safe but is much less bureaucratic and  much faster. I am going to come back in the next couple weeks, if we  get time, and talk about revolutionizing the tax system that  incentivizes us to make things in America instead of functionally a tax  system that incentivizes us to buy things made in other parts of the  world because that is what we have today.   We are going to also talk about immigration--it is really  uncomfortable to talk about, you are going to have to decide as a  society: Do we keep the open borders that I have in Arizona where we  functionally have a mass poverty movement into the United States? Or do  we move to a system that maximizes economic growth?   You have got to decide, if you want us to have the money to be able  to pay for Medicare, I have to have the economic growth.   Then the other thing is, what do we do to incentivize our brothers  and sisters to stay in the labor market?   You just became 65. Are there things that we could do in a spiff on  your Social Security, so you stay in the labor market?   How about if we let you keep your half of the FICA? What can we do?   There is a crazy piece of math out there for under 35, particularly  males--they are not participating--there are numbers of them who have  disappeared from the labor markets. This makes some of the math really  difficult if you are trying to grow because it is not enough to have  the disruption in the cost of the healthcare, if on the same side over  here we don't have the economic growth.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to run through these fairly quickly because I  want to keep the theme going. I am going to be dogged about this  because we are going to save this country. We need to think a little  bit differently because right now we are still having the same debates  that we were having in the 1990s on this floor.   Last night, I mentioned this. Tonight, I thought I would bring the  board with me. What would happen if I came to you tomorrow, and said:  Hey, there is this thing that looks like a kazoo, and you blow in it  and it almost instantly tells you you have a virus. It instantly  bounces off your medical records. It instantly could order your  antiviral. Oh, and by the way, the newest versions look like they can  detect about 25 different dead cancer proteins.   Wouldn't that be really good for our constituents? Wouldn't that be-- the ability for that hardworking family, that working mom, to not try  to find a way to take the day off from work, to be able to organize the  kids, to find out if she can go into an urgent care center, but  functionally have a breath biopsy in her medicine cabinet?   I will argue that it is both moral, it is faster, it is healthier,  and it crashes the price of healthcare. This body keeps that type of  technology illegal. It is something that would save so much time for  the working people in this country, and we keep it illegal because this  place is so much like a protection racket. It is not utopian, there are  a dozen different versions, and it exists. Much of it has already made  it through the FDA. Our problem is we don't reimburse it and we don't  make it legal so it can write the script.   If you don't reduce the cost, you can't do marginal--I have some  people come in here and say, well, we have an idea. We can remove 2 or  3 percent out of healthcare costs if we do this. We had 16 percent  healthcare inflation in many of our markets so far this year. Great, we  can find a 1 or 2 percent rounding error.   Do you understand how much trouble we are in?   Your government functionally is an insurance company with an army. It  is going to be an insurance company where the insurance side is going  to start consuming every dollar and the army is going to have to get  smaller. It is demographics. It is the reality where we are.                                time  1530    Why wouldn't this body take an experiment and say let's make it  legal. If you can find insurance, if the manufacturer can find  insurance for it, FDA approves it, why wouldn't we let this write a  script? There are dozens and dozens and dozens of these things.   For those of that walk around with these smartwatches or your fancy  supercomputer in your pocket, the fact of the matter is, we should be  using every piece of technology to crash the price of healthcare.   Last night, I came and showed some slides about a path, and who  knows, maybe it doesn't work. But there might be a path for a cure for  diabetes. Diabetes is 33 percent of all healthcare  [[Page H8864]]  spending. It is 31 percent of all Medicare spending. It may be the  leading contributor to income inequality.   You go, huh? Look at the data. Look at my data sets of who is  suffering, who is going blind, who is having their feet cut off.   I represent a tribal community with the second highest per capita  diabetes in the world. Is it moral not for us to go and throw every  smart idea and sometimes the resources we need to cure it?   Wouldn't that be more moral than this crazy ass argument of, hey,  let's go build more clinics so we can help people manage their misery,  because that is what we do here. We are better than this. Well, no, we  are not better than this, but we could be.   So let's go a little further down the crazy line of, what do you do  to grow the economy? So think about what we did last week. We are going  to stop this strike because we are going to fight for the way we move  goods out of the port and put them on trucks and then put them on a  rail car and move it over here.   Yes, we have all the environmental issues of, yes, it is really  dirty, it is really filthy. Oh, but the Democrats in their inflation  reduction--crazy name for what the bill actually did--bill, made it so  if they are going to take the green money, they can't actually do  certain innovation; they can't automate because they have to protect  all their longshoremen union folks because that is who writes them  checks.   So in one hand, we give great lip service; we have got to fix the  supply chain; we have got to get greener in the economy. And then they  make it illegal. It is in your legislation. You did it.   Yet, at the same time, we have brilliant innovators--and these things  aren't Republican, they are just the next generation of innovation--of  autonomous rail platforms. You take the container off; you put it on  the platform. You hit the button and you say, go to the spur over here  and dump this at the warehouse. Go take this and put at the  manufacturing facility.   It is electric. The environmental load is dramatically cleaner. It  would be a revolution of efficiency.   We keep saying, well, we have got to fix the supply chain. Well, damn  it, you made parts of fixing the supply chain illegal.   Why does this place act like a barrier, a protection barrier of  allowing innovation in the economy?   We do this over and over and over. Most of the Members don't know it  is happening. But we have functionally made that disruption that grows  the economy, that if we don't have that growth, we are absolutely--we  are in real trouble. Go ahead.    We make it illegal.    How many times--and you have some of this in your  district--will we get the lobbyists and the folks come in--and this has  been going on for 30 years, so this is sort of one of the running joke  scams around here.   We need money for rural broadband. We do. I have--well, communities  in Arizona--I don't represent them--they have been waiting 20 years for  that line to get out to the chapter house on the Navajo reservation.   The fact of the matter is every inch of this country actually has  broadband right now. They just happen to be satellites. We have what,  five companies? A couple of them already have most of the satellites  up.    What is yours? I drive a long-bed pickup truck.    When I had my midlife crisis, I didn't want a new  wife or a Porsche, I just wanted a long-bed pickup truck; and mine is  10 years old.    But you think about this; if I really cared about  that community--and you see where this ties in, this is back to that  unified theory. I believe much of my healthcare I can use technology,  but I need access to the broadband. But I am going to wait for the wire  to show up because that is incredibly inefficient.   But I do have an option right now where something like the Starlink  satellites, I could actually put up a little oval-shaped dish so they  have the broadband, so they can use the healthcare technology, let  alone the education technology and the other things. I need you to see  this as a unified theory.   But, instead, we are going to take that tax that is on your cell  phone bill, hand it out to companies, and then we are going to wait  another decade for that wire to get out; and it never gets there, when  they already have access to broadband.    This could be urban, too. The technologies exist. So let me go to  crazy town.    No, no, no. This is one, it is a little more  ethereal, but it is in the field. It is being tested right now. I am  not going to do the whole thing about a C4 plant and a C3 plant.  Remember your high school biology class.   But what would happen in a world--I am sorry, this slide is a little  old, so it is a little beaten on. How do you get the Agriculture  Committee to have an honest conversation saying, you do realize there  is about to be a revolution in food?   This whole thing called synthetic biology: They basically figured out  how to take a plant--our high school biology plant--the plant really,  really wants a carbon molecule so it turns it into a sugar so it can  grow. It accidentally grabs an oxygen. It doesn't need the oxygen, so  it has to spend all this energy getting rid of the oxygen so it gets a  carbon so it can grow.   What happens if the plant every time got a carbon molecule?   In some plants you could have a 40 percent improvement in growth;  dramatically less water; dramatically less land needed; dramatically  less fertilizer. This is being tested right now, I think it is  University of Illinois. It is out there.   How much discussion have we had that there is a revolution coming in  agriculture? And it would be incredibly productive. It would be  incredibly disruptive because, what happens in agriculture land if, all  of a sudden, I have crops that grow dramatically more efficiently?   But it would also be amazing for the environment. At 40 percent  production improvement--which you are not going to get, but if you did,  theoretically--in world agriculture, you do realize that would be like  removing every car off the face of the Earth.   How many hearings have we had on is this coming, is this feasible?   No, because that would require thinking, something we just don't do  here.   The other thing I am going to give you is just a conceptual idea, and  if anyone is crazy enough, go on YouTube, Schweikert Environmental  Crowdsourcing.   Five, 6 years ago, I did a little YouTube cartoon. It is like 90  seconds, with this concept, you could actually attach a little  environmental sensor to the bottom of this.   How about if in your community you had a couple of thousand people  driving around with a little environmental sensor saying, hey, we are  keeping an eye on the air quality. Hey, it is spouting off. I have some  clowns over here painting cars in the back of their house, but the  motorcycle paint shop over here that has its filters, it is not setting  the alarm off. Leave them alone.   What would happen if your environmental data was living data?   You wouldn't need people to go fill out paperwork. You don't need an  inspector. Do file cabinets full of paper make the environment cleaner?  They don't, they just build bureaucracy.  [[Page H8865]]    What makes the environment cleaner is knowing when someone has done  something stupid and stopping them.   Crowdsourcing. The data is living. Use a living data model. And guess  what? You can do that for water, for sound; you can actually do it for  health. You can do it for all sorts of things.   How many hearings has this place had to discuss dragging our  regulatory environment; and it is not deregulating, it is smart  regulating. Make us more efficient.   It turns out, the data says that we would be healthier, cleaner,  faster, and you would get the bad guys, and you could build a model  where you just leave the good actors alone.   If you are the motorcycle paint shop, and your filters are working,  and your booth is working, why should you be bothered? Just leave them  alone; and if they screw up, a crowdsourced environmental sensor model  will catch them instantly.   You would be amazed the pushback you get because, well, we are a  consulting firm. You just put us out of business. Hey, I work for the  group. I shove paperwork in the file cabinets. Why do you want to  unemploy me?   We are going to have to have the discussion if we intend to survive,  where we are going population-wise, debt-wise.   Remember, functionally, in 10 years, we have two $1 trillion running  deficits, and it is demographics. It is trying to pay for healthcare.  We have got to have the growth, and we have got to have the technology  disruption and healthcare, or we are in for some very dark times.   The fact of the matter is, we could have incredibly prosperous times  for the future. But that prosperity is only going to come if I, and  you, and the people who are willing to listen to this are willing to  pound on Members of Congress and our staff and the lobbying communities  and our creative thinkers out there and say, okay, guys. There is hope  out there. There is hope. We just need to be willing to think  differently and embrace the disruption and embrace an economy that  actually starts to do good things for our people, instead of basically  being a protection racket for incumbent models.   It is uncomfortable, but there is hope. But there is no hope if we  keep doing the same thing.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for letting me do  this. We are finding the only way it is going to sink in is if I keep  coming and giving more and more examples that there is hope if we just  do things differently. So I thank the gentleman for giving me some of  his time.
