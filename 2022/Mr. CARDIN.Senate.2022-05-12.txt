 Mr. President, 1 month ago, Russian authorities arrested  Vladimir Kara-Murza, a tireless advocate for a democratic Russia and  longtime Putin critic, on the street near his apartment in Moscow.  While he was in detention for a fabricated administrative violation,  they charged him further with ``spreading deliberately false  information'' about the armed forces of Russia, which was criminalized  under a Russian law passed after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He  is currently in pretrial detention and could face up to 15 years in  prison if convicted.   Vladimir is a friend and frequent visitor to the offices of many  Members of Congress, myself included. His wife and children live in  Virginia, and he splits his time between the United States and Russia,  where he was born and raised. Vladimir has a special relationship with  the Helsinki Commission and a keen interest in using parliamentary  diplomacy to rally other nations against the Putin regime's  undemocratic and violent policies, particularly the war in Ukraine.   Vladimir was instrumental in the development and passage of the  Magnitsky Act. In fact, a number of colleagues and I recently sent a  letter to President Biden urging that the administration impose  Magnitsky Act sanctions on every Russian official and associate  involved in Vladimir's false arrest and unjust detention.   That Vladimir continues to return to Russia after multiple  poisonings, arrests, and other tribulations is a testament to his  profound courage and dedication to his fellow citizens. He feels that  he cannot, in good conscience, call on Russians to risk their freedom  and lives to resist the evils and complacency of Putin's Russia if he  is comfortably out of harm's way himself.   Two weeks before his arrest, Vladimir testified at a Helsinki  Commission hearing on propaganda and censorship in Russia, where he  warned that speaking out against the war in Ukraine is now grounds for  prosecution in Russia, yet he refused to be silent.   Though now deprived of his physical freedom and in grave danger,  Vladimir's spirit is unbroken; he is unafraid; and he continues to  believe that Russia will one day become a democratic, European state.  He sees the Ukraine war as the last desperate gasp of Putinism, the  beginning of the end.   In our many meetings over the years, Vladimir has always reminded us  of the need to remember prisoners of conscience and speak their names.  As Vladimir now ranks among these hundreds in Russia, and even more  throughout the rest of the world, we will remember him. I call upon my  colleagues to do the same; there is hope and power in not being  forgotten.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter to President  Biden that I referred to a moment ago be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                        May 5, 2022.      President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear President Biden: We urge you to name and sanction       every Russian official and associate involved with the false       arrest, detention, and political persecution of Vladimir       Kara-Murza. Kara-Murza is a Russian opposition politician who       has long stood up against Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. He       embodies what Russia might be one day when it is democratic       and free. We also urge you to examine whether to sanction       those involved in the persecution and imprisonment of other       Russian political prisoners.        Kara-Murza is a Russian patriot who has fought for decades       for democracy in Russia and a prosperous future for his       country. For this, the regime in Russia has poisoned him       twice. On April 11, while in Russia, Kara-Murza called this       regime ``a regime of murderers.'' He was then arrested, and       now faces trumped up charges that may result in years of       unjust imprisonment.        Kara-Murza was the key Russian activist behind the passage       of the Magnitsky Act and its adoption by our allies. The late       Senator John McCain called him ``one of the most passionate       and effective advocates for the passage of the Magnitsky       Act.'' Kara-Murza himself, like his mentor Boris Nemtsov       before him, has called the Magnitsky Act the most ``pro-      Russian law passed in the United States in the history of our       countries.'' Nemtsov was murdered in front of the Kremlin.        The Magnitsky Act is the appropriate tool to sanction those       involved in the persecution of Kara-Murza. We ask that you       coordinate with our allies to sanction these individuals at       the same time. The European Union, the United Kingdom,       Canada, and Australia now all have Magnitsky sanctions laws       of their own.        As Russia loses its brutal war of aggression against       Ukraine, we must consider what might come next in that       country. Kara-Murza offers a vision of a Russia free from       imperialist kleptocracy. He has bravely answered the call of       many Ukrainians for Russians to take a stand and oppose this       bloody  [[Page S2488]]       and senseless war. He must be immediately freed and allowed       to continue his work.            Sincerely,          Ben Cardin, Jeanne Shaheen, Roger Wicker, Sheldon             Whitehouse, U.S. Senators.
