 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Westerman for yielding  me the time.   Mr. Speaker, as has been mentioned, this bill would add 1.5 million  new acres of wilderness area, monument expansion, and scenic rivers.  That sounds pretty good. Now, here is the rest of the story, and it is  coming from someone whose home State is two-thirds federally owned.   This bill also comes with a critical mineral ban on things like  uranium. China and Russia will thank us for that.   This bill also comes with a ban on any active land management, which  is a welcome mat for wildfires. It is simple. If we don't manage, a  lightning strike will. Now, that is too bad for wildlife, the  environment, and productive use, but at least we get the privilege of  spending taxpayer dollars for fire suppression.   Mr. Speaker, we can't rationalize the contents in this bill to the  objective American taxpayer, but that is what happens when legislation  gets rammed through without one markup or adequate bipartisan review.
