 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2119,  the bipartisan Family Violence Prevention and Services Improvement Act.  As policymakers, we have an obligation to do all we can to address the  domestic violence epidemic and to support survivors.   In 2021, the annual Domestic Violence Counts Report from the National  Network to End Domestic Violence, found that more than 76,000 adults  and children nationwide received potentially lifesaving services from  emergency shelters and hotlines in one 24-hour period. Tragically,  during that same day, more than 11,000 survivors' requests could not be  fulfilled because of a lack of resources. That is unacceptable.   We must better fulfill our responsibility to the millions of  survivors who carry the trauma of experiencing domestic violence, and  whose safety and well-being depends on access to these services.   There is a clear need to update and strengthen our Federal programs  to prevent intimate partner violence and better serve survivors. This  critical reauthorization includes a much-needed investment to increase  funding for the Family Violence and Prevention Services Act, which will  help close national resource gaps.   Additionally, communities of color, LGBTQ individuals, and people  with disabilities face disproportionate rates of intimate partner  violence while too often having limited access to services.   Importantly, this bill will make sure that resources do reach  culturally-specific programs and community-based organizations that are  better equipped to serve the needs of survivors who face historic  violence and systemic inequities.   As chair of the Civil Rights and Human Services Subcommittee, I was  honored to hold a hearing that examined evidence-based solutions to  prevent and end domestic violence. Passing this legislation takes a  critical step in fulfilling our obligation to eradicate intimate  partner violence wherever and whenever it occurs.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman McBath and Chairman Scott for  their leadership in working to update this important legislation to  keep individuals and families safe, and I urge all of my colleagues to  support the bill.  [[Page H5898]]    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters in support of the bill  from the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence and the National  Network to End Domestic Violence.                                                   National Resource                                     Center on Domestic Violence,                                 Harrisburg, PA, September 20, 2021.      Rep. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Rep. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, House Committee on Education & Labor, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Rep. Steny Hoyer,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Rep. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Chairman Scott,       and Republican Leader McCarthy: Thank you for your leadership       and the Committee's work to eradicate gender-based violence       through the bipartisan Family Violence Prevention and       Services Act (FVPSA), H.R. 2119. The National Resource Center       on Domestic Violence (NRCDV) endorses H.R. 2119 which will       provide core supports and enhance comprehensive responses to       domestic violence and urges Members to vote YES on final       passage. FVPSA provides critical support for shelters,       coalitions, training and technical assistance centers,       children's services, emergency response hotlines, and       prevention initiatives.        In addition to its broader systems impact, for over 25       years FVPSA has been a critical resource to NRCDV's efforts       to provide training, technical assistance, and resource       development. Through programming such as the National       Capacity Building Center on Safe and Supportive Housing for       Domestic Violence Survivors and web resource repositories       such as VAWAnet, which receives 300,000 site visits per day--      an average of 800 visits per day from 210 countries and       territories around the world, NRCDV can lead innovative and       equitable solutions that address the housing needs of       survivors and resource needs of organizations serving them.        FVPSA also supports NRCDV's work to prevent domestic       violence through the PreventlPV Project. This project       enhances the capacity of state/territory domestic violence       coalitions and community-based domestic violence programs to       advance a comprehensive national prevention agenda and       broaden support for the full implementation of the agenda at       the national, state, territory, and local levels.       Additionally, the platform provides communities with access       to an inventory of searchable tools and materials utilized       and developed by prevention experts from across the country.        Finally, FVPSA supports NRCDV's work to support the       facilitation, coordination, and strategic collaboration       amongst the Domestic Violence Resource Network (DVRN). The       DVRN informs and strengthens domestic violence intervention       and prevention efforts at the individual, community, and       society levels through a network of two national resource       centers, four special issue resource centers, three       culturally specific resource centers, five emerging issue       resource centers, and the National Domestic Violence Hotline.       These examples are only a minor representation of the ways       FVPSA supports the work of NRCDV and enhances the impact of       on the ground advocacy efforts.        As you lead the efforts to pass H.R. 2119, Family Violence       Prevention and Services Improvements Act, we thank you again       for your leadership on behalf of survivors, their families,       and their communities around the country.            Sincerely,      Shenna Morris, M.A.,        Director of Policy, National Resource Center on Domestic       Violence.                                   ____                                             National Network to End                                               Domestic Violence,                                 Washington, DC, September 27, 2021.      Rep. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Rep. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, House Committee on Education & Labor, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Rep. Steny Hoyer,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Rep. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Chairman Scott,       and Republican Leader McCarthy: On behalf of our 56 member       state and territorial domestic violence coalitions, their       more than 2,000 local programs, and the millions of victims       they serve, the National Network to End Domestic Violence       (NNEDV) commends the Education and Labor Committee for       passage of the bipartisan Family Violence Prevention and       Services Improvement Act (FVPSA), H.R. 2119. H.R. 2119 would       bolster existing FVPSA programs and increase authorized       funding, while expanding access to tribes, tribal coalitions       working to end domestic violence, culturally specific       programs, and other underserved communities. We write today       to express NNEDV's strong support for the bill as reported       out of Committee and to urge all Members to vote yes on final       passage.        FVPSA is at the heart of our nation's response to domestic       violence services and supports lifesaving services including       emergency shelters, crisis hotlines, counseling, legal       assistance, and prevention education for communities       throughout the United States, American Indian and Alaska       Native communities, and U.S. territories. First authorized in       1984 and administered by the U.S. Department of Health and       Human Services, FVPSA is the only federal funding source       dedicated to domestic violence shelters and programs. FVPSA       expired in 2015 and must be reauthorized with key       enhancements in order to meet the growing needs of survivors.        Over 1,500 local, public, private, nonprofit, and faith-      based organizations domestic violence programs rely on FVPSA-      funding to keep their doors open to more than 1.3 million       victims seeking safety each year. NNEDV's 15th Annual       Domestic Violence Counts reports that on just one day in       2020, 76,525 domestic violence victims and their children       received essential services ranging from shelter to       counseling to legal advocacy. However, on that same day,       11,047 requests for services went unmet due to lack of       resources. Many communities and tribes currently have very       limited access to FVPSA funds. H.R. 2119 would bolster       existing FVPSA programs and increase authorized funding,       while expanding access to tribes, tribal coalitions working       to end domestic violence, culturally specific programs, and       other underserved communities. It is vital that access to       FVPSA funds be expanded through the passage of this bill.        The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected       survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, and family       violence. Survivors are at risk in a time of heightened       economic, health, familial, and emotional trauma. Direct       service providers are also grappling with the unprecedented       challenge of housing survivors and providing life-saving       services while following distance and separation protocols.       The improvements made in this bill will greatly help meet the       needs of survivors in the current crisis and beyond.        The important improvements in H.R. 2119 reflect the       priorities of the domestic violence field and the diverse       needs of survivors. These improvements include:        Bolstering and investing in lifesaving core victim services       and shelters;        Expanding support for and access to culturally specific       programs by authorizing a new grant program to provide       enhanced access to services for racial and ethnic minority       populations;        Strengthening the capacity of Indian tribes to exercise       their sovereign authority to more fully respond to domestic       violence in their communities by increasing resources for       tribes, authorizing funding for tribal coalitions, and       authorizing the currently funded Alaska Native Women's       Resource Center;        Meaningfully investing in domestic violence prevention by       increasing support for evidenceinformed prevention projects       and funding new initiatives that bring these approaches to       more communities across the country;        Creating a new underserved populations grant program; and        Increasing the funding authorization level to respond to       very low per-program funding levels and adjusting the current       formula to increase access to FVPSA funds for programs not       currently funded.        The bipartisan Family Violence Prevention and Services       Improvement Act (H.R. 2119) provides meaningful investments       in and expanded support for lifesaving domestic violence       shelters and services, including prevention, throughout the       country. NNEDV strongly endorses H.R. 2119 as reported out of       Committee and urges all Members to vote yes on final passage.            Sincerely,                                                 Deborah J. Vagins,                                           NNEDV President and CEO.                                time  1245
