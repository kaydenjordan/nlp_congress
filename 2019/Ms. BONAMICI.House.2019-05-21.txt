 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th  anniversary of the House passage of the 19th Amendment giving women the  right to vote.   Suffragettes across the country bravely fought for decades to make  that moment possible, enduring hardship and pervasive discrimination. I  think about trailblazing women like Oregon's Abigail Scott Duniway.   The right to vote empowered women to shape policy, elevated public  discourse, and more.   We have come a long way. There is a record number of women not only  voting but serving in Congress. With more women at the table, I hope we  will finally enact policies that support all women and their rights,  including the right to make our own reproductive  [[Page H4022]]  healthcare decisions, to affordable childcare, to paid family and  medical leave, to retirement security, and to equal pay for equal work.   We still have work to do. We must continue breaking down barriers so  future women leaders of all backgrounds can be heard. Together, we will  achieve great things.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in the celebration of the 19th  Amendment.                            ____________________
