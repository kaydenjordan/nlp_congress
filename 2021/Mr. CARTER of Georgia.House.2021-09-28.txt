 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Steve  Howard of Woodbine, Georgia, on his appointment to the National  Association of Counties' Environment, Energy, & Land Use Steering  Committee.   Known as an intensively hardworking leader, Steve's accomplishments  are impressive. Over the past several years, Steve has led one of the  most innovative and economic development projects in Georgia and  throughout the country.   He has shown exceptional leadership in the Spaceport Camden project  that is a tremendous opportunity for Georgia's First Congressional  District. The project encompasses many of the aspects of the committee,  making his expertise invaluable.   There is no county administrator who has as much knowledge in energy,  environment, and land use as Steve. I know he will be an amazing  resource for counties across the Nation. I am proud to see Steve  represent our district with the National Association of Counties.   I would like to congratulate Steve on his appointment and thank him  for his years of service to Georgia's First Congressional District.   savannah/hilton head international airport is an award-winning facility     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport for being awarded the  second-best domestic airport in the United States.   Complemented by an amazing staff, this airport has shown exemplary  service to its customers since 1929.   For the past 5 years, Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport has  ranked in the top 10 of best domestic airports in the United States.   This award highlights their hard work and dedication to ensure safety  and security, while offering the best customer service.   Savannah's airport has been a tremendous economic contributor to  Georgia's First Congressional District, supporting the community with  over 20,000 jobs. Although small in size, the Savannah/Hilton Head  International Airport has had a lasting impact on the people visiting  the great State of Georgia.   I want to extend my congratulations to the great staff, TSA workers,  and Savannah Airport Commission for their great work.   I look forward to the continued success of the Savannah/Hilton Head  International Airport.                                time  1045                    Remembering and Honoring Deborah Smith     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor Deborah Smith of Wayne County, Georgia, who, sadly, passed away  on September 12, at the age of 51.   Debi devoted her life to improving her community and the lives of  others. Debi loved volunteering and helping people.   Debi's love for her community was apparent during her time as the CEO  of United Way of South Georgia, where she served eight counties and 26  agencies.   A giant in her local community, Debi also served as the president of  the Rotary Club of Jesup and on the board of the Downtown Development  Authority.   Debi was recognized by the Wayne County Chamber of Commerce as  Ambassador of the Year for her selfless sacrifice toward her community.   I am thankful for the immense impact that Debi had on Georgia's First  Congressional District, and I know her legacy will remain.   My thoughts and prayers are with her family, friends, and all who  knew her, during this most difficult time.                            Recognizing Jeff Lurey     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor Jeff Lurey for his long and accomplished pharmacy career.   Jeff discovered his passion for helping others during his time at the  University of Georgia's School of Pharmacy. Following graduation, Jeff  bought his first pharmacy in 1973 and would go on to own five other  pharmacies.   Jeff's accomplishments are nothing short of extraordinary.   From starting the Georgia Pharmacy Foundation to his service on the  Georgia Pharmacy Association, Jeff's leadership has been felt  throughout the great State of Georgia.   During his accomplished career, Jeff served in numerous leadership  positions within the Georgia Pharmacy Association.   Jeff has received numerous awards throughout the State of Georgia for  his immense contributions to the pharmacy community.   While Jeff's work with the Georgia Pharmacy Association is coming to  an end, I am confident that his service to pharmacists will continue.   I am truly grateful for Jeff's contributions, and I thank him for his  years of service.

The Okefenokee Swamp Park opened their doors 75 years ago. Since  then, people from across the world have visited one of Georgia's most  desirable destinations. Each year, over 500,000 people visit the  Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.   As one of the largest intact freshwater wetlands in North America,  the Okefenokee is home to various threatened and endangered species.  More than 600 plant species have been identified at the Okefenokee.   This anniversary is not only a celebration of 75 years of preserving  history and wildlife but also as a beacon of what is to come in the  next 75 years.   I, along with the First District of Georgia, thank the staff at  Okefenokee Swamp Park for their stewardship of this beautiful park. I  am proud to represent parts of the Okefenokee, and I am excited for the  future.                            ____________________
