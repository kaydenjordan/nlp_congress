 Madam President, 20 years ago today, in the late  afternoon, shots rang out in this building. A mentally ill individual,  armed with a gun, was coming through security when he shot Capitol  Police Officer Jacob Chestnut. He then approached the Capitol office of  Tom DeLay and engaged Detective John Gibson, and they exchanged  gunfire. Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut lost their lives in the  line of duty while protecting this building's occupants and visitors.   There is no way of knowing how many lives they saved in their  sacrifice, but their families know that their sacrifice has not been  forgotten by all of us here. Their memory is a blessing to their  families and to all of us here who remember that awful day.   I join the distinguished Republican leader today in recognizing the  anniversary of their passing as a solemn reminder of the everyday  heroism practiced by the Capitol Police and their brothers and sisters  in blue all across the country.                            ____________________     Madam President, the Senate has a constitutional duty to  provide advice and consent and a special obligation to thoroughly  examine Supreme Court nominations. After all, there are few positions  in our government with greater importance or responsibility than a  lifetime appointment on the Nation's highest Court. It is now our job  to carefully, thoroughly, and methodically review the record of Judge  Brett Kavanaugh, and we have quite a job ahead of us.   As a partisan political lawyer during the Clinton and Bush years,  Brett Kavanaugh has a paper trail a mile long. There is no doubt the  White House and Leader McConnell were aware of this history when the  nomination was made. The length of Judge Kavanaugh's record, however,  is no reason to shirk our responsibility as Senators to review it.   Yet the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee has already  suggested there is no reason to review Judge Kavanaugh's full record  before proceeding with his nomination. Leader McConnell threatened to  play political hardball if Democrats insisted on obtaining Judge  Kavanaugh's full record. Senate Republicans are making hollow arguments  and petty attempts at advancing Judge Kavanaugh's nomination with as  little scrutiny as they can manage.   We have been having trouble getting an agreement with Judiciary  Committee Chairman Grassley on the scope of the documents the Senate  should request. Chairman Grassley has had our request for over a week.  It is the same request that was made when Elena Kagan was nominated to  the Supreme Court. It is the very same request that Republicans  insisted on, including Senator Grassley--he was not chairman then--and  Democrats agreed to when we were in charge.   Much like Judge Kavanaugh, Elena Kagan spent time in prior  administrations and had a lengthy paper trail, some of which could have  been labeled privileged. Did Democrats, in the majority at the time,  attempt to rush her nomination through? No. Did we lean on former  administrations to declare her documents privileged? No. Democrats  actually joined with the Republican minority to request a full and  complete accounting of Elena Kagan's record. Her former employer waived  all claims of privilege.   Let me show you the letter right here that my friend Senator Leahy,  then chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senator Jeff Sessions,  then ranking member, sent to the Clinton Library. Here is the letter.  What we have done is use the same letter. We are willing to issue the  exact same letter, except we have put the address of the person at the  Bush Library, changed the name of Kagan to Kavanaugh, and changed the  name of Clinton to Bush; otherwise, it is the exact same letter.   How can our Republican colleagues resist this simple letter when it  is the exact same letter they pushed for, and we acceded to, when the  shoe was on the other foot?   The letter requests the entirety of Elena Kagan's record, not part of  it, not a subset of it--all of it. What is good enough for Justice  Kagan is good enough for Judge Kavanaugh. You could simply replace her  name with Judge Kavanaugh's name throughout this letter, and the letter  would be exactly applicable today. This is the standard Democrats and  Republicans used to agree on, the Kagan standard--and it wasn't just  Senators Leahy and Sessions.   At the time, Senator Grassley, now chairman--the burden is on him to  help  [[Page S5229]]  us get a bipartisan letter--said: ``In order for the Senate to fulfill  its constitutional duty of advise and consent, we must get all of  [Elena Kagan's] documents from the Clinton Library and have enough time  to analyze them so we can determine whether she should be a Justice.''   Let me read it again. This is what Chairman Grassley said--now  chairman, then a member of the Judiciary Committee: ``In order for the  Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty of advise and consent, we  must get all of [Elena Kagan's] documents from the Clinton Library and  have enough time to analyze them so we can determine whether she should  be a Justice.''   Senator Grassley is a good man. Senator Grassley has a real sense of  integrity and fairness. That is why so many of us are wondering why  there is such a double standard right now. We hope he will join Senator  Feinstein in a joint letter, just as Senator Leahy and Senator Sessions  came together on such a letter a while ago.   Senator Cornyn at the time, now the No. 2 man in the Republican  hierarchy here in the Senate, said: ``I think it would be a mistake to  hold the hearing until we've had a chance to see [Elena Kagan's]  documents and any other documents that might exist . . . [and] we've  had an adequate time to review the documents.''   This happens especially when it comes to judges. The double standard  of the other side is enormous. When they are in the minority, they  profess strong arguments, push us to go along, and usually we do. But  now that they are in the majority, it is as if there is a whole new  world and what happened in the past doesn't make a darn bit of  difference. That is not fair. That is not right.   We, on this side, have had enough of the other side's hypocrisy on  judges. We know there is a push by the hard right to fill the bench so  they can achieve their agenda, which they could never achieve--even  with Republican majorities in the House, Senate, and Presidency-- through the elected bodies.   The kinds of attitudes that we have seen by the conservative  Justices--which we believe Judge Kavanaugh might well accede to, and  that is why we want a hearing--are not what America wants on issue  after issue after issue. This is the hard right's No. 1 goal.   They embraced Donald Trump only after he agreed to a list of 25  judges that the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation suggested;  both are far away from where Americans feel on issues like healthcare,  government involvement, and choice. That is when they embraced him.   There is huge pressure; I get that. We have pressure on our side too.  But the double standard is so glaring, so unfair, that it is appalling.   People say: Well, on judges, it has been tit for tat. It really  hasn't. It really hasn't. Leader Reid changed the rules after four  vacancies existed on the DC Court of Appeals because Republicans  wouldn't put them in. It was a 60-vote rule, but we kept it open for  the Supreme Court. Leader McConnell changed that. Leader McConnell,  unprecedentedly, let Merrick Garland stew and not have a hearing.   We understand the pressure, but it is not good for the Republicans,  and it is not good for comity in this body, which we are seeking. I see  the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. We are trying to get  comity on appropriations. Stuff like this poisons the well. It does.   Just last week, we witnessed the firsthand importance of reviewing a  nominee's full record. The White House was forced to withdraw the  nomination of Ryan Bounds for a seat on the Ninth Circuit after  abhorrent writings from his college newspaper came to light. If the  college newspaper writings of a potential appellate judge are  significant enough to disqualify him from consideration, how can my  colleagues on the other side argue with a straight face that Judge  Kavanaugh's record should not be fully considered before the Senate  moves forward on his nomination to this Nation's highest Court--one of  the most powerful institutions in the world?   There is a lot we don't know about Judge Kavanaugh. We are learning  more about him each day. Just a few days ago, for example, we learned  he had expressed skepticism about the Supreme Court that held President  Nixon accountable. It is another example of Judge Kavanaugh expressing  the view that Presidential power should be virtually unconstrained. One  that is still amazing to me, and I would like to see if there is more  of it in his records because it is so extreme a view, is that Judge  Kavanaugh suggested a President can ignore a statute he ``deems''--his  word--unconstitutional even if a court ruled it was constitutional.  That is like a King, not a President. We have the rule of law here.    He said sitting Presidents should not be subject to an investigation  of any kind, other than an impeachment inquiry by Congress.   Judge Kavanaugh's belief in unchallenged Presidential power is so  ingrained that he has even questioned the constitutionality of what he  calls the ``independent regulatory state,'' a phrase that sounds  awfully familiar to the hard-right myth of a deep state.   This is a radically activist view for a judge who advertises himself  as someone who will merely interpret the law as written. Congress has,  by law, given certain agencies varying degrees of independence from the  Executive. That started in the 1890s. That is not new, and there is an  ebb and flow to it. Sometimes Congress feels the regulations have gone  too far and push back; sometimes they feel they need more, and they  push forward. There has been an ebb and flow in history since the  1890s, but almost no one has said--except the hard right and deep state  people--that there shouldn't be regulations.   If Judge Kavanaugh has his way, agencies that have been somewhat  independent with good success, such as the Social Security  Administration, the SEC, the IRS, and the FBI, would be subject to vast  political influence from the White House. That is exactly the opposite  of what Congress has provided by law.   Senators and the public will have to make up their minds about what  Judge Kavanaugh believes, and they will have to think of it in the  broad, long-term context but also in the context of this President, who  seems to have less respect for the rule of law, less respect for  separation of power, and less respect for anyone who stands in his way  than any President I have seen in my lifetime.   Everyone will have to make up their minds about that. I understand  that. That is what we are here for, but it seems clear that in the  context of Judge Kavanaugh's writings about the Presidency, that the  statement questioning the Nixon decision reflects his actual beliefs.  That is why we need to obtain, analyze, and scrutinize his record. That  is our job as U.S. Senators, a job Members from both sides of the aisle  used to agree on.                            ____________________     Madam President, finally, just a few points as I see my  colleagues are waiting. I wish to make a few points on Iran and  President Trump's tweets. First, it seems the President is desperate to  distract the American people from last week's performance in Helsinki.  He always seems to do this: He runs into trouble, and he creates a  whole new firestorm somewhere else. It is his MO. It is not the way we  have seen government work in the United States, but that is what he  does. He is the President.   Second, the tweets suggest a pattern in President Trump's foreign  policy in which the President uses heated rhetoric with foreign  capitals to inflame and intensify tensions so later on the President  can pretend to ride in and save the day with a more measured tone. It  is sort of like a Kabuki play. It screws up our foreign policy.   We saw this play out in North Korea. President Trump repeatedly  insulted Kim Jong Un on Twitter, only to declare world peace once the  two of them had met. It seems as if the President's foreign policy is  to commit arson so he can play the firefighter. He lights the fire and  then puts it out and gives himself a huge pat on the back.   Not surprisingly, this reality TV foreign policy hasn't produced the  concrete results we are all looking for and must secure. It has been 2  months since the President met with Chairman Kim. Yet we have seen  little in the way of irreversible steps toward  [[Page S5230]]  denuclearization. We don't even have details on the agreement.  Secretary Pompeo went over there and was just given the cold shoulder.  Kim wouldn't meet with him and said nasty things about him. Still, the  President claims--I think he is alone here--that the North Korean  summit was a huge success.   Certainly, the world is a safer place without President Trump and  Chairman Kim trading barbs on social media. Those tactics make America  weaker. We all want diplomacy to succeed. We all want a strong deal  with North Korea, but the cessation of rhetorical hostilities is no  replacement for concrete, verifiable steps toward denuclearization.   The same holds true for Iran. I hope the President isn't reaching  into the same old social media playbook, using rhetoric as a  replacement for the hard work of diplomacy.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
