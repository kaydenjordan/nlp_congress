 Madam Speaker, let me say to some of my  Republican friends: If our African-American slave ancestors were here  today, they would say to you:         You know, them that's got should get, and them that's not       should lose, because the Bible says, and it still is news,       your mama may have, and your papa may have, but God bless the       child that's got his own.    God bless the child who can say I am free. Two hundred years in the  deep slavery south, but God put hope in our hearts and a song in our  mouths. All we are asking is for you to express the feeling and the  depths of the African-American people today who need you, all of us,  White and Black Members of Congress, to stand together and vote  ``yes.''    Vote ``yes.'' And by doing so, you will  say not: This is my country.   You will say in one united voice: This is our country, Black and  White. This is our country, the greatest country, and we thank God  Almighty for this blessing.   Please, let us do as the Senate. Vote unanimously for passage of this  bill.
