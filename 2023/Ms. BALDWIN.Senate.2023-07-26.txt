 Mr. President, today I rise to honor posthumously half- brothers Captain Robert C. Harmon and Private John R. Peirson from New  Richmond, WI, who both made the ultimate sacrifice for our great Nation  during World War II.   A week before the D-Day invasion on the Normandy coast and on his  51st mission, Captain Harmon's plane was shot down over occupied France  by German artillery. Initially listed as missing-in-action, Captain  Harmon was officially declared dead on May 29, 1945, by the U.S. War  Department.   Motivated by a sense of duty to his country, as well as the loss of  his older half-brother, Private Peirson enlisted in the U.S. Army. He  was mortally wounded during the April 16, 1945, Easter Day assault on  the island of Okinawa, Japan, and died of his wounds the following day.   A joint memorial service was held in New Richmond, WI, on April 26,  1949, for the repatriated remains of the two fallen brothers. They are  buried side by side at the Fort Snelling Cemetery in Minneapolis, MN.  Both were posthumously awarded the Purple Heart.   In recognition of their service and sacrifice, I was proud to sponsor  and witness successful passage of S. 2932 during the 117th Congress, a  bill to designate the facility of the U.S. Postal Service located at  430 South Knowles Avenue in New Richmond, WI, as the ``Captain Robert  C. Harmon and Private John R. Peirson Post Office Building.'' This  legislation was passed in the Senate by unanimous consent on May 25,  2022, and was signed into law by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., on  December 29, 2022.   The official dedication and celebration of the Captain Robert C.  Harmon and Private John R. Peirson Post Office Building will take place  on August 25, 2023. Family, friends, fellow veterans, elected leaders,  and community members will come together to remember these brothers and  their service to our country. Local support of this dedication includes  the New Richmond City Council, along with Mayors Fred Horne and Jim  Zajkowski; the New Richmond Chamber of Commerce; the Butler-Harmon  American Legion Post 80; and the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 10818  New Richmond/St. Croix County. Special recognition is due to Ms. Sally  Berkholder who has been a tireless advocate for this dedication and  ensuring that the family and community is able to properly celebrate  and honor the service of the Harmon/Peirson brothers.   Captain Harmon and Private Peirson heroically gave their lives  serving our country during World War II. They bravely fought for our  American values and freedom, and we are indebted by their sacrifice. I  am proud that their memory will live on by the official dedication of  the New Richmond Post Office as the ``Captain Robert C. Harmon and  Private John R. Peirson Post Office Building.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor Walter Knight, who  passed away on June 20, 2023, at the age of 89. Mr. Knight will be  remembered for his numerous acts of leadership in the community of  Beloit, WI--notably, serving as the first African-American on the  Beloit Police and Fire Commission and the first African-American to be  elected to the Beloit City Council.   Mr. Knight spent the first 17 years of his life in Arkansas where he  attended segregated public schools and graduated from Union Grove High  School in 1951. Upon graduation, he moved to Beloit, WI, where he went  on to work for Fairbanks Morse in the foundry. The grueling conditions  of the foundry motivated him to enroll in Blackhawk Technical College.  This allowed him to move into a position in the machine shop at  Fairbanks Morse where he remained for 25 years. Later in his career at  Fairbanks Morse, he was elected the president of the Local Union 1533  United Steelworkers of America from 1972-1976.   To further advance his educational career, Mr. Knight studied union  policy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. At the time he attended  Madison, less than 1 percent of students were African-American. After  securing higher-level education, Mr. Knight's activist voice and  profound leadership in the Beloit community led him to be elected the  first African-American on the Beloit City Council, where he served from  1972-1985. Mr. Knight's involvement and dedication to the Beloit  community did not stop there. As an African-American, he spent his  early years in Beloit fighting segregation by exposing and assisting in  the closure of local discriminatory and prejudice businesses.   In addition to his fight for racial justice, Mr. Knight spent over 30  years with the Rock County Opportunities Industrialization Center. As  executive director, he dedicated his time to helping minority and other  local residents build occupational and social skills to enhance their  career prospects. Mr. Knight always wanted to be remembered as someone  who did all he could to help others. His life of selfless acts for his  community accurately displays this. From working in the foundry at  Fairbanks Morse to becoming president of the Beloit City Council, Mr.  Knight was truly a trailblazer and has left an indelible mark on the  Beloit community.   By creating opportunities and a voice for the minority community in  Beloit, Mr. Knight's leadership granted him induction into the Beloit  Historical Society Hall of Fame in 2014. Additionally, as a part of the  2019 Juneteenth celebration, the Portland Avenue Bridge in Beloit was  renamed ``Walter R. Knight Bridge'' in his honor. Mr. Knight will be  whole-heartedly missed and always remembered for the years of  compassion and love he bestowed upon his community.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the 50th  anniversary of the Mexican Fiesta in Milwaukee. I am proud to honor  this tradition that showcases the rich cultural history of the Hispanic  community in Wisconsin.   What began as a small street festival in Milwaukee has grown to be  one of the largest celebrations of Mexican culture in the country. In  1973, proud members of the Mexican-American community closed down one  street in downtown Milwaukee to celebrate Mexican Independence Day.  Today, the Mexican Fiesta attracts thousands of visitors from across  the State to enjoy Hispanic cuisine, dance to Mexican artists, and  learn more about the rich history of this community. With more than 450  exhibitors and vendors, it has also become an opportunity for Wisconsin  small businesses, nonprofits, and local artisans to showcase their  products and reach new customers.   This 50-year tradition is not only a celebration of Hispanic  heritage; it is also a chance to support students across the State as  they pursue an education. Money raised through the Mexican Fiesta goes  towards the Wisconsin Hispanic Scholarship Foundation, which expands  access to higher education for the Hispanic community. Since its  founding, the foundation has awarded $1.8 million in scholarships.  Thanks to their efforts, young Hispanic men and women across the State  have been empowered to explore their interests and jumpstart their  futures.   The original organizers of the Mexican Fiesta were searching for a  way to share their traditions and culture with the rest of their  community. It has been inspiring to watch that vision become a reality  over the last 50 years. Armed with the knowledge that education opens  doors, the Wisconsin Hispanic Scholarship Foundation has used the reach  and popularity of this celebration to empower young Wisconsinites to  pursue their dreams. I am proud to recognize this important tradition  on their 50th anniversary, and I look forward to celebrating the  countless contributions that Mexican Americans have made to our State  for years to come.                            ____________________
