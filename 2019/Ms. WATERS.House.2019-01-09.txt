 Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues  on the opposite side of the aisle, but today I rise in support of H.R.  264, legislation that would reopen the Federal Government and put Wall  Street's cop on the beat, the Securities and Exchange Commission, back  to work.   This President has all but closed the door of the SEC, furloughing 94  percent of the agency and essentially providing fraudsters and schemers  with a free pass to swindle investors and small businesses. With such a  skeleton crew of less than 300 staff, the SEC cannot possibly oversee  the activities of over 26,000 registered entities, such as investment  advisers, broker dealers, and stock exchanges. Worse, the SEC is unable  to hold bad actors accountable through most enforcement actions,  preventing harmed investors from obtaining relief.   But the importance of the SEC goes beyond ensuring the rule of law.  Businesses that are looking to enter the public stock markets may have  to delay their initial public offerings because the SEC cannot approve  their documents. Businesses seeking guidance from the SEC are left in  legal limbo until the SEC can get back to work.   The Trump shutdown is jeopardizing the integrity of our financial  markets and the hard-earned savings of millions of Americans. So let's  end this Trump shutdown and open the government so that the SEC and  other agencies can get back to work on behalf of the public.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate some of the comments that have been made  about the fact that we have been able to work together, both sides of  the aisle on the Financial Services Committee, working on such things  as the JOBS Act, but we can't do any of that. We cannot move. We cannot  get to work for the American people because this President not only has  shut down the government, but he took responsibility for  [[Page H335]]  it. He wanted everybody to know that he did it--that he not only did  it, but he is going to continue to do it until he can bend us to his  will and give him $5 billion-plus to put up a wall of some kind. We  don't even know what it is.   So I want to say to my friends on the opposite side of the aisle and  to Mr. McHenry, yes, we are going to be able to work together on a lot  of good legislation, but why don't you join with us and talk to the  President and tell him to open up government, that we cannot continue  to have the American people suffer in the way that they are doing, and  our financial services agencies are unable to do the job that the  people sent them here to do.                                time  1445
