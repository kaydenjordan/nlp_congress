 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the  extraordinary life and legacy of a trailblazing public servant and  educator, Selma Mayor George Patrick Evans, who passed away at the age  of 78 on May 15.   A native of Selma, Alabama, Mayor Evans overcame great diversity and  adversity to break down barriers for generations of leaders like myself  to follow.   An educator, coach, basketball referee, principal, superintendent,  city council president, and mayor, Evans wore many hats; but the common  thread was service. He loved our hometown of Selma, Alabama, and he  served her well.   He dedicated over 40 years to the Dallas County Public School System,  cultivating an impactful career molding, teaching, coaching, and  mentoring the youth of Selma and Dallas County.   In 1994, he made history again as the first African-American  superintendent of Dallas County Public Schools.   He began his career in electoral politics in the Selma City Council.  In this role, he brought the same passion, love of people and  community, making history as the first African-American president of  the Selma City Council.   In 2008, he earned more distinctions, as the second African-American  mayor of the city of Selma in its 192-year history. During his two  terms as Selma's mayor, Evans led the Queen City through the recession  of 2008, the implementation of the city's optic fiber network, and  helped address the lingering impact of segregation within Selma's  community. I was proud to partner with Mayor Evans to bring vital  Federal resources home to Selma and Dallas County.   From his demonstrated efforts to revitalize downtown Selma to his  commitment to making our community safer and stronger, Mayor Evans  fought hard to improve the lives of the people he served. His foresight  propelled the city of Selma forward and cemented his legacy as a  trusted leader in our community.   On a personal note, I have known Mayor Evans all my life. I even  served as his family's babysitter during my youth. Mayor Evans has  always been a man of great character and honor whose love of God,  family, and community has been his guiding principle.   Through all of his accomplishments, he has led by example through his  hard work, perseverance, grit, and kindness. His public service has  left an indelible imprint on the city of Selma, and we will miss him  terribly.   Let us not weep, but find comfort in knowing that his incredible  legacy will live on in the many people he touched.   On behalf of Alabama's 7th Congressional District, I ask my  colleagues to join me in honoring and celebrating the extraordinary  life and legacy of Selma's mayor, George Patrick Evans, for his decades  of service to the city of Selma, Dallas County, and the entire State of  Alabama. May he rest in peace and power.                            ____________________
