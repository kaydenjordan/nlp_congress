 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce the  formation of the Sound Money Caucus. Together, we will study and  highlight the impact of monetary and fiscal policy on the United States  dollar as a store of value and a means of exchange.   As you can see, the supply of dollars has gone up dramatically,  really since the gold standard ended in 1971. It is a gradual slope.  But if you see since the recession, it has been aggressive. And then,  obviously, here, this year, it has been nearly vertical.   The value of the dollar is critical. That is the store of value for  all Americans.   I am pleased to be joined by Co-Chairman   Andy Barr, and Members  like Brady, Budd, and Zeldin. We look forward to working with everyone  to highlight the importance of sound money.                            ____________________
