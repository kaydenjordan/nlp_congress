 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, wildfires pose a significant threat to the  safety and well-being of our citizens, particularly those living near  Federal lands. One way to protect against wildfires is with the use of  fuel breaks.   Fuel breaks are--think of them as firewalls, firewalls for our  communities. They are manmade areas with a reduced fuel load that are  set up to act as a barrier to slow the spread of a wildfire. They slow  it down and make it so the fire can't spread as quickly.   In 2021, Congress created a series of categorical exclusions  specifically for the creation of fuel breaks. That was good. They were  intended to protect communities adjacent to Federal land from the  devastating effects of wildfires. However, the Federal Agencies  responsible for implementing these  [[Page S1157]]  exclusions have been bogged down by regulatory delays.   These delays are really problematic, and they are adding up,  especially in certain parts of the country where there is a lot of  Federal land and where there is a lot of Federal land near where people  live. For example, in California, there are 5.1 million homes in the  wildland-urban interface. The Forest Service and the BLM will never  have the capacity to protect these homes. The hands of the States  shouldn't be tied while they watch their homes being burned.   So Congress did a good thing by creating these categorical  exclusions, but it has been more or less rendered--I think by mistake-- a dead letter in many areas because of these regulatory problems.   Rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater, we need to make  this one work. My amendment aims to do precisely that. It aims to  create a process for States to assume responsibility for the  environmental analysis, approval, and execution of these projects. By  allowing States to take on these responsibilities, we can expedite  these critical projects for community protection.   The safety and well-being of our citizens and our communities are at  stake. By passing my amendment, we can take a significant step toward  protecting our homes, communities, and critical infrastructure from the  devastating effects of wildfires.   Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 80 and ask that it be  reported by number.    Mr. President, I appreciate the insight and the observations  of my friend and distinguished colleague, the Senator from Delaware. I  appreciate the amount of effort that he puts into this and I am sure a  lot of hard work.   He raises some good points, and there are points that I might find  persuasive if they were accurate. He seems to be under the impression  that these would be broad categorical inclusions, that these procedures  we contemplate would apply broadly to all Forest Service operations. It  wouldn't. This is talking only about fuel breaks and only about fuel  breaks in narrow sets of circumstances.   He suggested incorrectly that there is no requirement in place to  make sure that the States have the resources financially, regulatorily,  and otherwise to undertake the analysis contemplated under this. It  does. He has been misinformed on that point.   Finally, I might feel differently about this if, like my friend from  Delaware, if I were from a different State, if I were from the State of  Delaware. But when you look at the Western United States, we have  Federal land everywhere.   In every State to the east of Colorado's eastern border, the Federal  Government owns less than 15 percent of the land in each State, and in  most cases, it is in the single digits. In many States, it is in the  low single digits. I don't remember what the percentage of land is in  Delaware. I can find that out. But in Utah it is two-thirds of our  land. It is 67 percent. In every State to the west of Colorado's  Eastern Rim, it is more than 15 percent and usually a lot more than  that. That affects people. These are people's homes, their livelihoods,  their communities, their economies are all put in jeopardy by the fact  that the Federal Government owns too much land. It owns so much land  that no one would have the capacity to operate this. No one. It is  impossible.   More than 5 million homes in California alone are in these affected  areas. No matter how efficient we may be in the Forest Service, no  matter how many employees we authorized them to hire, they are still  not going to be able to keep up with it.   It is a matter of doing this or losing more property, losing more  ecosystems and losing more homes and communities and sources of  economic activity. That is what is at stake.   Now, if the points he made were factually correct or legally correct,  he might be right, but they are not correct. We need this, and we need  to pass this now.   Mr. President, thank you.    Mr. President.    I will point to two things. First, on page 4 of the  amendment, subdivision (D) Verification of Resources. This requires  each State or Indian Tribe to go through a process to verify that they  have got the resources to do it.   Turn to page 6. It is subject to full judicial review in the same way  that they would be subject to judicial review if these actions were  being undertaken by a Federal Agency. So the only difference is, these  State and local governments, they have both the personnel, and they  have the incentive to do it. Federal land managers can't and don't and  won't ever be able to do this the same way State people, State  officials, State governments, and local governments will be able to.   We either care about these communities or we don't. If we don't adopt  this, we are effectively nullifying what Congress passed back in 2021,  and we cannot do that.   Mr. President, I know of no further debate on this matter.    Mr. President.    The distinction he is dwelling on is the distinction on page  4, the ``may-shall'' distinction. The only way he can be right on this,  of course, is if he presupposes that the Secretary is just not going to  care; that the Secretary is not going to exercise that authority. It is  not going to happen. I am sure he is not impugning a lack of concern on  the part of the Secretary of Agriculture to do that. He wouldn't do  that.   Secondly, look, if that is what is holding this up, if you want to  switch--if you would be willing to support it if I made the ``may'' and  turned it to a ``shall,'' I will do that right now. I will offer up a  second-degree amendment to my own amendment right now, and we will do  that. If the gentleman from Delaware were to agree to that, I would be  fine with it, and we could get this passed.  [[Page S1159]]         Mr. President, this is how the western lands suffer--people  from the Eastern United States, with neither the knowledge nor the  concern about how they are managed and don't care. And so while they  passed something in 2021 to make these firebreaks easier to put in  place, as a practical reality, the regulatory hurdles are proving too  much. This would fix that. This is reasonable. There is nothing that  the Senator from Delaware has pointed to that makes this amendment to  this bill objectionable in any way. I urge my colleagues to support it.   And if you do so--if you come from the west of Colorado, you know  exactly what I am talking about. If you come from the Eastern United  States, I beg you to imagine, for a moment, that you represent a  Western State, where we have experienced, in some cases, decades of  drought and where we are sitting ducks, where we are an island of  private land amidst a vast overwhelming sea of Federal land that is  chronically mismanaged just because it is physically impossible for  them to manage it properly to avoid this kind of thing. I urge you to  be sympathetic to this and support it.    I would be happy to.    Thank you.    I appreciate the magnanimous offer from my colleague. I will  take him up on that. I am still hoping that it will pass. It is still  my hope that it should pass today.   Mr. President, I know of no further debate.                           Vote on Amendment No. 80     I call for the yeas and nays.
