 Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?    We had a bill we took up the last vote of the day before  we are out for October, and it was strange because this bill got rushed  to the floor. I can't find anybody on our side of the aisle who had any  idea this was coming until yesterday afternoon.   It is interesting, though. It is titled Fairness for 9/11 Families  Act, and it makes $2.982, right at $3 billion, available for 9/11  families.   There has been a lot of money provided in the past, but it is  interesting because just last week, I was talking about this article  from September 12 by Daniel Greenfield about what the Biden  administration was doing in battling against 9/11 victims' families in  court.   There was $7 billion of Afghanistan assets, bank funds, liquid money  funds in the bank in America that were frozen after 9/11 when we found  out who was responsible.   The 9/11 victims' families sued, and they had gotten a judgment  against the Taliban, al-Qaida, and Iran for $6 billion.   As this article points out, White House Democrats have a history of  fighting against terror victims who are suing Islamic terrorists.   The Obama administration battled American terror victims suing the  PLO. In 2015, after they won a $218 million judgment against the terror  group, Blinken, then only a Deputy Secretary of State, intervened,  claiming that the lawsuit threatened ``several decades of U.S. foreign  policy.'' In other words, he took up for the terrorists against the  victims' families.   The article points out that now the Biden administration is fighting  9/11 victims on behalf of the Taliban. At stake are billions of dollars  being held by the Afghan central bank fund in the United States.   Further down, it points out that since Afghanistan has assets in this  country, the United States, including $7 billion in bank funds, it is  now entirely possible for the victims to collect that money.   Biden officially announced that he was splitting the $7 billion  between the families of the victims and a trust fund to provide  ``humanitarian aid'' for the people of Afghanistan.   For those who don't understand international relationships, when the  Biden administration says it is for humanitarian aid, what it means is  they have to give that money to the Taliban and trust the people who  have lied and killed Americans and killed 13 Americans on the very day  that the Biden administration had that ridiculous, hasty retreat. You  are going to trust them? Are you kidding me? It is just so outrageous.   The article points out that $3.5 billion was placed in a separate  trust that would be separate and distinct from around $800 million the  Biden administration has already spent on aid to Afghanistan.   It wasn't enough that this administration left $85 billion worth of  military equipment that they could use to attack us later, but they  have been sending millions of dollars over there, like that is going to  really go to help the people.   The article points out that what Biden actually did was take money  off the table for the 9/11 victims, and it got worse. On the same day  as Biden's executive order reserving $3.5 billion for the terrorists,  his Justice Department filed a statement of interest in court arguing  that the judgment for the victims of terrorism here in the United  States was too large and that actually turning over the money to those  victims in America would interfere with the Biden administration's  foreign policy in Afghanistan, like we have a foreign policy in  Afghanistan. Who believes that?    This administration tucked tail and ran, and ran so fast, it exposed  our military, our people, our allies to death. Policy in Afghanistan,  for heaven's sake.   The article points out that now a magistrate judge has repeated back  much of the Department of Justice's arguments and ruled for the Biden  administration that the 9/11 families who were laying claim to the  other half of the $7 billion, that $3.5 billion, were not entitled to  it.   If it weren't for the Biden administration going to court and  fighting against the 9/11 victims' families, there would have been $3.5  billion, and this is not just some speculation. That is money in the  bank. This is liquidity. This is money that is there.   The Biden administration has been fighting them in court to keep them  from getting that $3.5 billion with a b that the Biden administration  wants to give to the Taliban for ``humanitarian aid.''   Now, the Taliban is more likely to torture and kill, as they have  done, anybody who was our ally than provide true humanitarian aid. To  them, humanitarian aid is treating women like property, preventing them  from having an education, which was improving, and killing those with  whom they disagree. It is just tragic.   If there is any doubt about who would get the money, the deputy  governor of the bank that this will go through is a Taliban leader who  we have listed specifically as a global terrorist. That is who the  Biden administration wants to help.   It shouldn't have been a surprise. I talked about this here on the  House floor last week, that the Biden administration was fighting our  own 9/11 victims, trying to keep them from getting reimbursement from  the terrorists.   So, what happens? The last thing, here we come, running in here. Oh,  we don't want the 9/11 families too mad at us. Let's take $3 billion  that American taxpayers have paid and give that to the 9/11 victims  instead of the $3.5 billion that belongs to the Taliban, we are told,  by this administration.   Well, I think most Americans, if they knew that this had gone on,  would say this is crazy. Do you actually want to give the people  responsible for killing 3,000 Americans $3.5 billion so that you  [[Page H8363]]  can take taxpayer money from Americans and give that for the damages  that the terrorists did?   That makes no sense, but it does explain why the last bill for the  next month and a half was $3 billion of taxpayers' money that the Biden  administration wants to use instead of the $3.5 billion that they say  they need to send to the terrorists, the Taliban, in Afghanistan.   It was bad enough that this administration deserted our allies in  Afghanistan and left them to be massacred by the evil within the  Taliban, but now they want to give the terrorists even more money?   I mean, at least you would have thought somebody in this  administration would have said: Do you know what? We left them $85  billion of military equipment. I think they can get $3 billion out of  that.   That would pay the victims of 9/11. But this administration--$85  billion of equipment they left with them--has added $800 million of  American taxpayer dollars sent over there to the Taliban for  humanitarian aid. Now, they want to give $3 billion more of taxpayer  money, instead of terrorist money, to 9/11 victims?   I think there were 30 or so Republicans who voted against this.  Anybody who tries to say they don't care about 9/11 victims is a liar  because they do, and that is why we have appropriated billions of  dollars for them.   But in this case today, I can't help but think if everyone on both  sides of the aisle--well, I know some would have known. If they had  known there was $3.5 billion from the terrorists' own money in our  banks that we could give to the 9/11 victims, then they would say that  is probably a better idea than taking it from American taxpayers. That  is outrageous.                                time  1430    Now, shifting to what is going on in our Department of Justice. We  have been seeing these tactics that have been coming for some years,  and people know that there was some corruption within J. Edgar Hoover's  FBI. People should have gone to prison within the DOJ for what they did  to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to the point not only did they harass  him, spy on him illegally, but even send him messages that he needed to  kill himself.   We know it has been bad in the past, but most of us felt like there  have been great strides forward to the point that in the 1980s and  1990s, if you asked people around the world, they would say the FBI is  probably the greatest law enforcement entity in the world.   That is not the case anymore. Some of the first people that will tell  you that are people working for the FBI, but they have to be very  careful. I have heard from FBI agents, former FBI agents, people that  have been around awhile, one of them said, you remember the way it used  to be? The FBI was a class organization.   We knew if there was a defendant who was nonviolent that--and I  remember this happening before I went on the bench as a judge, and then  during my years on the bench as a district judge. I knew of cases,  where the FBI knew they were nonviolent, white-collar crimes, and even  though they were very, very serious felonies, they would call the guy's  lawyer, and say, you need to show up at the jail at this time, you have  been indicted or you will be indicted. They knew they would show up  because otherwise they might come knock down the door. That was not  what they did. That was not their practice. They believed in civility  and humanity.   I have been thinking about the intimidation tactics that have been  used by the FBI, and it was for no other reason but intimidation. I  think Merrick Garland, through some of the things he and Christopher  Wray have said, they made it clear, they are out to intimidate  conservatives, and they have done a good job.   Many are afraid to speak up about the improprieties that are going on  within the FBI and the DOJ, even to the point that the head of the  Department of Justice, the Attorney General himself, who was nominated  for the Supreme Court--thank you, God, that he is not there--but he is  in a place he can do a lot of damage to people's rights, and he has. He  issued an order that DOJ and FBI, they were not to speak to a Member of  Congress or the Senate without going through the FBI.   I have heard from people that have complained about what is going on  in DOJ and FBI. They have talked about how Christopher Wray has talked  repeatedly using this line, protect the brand. Protect the brand.   From the things that he would say, they tell me, he made it clear, we  are not asking you to be honest and truthful. We are asking you, when  you find something that is criminal or a wrongdoing within the FBI,  don't tell anybody, just pass it up the chain of command. Let's keep it  inhouse because if people find out about corruption inside the FBI or  the DOJ, then it hurts our brand.   Christopher Wray and Merrick Garland apparently don't understand the  damage that they have done to the brand of the FBI and the DOJ.   The Attorney General knows the Constitution and knows this body's  right of oversight and knows that everybody inside and outside the  Department of Justice has a constitutional right to talk to their  Member of Congress without going through Merrick Garland's screeners.  Yet, he orders that they don't have the constitutional rights they have  got because he thinks his orders take precedence over the U.S.  Constitution.   Why wouldn't he think that? They have been giving orders that take  precedence over the Constitution.   I have been thinking, there is so much in the way of intimidation  tactics being utilized by the FBI and the DOJ, that is exactly what the  tactics were of a group that people understood they were all about  intimidation. We hear comparisons, people say, oh, Donald Trump is like  Hitler.   Really?   He wants more participation. He wants to have more rights back in the  States. He wants to spread out the power of the government.   And that the left thinks is like Hitler?   No, that is not.   When you have a so-called Justice Department that is using the exact  same tactics as the gestapo--you need to understand your Republic, a  democratic Republic as it is often referred to, because we elect  Representatives and then have Representatives represent us. They are  servants of the people. So it is a Republic, democratically elected, it  is in jeopardy. And ours is in jeopardy when the DOJ gets this  powerful.   Now, there were some that were extremely upset about what happened on  9/11, like all Americans were, but they were concerned about what they  saw as infringements on liberty within a month after 9/11. They have  been talking about those for years now.   It has really come into focus in recent days as the FBI has knocked  down doors, leaked information to media so that they are there to film  people when they drag them out in their underwear. In some cases, not  even giving them a chance to put on clothes.   Contrast that to the same treatment they would have gotten back in  the 1980s or 1990s of telling them they need to report to the jail on a  certain day and a certain time. I don't use the term ``gestapo''  lightly.   And why is our Justice Department feeling like they got to be like  the gestapo?   I greatly admired the FBI when I saw the way they worked in the 1980s  and 1990s. They were so professional.   Then along came Mueller in 2001 as the new director of the FBI. He  started a policy that allowed the FBI to run off thousands and  thousands and thousands of years of experience because he wanted  nothing but young, yes-people working at the FBI.   So over the years, those people that would have said, excuse me, I  know you think that is a good idea, but let me tell you what happened  when we tried that before, or let me tell you where that is going and  why it is not a good idea. They didn't want those people there.    If they wanted to go after a candidate like Donald Trump, they wanted  people around them that would say, okay, here is how we can do it. We  can do this secretly and we can do this and that. If it violates the  Constitution, we don't care. We need an insurance policy to keep Trump  from getting elected. If he gets elected, we need to violate more  rights and we need to have people working for the Justice Department  that will lie in an affidavit.  [[Page H8364]]    I am telling you, that is why when I saw the lack of response, or  appropriate response from the FISA court, when they found out that the  FBI and the DOJ lied to them, and then kept filing for a warrant every  90 days, basing it back on a lie, those FISA judges should have been  outraged. The Chief Justice across the street on our Supreme Court  should have been outraged. They weren't. They really didn't do  anything.   The State district judges I know and the former Federal district  judges I practiced in front of trying cases, I couldn't imagine them  not calling a lawyer in and finding them in contempt because it was  done in their presence and sending them to jail for 6 months before any  criminal prosecution even took place, and then demanding that there be  a criminal prosecution. That didn't happen.   So it tells you something about the FISA courts. We learned, I  believe it was 2007, that the National Security Letters that give the  FBI the ability to just send a letter like a warrant saying, produce  all the records you have on this individual, that individual. And, by  the way, it is a Federal felony if you tell anybody that you got this  letter.   The IG did an inspection and ultimately said, oh, there are probably  3,000 or so National Security Letters that were sent out by the FBI  when there was no case, there was no probable cause, they were just  doing fishing expeditions. That is unconstitutional. We would have  hoped that that got cleaned up, but we had an FBI director named  Mueller that kept adding to the problems.   Instead of punishing the FBI agent that fabricated a case against Ted  Stevens, a Republican Senator, the one that brought forward the fraud  by the FBI, he gets run out of the FBI. The one that was involved in  the fraud got a promotion and got a better job. So that tells you even  back not long after Mueller took over at the FBI, he was involved in  intimidation.   Really, I felt that ever since--we know that William Jefferson was a  criminal, committed a crime, and was punished as he should have been.  But when the FBI under Mueller made it clear--this is intimidation to  Congress--you better not mess with me or counter me or have legitimate  oversight over what I am doing, or I may just come search your office.  Well, they did. It had never been done before that.   It was all about Members of Congress concerned about what was  happening at the FBI, the abuses of our Constitution. So he shoves it  right back in our face. It is intimidation. These are gestapo-type  tactics.   There was an article that was written in the ``Eurasia Review'' back  on September 1 of this year, and it expressed the concern I have. It is  titled ``The FBI's Gestapo Tactics: Hallmarks of an Authoritarian  Regime.''   It talks about, ``With every passing day, the United States  Government borrows yet another leaf from Nazi Germany's playbook:  Secret police. Secret courts.''   We have FISA, and I am fine if we get rid of them. We had national  secrets that were kept before FISA. But the abuses and the lack of  concern about the abuses by the judges tell me we need to get rid of  them.   It says, ``Secret government agencies. Surveillance. Censorship.  Intimidation. Harassment. Torture. Brutality. Widespread corruption.''   Look, if that power is there and the Republicans take over and put  staunch conservatives in there, you know, we still would need very,  very stringent oversight, so that nobody did that to the Democrats  because when it happens to one side it should concern everybody.   I got really upset when I found out about the abuses of the National  Security Letters, and that was under the Bush administration. I was  calling it out. I was angry about it. And I am not hearing any  Democrats concerned about the abuses of the Constitution that have gone  on. The intimidation, borrowing pages directly from the gestapo.                                time  1445    This is how you intimidate people. This is very serious, and I don't  have time to go into all of this. It is a good article from the Eurasia  Review, but it goes and documents what the Gestapo did and what the FBI  is doing, and it is scary.   I hope that if Democrats are not willing to address this issue now  then, surely, they will be when we have a Republican administration  because the abuse needs to stop.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
