 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3395) to direct the Chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission  to seek to enter into an agreement with a federally funded research and  development center to evaluate foreign ownership of marine terminals at  the 15 largest United States container ports, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3395         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``U.S. Supply Chain Security       Review Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. STUDY ON FOREIGN PORTS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Chairman of the Federal Maritime       Commission shall seek to enter into an agreement with a       federally funded research and development center to evaluate       how foreign ownership of marine terminals at the 15 largest       United States container ports affects or could affect United       States economic security.        (b) Contents.--In carrying out the study under subsection       (a), the center selected under such subsection shall--        (1) consider--        (A) changes in ownership of the 15 largest United States       container ports over the past 10 years as well as announced       ownership changes from 2023 and 2024;        (B) instances of ownership in individual marine terminals       and cumulative ownership by Chinese or Russian entities or       nationals;        (C) instances of ownership in individual marine terminals       and cumulative ownership by any foreign entity;        (D) the amount of--        (i) Port Infrastructure Development Grant funds since       fiscal year 2018 that have gone to ports and marine terminals       that are owned wholly or partially foreign owned; and        (ii) Port Security Grant funds since fiscal year 2003 that       have gone to ports and marine terminals that are owned wholly       or partially foreign owned; and        (E) where ownership exists, a detailed description of       foreign operational control including both affirmative and       negative control; and        (2) offer recommendations on--        (A) policies by ports and marine terminal operators to       prevent excessive foreign ownership that could threaten       United States economic security;        (B) whether ownership affords the foreign owner access to       operational technology and information unique to the United       States and otherwise unavailable; and        (C) whether foreign ownership has or could affect the       supply chain and policies related to the prioritization of       certain cargoes.        (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the initiation of       the evaluation under subsection (a), the Chairman of the       Federal Maritime Commission shall submit to the Committee on       Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House       of Representatives the results of such evaluation.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members have 5  legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material in the Record on H.R. 3395, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 3395, as amended, requires a study on the implication of foreign  ownership of marine terminals at United States container ports.  [[Page H3916]]    Not only will the study examine the nationality of the firms owning  marine terminals at 15 of the largest United States ports, but it will  also specifically focus on whether ownership is held by entities or  nationals of countries adversarial to our Nation, including  affiliations with China or Russia.   Further, the study will assess whether Port Infrastructure  Development Grant and Port Security Grant funds have been awarded to  ports that are wholly or partially foreign-owned.   These findings will help the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure hold the administration accountable for how Federal  funds are allocated and inform the committee's work on the efficient  movement of goods through the supply chain.   I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Auchincloss) for  introducing this bill.   As a supply chain logistics professional in my prior life, I  understand how critical this is to our Nation's infrastructure and to  our economic prosperity moving forward in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers. I am prepared to  close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The report directed by this bill will help inform the committee's  work and protect our ports and supply chains against foreign  adversaries.   As we have seen these past few years, disruptions in the supply chain  have a widespread impact across our Nation. We should take the  necessary steps to understand the potential vulnerabilities in our  supply chain and work to address them.   Mr. Speaker, I again, thank the sponsor of this bill for his work,  and I urge support. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3399) to study the security of the Soo Locks and effects on the  supply chain resulting from a malfunction or failure of the Soo Locks,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3399         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Soo Locks Security and       Economic Reporting Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. REPORT ON SECURITY AND ECONOMIC EFFECTS ON SUPPLY                     CHAIN OF SOO LOCKS, MICHIGAN.         (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation, in       coordination with the Commandant of the Coast Guard and the       Secretary of Defense, shall submit to the appropriate       committees of Congress a report that--        (1) highlights any security deficiencies that exist with       respect to the Soo Locks in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan;        (2) highlights the supply chain, logistical, and economic       effects that would result in the event of a malfunction or       failure of the Soo Locks and how such effects would impact       the region surrounding the Soo Locks and the United States;        (3) highlights any potential domestic or international       threats to the integrity of the Soo Locks;        (4) details the current security structure of the Coast       Guard and any other relevant Federal, State, or local agency       to protect the Soo Locks; and        (5) provides any recommendations, and cost estimates for       such recommendations, for--        (A) strengthening the security of the Soo Locks; and        (B) reducing the impacts to the supply chain of the United       States that would result in the event of a malfunction or       failure of the Soo Locks.        (b) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this       Act, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means--        (1) the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of       the House of Representatives;        (2) the Committee on Commerce, Transportation, and Science       of the Senate; and        (3) the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the       Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material in the Record on H.R. 3399.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, I am grateful for the bipartisan  support of  [[Page H3917]]  my colleagues in Michigan, General Bergman, along with Representatives  Scholten and Kildee, for cosponsoring this very important legislation.   H.R. 3399, the Soo Locks Security and Economic Report Act of 2023, is  proof that fortifying our national security and strengthening our  economy transcends partisan politics.   The Soo Locks are a feat of human ingenuity and a point of pride for  all Michiganders. The Army Corps of Engineers has nicknamed the Soo  Locks the ``linchpin of the Great Lakes,'' and for good reason. The  locks connect both Lake Superior and Lake Huron.   They play a vital role in transporting goods and resources not just  throughout the Great Lakes, but all around the world. An average of  7,000 vessels pass through the locks every single year, and with it,  over 90 percent of the world's iron ore.   As the hub of America's vehicle industry and one of the most critical  States for our military industry, Michigan relies on the locks to get  necessary materials in and out of the State. The Soo Locks aren't just  important for my home State, they are also critical for every State and  for our national security.   As stated above, over 90 percent of the world's iron ore flows  through the Soo Locks. Michigan is home to the third largest land  border in the country. As a member of the House Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee and the congressman representing Michigan's  10th Congressional District, America's number one manufacturing  district, it is my job to safeguard our national defense and vital  commerce by finding ways to secure our essential infrastructure. An  unexpected closure of the Soo Locks would threaten both.   In 2015, the Department of Homeland Security found that a 6-month  shutdown would be disastrous: Recession, closed factories, shuttered  mines, a pause in U.S. auto and appliance production for most of the  year. Around 11 million jobs could be lost nationwide. That is the  entirety of Michigan's population.   Let's think of that. Our economy would be critically harmed and might  never recover.   A 2018 study concluded that an unexpected outage in the 1,200-foot- long Poe lock would create a bottleneck that would disrupt the supply  chain for steel production and wreak havoc in Michigan manufacturing,  particularly in the automotive industry.   That is why I introduced the Soo Locks Security and Economic  Reporting Act of 2023, and this is why we must together pass this  legislation. This is a commonsense measure that simply asks the  Secretaries of Transportation and Defense, along with the commandant of  the Coast Guard, to study potential security risks of the Soo Locks.   It would examine the economic consequences in the event of  operational failure. Finally, it asks these departments to provide  recommendations, as well as the cost of these recommendations to  Congress.   This legislation is a commonsense step toward protecting the  infrastructure that keeps this country running. Failing to move forward  on this bill doesn't just jeopardize America's national security, it  leaves our country vulnerable to an economic crisis that is  unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3399,  the Soo Lock Security and Economic Reporting Act of 2023, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), a Lake Superior State University graduate.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for his  leadership on this matter, as well as his remarks, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the Soo Locks are critical to international commerce and  to our supply chain, and the report directed by this bill would provide  important information to ensure their continued funding and operation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.
