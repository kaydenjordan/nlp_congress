 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  bipartisan PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act.   Since 2010, the Affordable Care Act has required employers to provide  nursing mothers with break time to express milk, as well as access to a  private non-bathroom space for pumping.   Although this was a significant improvement for working moms--one  that I didn't have when I was breastfeeding my babies--the law still  left 9 million workers uncovered, including teachers, agriculture  workers, engineers, and others.   This coverage gap is unacceptable, and it means that each year  millions of parents who choose to breastfeed must  [[Page H5806]]  decide between the health of their child and maintaining employment.  The coverage gap has also disproportionately harmed Black and brown  women, who represent 12 percent of the workforce but nearly 20 percent  of women of childbearing age who are not covered by the existing break  time provision.   The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act will address this coverage gap by  simply amending the Fair Labor Standards Act to provide protections to  workers who are not currently covered.   As Representative Herrara Beutler explained, this is current law. We  are just closing a gap that is leaving too many nursing moms out. It  will also clarify that if a worker is not relieved of their duties  during the time spent pumping, then those hours must count as hours  worked.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the rights of  women in the workplace and to help their families by joining me in  voting for the bipartisan PUMP Act.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter in support of the  bill from the United States Breastfeeding Committee.     Written Statement of Nikia Sankofa Executive Director of the U.S.         Breastfeeding Committee Before the United States House of                    Representatives--September 24, 2021         Dear Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader McCarthy, and all       members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The U.S.       Breastfeeding Committee (USBC) submits this letter to the       U.S. House of Representatives in full support of the       Providing Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing       Mothers Act (H.R. 3110).        The USBC is a coalition of more than 100 national       nonprofits, breastfeeding coalitions, community-based       organizations, and federal agency partners that support a       shared mission to drive collaborative efforts for policy and       practices that create a landscape of breastfeeding support       across the United States. We are committed to ensuring that       all families in the U.S. have the support, resources, and       accommodations to achieve their breastfeeding goals in the       communities where they live, learn, work, and play.        We know that the vast majority of people become parents       during their lifetime, and their needs and the needs of their       infants are neither surprising nor difficult to meet if we       plan appropriately. A simple and common-sense policy solution       to address ongoing workplace barriers and inequities is       within the reach of Congress through the Providing Urgent       Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act (H.R.       3110), which strengthens the existing Break Time for Nursing       Mothers law and has bipartisan and bicameral support.                   Human Milk: A Proven Prevention Strategy         Breastfeeding is a primary prevention strategy that builds       a foundation for life-long health and wellness, adapting       overtime to meet the changing needs of the growing child. The       evidence for the value of human milk feeding to overall       health is scientific, robust, and continually being       reaffirmed by new researcher.        Human milk feeding is proven to reduce the risk of a range       of illnesses and conditions for infants and mothers. Compared       with commercial milk formula fed children, breastfed infants       have a reduced risk of ear, skin, stomach, and respiratory       infections; diarrhea; and sudden infant death syndrome. In       the longer term, breastfed children have a reduced risk of       obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, asthma, and childhood       leukemia. Women who breastfed their children have a reduced       long-term risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease,       and breast and ovarian cancers. The American Academy of       Pediatrics recommends infants be exclusively breastfed for       about 6 months with continued breastfeeding while introducing       complementary foods for at least 1 year.                             Barriers to Success         The great majority of pregnant women and new parents want       to breastfeed, but significant barriers in the community,       health care, and employment settings can impede breastfeeding       success. In 2017, the national breastfeeding initiation rate       among infants was 84.1 percent, representing a 13.8 percent       increase from 2001. However, by six months of age, only 25.6       percent of U.S. infants exclusively breastfeed. Despite       overall increases in breastfeeding initiation and duration,       deep racial, geographic, and socioeconomic disparities in       breastfeeding rates persist. Compared to national averages,       only 73.7 percent of Black infants and 80.7 percent of Native       American infants are ever breastfed, contributing to       inequalities in maternal and infant health outcomes.       Furthermore, a distressing 60 percent of mothers report that       they did not breastfeed for as long as they intended.        Structural and environmental barriers can make it difficult       or impossible for families to establish an adequate milk       supply to sustain human milk feeding at medically recommended       levels. For many families, rather than being a matter of       personal choice, infant feeding practice is informed by       circumstance.        More than half of mothers enter or return to the labor       force before their children turn one year old, with as many       as one in four women returning within just two weeks of       giving birth. When back at work or school, many discover that       they are unable to pump breast milk as frequently as       necessary or they have no choice but to pump in an unsanitary       or unsafe location, such as a bathroom. Economically-      marginalized women and non-white women are more likely to       return to work earlier than their more affluent white       counterparts. Without necessary accommodations, they are too       often unable to produce enough milk for a caregiver to feed       their child during separations and may not be able to       maintain their milk supply.        Breastfeeding families throughout the United States are       facing barriers that make it difficult or impossible to start       or continue breastfeeding--but it does not have to be this       way. Public health initiatives, including legal and policy       interventions and approaches designed to enable more infants       to breastfeed, have the potential to markedly improve       population health.           Current Laws and Simple Accommodations Across Industries         The Break Time for Nursing Mothers law (Break Time law),       passed in 2010, provides critical protections to ensure that       employees have reasonable break time and a safe, private       place to pump breast milk. All the same strategies that       businesses use for any other type of break time, such as rest       breaks, meal breaks, or medical breaks can be utilized to       support breastfeeding employees.        Businesses of all sizes and in every industry have found       simple, cost-effective ways to meet the needs of their       breastfeeding employees as well as their business. The       Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office on       Women's Health hosts the Supporting Nursing Moms at Work       resource, which provides a critical link between the need for       workplace support for breastfeeding families and the need for       implementation guidance for their employers. The online       resource provides a user-friendly tool that employers can use       to identify and implement industry-specific solutions to       providing time and space accommodations that work from farm       fields to grocery stores, and restaurants to offices. These       examples are already helping employers and employees identify       practical solutions that work for their business.        In many workspaces, compliance is as simple as placing       butcher paper or a curtain over a window in a managers'       office. In outdoor worksites, pop up tents or the cab of a       construction vehicle are used to meet the needs of       breastfeeding employees. To be functional, the pumping space       simply needs to be furnished with seating and a flat surface       such as a desk, small table, or shelf for the breast pump. As       long as the space is available each time the breastfeeding       employee needs it, the employer is meeting the requirements       of the law. If there are no breastfeeding employees, the       employer does not need to maintain a space.                  Gaps in Current Law and Impact on Families         Unfortunately, the placement of the Break Time law within       section 7(r) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) resulted       in nearly 9 million women--nearly one in four women of       childbearing age--being excluded from coverage. Those left       unprotected include teachers, software engineers, and many       nurses, among others. Without these protections,       breastfeeding employees face serious health consequences,       including risk of painful illness and infection, diminished       milk supply, or in ability to continue breastfeeding.        Over the past decade we have learned how to make       breastfeeding and employment work, but the significant       coverage gaps in the Break Time for Nursing Mothers law mean       that workplace breastfeeding accommodation implementation is       radically inconsistent. Employees of the same company and in       the same building frequently do not have access to the same       accommodations, and to figure out who must be accommodated       can be complicated for businesses.        In addition, little recourse is available for employees who       are covered by the Break Time law to ensure they can use       their rights. Section 7(r) of the FLSA does not specify any       penalties if an employer is found to have violated the break       time for nursing mothers requirements. This means that in       most instances, an employee may only bring an action for       unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation and an       additional equal amount in liquidated damages. According to       the Request for Information on the Break Time for Nursing       Mothers provision, which includes the Department of Labor's       preliminary interpretations of the law, ``Because employers       are not required to compensate employees for break time to       express breastmilk, in most circumstances there will not be       any unpaid minimum wage or overtime compensation associated       with the failure to provide such breaks.    A Bipartisan Solution to Simplify Existing Law: the PUMP for Nursing                                Mothers Act         A policy solution with bipartisan support, the PUMP Act       would support breastfeeding employees while clarifying       implementation for employers across the nation. The bill       would strengthen the 2010 Break Time law by closing the       coverage gap and providing remedies for nursing mothers that       are available for other violations of the FLSA.        The Break Time for Nursing Mothers provision is written       with language that provides  [[Page H5807]]       immense flexibility and does not require the construction of       a permanent, dedicated lactation space. The PUMP for Nursing       Mothers Act would maintain this flexibility. More than half       of all states have enacted legislation that impacts       breastfeeding employees. For many of these states, the PUMP       for Nursing Mothers Act would have little to no impact on       employer requirements.        For over ten years, the U.S. Breastfeeding Committee has       worked with organizations and government agencies on this       issue. We have documented the experiences of workers and       employers, seen the innovative solutions created by       businesses of all sizes, and identified the legislative gaps       that need to be addressed. After more than a decade of       raising awareness and mobilizing action, one thing is clear:       America needs the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act.        By aligning federal law with the needs of families and       ensuring that employers have the comprehensive resources and       support that they need, we can create a better tomorrow       together.        Thank you for your consideration.
