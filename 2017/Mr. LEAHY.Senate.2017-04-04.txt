 Mr. President, I want to express my serious concerns with  the budget for fiscal year 2018 recently proposed by President Trump.  If adopted, this budget would have severe consequences on many  Americans, but I am particularly concerned that it would be low-income  families who are impacted the most. As vice chair of the Senate  Appropriations Committee, I will do everything in my power to make sure  that does not happen.   Among countless examples within a budget that is out of touch and  that will drive more American families into poverty, the President's  proposal to eliminate the Community Service Block Grant, the Low Income  Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, and the Weatherization  Assistance Program should be concerning to all of us. These are  resources that are essential not only to Vermonters, but to millions of  families throughout the country.   The Community Service Block Grant ensures that low-income families  receive the support they need for basic food and housing assistance,  financial planning tools, and fuel in winter months. LIHEAP and  weatherization services ensure that families do not have to choose  between food and heat. They ensure that families stay safe from harmful  asbestos that may be in the walls of their old Vermont farmhouses or  their inefficient mobile homes. In States like mine, home heating is a  life-and-death matter.   We need to show compassion when drafting our budget and provide  support for those programs that help hard-working families in need. We  must see the faces behind these proposed budget cuts. Vulnerable people  should never be at the whim of politically driven priorities.   We have to do better. I would like to begin by recognizing the crisis  so many families will face in this country without the help of our  community action agencies. Without them, families will go cold. They  will choose not to eat so they can heat their homes. They will deny  themselves healthcare and miss rent payments so that they can stay  warm, so that they can stay alive.   Last month, I had the pleasure of seeing a longtime friend and fellow  Vermonter Jan Demers, who serves as the executive director of the  Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity, CVOEO, Vermont's  largest community action agency in Burlington. It was Jan who said it  best, noting that, ``President Trump's budget is like one amputation  after another. Not bringing health to the community but cut after cut-- loss after loss.'' I am proud that CVOEO and the other community action  agencies continue to meet the needs of these families and hope all  Senators will continue to support them as I have during my time in the  Senate.   In recognition of their leadership, I ask unanimous consent that a  statement by Jan Demers be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Good morning, my name is Jan Demers and I am the Executive       Director of the Champlain Valley Office of Economic       Opportunity. On behalf of the more than 23,000 Vermonters       that CVOEO serves: Welcome. We are standing in CVOEOs       Weatherization Warehouse. It is a fitting place to talk about       President Trump's recently released budget. Thank you to       Senator Leahy and your staff for organizing this press       conference and for the leadership you provide for Vermont and       the nation. Thank you to Jonathan Bond and our staff and for       all the Community Action Agencies who carry on this good       work. Thank you to Bobby Arnell, Sean Brown, Sarah Phillips       and to our partners in the State of Vermont who uphold the       values of care and wellness for all Vermonters. And thank you       to Mr. Todd Alexander who typifies the strength of those we       serve.        Community Action Agencies exist to support community well-      being. We make sure that everyone can reach their potential       and fully contribute to the total strength of our       communities.        How does Mr. Trump's budget affect CVOEO? It zeros out the       Community Service Block Grant--$990,687. This is the       foundational grant that undergirds the majority of our       programs. It zeros out the Low Income Home Energy Assistance       Program (LIHEAP) that keeps Vermonters warm in the winter. It       zeros out the Department of Energy's Weatherization Program.       Thankfully the State of Vermont is our main source of       Weatherization funding. However, this will mean that 30       Vermont homes will not be weatherized in our area. Just those       3 cuts amount to a total of $2,056,675.        On top of that there are the cuts to Head Start, Fair       Housing, Housing assistance, Mobile Home, and Voices Against       Violence. There isn't an area, program, staff person or any       of the 23,000 people we served that won't be touched and       experience devastation of services due to this budget.        We have heard over and over that the war on poverty didn't       work. However, when the programs that created the War on       Poverty in 1964 measured the percent of poverty it was at       20%. Seven years later the percentage of poverty was at 11%.       It worked! Then the years of cutting started, cut after cut       was enacted weakening the effort substantially. In 2012 the       measured percent of poverty was 15%. Currently the percentage       of poverty is 13.5%. To me that signifies that the measured       efforts put into place during the Obama years are working.        There isn't a CVOEO Program that isn't decimated by this       budget bringing great loss for the entire population of over       23,000 people that CVOEO served in FY 16. Community Action       Agencies exist to support community well-being. Instead of       health, this budget is like one amputation after another. Not       bringing health to the community but cut after cut--loss       after loss.        Our vision is bridging gaps and building futures for the       people we serve. This budget widens the chasm and diminishes       life.        This cannot be the last word in the Federal budget for FY       18.        Thank you, Senator Leahy for bringing us a better way.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week, Egypt's President Abdel Fattah  el-Sisi is in Washington where he is meeting with President Trump and  other senior administration officials, as well as some Members of  Congress.   President Trump has spoken glowingly of President el-Sisi, as he has  of Russian President Putin and Philippine President Duterte. ``Strong  leaders,'' he calls them, as if that is enough to justify our  wholehearted support. Unfortunately, world history is replete with  examples of strong, messianic leaders who abused their power in ways  that caused immense hardship for their people and divisiveness and  conflict in their countries.   Despite that, the White House has voiced its strong support for  President el-Sisi, and for U.S.-Egyptian relations.   I have been to Egypt many times, and I have voted for billions of  dollars in U.S. aid for Egypt to support economic and security programs  in that country. I have recognized positive developments in Egypt when  they occur, such as President el-Sisi's decision to undertake economic  reforms, including by reducing some subsidies. Far more needs to be  done, however, if Egypt's economy is to break free of decades of state  control, endemic corruption, and gross mismanagement.   I am also aware of the security threats Egypt faces in Libya and in  the Sinai, although I and others have expressed deep concern with the  flawed tactics the Egyptian Government is using to combat those  threats. The U.S. has an interest in helping Egypt confront these  challenges by addressing the underlying causes in a manner that is  effective and consistent with international law.   President Trump has called President el-Sisi a fantastic guy.  Ironically, that says a lot more about President Trump than it does  about President el-Sisi.   President el-Sisi, a former general who seized power by force, has  ruled with an iron fist. He has effectively banned public criticism of  his government since the removal of former President Morsi, enforcing  what amounts to a prohibition on protests and arresting hundreds of  people in connection with the ban, many preemptively.   President el-Sisi's government has engaged in one of the widest  arrest campaigns in the country's modern history, targeting a broad  spectrum of political opponents. Local civil society organizations  estimate that between 40,000 and 60,000 people are detained on  political grounds, such as for protesting or calling for a change in  government. Police have accused many of having links to the Muslim  Brotherhood, usually without evidence that they have advocated or  engaged in violence. Many other detainees belong to other political  organizations or have no party affiliation.   A systematic crackdown on Egypt's independent civil society has left  it on the verge of collapse. According to human rights groups, nearly  every prominent Egyptian human rights defender or civil society leader  is banned  [[Page S2212]]  from leaving the country as part of a judicial investigation into the  foreign funding of their organizations. A law signed by President el- Sisi in 2014 would allow prosecutors to seek 25-year sentences for  illegally receiving foreign funding. Parliament has also proposed a new  law regulating civil society organizations which, if adopted, would  effectively outlaw independent human rights work in the country.   Despite repeated requests by U.S. officials, including some  Republicans and Democrats in Congress, President el-Sisi's government  has refused to release those detained for political reasons for months  or years without charge or on trumped up charges like Egyptian-American  citizen Aya Hijazi.   The media has also been targeted, with authorities threatening and  jailing journalists who reported on political opposition. Some foreign  journalists have been barred from the country after writing articles  critical of the government. As of December 2016, Egypt was the third- highest jailer of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect  Journalists. This pattern of harassment and arrests is not new. It has  been happening for years, and, contrary to the representations of  Egyptian officials, it is getting worse.   According to Human Rights Watch, members of the security forces,  particularly the Interior Ministry's National Security Agency,  routinely torture detainees to elicit confessions. This torture usually  occurs during periods of enforced disappearance that can last for weeks  or months. The widespread use of torture has also been reported by the  State Department. Despite hundreds of reported cases of torture and  enforced disappearance, since 2013, only a handful of police officers  have reportedly been punished for violating the law.   According to information I have received, prison conditions remain  deplorable, and political detainees are beaten, often deprived of  contact with relatives and lawyers, and denied access to medical care.   The government's use of U.S. aircraft and other military equipment in  its counterterrorism campaign against a local ISIS affiliate in the  northern Sinai has not only resulted in indiscriminate attacks against  civilians and other gross violations of human rights, it has made the  terrorism situation worse. Requests by myself, as well as State and  Defense Department officials and by independent journalists and  representatives of human rights groups, for access to conflicted areas,  have been denied.   While President Trump and other U.S. officials unabashedly praise  President el-Sisi, I wonder how they reconcile their portrayal of him  with his crackdown against civil society and brutal repression of  dissent. In fact, it can't be reconciled, and it damages our own  credibility as a strong defender of human rights and democratic  principles.   I want to reiterate what I said in this Chamber on September 27,  2016, when I spoke about Aya Hijazi, the young Egyptian American social  worker currently detained in Egypt. Ms. Hijazi, along with her Egyptian  husband and five employees of their organization Belady, has been  accused of salacious crimes that the government has yet to corroborate  with any credible evidence; yet she has been jailed since May 21, 2014.  Just last month, a decision in her case was inexplicably delayed until  later this month. It is long past time for her ordeal to end.   The United States and Egypt have common interests in an increasingly  troubled region. Egypt has acted to reduce the smuggling of weapons  into Gaza, and it has helped to broker ceasefires with Hamas. Our  support for Egypt is demonstrated by the fact that, over the past 70  years, U.S. taxpayers have provided more than $70 billion in economic  and military aid to Egypt. I doubt that many Egyptians know that, as  most have a decidedly unfavorable opinion of the United States.   After three decades of corrupt autocratic rule by former President  Mubarak, Egypt once again has a former military officer as President  who has chosen to rule by force. It is neither justified, nor is it  necessary. If, on the contrary, President el-Sisi were to demonstrate  that he has a credible plan for transforming Egypt's economy, for  improving education and creating jobs, for respecting due process and  other fundamental rights, and for addressing the discrimination and  lack of economic opportunities that are at the root of the violence in  the Sinai, the Egyptian people would support him. They would also have  a brighter future. Instead, I fear that, by relying on repression, he  is sowing the seeds of misery and civil unrest, which is in the  interest of neither the Egyptian people nor the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I do not see anybody on the floor, but I  understand that this time has been reserved for the Republican side.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, first I wish to commend the senior Senator  from Washington State for her terrific statement.   I know, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, that we reported the  nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch by the narrowest margin--a party-line  vote. The majority leader then filed cloture to cut off debate on this  nominee. He has shown that he will use whatever tactic is necessary to  ensure this nominee is confirmed, no matter the concern of Senators or  millions of other Americans.   Today is just the 75th day of the Trump administration. After only 75  days of having a Republican-controlled White House and Congress, the  Republican leader has promised to vitiate the historic rights of the  minority in this institution. He is prepared to abdicate the Senate's  constitutional duty to serve as a check on the President and our  responsibility to protect the independence of the Federal judiciary,  all in the service of Donald Trump's agenda and because, as we know,  Donald Trump asked him to.   Senate Republicans seek to justify their tactics by claiming that  Democrats would do no different were the shoe on the other foot. They  are free to make that argument, but it is wrong. There is one claim in  particular that I need to address. Some Republicans have asserted that,  if President Bush had made a Supreme Court nomination in 2008, the  final year of his term, Democrats would have pocket filibustered that  nomination the same way that Senate Republicans did to Chief Judge  Merrick Garland. Well, I was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee  during that time, and I can assure them that they are wrong. Democrats  did not invent an election year exception to the Constitution. Look no  further than when a Democratic-led Senate confirmed Justice Kennedy  during a Presidential election year.   If President Bush had made a Supreme Court nomination in 2008, that  nominee would have had a hearing, and all Senators would have had the  opportunity to debate that nomination on the floor. As Senator Hatch  and I wrote in 2001, ``The Judiciary Committee's traditional practice  has been to report Supreme Court nominees to the Senate once the  Committee has completed its consideration. This has been true even in  cases where Supreme Court nominees were opposed by a majority of the  Judiciary Committee.'' This Senator would not have disregarded  precedent and constitutional obligation because of partisan politics.  Whether such a nominee would have been confirmed would have depended on  his or her views, but the nominee would have been given a fair process,  which Senate Republicans denied Chief Judge Garland when they pocket  filibustered him.   My record in 2008 shows that I treated President Bush's nominees  fairly. We confirmed 28 circuit and district nominees in 2008,  including 10 in 1 day, just weeks before the election, and reduced the  number of judicial vacancies to just 34. Compare that to 2016, when  Senate Republicans allowed just nine circuit and district nominees to  be confirmed in total. That is less than 33 percent of the 2008 number.  Moreover, Republicans' pocket filibusters, even for nominees supported  by home State Republican Senators, allowed the number of judicial  vacancies to skyrocket over 100. Of course, they had done the same  thing at the end of the Clinton administration, pocket filibustering  more than 60 nominees. Those are the facts. Anyone who claims that  judicial nominees were never obstructed before 2001 has conveniently  forgotten those facts.   When Senate Democrats changed the cloture rule for lower court  nominations in 2013, we did so reluctantly and only after Senate  Republicans repeatedly abused Senate rules to wage in unparalleled  obstruction of President Obama's nominees over a period of years. By  November 2013, the Republican leader had orchestrated an unprecedented  number of filibusters, including requiring cloture motions on 34  circuit and district nominees in less than 5 years--compared to 18  nominees who faced cloture motions during the entire 8-year tenure of  President Bush.   When it comes to judicial nominations, the filibuster has been a tool  to protect the independence of our courts by compelling Presidents to  find mainstream, consensus nominees who do not bring an agenda with  their lifetime appointments to our courts. Senate Democrats  filibustered a small number of President George W. Bush's nominees, but  it was not because they were conservative, or had been nominated by a  Republican President. It was because we had serious doubts about their  ability to put partisanship and ideology aside and be fair, neutral  judges. Or it was because the President had ignored the traditional  role of home State Senators when selecting the nominee. We confirmed  numerous  [[Page S2320]]  conservative nominees, including Judge Neil Gorsuch. In fact, during  the 41 months that I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee while  President Bush was in office, the Democratic-majority Senate confirmed  more circuit and district nominees than were confirmed during the 55  months when Republicans held the majority.   When President Obama took office, Senate Republicans imposed a new  standard. Just 2 days after he was sworn in, a group of extreme  conservative activists instructed Senator McConnell to treat President  Obama's judicial nominees in an ``unprecedented'' way, and that is what  he did. For the first time, even noncontroversial district court  nominees were subject to filibusters--Leader Reid was at one time  forced to file for cloture on 17 of them in a single day because of  Republican obstruction, even though none were particularly  controversial and many actually had the support of their home State  Republican Senators.   Republicans filibustered judicial nominees they ultimately supported.  They stalled Senate action for weeks and months on judicial nominees  who they did not oppose and who they ultimately voted to confirm once  their filibusters ended. Senate Republicans kept making up new excuses  for filibustering nominees that had nothing to do with the nominees  themselves. They abused the Thurmond Rule to filibuster Judge Robert  Bacharach, even though he had been reported almost unanimously and was  supported by his two very conservative Republican home State Senators.  It was obstruction for obstruction's sake.    But the final straw was when Republicans blockaded the DC Circuit.  The Senate had confirmed four of President Bush's nominees to that  court, but only one of President Obama's five nominees. When Senate  Republicans filibustered President Obama's last three DC Circuit  nominees in late 2013, they barely even bothered to pretend to find  fault with the nominees themselves. These were mainstream nominees with  broad support. Their only alleged flaw was that they had been nominated  by President Obama. Senate Republicans unilaterally decided that  President Obama should not get to make additional nominations to that  court, effectively trying to nullify the results of the 2012 election-- a prelude to their unprecedented treatment of Chief Judge Merrick  Garland.   Compare that to the situation we are in this week. We are told that  we must rubberstamp Judge Gorsuch or the majority leader will change  the rules. Now, some may remember reports from last year where several  Senators promised to blockade any Supreme Court nominations by one of  the Presidential candidates if that candidate won the election. Of  course, those were Republican Senators talking about Secretary Clinton.  But that proposed blockade is not what is happening here. The fact is  that there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and that vacancy should  be filled with a qualified, mainstream judge. I know that a Republican  President would probably make a different selection than the one I  would make, but I have always been willing to consult with Presidents  of both parties to find mainstream, consensus nominees. That is my  constitutional obligation as a Senator.   Now, all Presidents, including President Trump, are entitled to have  their Supreme Court nominees considered on the merits. Over my 42 years  in the Senate, I have evaluated every nominee on the merits, and I have  never gone to reflexive partisanship. In fact, I have voted to confirm  six Supreme Court nominees of Republican Presidents. I do not know if  there is any Republican in this Senate who could say that about  nominees of Democratic Presidents.   Although I had concerns that Judge Gorsuch would bring a partisan  agenda to the Court, I went to his hearing with an open mind. I had  hoped he could convince me that he was a conservative I could support,  as I did Chief Justice Roberts. I voted for Chief Justice Roberts not  because I thought I would always agree with him--and I do not--but  because I was able to take him at his word that he did not have an  ideological agenda. I cannot take Judge Gorsuch's word that same way.   It is no secret that Judge Gorsuch is very conservative--that much  was evident back in 2006 when he was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit.  Back then, he did not have a judicial record, but he gave answers that  were reassuring. He discussed the importance of following precedent and  of judicial restraint and deference to Congress. He said, ``Precedent  is to be respected and honored. It is not something to be diminished or  demeaned. It is something you should try to uphold wherever you can,  with the objective being, follow the law as written and not replace it  with my own preferences, or anyone else's.'' He explained that judges  should not be ideologues who disregard precedent ``to effect [their]  own personal views, [their] politics, [their] personal preferences.''  Well, I wish that same judge were before us today, but he is not.   Judge Gorsuch has a fine resume. I do not take issue with the  qualifications on paper, but my concern is that he has not lived up to  his own standard. I am concerned that his personal views and his  politics have permeated throughout his judicial philosophy. That is, in  fact, the reason why his nomination is before us today.   To know what kind of a Justice Judge Gorsuch would be, we have to  understand why he was chosen. President Trump made very clear right  from the beginning that he had a litmus test: Anyone he nominated to  the Supreme Court would automatically overturn Roe v. Wade. Then- candidate Trump proceeded to outsource the selection process to far- right interest groups. The leader of that unprecedented vetting process  admitted they were not driven by ``Who's a really smart lawyer and who  has been really accomplished?'' but by a search for someone ``who  understands these things like we do.''   Let us be clear. These are not groups that support independent judges  who act with restraint. These groups search for nominees who will skew  the courts, who will call to reject precedent, and who will further  their partisan agenda. And they gave President Trump a list and said:  Here, you are allowed to pick from our people. If these groups sought a  mainstream, widely respected, and independent jurist, they would have  been as supportive as I was of Chief Judge Merrick Garland. Instead,  they funneled money to push Senate Republicans to hold Chief Judge  Garland's nomination hostage and to have the Senate defy the  Constitution of the United States for the first time ever in not  allowing advice and consent.   The Federalist Society's purpose statement, which is on their  website, calls for ``reordering priorities within the legal system to  place a premium on,'' among other things, ``traditional values.'' These  groups and the billionaire donors who fund them have a clear agenda-- one that is antichoice, antienvironment, and procorporate. I am not one  to gamble, but in my mind they would not have gambled with millions of  dollars on Judge Gorsuch. They chose and invested in him for a reason.  They are supremely confident he shares their far-right agenda. So is  the White House.   The White House Chief of Staff has said that Judge Gorsuch ``has the  vision of Donald Trump.'' He said that, with this nomination, ``We're  talking about a change of potentially 40 years of law.'' It is clear  that the people who vetted Judge Gorsuch do not want a nominee who will  ``call balls and strikes.'' They want a nominee who will expand the  strike zone to the detriment of hard-working Americans. We should all  find that concerning.   At his public hearing, Judge Gorsuch did nothing to allay my  concerns. In fact, he solidified them. I cannot recall a nominee  refusing to answer such basic questions about the principles underlying  our Constitution. These were fundamental questions that we should ask  every nominee seeking a lifetime appointment to our Highest Court, but  Judge Gorsuch would not answer. Some of the questions that I asked him  were not intended to be difficult. Several could have been answered by  any first-year law student, with ease; yet, unless we were asking about  fishing or basketball, Judge Gorsuch stonewalled and avoided any  substantive response. He was excruciatingly evasive. His sworn  testimony and his approach to complying with the Judiciary Committee's  historic role in the confirmation process was, in my view, patronizing.   Judge Gorsuch claimed that he did not want to prejudge potential  cases.  [[Page S2321]]  That is a valid concern, but only within reason. It should not be used  to evade questions on long-settled precedent or on the meaning and  purpose of constitutional provisions. Judge Gorsuch would not even  state whether he agreed with certain landmark Supreme Court cases such  as Brown v. Board of Education. He refused to say whether he believes  that the Equal Protection Clause applies to women. He refused to say  whether the framers of the First Amendment believed it permitted the  use of a religious litmus test. He refused to provide information  regarding his selection by extreme special interest groups and a  billionaire businessman. And he even refused to confirm whether he  would continue to recuse himself from matters involving that  billionaire--as he has done on the Tenth Circuit--even if presented  with the exact same facts.   Other Supreme Court nominees have been far more forthcoming. When  asked whether he agreed with important precedents, then-Judge Alito  answered the questions. When I asked then-Judge Roberts whether  Congress has war powers, he said, ``Of course. The Constitution  specifically gives that power [to declare war] to Congress.'' I asked  whether Congress has the power to stop a war, and he said, ``Congress  certainly has the power of the purse,'' but added, ``as a judge, I  would obviously be in a position of considering both arguments, the  argument for the Legislature and the argument for the Executive. The  argument on the Executive side will rely on authority as Commander in  Chief, and whatever authorities derive from that.'' It was perhaps not  the answer I would have liked, but he certainly engaged with the  question and showed that he understood the issue in a way that did not  prejudge any potential case.   I later asked then-Judge Roberts whether ``Congress can make rules  that may impinge upon the President's command functions.'' He  responded: ``Certainly, Senator. The point that Justice Jackson is  making there is that the Constitution vests pertinent authority in  these areas in both branches. The President is the Commander in Chief,  and that meant something to the Founders. On the other hand, as you  just quoted, Congress has the authority to issue regulations governing  the Armed Forces, another express provision in the Constitution. Those  two can conflict if by making regulations for the Armed Forces,  Congress does something that interferes with, in the President's view,  his command authority, and in some cases those disputes will be  resolved in Court, as they were in the Youngstown case.'' Whether one  agrees with it or not, that was a substantive answer.   I asked Judge Gorsuch a similar question in writing--whether he  agreed that ``the Constitution provides Congress its own war powers and  Congress may exercise these powers to restrict the President--even in a  time of war'' as the Court held in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. Here is the  totality of his response: ``I agree that Hamdan v. Rumsfeld recognized  limitations on the power of the President. It is a precedent of the  Supreme Court entitled to all the weight due such a precedent.''  Perhaps that is better than no response at all, but not by much.   When I asked Judge Gorsuch a straightforward question about whether  the Framers of the First Amendment believed it permitted the use of a  religious litmus test, he refused to answer. Any first-year law student  knows the answer to that one.   I asked then-Judge Roberts a similar question--whether he would  reject Korematsu and hold it unconstitutional to intern U.S. residents  who ``have a particular nationality or ethnic or religious group.'' He  said: ``I suppose a case like that could come before the Court. I would  be surprised to see it, and I would be surprised if there were any  arguments that could support it.'' I do not think he prejudged any  cases, but he was still able to provide a real answer to a basic  question--and he earned my support.   I had hoped that, if Judge Gorsuch was not willing to be transparent  for the lights and cameras, he would at least answer written  questions--given time to carefully craft answers. Again, he declined.  He refused to expressly acknowledge that Congress has war powers, even  though we know we do. Every high school student knows that the  Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war. He again  misstated the holding of Citizens United in an attempt to evade my  question about Congress's ability to enact campaign finance  legislation. He provided no answer at all to questions regarding the  Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County to gut the Voting Rights Act  or about women's rights to obtain contraception. And, again, he refused  to answer whether the First Amendment prohibits the President from  imposing a religious test, even when the Trump administration has  adamantly claimed such a litmus test is not at issue with his travel  ban.   Previous nominees respected the Judiciary Committee's constitutional  role by answering questions in a substantive way, not with mere  platitudes. The difference is clear to Vermonters. As an editorial in  the Rutland Herald put it:         Gorsuch's affable muteness sent a message: I am above the       people and their concerns. I have no responsibility to anyone       but the narrow band of millionaires and ideologues who have       advanced my nomination and to the President who has declared       war on the American government.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  at the conclusion of my remarks the full editorial.   Judge Gorsuch claimed that his personal views do not matter so he  would not share them. But that did not stop him from speaking at length  about overcriminalization and arguing that there are too many Federal  criminal laws and regulations. Those of us on the Judiciary Committee  know this is a substantive and controversial policy issue that has been  vigorously debated in recent years. I have to wonder why this was the  only issue where he put forward his actual views. That is not good  enough for me. As the article by Garrett Epps in the Atlantic put it,  Judge Gorsuch's refusal to answer questions implied that the role of a  judge is ``a job which calls, apparently, for neither values nor any  firm connection to human life as it is lived.'' The American people  know better.   All of this matters because court decisions, especially Supreme Court  decisions, are not simply detached applications of neutral principles.  If there were, all judges would reach the same results. They do not.  Legal decisions are not mechanical. They are matters of interpretation  and, often, matters of justice. One Supreme Court Justice said more  than a century ago: ``When we take our seats on the bench we are not  struck with blindness, and forbidden to know as judges what we see as  men.''   Whether he will acknowledge it or not, Judge Gorsuch's record says a  lot about his judgment and his sense of justice. In a policy role at  the Justice Department, he embraced broad and discredited assertions of  Executive power. Judge Gorsuch once complained about liberals relying  on the courts to vindicate their constitutional rights, but, once on  the bench, he had no problem rubberstamping the far right's social  agenda when he ruled that employers could control their employees'  access to contraception. As a judge, he twisted statutory language to  limit the rights of workers, of women, and children with disabilities.   Judge Gorsuch also reached for broad constitutional questions that  were not before him in order to advance his agenda. Just last summer,  Judge Gorsuch wrote a concurrence to his own opinion in a case called  Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch. His unanimous panel opinion decided the  case on narrow grounds. But Judge Gorsuch nevertheless wrote a separate  concurrence to argue that the Chevron doctrine should be overturned.  The Chevron doctrine not only forms the basis for our modern  government, but it is well-settled law and has been for decades. As  Emily Bazelon and Eric Posner wrote in the New York Times, ``The  administrative state isn't optional in our complex society. It's  indispensable.''   Judge Gorsuch's rejection of that has shown that he is not a  mainstream nominee. His judicial record demonstrates a partisan  agenda--a hostility toward our government's power to enact  environmental, labor, consumer rights, and other regulations that keep  hard-working Americans safe and ensure a level playing field--not just  for the wealthy few, but for all hard-working Americans.  [[Page S2322]]    Between not answering questions, Judge Gorsuch spoke repeatedly about  the limited role that judges play in our democracy. His actual record  belies that claim. I think that is precisely why these extreme-right  interests groups selected Judge Gorsuch. That is why the President's  Chief of Staff promised he will bring a change of 40 years of law, and  that is why I cannot support this nomination.   It is for this nominee that Senate Republicans have brought us to  this precipice, but perhaps we should not be surprised. Republican  leadership has sought to govern only by simple majority since day 1 of  the Trump administration. They paraded before the Senate the most  extreme and partisan slate of Cabinet nominees I have ever seen. Their  signature legislative goal--to repeal the Affordable Care Act-- collapsed under the weight of their own intraparty infighting. Then,  they dusted off the Congressional Review Act and, by party-line votes,  rolled back more than a dozen environmental, workplace, privacy,  healthcare, and transparency protections--all over the objections of  the minority.   Think about that. Republicans have not sought compromise on anything  in this Congress. That is not the way to govern. To give you one  example, they repealed an important internet privacy rule that  protected Americans' online activity. That means that by party-line  vote, hard-working Americans will now see their private internet  activity sold to the highest bidder for greater corporate profits. They  are allowing these companies to basically come in and spy in your house  because they are making money.   But Senate Republicans didn't stop there. They rolled back  protections to ensure that all students have the same educational  opportunities. They eliminated rules requiring employers to maintain  records of workplace injuries so employers could avoid accountability.  In other words, if you have major injuries, you do not have to keep a  record of that to make sure nobody knows this is a dangerous place to  work. They rolled back rules holding coal companies accountable for  their pollution. Most recently, Republicans undermined healthcare  access for millions of Americans, rolling back protections under the  title X program. In underserved communities and rural areas like  Vermont, title X is critical in making sure women have access to the  basic healthcare they need.   But that is what one-party rule gets you. They are great at looking  out for corporate interests. They struggle at looking out for the  interests of hard-working Americans. The irony of it all is that even  these partisan efforts have been too partisan for some Republicans.  Three times this year--the most of any Vice President since 1911--Vice  President Pence was forced to make the trip to Capitol Hill to break a  tie and ensure some of these extreme measures passed.   With the Gorsuch nomination, Republicans are proving they have  no interest in playing by the rules; they prefer to break them. The  unprecedented obstruction of Chief Judge Merrick Garland is going to be  a permanent stain on this body. But then, days after the 2016  election--after Republicans turned their back on the Constitution for a  whole year, even though they had sworn an oath to uphold the  Constitution, which calls for advice and consent, they refused to  advise and consent and have a vote on Chief Judge Merrick Garland-- Republican leaders threatened to change the rules to get their own  nominee through--before we even had a name. After disregarding his  constitutional obligations for nearly a year, the majority leader now  tells us we must rubberstamp President Trump's nominee or he will  forever damage the Senate.    It is interesting that the majority leader's argument for obstructing  Chief Judge Merrick Garland was that the American people needed to  weigh in on this decision, as if they had not weighed in when they  reelected President Obama in 2012. But when the American people did  vote last November, nearly 3 million more of them chose Secretary  Clinton over Donald Trump. In fact, Ezra Klein had it right 2 months  ago when he wrote that this nomination ``makes a mockery of the popular  will.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous that the article, ``The country  deserves a compromise Supreme Court nominee. Neil Gorsuch isn't one,''  by Ezra Klein, also be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my  remarks.   Because of the divergence between the popular and electoral vote,  Klein argued, ``This is a time, if ever there was one, for a compromise  nominee, and Gorsuch is not a compromise nominee.'' This is exactly  what the 60-vote threshold is for. It helps ensure that Presidents  consult with Senators of both parties and find mainstream, consensus  nominees. The filibuster protects the rights of the minority and of  individual Senators; it protects the constitutional role of the Senate,  and it helps us protect the independence of the Supreme Court. The  Court is no place for someone with a radical, partisan agenda.   Senate Republicans are defending their threat to change the rules by  claiming that Judge Gorsuch is essentially a perfect nominee and that,  if Democrats filibuster Judge Gorsuch, then we would filibuster anyone.  That is nonsense. We have asked only for a mainstream nominee. Perhaps  they are confusing our approach with their blockade of Chief Judge  Garland. Unlike committee Republicans' treatment of Chief Judge Merrick  Garland, I take my constitutional duty to independently evaluate a  President's Supreme Court nominees seriously. As I have said, my votes  on Supreme Court nominations have never been about reflexive  partisanship. I have evaluated every nominee on the merits--and I have  voted to confirm six Supreme Court nominees of Republican Presidents.   If the Senate does not vote to end debate on this nomination, that is  a judgment on defects of this nominee. I remind the Republicans that  they do have a choice here. We can work together with President Trump  to find a mainstream, consensus nominee. I expect that an actual  mainstream nominee would be confirmed easily, even if nominated by  President Trump. Recall the process President Obama used when he  selected Chief Judge Merrick Garland. He sought advice from both  Republican and Democratic Members of Congress and was told this was a  person who would get a solid majority vote. He said: ``We have reached  out to every member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to  constitutional scholars, to advocacy groups, to bar associations,  representing an array of interests and opinions from all across the  spectrum.'' President Obama nominated somebody who, in normal times,  would have gotten the vast majority of votes of Republicans and  Democrats. If President Trump would have followed that template, we  would not be in this extraordinary place.   Let me conclude with this. In the committee, I said I respect this  institution as much as anyone. I have been here for more than 42 years.  I have devoted myself to the good the Senate can accomplish. We 100  Senators stand in the shoes of 320 million Americans. We should be the  conscience of the Nation. First and foremost, we must do what is right  by 320 million Americans. And I am not going to vote solely to protect  an institution when the rights of hard-working Americans are at risk.  It is for these reasons that I must oppose this nomination.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Rutland Herald, Apr. 5, 2017]                               No to Gorsuch         Senate Democrats are prepared to block the appointment of       Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, and the Republican       majority is prepared to change the Senate rules to push the       appointment through anyway.        Sens. Patrick Leahy and Bernie Sanders are willing to       filibuster the Gorsuch nomination, offended by the       candidate's evasiveness and alarmed by his ideological       rigidity. Mounting a filibuster comes at a cost, however.       Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the       Republicans would rewrite the Senate rules in order to       prohibit the use of a filibuster to block Supreme Court       nominees. As it stands the Republicans would need 60 votes to       shut down debate; if the Republicans change the rules,       Gorsuch would need only 51 votes to gain confirmation.        Elimination of the filibuster on high court nominations       worries some Democrats. But what do they have to lose? If       they give in to McConnell they will have retained the right       to filibuster but would have lost the power to exercise it.       Instead, they would have surrendered to one of the most       egregious power grabs in the nation's history, allowing the       Republicans to place their stamp on the judiciary in order to       impose an agenda on the nation that the nation has shown no       indication it supports.  [[Page S2323]]         The Republican campaign to seize dominance of the judiciary       must be seen as an effort by narrow interest groups to force       measures into the law that the American people would never       allow the legislative branch to advance. In order to pursue       this agenda, the Republicans have resorted to a contemptuous       assault on the role of Congress as the body that must consent       to judicial appointments.        The refusal of the Republicans to allow even a hearing on       President Barack Obama's appointment of Merrick Garland to       the Supreme Court showed that they were willing to scoff at       their own constitutional obligations in service of their       ideological and economic loyalties.        Gorsuch's refusal to answer even the most basic questions       about his thinking was an expression of the same contempt for       Congress that McConnell displayed in refusing to allow a       hearing for Garland. Gorsuch's affable muteness sent a       message: I am above the people and their concerns. I have no       responsibility to anyone but the narrow band of millionaires       and ideologues who have advanced my nomination and to the       president who has declared war on the American government.        Much is at stake with the Gorsuch nomination. His own       rulings suggest he adheres to a view that the high court went       astray in the 1930s in decisions allowing the federal       government to give rule-making power to agencies established       to protect workers, consumers, investors, air, water, the       purity of food and drugs. There is a cohort of extreme       conservatives--President Donald Trump's adviser Steve Bannon       is their godfather--who have declared that they want to       destroy the ``administrative state.'' Gorsuch's rulings and       his refusal to describe his thinking suggest he is one of       them.        The filibuster is an antidemocratic tradition in the Senate       that allows a minority to block action by refusing to end       debate on a measure. It is usually defended as a means to       demand from senators comity and a willingness to join with       the other side to find middle-of-the road solutions. In       normal times, the majority would nominate a centrist justice       in order to draw support from both sides so that the minority       would not see the need to mount a successful filibuster.        But these are not normal times. The Republicans have       succeeded in getting their way by refusing to compromise, and       they will continue to get their way until the Democrats stand       up to them. McConnell may ditch the filibuster this time, but       he may rue the day after the people revolt against the       disaster of the Trump administration and elect a Democratic       Senate.        Leahy and Sanders are taking a necessary and principled       stand against the Republican effort to steal a seat on the       Supreme Court. The Democrats may not win this battle, but       they are on the right side.                                   ____                          [From Vox, Feb. 3, 2017.]   The Country Deserves a Compromise Supreme Court Nominee. Neil Gorsuch                                 Isn't One.                              (By Ezra Klein)         The problem with Neil Gorsuch's nomination for the Supreme       Court is not Neil Gorsuch. He is, by all accounts, a       brilliant jurist and a kind man. But he is an extremely       conservative judge at a moment when an extremely conservative       judge makes a mockery of the popular will. For the good of       the country and the Court, this moment demands a compromise       nominee, and Gorsuch is not that.        Antonin Scalia's seat came open under a Democratic       president and a Republican Senate. This should have led to a       centrist nominee. And President Barack Obama tried to offer       one: Merrick Garland, who had previously been suggested for       the Court by Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch. Republicans did not       oppose Garland. They refused to consider him, or anyone else,       for the opening. They insisted that no opening on the Court       could be filled in an election year--an absurd faux principle       which implies that vacancies on the Court must be left       unfilled fully 50 percent of the time.        Having blocked efforts to replace Scalia under Obama,       Republicans were relieved when Trump won the Electoral       College. But Democrats decisively won the popular vote and       gained seats in the Senate. I do not want to overstate this:       US elections are not decided by simply tallying up votes. But       though the public will doesn't decide elections, it should       still weigh on those who hold power. This is a time for a       center-right nominee, just as Obama put forward a center-left       nominee in Garland.        The choice is all the more important because the Supreme       Court is, itself, a strange and undemocratic institution. It       is insulated from popular opinion, and judges serve for life.       Forcing it unnaturally out of step with the public is bad for       both the Court and the country.        Senate Democrats have the power to filibuster nominees to       the Supreme Court. I don't agree with those who think       Democrats should filibuster anyone who isn't Garland, as Sen.       Jeff Merkley is threatening. But Democrats should insist on a       compromise nominee--it would be wise of them to offer a       realistic list of more centrist candidates--and use the       filibuster to give their position teeth.        It's true that Republicans could eliminate the filibuster       with only 51 votes, but it's not clear why that's relevant.       If the Supreme Court filibuster will be eliminated the moment       it's used, then it's a fiction, and there's little cost to       seeing it unmasked as such. If Republicans would prefer to       destroy the filibuster than make any accommodation to the       majority of voters who wanted a Democratic president to be       making this pick, then that's their prerogative--at least the       Democrats' base will know their legislators did their best.       Democrats need not be in the business of protecting a       filibuster they cannot use.        It's a mistake to see Supreme Court nominations as about       the individual's resume rather than the country's wishes. If       the question is whether Gorsuch is qualified to be on the       Court, of course he is. But that's not the question. The       question is whether Gorsuch should be on the Court--whether       he is the right pick for this moment, and for the decades in       which he's likely to serve. He is not.        Republicans lost the popular vote in the presidential       election preceding Scalia's death. They lost the popular vote       in the presidential election after Scalia's death. The will       of the people might not be all that matters in politics, but       nor should it be meaningless. This is a time, if ever there       was one, for a compromise nominee, and Gorsuch is not a       compromise nominee. Republicans do not need to nominate a       liberal, but Democrats should insist they nominate a justice       more in the mold of Anthony Kennedy than Scalia.        The Supreme Court is undemocratic enough as it is. It does       not need to be made more so.     I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The Senator from California.
