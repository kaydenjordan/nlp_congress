 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Bill Pickett  of Danville, Illinois, who is celebrating 50 years of reporting the  news for Neuhoff Media.   Having recently graduated from Danville High School in 1968, Bill  became one of the youngest newsmen in the business at 17 years of age.  It wasn't very long after he started that Bill went live with his first  story: an explosion at the grain elevator in Danville. Bill witnessed  the fireball erupting and the walls of the elevator slowly crumble into  a heap of debris. All that night, Bill provided live updates on the  disaster. As the fire subsided, it became apparent to Bill that he had  found his calling.   Over the past half century, Bill has gone from answering phones to  being the news director for several news outlets. His duties require  him to act as investigative reporter, news gatherer, copy editor, and  broadcaster.   Mr. Speaker, many voices have been raised in recognition of Bill's  remarkable career, and I am pleased to be able to add my own to the  chorus. I wish Bill and Neuhoff Media all the best in the future as we  celebrate Mr. Bill Pickett's 50 years in radio.                            ____________________
