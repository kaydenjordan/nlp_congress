 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte for yielding. I  appreciate his boldness in protecting the citizens of America with  great legislation.   Mr. Speaker, when the father of Kate Steinle, Jim, testified before  Congress, he said: ``Everywhere Kate went throughout the world, she  shined the light of a good citizen from the United States of America.  Unfortunately, due to unjointed laws and basic incompetence of the  government, the United States has suffered a self-inflicted wound in  the murder of our daughter by the hand of a person that should have  never been on the streets in this country.''   Well, today we can resolve that.   Two years ago this weekend, Kate's life was ended when she was gunned  down by a five-time deported criminal illegal alien with seven prior  felony convictions.  [[Page H5350]]    Kate's Law would stiffen penalties, helping to stop these preventable  tragedies.   Additionally, today the House will pass the No Sanctuary for  Criminals Act as well.   You just heard: Will Democrats participate?   Well, 80 percent of Americans support ending sanctuary cities, and no  citizen should be in danger because politicians think they are above  the law.   So will Democrats participate? Will they listen to their  constituents?   Eighty percent of Americans feel pretty good about this law.   Both pieces of legislation serve the basic functions of our  government by keeping the people of our States and country safe from  those who wish to do us harm.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, our country will celebrate our  independence and the rebuke of the British monarchy. Even still, we  know across America, but especially in the great State of North  Carolina, we have our own king, who turns 80 on Sunday.   Richard ``The King'' Petty is the most decorated and respected driver  in the history of motor sports. His legendary 43 car dominated race  tracks for decades. He has even been awarded the Presidential Medal of  Freedom by President George H.W. Bush.   More importantly than Mr. Petty's work on the track are the lives  that he has impacted. The Petty family, through the work of multiple  charities and the impactful Victory Junction Camp, has served children  with disabilities in incredible ways.   Mr. Petty, you and Kyle and the rest of the family even showed what  grace and dignity looks like in the loss of a grandson.   We wish you a happy birthday today, Richard ``The King'' Petty. Thank  you for all you do for the people of North Carolina, and I will be  looking for that hat, those sunglasses, and that bright smile for years  to come.                            ____________________
