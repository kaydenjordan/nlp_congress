 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for  his leadership on this very important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family  and Small Business Tax Cuts Act. As chairman of the House Small  Business Committee, I have closely examined the effects that the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act that we previously passed has had on America's small  businesses, on startups, and on entrepreneurs.   From a Small Business Committee hearing that I chaired in July that  reviewed the impact of that law on Main Street companies to the many  small business optimism surveys that are published on a monthly  business, the results are in, and they are positive for our Nation's 30  million small businesses that about half of the workers in this country  work for. They work for small businesses.   The tax cuts have provided small businesses with the opportunity to  invest in their workers, invest in their equipment, and invest in their  dreams. A small business owner in my district in southern Ohio recently  testified: ``The recent tax reduction will have a positive impact on  our employees in 2018 and beyond.''   The shops on Main Street all across America are transforming our  communities and neighborhoods with job growth and business expansion,  and that means jobs for more Americans.   With our economic engines starting to rev, Congress should take the  next step in the tax debate, which is making the tax cuts for our  Nation's job creators permanent. That is what we are doing here today.   Making section 199A, the small business pass-through provision,  stronger will be a benefit to small businesses from my State of Ohio  and to our States all across the country, from coast to coast.   I applaud the work of Mr. Davis, Mr. Brady, and the other members of  the Ways and Means Committee on this issue. It has been very important.  When our Nation's small businesses, entrepreneurs, and startups are  thriving, so are their employees, the families of those employees, and  America's consumers.                                time  0945
