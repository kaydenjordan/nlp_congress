 Madam Speaker, Don Young has 50 years of stories, and I  will tell you just one in 20 seconds.   Madam Speaker, Don Young, faced with a young Member wanting to affect  bypass mail in Alaska, could have dressed me down and told me over his  dead body. Instead, he directed me to go to Alaska to see how bypass  mail was done in the post office there. He sent me to an Aleutian  Island, sent me to a few other appropriate places, and changed my view  of why we have bypass mail.   That is the Don Young I will remember.
