 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the all-women team  of scientists from the Novavax Vaccine Lab in Gaithersburg, Maryland,  who are working to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus.   Nita Patel, the director for vaccine development and antibody  discovery at Novavax, is leading the team of scientists who have been  working on a  [[Page H1562]]  vaccine since January 10. While they still need to be tested, the team  has already developed three potential vaccines.   Women's History Month is the perfect time to highlight how women have  contributed in our past and continue to contribute to the world now and  into the future. Today we recognize this group of scientists and  emphasize the importance of having women across all industries and  leadership positions around the world.                    50th Anniversary of Delta Sigma Theta     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Montgomery  County Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority for all of the  work they have done for the community over their rich, 50-year history.   The Montgomery County Chapter was founded in March of 1970 by 28  women under past National President Lillian P. Benbow. The organization  was founded to help promote the quality of life for both African  Americans and the community at large in Montgomery County.    I, myself, am lucky enough to have a member of the Delta Sigma Theta  Sorority in my office serving the people of Maryland's Sixth District.   Today, as a part of Women's History Month, we recognize the  Montgomery County Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority for  their 50 years of service and the positive impact they have had on the  Montgomery County community.         Recognizing Ed Hargis, Retiring Frederick City Police Chief     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work of  Frederick Police Chief Ed Hargis, who just recently retired after 4\1/ 2\ years of service as the top law enforcement officer in Frederick,  Maryland.   Chief Hargis arrived in Frederick in 2015 with over 33 years of law  enforcement experience from around the country. During his tenure as  police chief, he worked with city leaders and citizens to ensure  Frederick was a safe, welcoming community for everyone.   Chief Hargis showed tremendous leadership in Frederick, and we would  like to commend him for his 37 years of public service to our  communities.     Honoring Ruby Rubens, Education and Housing Advocate in Montgomery                      County Who Recently Passed Away     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Ruby  Rubens, a champion for human rights and education in Montgomery County,  who passed away at the end of February at the age of 86.   Ruby Rubens was a force in her community. She was a founding member  of the Montgomery County Coalition for Equitable Representation in  Government and worked extensively on housing rights with the Montgomery  County Housing Opportunities Commission, the U.S. Civil Service  Commission, and the Social Security Administration.   She was greatly involved in the education community as a longtime  volunteer in Montgomery County Public Schools. People were inspired to  follow in her footsteps, including her son, Joe Rubens, who is the  principal of John F. Kennedy High School.   For her work, she was a recipient of the Neal Potter Path of  Achievement Award and was inducted into the Montgomery County Human  Rights Hall of Fame.   Ruby was known throughout her community for being a constant advocate  for those without a voice. Today, I would like to honor her life and  contributions on the floor of the House of Representatives.                            ____________________
