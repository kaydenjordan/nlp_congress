 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the POPPY Study  Act, which will improve research and awareness of opioid use disorder  during pregnancy.   The opioid epidemic is a national crisis and has hit particularly  hard in Utah. Unfortunately, Utah's drug overdose rate is ranked among  the highest in the Nation. Six Utahns die every week from an opioid  overdose. Sadly, Utah also has the highest rate of opioid prescriptions  for pregnant mothers in the country, double the national average.   Women have been disproportionately affected by the opioid epidemic,  and little is understood about the effect this has had on pregnant  women. That is why I have introduced the POPPY Study Act, to improve  our understanding of prescription opioid use during pregnancy, the  effects that it can have on a mother and child, and how we can best  help those who are pregnant and suffering from opioid use disorder.   It is my hope that the POPPY Study Act will improve the care and  well-being of our expecting mothers and their children.                            ____________________
