 Mr. Speaker, I rise today after news that the Attorney  General, Jeff Sessions, lied under oath about his multiple contacts  with higher level officials from the Russian Government.   The American people deserve full answers from the FBI on the ever- growing list of Trump administration officials with reckless and  dangerous ties to Russia. The 2016 attack by Russia on U.S. democratic  institutions, election systems, and political parties represents an  international crime against liberty.   We still don't know the full extent of Russia's attacks. Thus, it is  essential that the FBI, which reports to the Attorney General, be  absolutely free of any political pressure. Congress must empower an  independent investigatory, bipartisan commission to discover the truth.  And the administration must appoint a special prosecutor free of  political influence by the executive branch.   Any investigation must be empowered to thoroughly probe Russia's  actions against our Nation's elections and must unearth any individuals  who aided and abetted Russia in furtherance of its nefarious  objectives. Without question, it is essential that our FBI and Justice  Department be absolutely free of any political influence by the  Attorney General.   The American people are owed the truth, the whole truth, and nothing  but the truth. Toward restoring integrity, the Attorney General should  resign in view of his misleading answers about Russia during his Senate  confirmation hearing.   Truth will out.                            ____________________
