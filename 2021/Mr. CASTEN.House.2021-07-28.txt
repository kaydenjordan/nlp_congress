 Madam Speaker, I rise to continue our celebration of Hot  FERC summer. As climate activist Fergie would certainly say: The FERC- alicious definition is to make our planet cooler.   So listen up, y'all, `cause this is it. The Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission, or better known as the F to the E to the R to the C, is one  of the most important Federal agencies to fight climate change. And if  I am doing this right, one that a few more of you are now keeping tabs  on.   Having a well air-conditioned home when it is ``hot-hot''? That is  FERCalicious.   Getting your electricity from the lowest cost reliable source?  FERCalicious.   An electric transmission system that keeps everything from electric  vehicles to steel mills running with zero carbon electricity?  FERCalicious.   With record-setting heat waves already causing deadly droughts,  wildfires, and overwhelmed power grids, we have run out the clock and  must transition to a clean energy economy--and we need FERC's help.   So, today, I am proud to introduce the Right to Timely Rehearings at  FERC Act with my friend, Mr. Malinowski, a bill to ensure everyone has  access to fair and timely hearings at the Commission.  [[Page H4094]]    But Congress can't do this alone. Moving at the pace demanded by the  climate crisis will take all hands on deck. And a fully staffed FERC is  going to be critical to that success.   Mr. Speaker, I will now go work on my fitness.                            ____________________
