 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the THRIVE Act.   In the Sixth District, my district, Fulton and Cobb Counties have the  highest opioid and heroin overdose rates of all counties in the entire  State of Georgia.    For those struggling with addiction who make that hard commitment to  recovery, aftercare and stability are critical to their ability to  remain drug-free. Too often they return to the very same environments  that helped foster their addiction, increasing the risk of relapse.  Worse, many find themselves homeless, with no resources and no job.   The THRIVE Act would create a 5-year pilot program that expands  housing options for individuals transitioning out of treatment programs  but still needing help. The program sets aside a small percentage of  Section 8 housing choice vouchers for supportive and transitional  housing nonprofits.   Earlier this year, former Kentucky Governor Ernie Fletcher attended  an opioid summit in my district. He shared with us the incredible  outcomes from the Recovery Kentucky initiative launched during his  administration. This legislation draws on the program and its success.   I commend Governor Fletcher and, in particular, my colleague from  Kentucky,  Andy Barr, for their leadership on this legislation. This  bill will give recovering addicts the added help they need to rise  above their addictions and fulfill their real potential in life.   I encourage my colleagues to support the THRIVE Act.
