 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California  for bringing this amendment to the floor.   The gentlewoman from Minnesota misses an important fact, and that is  that the current massive water diversions have done absolutely nothing  to improve salmon populations.   By taking those diversions to 40 percent unimpaired flow to the  ocean, in practical terms, this means that New Melones and Don Pedro  reservoirs in my district will be drained to their dead-pool levels  each fall.   It would destroy what's left of agriculture in California's Central  Valley, destroy the tourism these reservoirs attract in my region, and  create catastrophic water shortages in one of the most water-rich  regions of the Nation.   We don't build these reservoirs to dump water into the ocean. We  build them to store surplus water from wet years so that we have it in  dry ones.   This is insanity. It is the result of years of greens-gone-wild  radicalism in California. This amendment assures that the Federal  Government will not participate in such nonsense.
