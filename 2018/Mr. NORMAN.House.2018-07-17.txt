 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share that in 6 short  months, tax reform has transformed lives and businesses in South  Carolina.   I recently sent out two postcard surveys to over 50,000 of my  constituents asking them how tax reform has affected them. I have  received great feedback, with over 70 percent saying they saw increased  pay or benefits.   One example I received in the Fifth District is from the Mattox  family, a self-employed couple in Clover. They said that, due to their  tax cuts this year, they are going to finally be able to buy new  equipment for their business. The Mattox family also believes these tax  cuts should remain permanent for all middle class families because of  the benefits they personally see occurring in their community.   As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, South Carolinians are now  seeing opportunities and confidence coming back to their families and  small businesses.                            ____________________
