 Mr. President, Marcelle and I have been involved with a  wonderful charity for more than 20 years, with Marcelle on its board  for over a decade. Tracy's Kids helps children with cancer or blood  disorders cope with the emotional toll imposed by their disease and its  treatment. Tracy Councill, the heart and soul of that program and a  woman who has made a difference in the lives of tens of thousands of  patients, siblings, and parents, is retiring after 31 years.   The following announcement by Matt Gerson, founder and president of  Tracy's Kids, underscores the positive impact that she has made over  the course of her career: ``Big News--Tracy is retiring from Georgetown  after 31 years. Her service has been indispensable for the patients,  siblings, and parents she helped guide through their darkest times. Her  announcement is eliciting expressions of gratitude from the medical  professionals with whom she served, and throughout the Art Therapy  community she influenced.   ``I recognized a long time ago that Tracy was put on this earth to do  what she does. Because of the model that she developed at Georgetown,  Tracy's Kids has fundamentally changed the standard of care for  pediatric oncology in the region--and beyond. Her patience, compassion,  commitment, and professionalism--along with that accent--have been  invaluable to thousands of children and families.   ``Tracy is as heroic to her admirers as better-known GOATs. Our Giant  Of Art Therapy has trained and inspired generations of students who  aspire to be as impactful. Grateful parents know that they could not  have confronted the exhausting chapter of their lives without her. Part  of her legacy will be paid forward by former patients who are now Art  Therapists themselves--as well as the ones pursuing careers in art  disciplines from jewelry making to film.   ``She will still serve as the Tracy's Kids Program Director, and  continue to teach, lecture, and publish on how to help kids and  families develop strategies for coping with scary procedures,  communicate with doctors and nurses, and express the fears that might  lead to nightmares and social isolation.   ``I knew nothing of Art Therapy when we met 25 years ago. If  anything, I was a bit skeptical. But because of her, when you walk into  a clinic served by Tracy's Kids you will likely see children with  infusions in their arms, crayons in their hands and smiles on their  faces. She has created environments where kids can just be kids--not  `sick kids.' And because they feel so comfortable, patients and their  siblings actually look forward to going to the clinic--a sentiment we  hear over and over and find hard to believe each and every time.

Marcelle and I appreciate all she has done and also send Tracy and  Don our best wishes.                            ____________________     Mr. President, veterans make a valuable addition to any  workplace. Vermont companies know this, which is why most employers in  the State do their best to recruit former servicemembers. But some go  far beyond others in their commitment to employing veterans. Darn Tough  Vermont is one such company. Since the Darn Tough brand was created in  2004, consumer interest in the company's famous socks has steadily  grown. This is because of the dependability and durability their  products are known for. But the nearly 500 employees at Darn Tough, a  disproportionately high amount of which are veterans, are what ensures  this reputation.   Darn Tough has always been committed to hiring veterans whenever  possible. As a trusted supplier of the military, the company  understands why it is former servicemembers stand apart from others  when it comes to reliability, team orientation, and performing under  stress. They know that hiring a veteran is not only a good thing to do;  it is an excellent investment for an employer to make. This is why more  than 7 percent of employees hired by Darn Tough over the last calendar  year were veterans.   In November, the U.S. Department of Labor recognized Darn Tough for  its commitment to hiring veterans by awarding them a 2022 HIRE Vets  Medallion ``gold tier'' Award. The award is given to a company who can  show that 7 percent of the people it hired in a calendar year are  veterans. It can also be awarded to companies who retain more than 75  percent of their annual veteran hires for 12 months or more. Darn Tough  exceeded the Labor Department's award criteria in both of these areas.  Meeting these benchmarks is doubly impressive, considering veterans  make up only 4.7 percent of Vermont's civilian labor pool.   I am always heartened when I learn of a Vermont business who receives  honors for so clearly integrating Vermont's values into their  operations, which is why I would like to recognize Darn Tough Vermont  for leading the State in veteran's hiring and receiving the U.S.  Department of Labor's 2022 HIRE Vets Medallion Award. Their commitment  to producing the finest products and their demonstrated dedication to  veterans make this company one truly worthy of our praise.   I ask unanimous consent that an article from VT Digger on this  achievement be printed into the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              [From VT Digger]     Darn Tough Vermont, the Northfield Sock Manufacturer, Is Getting      Recognition for Its Commitment to Hiring and Retaining Military                                  Veterans         ``It's just good to be around more people that are       veterans,'' said Jim Decker, chief technology officer at Darn       Tough.        Decker, who has worked for the company since 2019, served       in the U.S. Army from 1985 to 1989. He joined Darn Tough in       2019, when the company employed about 185 people. The company       has experienced explosive growth in the last three years, and       it employs nearly 500 people now, he said.        Last month, Darn Tough was awarded a 2022 HIRE Vets       Medallion Award from the U.S. Labor Department. Darn Tough is       the only Vermont company to have earned the award in the four       years that it has been presented.        The awards are based on the percentage of workers hired and       retained who are military veterans. To earn the ``gold'' tier       award, the company had to show that 7% of the people it hired       in a calendar year were veterans.        ``And that's not an easy mark to make, because the overall       national percentage of veterans is 5.4%,'' said Randall       Smith, director of the Labor Department's HIRE Vets Medallion       program. In Vermont, veterans account for 4.7% of the       civilian labor force, Smith said.        One goal of the award, Smith said, is to let veterans know       about companies that do an especially good job of hiring and       retaining veterans. The program posts a map of awardees.        Lawrence Forsyth, veterans services coordinator at the       Vermont Department of Labor, estimated that Vermont has about       40,000 veterans, many of them older veterans of World War II,       the Korean War and the Vietnam War.        He said the small number of veterans in Vermont, compounded       by the fact that it does not have an active military post,       makes it hard for employers to hire veterans.        However, Forsyth said, veterans are ``adaptive. They're       resilient. They're very team-oriented and they perform under       stress. Why wouldn't someone want to hire them?''        Forsyth said he goes four times a year to a recruiting       event at Fort Drum in New York to persuade people leaving the       military, as well as veterans living there, to move to       Vermont. He said he works in partnership with the Vermont       State Police, the Vermont National Guard and the Vermont Air       National Guard to recruit people leaving active-duty military       service.        Forsyth encourages businesses interested in attracting       people leaving the armed services to visit the website for       Skilllsridge, a U.S. Department of Defense program that pays       for internships for up to 160 days, which ``could turn into a       full-time job,'' he said.        He said he has placed five veterans through that program in       the past two years.        One way Darn Tough retains the veterans it hires is by       identifying the skills they bring from their military       service, said Jennifer No, the company's talent acquisition       recruiter.        ``What we do internally is we continue to build on those       skills and develop them to positions like the (chief       technology officer),'' No said.        Businesses could also earn the ``gold'' award by retaining       75% of the veterans they hired in a calendar year for 12       months or more, Smith said. Forsyth said Darn Tough excels in       retention, in addition to recruitment.        ``They're always a go-to organization that I send people       to,'' he said.]                            ____________________
