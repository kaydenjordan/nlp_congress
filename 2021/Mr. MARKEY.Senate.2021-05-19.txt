 Reserving the right to object.    Madam President, I appreciate the points that my  colleague from Texas is making, but the bill he is proposing to pass by  unanimous consent has not been considered by the Commerce Committee,  and it would drastically and unilaterally tie the hands of the  Department of Transportation from protecting communities from having  massive amounts of dangerous, explosive liquefied natural gas shipped  right through their towns and cities. I understand that the Republicans  and natural gas companies want to railroad through the Senate a bill  that would undermine the safety of the railroads in our communities,  but we just can't allow this to happen.   In 2020, the Trump administration moved to allow trains of 100 or  more cars to begin transporting liquefied natural gas with no  additional safety regulations. It did this over the objections of the  attorneys general of 15 States and the District of Columbia.  Firefighters opposed it. Railroad unions that represented the railroad  employees objected to it. The environmental community objected to it as  did the National Transportation Safety Board.   Listen to this: A train of 110 tank cars, filled with liquefied  natural gas, would have more than five times the equivalent energy of  the Hiroshima atomic bomb.   We cannot put our firefighters, our railway workers, and our homes  and families at risk from loose regulations on what could be  catastrophically dangerous trains. Too many lives are at stake, and the  Department of Transportation should have the ability to review this  rule. This bill that is being propounded right now would blind our  safety watchdog when we should be putting these threats under a  microscope.   I object.
