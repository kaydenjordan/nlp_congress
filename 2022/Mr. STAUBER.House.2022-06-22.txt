 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and honor  Eli Ruth, a fifth-grade student at Bay View Elementary of the Proctor  School District who was named Minnesota's AAA School Safety Patroller  of the Year.   Recently, I have been focused on how the United States is an  exceptional country and how our people live out American exceptionalism  every day. When I see a student like Eli taking an opportunity to be a  leader among his peers and working to ensure their safety, I see a  young man who perfectly exemplifies American exceptionalism.   During his time as a safety patroller, Eli has come to know the  students and community very well, and I am so glad to see that he has  already become such an effective and caring leader at such a young age.   When I was his age, I was a school patrol officer myself at Piedmont  Elementary. It brings me great joy to see that, decades later, this  program is still encouraging and developing young leaders with a  passion to serve.   Congratulations, again, to Eli Ruth on this amazing honor. I wish him  nothing but success and happiness as he continues down his path of  leadership.                            ____________________
