 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman and the ranking  member for including two of my amendments in this bipartisan en bloc  package, and I would specifically like to highlight one of my  amendments that will provide $5 million for the Department of Defense  to utilize community-based, nonprofit, post-traumatic growth  organizations for mental health treatment.   Suicide prevention is a top priority for the DOD, yet suicides in our  military communities continue to rise. While current pharmaceutical and  psychotherapy approaches help alleviate some struggles, they fail to  address two key elements of resilience: social and spiritual fitness.   My amendment provides resources to enable the DOD to employ a variety  of pathways for our servicemembers and will allow the Department to  leverage the resilience expertise of post-traumatic growth  organizations that are seeing so much success. I am excited about this  potential.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate their support of this amendment, and I ask  everyone to support this package.
