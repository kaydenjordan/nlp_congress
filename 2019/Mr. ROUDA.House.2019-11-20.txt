 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of resolving the  outstanding issues needed to pass the United States-Mexico-Canada  Agreement, or USMCA, before the end of the year.   More than 12 million American jobs, including 1.8 million jobs in  California, depend on trade with Canada and Mexico. We simply cannot  afford to keep the current rules in place if we are to secure our  economic future and create better paying American jobs.                                time  1015    Addressing contentious issues in a trade deal are always difficult,  but I am optimistic that we can come to a productive resolution if the  administration continues to engage with House Democrats in good faith.  [[Page H9063]]    USMCA represents an opportunity to fix fundamental flaws in our trade  policy, reverse the failings of NAFTA, establish strong, enforceable  labor standards across North America, and promote growth in new sectors  of each of our economies. Let's get it right this time.   I thank Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Neal, and House Democratic  leadership for their commitment to working families and for ensuring  USMCA reflects our core values, and I ask for a vote on USMCA as soon  as possible.                            ____________________
