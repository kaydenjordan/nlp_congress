 Mr. President, 2 months ago, the President nominated Judge  Neil Gorsuch, a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, to the  Supreme Court. This week, we will be voting on his confirmation.   I want to say that I am grateful to my colleague, the senior Senator  from Iowa, for his leadership during this process and for getting this  nomination to the floor. We are fortunate to have him as chairman of  the Judiciary Committee.   We have before us a supremely qualified candidate for the Supreme  Court. Judge Gorsuch has a distinguished resume. He is widely regarded  as a brilliant and thoughtful jurist. Most importantly, however, he is  known for his impartiality and his absolute commitment to the rule of  law. Judge Gorsuch understands that the job of a judge is to apply the  law as it is written--and here is the fundamental thing--even when he  disagrees with it.   ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad  judge.'' Judge Gorsuch has said that more than once. Why? Because a  judge who likes every outcome he reaches is likely making decisions  based on something other than the law. That is a problem because there  is no such thing as equal protection or equal justice when judges make  decisions based on their personal feelings about a case instead of  based upon the law. A judge's job is to apply the law as it is written,  whether he likes the result or not. Judge Gorsuch understands this.   A lot of people from across the political spectrum have spoken up in  favor of Judge Gorsuch's nomination, and one thread that runs through  their comments is their confidence that they can trust Judge Gorsuch to  apply the law as it is written.   Here is what Neal Katyal, an Acting Solicitor General for President  Obama, had to say about Judge Gorsuch:         I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help       to restore confidence in the rule of law. His years on the       bench reveal a commitment to judicial independence--a record       that should give the American people confidence that he will       not compromise principle to favor the president who appointed       him.    A former law partner and a friend of Judge Gorsuch's--a friend who  describes himself as ``a longtime supporter of Democratic candidates  and progressive causes''--had this to say about Judge Gorsuch:         Gorsuch's approach to resolving legal problems as a lawyer       and a judge embodies a reverence for our country's values and       legal system. . . . I have no doubt that I will disagree with       some decisions that Gorsuch might render as a Supreme Court       justice. Yet, my hope is to have justices on the bench such       as Gorsuch . . . who approach cases with fairness and       intellectual rigor and who care about precedent and the       limits of their roles as judges.''    Again, that is from a self-described ``longtime supporter of  Democratic candidates and progressive causes.''   During his years on the bench, Judge Gorsuch has had a number of law  clerks. On February 14, every one of Judge Gorsuch's former clerks,  except for two who are currently clerking at the Supreme Court, sent a  letter on his nomination to the chairman and ranking member of the  Senate Judiciary Committee. Here is what they had to say:         Our political views span the spectrum . . . but we are       united in our view that Judge Gorsuch is an extraordinary       judge. . . . Throughout his career, Judge Gorsuch has devoted       himself to the rule of law. . . . As law clerks who have       worked at his side, we know that Judge Gorsuch never resolves       a case by the light of his personal view of what the law       should be. Nor does he ever bend the law to reach a       particular result that he desires.        For Judge Gorsuch, a judge's task is not to usurp the       legislature's role; it is to find and apply the law as       written. That conviction, rooted in his respect for the       separation of powers, makes him an exemplary candidate to       serve on the nation's highest court.    Again, that is the unanimous opinion of 39 of Judge Gorsuch's former  law clerks whose political views, in their own words, ``span the  spectrum.''   E. Donald Elliott, an adjunct professor at Yale Law School, had this  to say about Judge Gorsuch:         Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy isn't mine . . . but       among judicial conservatives, Judge Gorsuch is as good as it       possibly gets. . . . Judge Gorsuch tries very hard to get the       law right. He is not an ideologue, not the kind to always       rule in favor of businesses or against the government.       Instead, he follows the law as best he can wherever it might       lead.    I could go on. The voices raised in support of Judge Gorsuch are  numerous.   Unfortunately, no amount of testimony in favor of Judge Gorsuch seems  to be enough for Democrats. Senate Democrats are apparently determined  to oppose Judge Gorsuch despite the fact that they are struggling to  find any good reason to justify their opposition.   The Senate minority leader came down to the floor on March 23 to  announce his determination to vote against Judge Gorsuch, and he urged  his colleagues to do the same. Why? Well, apparently the Senate  minority leader is not convinced that Judge Gorsuch ``would be a  mainstream justice who could rule free from the biases of politics and  ideology.'' That is right. Despite the fact that everyone--liberal and  conservative--seems to describe fairness as one of Judge Gorsuch's  distinguishing characteristics, the Senate minority leader is not  convinced the judge will be able to rule without bias. He is worried  that Judge Gorsuch won't be a mainstream judge.   Well, over the course of 2,700 cases on the Tenth Circuit, Judge  Gorsuch has been in the majority 99 percent of the time--99 percent. In  97 percent of those 2,700 cases, those opinions were unanimous. I would  like the minority leader to explain how exactly a judge who is in the  majority 99 percent of the time is out of the judicial mainstream. Is  the minority leader trying to suggest that all of the judges on the  Tenth Circuit, including the ones appointed by Democrats--which, I  might add, is a majority on the circuit--are extremists?   The fact is, Democrat opposition to Judge Gorsuch has nothing to do  with his qualifications. Let's just get it out there. I doubt that any  of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle really think that Judge  Gorsuch is out of the mainstream or that he lacks the qualifications of  a Supreme Court Justice. No, the truth is that Democrats are opposing  Judge Gorsuch because they are mad that it is not a Democratic  President making the nomination. They can't accept that they lost the  election, so they are going to oppose any nominee, no matter how  qualified.   It is extremely disappointing that Democrats plan to upend a nearly  230-year tradition of approving Supreme Court nominees by a simple  majority vote simply because they can't accept the results of an  election.   Democrats have no plausible reason to offer for opposing this  supremely qualified nominee. I hope that a sufficient number of Senate  Democrats will think better of their opposition and vote--when we have  that opportunity later this week--to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the  Supreme Court.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.  [[Page S2201]]         Mr. President, today we are one step closer to a vote to  confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. I look forward to the vote  tomorrow. We will be confirming a Justice to the Supreme Court who is  supremely qualified, who is a mainstream judge, who respects the rule  of law and the Constitution, and who will rule impartially from the  bench--someone who will call balls and strikes. That is what I believe  the American people look for when they look for a Supreme Court  Justice.   While it was always clear that some Democrats would oppose any  Supreme Court candidate the President nominated, I had hoped that  partisanship would be at least somewhat limited. I had hoped the  Democrats would want to preserve the Senate's nearly 230-year tradition  in confirming Supreme Court Justices by a simple-majority vote. And I  had hoped that more than a handful of Democrats would join us to  confirm one of the most, as I said, supremely qualified judges in my  memory. That is not what happened. Despite Judge Gorsuch's  qualifications, despite the support for his nomination from both  liberals and conservatives, the vast majority of Senate Democrats were  determined to block this confirmation.    Of course, it wasn't really ever about Judge Gorsuch. It is not that  Democrats were determined to block his confirmation; it is that they  were determined to block any confirmation.   Democrats tried to offer reasons to oppose Judge Gorsuch, but they  struggled to come up with anything plausible. The Senate minority  leader actually came to the floor and tried to argue that he was  worried that Judge Gorsuch would not be ``a mainstream justice.''   Over the course of 2,700 cases on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch  has been in the majority 99 percent of the time--99 percent. In 97  percent of those 2,700 cases, the opinions were unanimous. So I would  love to hear an explanation for how exactly a judge who has been in the  majority 99 percent of the time is out of the judicial mainstream. Was  the minority leader attempting to argue that all of the judges on the  Tenth Circuit, including those appointed by Democratic Presidents, are  out of the mainstream?   The fact is that Democratic opposition to Judge Gorsuch had nothing  to do with his qualifications. I doubt that any of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle really think that Judge Gorsuch is out of the  mainstream or that he lacks the qualifications of a Supreme Court  Justice, but they opposed him anyway.   If they opposed a judge with a distinguished resume and a reputation  as a brilliant jurist; if they opposed a judge who is known for his  fairness and impartiality; if they opposed a judge whose nomination has  been repeatedly supported by liberals, as well as conservatives; if  they opposed a judge who unanimously received the highest possible  rating from the American Bar Association--a rating, I might add, that  the minority leader once called the ``gold standard'' for judicial  nominees; if they opposed a judge a number of them supported 10 years  ago, then it is abundantly clear that their opposition wasn't about  this judge but about any judge this President nominates. Thus,  Republicans were left with no real alternative but to act to preserve  the Senate's tradition of giving Supreme Court nominees an up-or-down  vote. This wasn't my preference. I preferred to leave room for a  minority to block a judge who is truly not fit for office. But it was  the only alternative we were left with if we wanted to confirm anyone  to the Supreme Court.   Historically, confirming judges was not a partisan process. During  the George W. Bush administration, however, Democrats decided they were  going to change that. They were mad back then too--mad that a  Republican President was in charge. Apparently, modern-day Democrats  are not reconciled to the fact that in our system of government, it is  not always the Democrats who win.   Anyway, the Democrats were mad, and they decided that the  historically bipartisan process of confirming judicial nominees was  going to change. Their 2003 filibuster of Miguel Estrada, who had been  nominated to a seat on the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, was the  first time a judicial nominee who enjoyed clear majority support was  not confirmed because of a filibuster.   Democrats ultimately successfully filibustered no fewer than 10 Bush  nominees to appellate courts. That was a massive reversal in Senate  history. Suddenly the normally smooth process of confirming a  President's judicial nominee had been turned into an exercise in  partisanship.   Ten years later, Democrats struck again when they employed the  nuclear option to ensure that they could pack the DC Circuit--despite  the fact that at the time, when the current minority leader announced  that Democrats would ``fill up the D.C. Circuit one way or the other,''  Republicans had blocked just two of President Obama's circuit nominees  and had confirmed 99 percent of his judges. So 215 were confirmed out  of 217 under President Obama up to that point.   And now here we are today. Democrats are again mad that they lost an  election, that they can't control the nomination process, and they once  again turned to ``no-holds-barred'' partisanship. They made it clear  that no Republican nominee would ever make it to the Supreme Court;  thus, we had to act to ensure that Supreme Court nominees can receive  an up-or-down vote going forward.   In the Senate's nearly 230 years, the filibuster has been used to  block a Supreme Court nominee exactly once--one time. Supreme Court  Justice Abe Fortas's nomination to be Chief Justice of the Supreme  Court was blocked by a bipartisan coalition, in part over ethical  concerns. That is how strong the Senate's bipartisan tradition of an  up-or-down vote on Supreme Court nominees has been--230 years, one  time, and it was bipartisan. I am deeply sorry that the Democrats were  determined to end that tradition.   Judge Gorsuch should never have faced the threat of a filibuster.  There was no reason--no reason other than the most flagrant partisan  politics--to block this supremely qualified nominee from the Supreme  Court.   As I said, I look forward to tomorrow and to this final vote where we  will have an opportunity to confirm to the Supreme Court this well- qualified, mainstream nominee who fundamentally respects the rule of  law and the Constitution of the United States and will act impartially  as a Justice for the American people.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
