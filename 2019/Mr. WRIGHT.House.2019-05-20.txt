 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Digital GAP Act of  2019, which I was proud to introduce with Ranking Member McCaul and  Representatives Lieu and Bera.   In our increasingly connected world, internet access is a tremendous  driver of economic growth. But 60 percent of the world's population  remains offline and out of reach of U.S. businesses, organizations, and  educators--largely due to a lack of telecommunications infrastructure.   The Digital GAP Act will promote commonsense ``build once'' policies  to help ensure that companies have opportunities to incorporate  telecommunications into new infrastructure construction projects.   This will provide opportunities to the private sector and reduce the  cost of bringing new communities online.   The bill also presses for the removal of onerous tax and regulatory  barriers to Internet access, and calls on the State Department, USAID,  and other government agencies, to partner with businesses to increase  private investment in internet infrastructure in developing countries.   As we compete overseas with an increasingly aggressive China, we must  make America's assistance and development strategies more effective.   Bills like the Digital GAP Act and the Championing American Business  through Diplomacy Act, which passed 2 weeks ago, will do just that by  strengthening the United States partnership with the private sector.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Intercountry Adoption  Information Act authored by my friend from Georgia (Mr. Collins).   The world today is full of orphaned children, but it is also full of  loving families who are ready and eager to adopt them. All too often,  American families encounter policy obstacles that delay and prevent  those adoptions. Some countries have halted adoption processing,  suspended foreign adoptions, or banned adoption altogether.   This information doesn't always make it across the world to waiting  American families. Many times, they are already midway through the  difficult adoption process when these policy changes occur.   Without full information, they cannot understand the impact on their  own cases. This leaves adoptive parents in wrenching situations,  separated from their child and unsure how to proceed.   This bill ensures that American families are not left in the dark by  requiring the State Department to publicly report on legal and policy  changes other countries make that may impact the adoption process. It  also requires the State Department to explain its efforts to resume  stalled adoption proceedings so that American parents know what their  country is doing to successfully bring their children to their new  home.   As a father of three, I can say that there is no greater feeling than  being a dad. I know other parents in this Chamber feel the same way.  This bill is an opportunity for both parties to come together to do  something positive for American families.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Collins), the lead Republican on the Judiciary Committee  and the author of this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I again thank Representative Collins for this bill.  American parents ought to know how foreign policy decisions impact  their lives. They also deserve to know what our government is doing to  help unite them with their children.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Global Electoral  Exchange Act authored by my friend and fellow Texan, Mr. Castro.   Authoritarian regimes are a threat to personal liberty, international  security, and economic progress all around the world. Countries like  China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and Venezuela present major  roadblocks to global peace and prosperity, but there is nothing that  dictators fear more than free markets and free people. This is why  tyrants use repressive tactics to stifle dissent and crack down on  public protests.   The world is a safer, more prosperous place when individuals are  governed as citizens, not subjects. This is why promoting democracy  abroad has always been a bipartisan cause.   The United States must maintain its leadership in keeping the flame  of freedom burning. This legislation gives us another opportunity to be  that leader.   The Global Electoral Exchange Act would facilitate the international  exchange of election monitors, poll workers, and civil society leaders  who participate in the administration of elections. By promoting best  practices and empowering foreign societies to conduct elections that  truly recognize the will of the people, these exchanges will strengthen  democratic institutions in other countries.   Let's pass this bill and demonstrate that America remains a beacon of  hope and freedom to the world by empowering free and fair elections.   Madam Speaker, I do want to thank my colleague from Texas (Mr.  Castro) and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows) for their  hard work on this bill. Friends of democracy have an interest in free  and fair elections that are credible and protected from manipulation.  This bill promotes that and deserves our unanimous support.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution to denounce  female genital mutilation as a violation of the human rights of women  and girls.   I want to thank my committee colleagues, Congresswoman Lois Frankel  and Congressman Scott Perry, for introducing the resolution and for  their sustained engagement on the issue.   An estimated 200 million women and girls have been victims of FGM,  which has dangerous and lasting health implications. The United States  and many other countries and international organizations have called  for an end to this highly invasive practice.   Every year, the Department of State reports on the prevalence of FGM  as part of the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, and this is  an important tool for raising awareness of where this abuse persists.   This resolution urges the Department of State and USAID to go further  and to incorporate anti-FGM efforts into their existing programming  around the world. U.S. leadership is important to putting an end to  this human rights violation.   Speaking as the father of a daughter and a grandfather of five  granddaughters, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    In closing, I again want to thank Representative Frankel  and Representative Perry for their persistence in this fight.   Every case of female genital mutilation is one too many. This  resolution calls on the nations of the world to do more to stop this  awful violation of the dignity and safety of women and girls. It  deserves our unanimous support.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 2480. I  thank all of those who had any part in drafting this important  legislation.   The Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act takes an  important step in improving the lives of children in every State.   This bill authorizes important programs that will provide essential  support for child protective service systems and communities fighting  against child abuse and neglect.   This legislation before us comes at a time when State child  protective services around the country are seeing resources  increasingly strained due to the opioid crisis. H.R. 2480 provides the  resources and reforms needed for States to combat this crisis and  ensure that abused or neglected children are getting the help they  deserve.   Under this bill, States and local providers can focus on serving  children and families by streamlining duplicative and burdensome  paperwork requirements. It also ensures community and parent  involvement in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of  prevention services.   I am pleased that the bill before us today includes an amendment that  I introduced with my colleague from Maryland (Mr. Trone). The amendment  ensures those working in the child welfare system are of the highest  professional quality.   As has been said before, this work is critical. We want to ensure  these people are ready to tackle this challenging work, and States need  to know how to recruit the right people for the job.   The child welfare system contains some of the most vulnerable  citizens in our society, which makes it so important that those working  in the field get the education and professional development that is  needed.   H.R. 2480 will allow State and local providers to better serve the  almost 700,000 children who are victims of abuse and neglect every  year.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                                time  1715
