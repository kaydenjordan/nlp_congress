 You are young.    Will the Senator yield?    I am one who signed that letter.   First, let's talk about the letter itself. What it says is, ``We are  united in our determination to preserve the ability of Members to  engage in extended debate when bills are on the Senate floor.'' I agree  with that. The proposal that is going to be put on the floor today is  one that will allow extended debate.   There are two points that have caused me to modify the position that  I took on this letter. One is the nature of the issue that is before  the body. If we were here talking about immigration or gun control or  any of the other many issues that we consider, I wouldn't be taking the  position that I am.   I believe that the rules of the Senate are important and that  extended debate is an important part of the Senate process. However, we  are talking about fundamental structural changes--not policy changes  but structural changes--that I believe, in spite of your comments, that  in many States across the country are compromising the ability of our  people to express themselves in our democracy.   I consider that qualitatively different than a policy difference, and  that is why I am here today to talk about revising the rules--not  blowing up the filibuster but to get back to what the filibuster  actually means, and that is extended debate.   I am all for extended debate until we are exhausted, until we have  made a deal, until we have come to a compromise. But the problem is,  the filibuster, as we define it today, is a distant cousin of the real  filibuster.   The radical change in the filibuster isn't what is being discussed  today. It was made in 1975 almost by accident. In 1975, they were  debating whether it should be two-thirds of Senators present and voting  or a lower number. And they compromised on 60 Senators, sworn Members.  That was the focus of that discussion.   I have talked to Parliamentarians who were involved in that question.  I asked the specific question: Did they really realize what they were  doing by creating the mail-in, dial-in, no-effort filibuster? And the  answer was no. They didn't discuss it. They didn't think of it.   So what I am talking about here today and what the proposal that will  be on the floor later today is to do exactly what this letter says,  ``extended debate''--``extended debate.'' And that is why I believe  that what we are proposing today is in the deepest tradition of the  U.S. Senate. What we are trying to scale back is the cheap, easy, dial- in from your office, 60 votes, de facto, supermajority requirement,  which is not in the Constitution, which the Framers expressly did not  agree to.   They put in a lot of checks and balances. Two Houses of Congress,  two-thirds voting on treaties, two-thirds voting on an amendment,  confirmation of the President--the President, the Congress, the  independence of the courts, all those were checks and balances. One of  them was not a supermajority requirement in the U.S. Senate.   Hamilton and Madison expressly said that that would turn democracy on  its head. Democracy ultimately is about majority rule, and there should  be minority rights. The minority should have every opportunity to  speak, to offer amendments, to discuss--to offer germane amendments, I  might add--and discuss and debate but ultimately not have a veto.   That is really what it comes down to here: Do you have a rule that  says that the minority actually is in control of the legislative  process? That is not what the Framers intended. It is antithetical to  what the Framers intended.   In fact, one of the reasons for the Constitutional Convention was the  dysfunction of the Articles of Confederation, and one of the reasons  cited for that dysfunction was a supermajority requirement.   So, yes, I voted--what I supported 3 years ago, I still support. The  language is ``full, robust, and extended debate,'' and that is what is  going to be proposed later on.    If you guys will vote for it, this debate can go on, as it should,  for weeks and perhaps months because it is that important. But I don't  have any apologies to make. If I have to choose between a Senate rule,  as it works now--which, as I say, is a distant cousin of the real  filibuster--and democracy itself, I am going to take democracy every  single time.    Mr. President, I came here 9 years ago opposed to modifying  the rules of the filibuster. Indeed, I signed a letter a couple of  years ago saying the same thing. I understand that it can and probably  will boomerang, that an elimination of the filibuster--what is today's  annoying obstruction could be tomorrow's priceless shield. I get that.   I understand that it can also be a spur to bipartisanship. We all saw  that several years ago in the CARES Act. The Republican leader  submitted a bill. It was voted down on a filibuster initially, and then  there ensued a series of negotiations that improved the bill and made  it a bipartisan bill that passed this body unanimously.   The problem is, if it is being used as a spur to bipartisan  discussions, that works. We saw it work with the CARES Act. But if it  is used simply to stop something, in other words, if one side or the  other just doesn't even want to talk about the subject, what you are  talking about is stone cold obstruction, and that is where we are  today.   Unfortunately, part of this body just doesn't want to talk about the  issue of voting rights. How do I know that? Because we brought up a  motion to proceed three times, and it was voted down three times--a  motion to proceed to have a discussion about this issue. The only  reason we are having this debate today is that the majority leader  found a rule that, frankly, I never heard of that enabled us to bring  this to the floor. It wasn't because the other side said: Oh, let's  discuss voting rights.   What we have now is not a filibuster. It is a second cousin once  removed of a filibuster. It doesn't require any effort. It doesn't  require any speeches. It doesn't require to hold the floor. All it is  is a dial-in, no-work filibuster. Strom Thurmond would have loved this  filibuster. He wouldn't have had to stand here for 24 hours. And I  venture to say that if we had the rules that we have today, we wouldn't  have the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act, because it was too  easy to stop anything.   That is the problem. We don't really have a filibuster. The real  radical change in the filibuster rule was in 1975, when they wanted to  go from two-thirds of those present voting to 60 votes, but,  inadvertently, we created the no-effort filibuster, and that is what we  have now.   I would submit that a talking filibuster, which is what we are going  to be proposing in a few minutes, would be the real spur to  bipartisanship because everybody would want to get it over with. The  minority would want to get it over with, and the majority would want to  get it over with, and get to a point where there would be discussion.  And I believe, listening to the debate today, based upon the discussion  today, that I think there may be some areas where we can find  agreement.   The real spur to bipartisanship would be to return to the old  filibuster. This is what we are going to be voting on today.   And, by the way, on bipartisanship, I came here to seek  bipartisanship. I am all about bipartisanship. But it strikes me as one  of the deep ironies of this discussion that we are elevating  bipartisanship in this body to this exalted position while these laws  are being passed entirely on a partisan basis in all these States  across the country. I guess bipartisanship is an important principle in  Washington, but in Atlanta and Austin, not so much. I don't get that. I  think that is one of the real ironies of this situation.   So, Angus, if you came here opposed 9 years ago, why are you changing  now? Because what we are talking about today isn't policy; it is  structure. It is our democracy itself.   Policy can change. If they don't like the policy we pass, they can  kick us out and vote other people in. If we change the structure that  diminishes the right of people to vote, it is not self- correcting anymore. The system itself is being compromised. That is  what we have to talk about.    And we are not only talking. All of the discussion or most of the  discussion today has been about voter suppression. There is also what I  call voter subversion--purging the officials in charge of elections.   This democracy, I would argue, was damn near saved by a guy named  Brad Raffensperger in Georgia. They purged him--or they are going to.  They have already purged him out of the system, and they are going to  try to purge him out of his job. That is happening. And we talk about  giving people in the legislature--a partisan legislature--the ability  to dismiss voting boards because they don't like what they did? We are  going to see more and more voting boards, voting commissioners,  certification officials being purged because they don't want to get the  results that they don't agree with.   The other problem here that really worries me about our democracy is  that the former President's efforts to undermine confidence in our  elections have already convinced two-thirds of one of our great  political parties that the elections were illegitimate and were rigged.  Two-thirds of one of our great political parties now believes that.   If these laws that are happening across the country--and they are  going to continue happening. By the way, if we give them a pass today,  it is Katy, bar the door, over the next 6 months. Then you are going to  disillusion and anger and loss of trust among two-thirds of the  Democratic Party and Independents, and you are going to have widespread  distrust of elections as the way we solve our problems in this country.  And if you can't trust elections, what do you do?   I would submit that we saw it on January 6. Those people had been  told that something was stolen from them, and they couldn't trust  elections. They couldn't trust the courts. They couldn't trust the  media. So they took the law into their own hands. And, sadly, if this  continues, we will have a broad widespread loss of trust in our  electoral process, and that is when democracy starts to fall apart.   Finally--my wife says I say ``finally'' too much and it gets people's  hopes up.   Finally, there are some deeper constitutional issues here. The  Framers knew fractions. They said it takes two-thirds to pass a treaty.  It takes two-thirds to impeach a President. It takes two-thirds to pass  a constitutional amendment. It takes three-quarters of the States to  pass a constitutional amendment. They knew fractions. They didn't apply  any fractions when they talked about the passage of legislation. Why  not? Because they knew it would be a disaster to have a supermajority  requirement in one of the Houses of the national legislature.   How do I know that? Because Madison and Hamilton said it explicitly  in Federalist 22 by Hamilton, Federalist 58 by Madison. Madison said:         The fundamental principle of free government [if you have a       supermajority requirement] would be reversed. It would be no       longer the majority that would rule: the power would be       transferred to the minority.    You can't have it both ways. It is either majority rule or its  minority rule, and the filibuster was not part of the Constitution. In  fact, they expressly and explicitly rejected that idea of a  supermajority requirement. It flips democracy on its head.   I think we are at a hinge of history, Mr. President. I think we are  at a hinge of history where our fragile experiment--and Senator Murphy  is right, we are an anomaly in world history. The norm is pharaohs and  Kings and dictators, and now we call them Presidents for life.   And once people seize power, look at what--and this isn't an academic  discussion. This has happened in Hungary, in Turkey, and Venezuela--in  Russia. It has happened right in our personal experiences. It can  happen here, and it starts with undermining free and fair elections.   In the winter of 1891, the House passed a protection act for Black  voters in the South. The bill was to deal with the egregious voter  suppression that was then sweeping the South in the wake of the Civil  War. The bill came here and died due to a filibuster. That filibuster  echoed in this country for 75 years. It took 75 years to correct the  mistake that this body made with that filibuster in the winter of 1891.    We are not talking about abolishing the filibuster. We are not  talking about a carve-out. We are talking about allowing this body-- requiring this body--to debate, to argue, to make their arguments as  long as it takes, and then, at the end, when the debate is exhausted,  when all of us have had the opportunity to speak twice, then we have a  vote, and we pass legislation on the same basis that it has always been  [[Page S342]]  passed--by a majority. Cloture has nothing to do with the passage of  legislation. It has always been by a majority.   I pray that we don't look back on this day and realize the level of  the mistake that they made in 1891.   Abraham Lincoln's words ring today as they did when he came to this  body in December of 1862.   He said:         Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this       Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite       of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance,       can spare one another of us. The fiery trial through which we       pass, will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest       generation.    ``The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down, in honor  or dishonor, to the latest generation.''   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.
