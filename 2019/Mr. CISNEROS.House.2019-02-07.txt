 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment, No. 7, at the desk made  in order by the rule.    Mr. Chairman, I sincerely thank my colleague, Ms.  Brownley, for her steadfast leadership on this critical issue, and Mr.  Takano for working with me to ensure consideration. Finally, I would  like to thank the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch) for cosponsoring  this amendment.   I rise to offer an amendment, which would require the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs to study how the VA could provide childcare assistance  for veterans who receive covered healthcare services furnished by the  VA at non-Department facilities.   I am a strong supporter and cosponsor of H.R. 840 because I am  committed to advancing policies that make it easier for all veterans to  take advantage of their VA benefits they deserve.   As a veteran with two young twin boys, I know firsthand that  rambunctious young kids can often derail the best of plans. Providing  safe, affordable, and convenient childcare for veterans who are parents  and grandparents eliminates just one of those many barriers to quality  care our veterans can face when trying to make health and mental health  appointments. I rise to offer this amendment to ensure that my  constituents are not left behind in this noble effort.   Orange County, California, is home to the largest veteran population  in the country, approximately 130,000 veterans, without its own VA  hospital. This leaves many of my constituents without easy access to  high-quality care our VA system provides.   My amendment would direct the VA to conduct a feasibility study to  determine how the Department of Veterans Affairs could provide  childcare assistance for veterans who receive healthcare services far  from a VA medical center campus. This includes my constituents seeking  care at the Anaheim community-based orthopedic clinic.   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment to  ensure we do not overlook veterans who could benefit from childcare  services.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano).    Mr. Chairman, I just want to reiterate that this is a  simple amendment to require a study by the VA within 1 year.   I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment, No. 8, at the desk  made in order by the rule.    Mr. Chairman, I want to quickly thank my colleague and  chair of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Mr. Takano, for  urging, in his testimony before the House Committee on Rules, that this  amendment be made in order.   I rise to offer an amendment which would include ``intensive  healthcare services related to physical therapy for a service-connected  disability'' in the definition of ``covered healthcare service.''   Physical therapy is an important aspect of any human process and is  often necessary for veterans suffering from sustained pain or  discomfort from a service-connected disability. This experience can  often involve lengthy commitments and long commutes to achieve results.   For my constituents, accessing physical therapy services at VA health  clinics, receiving regular physical therapy means making a regular  commitment to be stuck in traffic on the 405 to drive to the Long Beach  VA hospital.   My amendment will ensure that veterans in need of physical therapy  for a service-connected disability are specifically afforded access to  childcare services.   VA benefits are not truly benefits if the costs associated with  childcare during regular appointments place too large a burden on  veteran caretakers.   Veterans and their families face many obstacles when transitioning  back to civilian life, but access to healthcare should not be one of  them. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano).    Mr. Chairman, I just want to reiterate that this is a  simple, commonsense amendment. I urge my colleagues to adopt this  amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, a couple days ago, the President gave a  State of the Union Address that did nothing to promote unity but,  rather, used fear to further a divisive agenda against immigrants by  repeating lies about his manufactured emergency at our southern border.   However, there was no mention of the real crisis. The real crisis  stems from the President's inhumane separation policies.   Mr. Speaker, 8 months since his cruel zero-tolerance policy first  came to light, the number of children who were ripped away from  families at the border continues to rise. At first, the administration  said nearly 3,000 children were separated from their parents. Now, we  are learning that it has been thousands more.   The administration also claims that they can't easily find the  parents of the children they ripped away, and they don't even think it  is worth the time to locate them. This inhumane policy and how they  treat these children goes against everything this country stands for.   The President and this administration need to do everything that they  can to ensure the reunification of these families. The prolonged  separation of these children has caused irreparable damage to their  mental health and well-being.   That, Mr. President, is the real crisis that you have created at the  southern border.                            ____________________
