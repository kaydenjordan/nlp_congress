 Madam President, I join with Vermonters across  our State to give a huge congratulations to Megan Nick for her  incredible achievement in winning a bronze medal at the Winter Olympics  in Beijing in women's aerials. Megan is an inspiration to so many  Vermonters, and we are tremendously proud of her. Megan credits her  parents, Jeff and Colleen Nick, for instilling in her the value of hard  work, which certainly showed all throughout the 2022 Olympic Games.   Growing up in Shelburne, Megan was a competitive gymnast and spent  more than 10 years training at the Green Mountain Training Center in  Williston. The similarities between the two sports, along with her  drive for perfection, drew Megan to skiing. Then ahead of her senior  year at Champlain Valley Union High School, Megan was challenged to try  aerial skiing and found a new passion. In talking about the transition  to becoming an aerial skier, Megan gives credit to her gymnastics  coach, Stefan Hruska, for teaching her the spatial awareness required  to be successful in the sport.   While she learned key skills in the gym, it was at Cochran's Ski  Area--a small, family-operated, nonprofit ski area in Richmond, VT, and  home to another Beijing Olympian--that Megan learned to ski. That is  what our small State is all about: communities coming together to help  young people achieve their goals in a supportive, encouraging  environment.   Like many Vermonters, Megan grew up loving the outdoors. As she said  herself in a recent interview following her Olympic medal, her Vermont  upbringing taught her ``the importance of sustainability and the role  that we can play in helping our environment while also being able to  play in it,'' something that she finds particularly important as an  aerial skier.   This was Megan's first Olympic Games, and she took bronze in her  first event. Megan showed everyone that with courage and hard work  there is nothing you can't accomplish. I heartily applaud Megan for the  positive impact she has had not only on Vermonters, but on young people  all over the country who have a dream. Megan is an inspiration to us  all and is a true testament of hard work leading to success.   Megan's level of commitment and accomplishments deserve all of our  sincere admiration. Vermont is remarkably proud of Megan, and we know  she is going to continue to be among our brightest hopes for a better  tomorrow--both on and off the slopes.                            ____________________
