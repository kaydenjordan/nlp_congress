 Mr. President, the unemployment crisis we are facing due to  the pandemic has devastated the lives of tens of millions of  Americans--many of whom may not see their jobs come back for the  foreseeable future. The expanded unemployment insurance we passed in  the CARES Act--especially the coverage for gig workers and the self- employed and the $600 weekly boost--have enabled workers to keep a roof  over their heads, feed their children, and pay for health insurance.   If these benefits expire or are drastically reduced, it could cause  an eviction and hunger crisis. It could also tank consumer spending  while increasing business closings that will lead to even more  unemployment. Additionally, it could further exacerbate this public  health and economic crisis by forcing more Americans into desperate  situations, instead of ensuring that people can return to the workforce  when it is safe.   And yet knowing this, the Republican have proposed to slash weekly  benefits to $200 a week for the next two months, after which benefits  would be limited to no more than 70% of previous wages. This plan,  which would cut the average worker's unemployment benefits by roughly  43%, would take states months to get up and running. This would further  delay benefits at a time when some workers are still waiting for  assistance.   Instead of this half-baked, inefficient, and disingenuous proposal,  we must work together on a bipartisan basis to enact targeted,  effective, and smart measures that will offer families, businesses, and  the economy the needed stability to get us through this crisis. That is  why I am introducing the Worker Relief and Security Act, along with  Senator Bennet and Congressman Beyer. Our legislation, which reflects  input from top economists, would take politics out of the equation,  basing continued enhanced unemployment insurance benefits on  ``automatic stabilizers'' that are tied to the public health emergency  and economic conditions. Specifically, this legislation would  automatically extend the $600 weekly boost and additional benefit  weeks, on top of regular state unemployment, through the duration of  the public health crisis. Once we begin to enter the recovery phase,  this legislation would continue providing supplemental weekly  compensation and additional benefit weeks until national and state  total unemployment rates get closer to pre-crisis levels.   Time is of the essence, so I urge our colleagues to join us in  pressing for immediate action on this legislation. We must extend and  enhance unemployment insurance benefits, tying them to economic and  health conditions--as  [[Page S4596]]  well as expand work sharing as I have discussed previously--to help  keep families, businesses, and states solvent through this crisis.   Mr. President, I yield back.                            ____________________
