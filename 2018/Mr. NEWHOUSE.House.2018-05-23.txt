 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman for this  opportunity to discuss a matter of great interest and importance to the  Tri-Cities community in my district.   In the 1940s and 1950s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers acquired  land along the shoreline of the Columbia River in Tri-Cities,  Washington. The land, 34 miles of the McNary shoreline, is currently  underutilized. The local communities continue to be saddled with  hundreds of thousands of dollars of M&O costs annually for upkeep of  land of these shoreline properties that they don't even own.   I support the community proposal to convey the land back to the  cities. I have been working with the chairman on proposed amendment  language to do so but respect the fact the chairman has let me know  there is still some work to be done.   I continue to encourage further community engagement and believe  public meetings are necessary to ensure all voices are heard, including  that of the local Tribes.   It is also a requirement that the city governments fully understand  the responsibilities and potential costs that could arise from having  this land conveyed.   There must be further coordination between conveyance proponents,  community stakeholders, city governments, and the Army Corps.   Mr. Chairman, you have raised concerns about the language in its  current form and have urged further efforts. I am committed to  continuing to work with the local communities to address these  concerns.   Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I respectfully ask: Will you commit to  continuing to work with me as the NDAA process moves forward to try to  address concerns with the proposal while the communities continue to  assess their needs?    I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the chairman for  that colloquy.
