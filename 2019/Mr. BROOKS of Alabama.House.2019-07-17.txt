 Mr. Speaker, this week America celebrates the  50th anniversary of one of mankind's--and America's--greatest  achievements: walking on the surface of the Moon.   Although then only a child, I well remember the earth shake and the  dishes in our kitchen cabinets rattle as the Saturn V engines were  tested nearby. Even now, 50 years after the Moon landing, I get chills  remembering when Apollo astronauts landed and later planted the  American flag on the Moon's surface.   It was American ingenuity, boldness, technical prowess, and economic  might that made this historic achievement possible.   I am proud to say the legacy of the Apollo 11 Moon landing lives on  in the Tennessee Valley of Alabama that I represent. Some history is in  order:   The Tennessee Valley's Marshall Space Flight Center is the birthplace  of America's space program. Americans generally, and Alabamians in  particular, designed and engineered the Saturn V rocket that launched  the historic Apollo 11 and took American astronauts to the Moon.   I will never forget the flames and the roar as our Saturn V rocket  was launched and carried the Apollo 11 crew in vehicles to the Moon. I  remember with tremendous pride Neil Armstrong's words as he set foot on  the Moon: ``That's one small step for man, one giant leap for  mankind.''   That giant leap meant to benefit all mankind is a prime example of  American exceptionalism and helped cement America's status as the best,  most powerful and most influential nation in world history.   When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planted America's flag on the  Moon surface on July 20, 1969, there was no doubt that America's space  program had passed the Russians and become the preeminent leader in  space exploration, a position America maintains today.   This week, America not only reflects on the miraculous achievements  of the Apollo 11 mission, but we also honor those who played a critical  role in its ultimate success. The Tennessee Valley is immensely proud  of our pivotal role in landing a man on the Moon and, equally  importantly, returning them alive to Earth.   Reflecting our pride in America's achievement, there are two--that  is, two--Saturn V rockets displayed at the United States Space and  Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.                                time  1015    These Saturn V displays help inspire the next generation to reach for  the stars and achieve what now may be thought impossible.   While it is important to remember the historic achievements of the  Apollo missions, it is also important to honor those who sacrificed  their lives in the effort to achieve American greatness.   In that vein, Huntsville has named schools after Apollo Command Pilot  Virgil ``Gus'' Grissom, Senior Pilot Ed White, and Pilot Roger Chaffee,  each of  [[Page H5917]]  whom died in a capsule fire during an Apollo 1 ground test.   After the Moon landing and return of Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz  Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, and Michael Collins to Earth on July 24, 1969,  Huntsville's streets were awash with revelers.   German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun said on the Huntsville  courthouse steps that day: ``My friends, there was dancing here in the  streets of Huntsville when our first satellite orbited the Earth, and  there was dancing again when the first Americans landed on the Moon.  I'd like to ask you: Don't hang up your dancing slippers.''   Von Braun's words remind us that mankind's greatest achievements are  yet to come, that America will continue to accomplish the unimaginable  in space for the benefit of all humanity.   As we reach for the stars, I have confidence that the Tennessee  Valley, Marshall Space Flight Center, and Huntsville, where we say,  ``The sky is not the limit,'' will be instrumental in carrying American  astronauts back to the Moon, to Mars, and beyond.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, socialist Democrats support open  borders. Open borders mean a literal tsunami of illegal alien labor  that artificially inflates the labor supply and suppresses American  wages. This is economics 101. If the supply goes up, everything else  being constant, the price goes down.   The way to raise wages is simple: America must stop importing cheap  foreign labor that takes American jobs from American workers and  suppresses the wages of hardworking Americans who need that money for  their families.   The question is: Do we care enough about American family incomes to  secure our borders and stop the flood of illegal alien labor that  suppresses American wages? Of course not. Instead, there are those who  seek an imperial decree for a $15-per-hour minimum wage.   Well, that all sounds fine and good. Socialist policies always have a  cost, and according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office,  that cost is a loss of as many as 3.7 million jobs.   You heard right. The policies being advocated today really are  advocating the firing of as many as 3.7 million American workers from  their jobs. That is like firing the entire population of the State of  Oklahoma.   Mr. Speaker, if the advocates of this legislation really cared about  American workers, they would not fire them; rather, they would help  secure our borders, save American jobs, save American incomes, and, as  an added bonus, help prevent the deaths of over 30,000 Americans who  die each year because of America's porous southern border.   But that is not what the advocates of this legislation prefer.  Rather, out of a lust for political power, they prefer open borders and  the firing of 3.7 million American workers.   Mr. Speaker, I say yes to border security; I say no to killing jobs;  and I say no to this job-killing socialist legislation.
