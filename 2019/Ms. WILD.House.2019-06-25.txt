 Mr. Speaker, as some are aware, today marks the 1-month  anniversary of the death of my beloved life partner, Kerry Acker. What  most people don't know is that Kerry's death was a suicide.   Kerry was 63 years old. He shouldn't have had a care in the world. He  was financially secure and had a warm, loving family and dozens of  friends. He loved them all. And yet, incomprehensibly, he seemingly did  not grasp the toll his absence would have on those who loved him.   Why am I sharing this very personal story? Because we all need to  recognize that mental health issues know no boundaries. I do not want  anyone else to suffer as he suffered, nor for any family to suffer as  mine has over the past month.   This is a national emergency. In 2017, there were more than 47,000  suicides in this country and more than 1.4 million suicide attempts.  Across our country, suicides rose by 30 percent between 1999 and 2018.   Behind these numbers are grieving partners and spouses, parents and  children, siblings, friends, and relatives. Every community in our  country has been touched in some way by major mental health challenges.   Removing the stigma cannot just be a slogan. We need to make it real  through our actions. That means building a future where people truly  understand that they should feel no more shame over seeking treatment  for this disease than they would seeking treatment for any other  disease or medical condition.   To anyone out there who is struggling, I am urging you to reach out.  There are people who love you and who will suffer more than you know if  they lose you. Help is available 24/7 through 911 or the National  Suicide Prevention Lifeline, 1-800-273-TALK.   To anyone who is concerned about someone in their life, please pick  up the phone or take that drive to go see them. Don't wait.                            ____________________
