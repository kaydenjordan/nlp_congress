 Madam President, the American people do not have to  choose between safer schools and the Constitution, and neither does the  U.S. Senate.   The American people want their constitutional rights protected and  their kids to be safe in school. They want both of those things at  once, and that is just what the bill before the Senate will help  accomplish.   Thanks to the leadership and dedication of Senator Cornyn, Senator  Tillis, and several of their counterparts across the aisle, we are  considering a bipartisan bill that will make our country safer without  making it any less free. This is the sweet spot: making America safer,  especially for kids in school, without making our country one bit less  free.   The legislation before us would make our communities and schools  safer without laying one finger on the Second Amendment for law-abiding  citizens. Its key provisions are hugely popular with the American  people. This bill supplies significant new funding to law enforcement  and police, to school security, and to mental health treatment both in  school and in the wider community.   Under this bill, if a teenager has been convicted of a crime or  adjudicated to be mentally ill, even before their 18th birthday, that  important information will show up in a firearms background check until  they are 21. This strengthens the existing background check system  without expanding it.   States will receive new money for crisis intervention programs of  their own choosing, and if they choose to use the money for so-called  red flag laws, those laws will have to meet a new, higher standard for  due process.   This is a commonsense package. Its provisions are very, very popular.  It contains zero--zero--new restrictions, zero new waiting periods,  zero mandates, and zero bans of any kind for law-abiding gun owners.   Police and law enforcement support the bill strongly. The police  chiefs' association and the Fraternal Order of Police say: ``This  bipartisan measure is . . . one that will save lives,'' according to  the FOP and the police chiefs' association.   The National Sheriffs' Association calls it:         A bill that can actually save lives . . . that allows the       States to craft their own unique answers to the questions       raised by gun violence.    After years--literally years--of liberal demands that would make war  on citizens' constitutional rights, our Democratic colleagues have  finally accepted that we can make schools and communities safer without  impeding on the Second Amendment.   We can do more to protect innocent Americans, schoolkids especially,  without--without--eroding the Bill of Rights 1 inch, and that is just  what the Senate will do when we pass this bill.
