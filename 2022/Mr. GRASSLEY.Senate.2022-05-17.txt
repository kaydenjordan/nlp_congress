 Madam President, I want to honor the life and legacy of  Julianne ``Julie'' Beckett of Cedar Rapids, IA. Julie was a mother and  passionate advocate for children and youth with special healthcare  needs and disabilities. I got to know Julie very well over the years as  the result of her daughter, Katie Beckett, and Julie's passionate  advocacy on Federal policy work such as Katie Beckett waivers, Family  Opportunity Act, Money Follows-the-Person, Family-to-Family Health  Information Centers, Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act,  Accelerating Access to Kids Care Act, and more.   Julie's daughter, Katie, was born in Cedar Rapids, IA, on March 9,  1978. Five months after she was born, Katie contracted viral  encephalitis followed by grand mal seizures. The encephalitis caused  damage to her central nervous system and her respiratory system, and  she was attached to a ventilator. She would be almost 2 years old  before she could breathe on her own. Under Medicaid law at the time,  Katie could only receive care through Medicaid if she remained in the  hospital, even though she was able to receive care at home. Iowa  Congressman Tom Tauke heard of Katie's situation and realized that it  made no sense to keep a child in the hospital who could be at home with  her family. He worked to convince the Reagan administration that the  system should be changed to allow States to provide Medicaid to  children receiving care in their homes. Ultimately, President Ronald  Reagan took up Katie's cause, intervening so that Katie could receive  treatment at home and still be covered under Medicaid.   In the 1980s, Julie and Katie were able to help change national  policy that became known as ``Katie Beckett waivers'' and, to date,  more than a half million disabled children have been able to receive  care in their homes with their families rather than being forced into  hospitals and institutions. Katie passed away on May 18, 2012. Since  then, Julie continued her advocacy.   Sadly, last Friday, May 13, 2022, Julie passed away. As the result of  Julie's advocacy, children like Katie are able to live a healthy,  happy, and independent life. Our Nation has lost a passionate advocate  for children and youth with special healthcare needs and disabilities.  For more than 40 years, Julie advocated and organized the voices of  families of children and youth with special healthcare needs and  disabilities. Julie cofounded Family Voices, a national family-led  organization of families and friends of children and youth with special  healthcare needs and disabilities. Julie was instrumental in passing  the Family Opportunity Act, which established Family-to-Family Health  Information Centers and created options for families with children and  youth with special healthcare needs and disabilities to buy into  Medicaid while continuing to work, among other important provisions.  Julie also worked at Child Health Specialty Clinics in Iowa for 30  years and served as a consultant with the American Academy of  Pediatrics. In 2021, she was honored with the Family Voices Legacy  Award in recognition of her outstanding lifetime contributions to  healthcare policy and services that have improved the lives of children  with special healthcare needs and disabilities and their families.  Julie positively impacted the lives of children and youth with special  healthcare needs and disabilities and their families.   While Julie would often say she was ``Katie Beckett's mom,'' we also  knew her as a passionate advocate and servant leader. Julie's lifelong  pursuit to improve the lives of children and youth with special  healthcare needs and disabilities made an impact for the better for her  community, State, and Nation. Godspeed, my friend.  [[Page S2540]]                                ____________________
