 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor Laura  Dove as she retires from serving as Secretary for the Majority of the  U.S. Senate.   Laura began her service many years ago as a Senate page. She returned  as an assistant in the Senate Republican Cloakroom under Republican  Leader Bob Dole. In her more than 20 years of dedicated service, she  has worked in various capacities. This includes in the Republican  Cloakroom, with the Senate Republican Conference, under Republican  leadership, and in her current  [[Page S1214]]  role as Secretary for the Majority. This is quite an honor and an  accomplishment, as Secretaries for the Majority and the Minority are  elected officers nominated by the party's leader. During her time in  the Senate, Laura provided much-needed parliamentary guidance and  counsel to Senators. She was no stranger to this type of advice, as her  father served as the Senate Parliamentarian for many years.   Laura has succeeded in every aspect of her service to the U.S.  Senate, and I can personally say she will be greatly missed throughout  the Upper Chamber. I wish her all the best as she transitions to the  next exciting chapter in her life.                            ____________________
