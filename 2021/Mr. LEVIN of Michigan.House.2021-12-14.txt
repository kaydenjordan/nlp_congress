 Madam Speaker, Islamophobia is a problem  across the world, including in my own district, where one of the many  mosques that I represent was vandalized last year.   It is a problem in this body, where only four Muslims have ever  served, and where the most visible among them, Congresswoman Omar, has  been the subject of horrible anti-Muslim attacks.   And it is obviously a problem abroad, even rising to the level of  genocide in Burma and China.   I am a Jewish Member of Congress who considers fighting all forms of  oppression and all instances of religious discrimination core to my  faith.   Mr. Speaker, let's all come together and reaffirm that cardinal  American value, freedom of religion. Let's pass this law as a step  towards protecting the rights of the world's 1.8 million Muslims and an  integral part of our work to win freedom and security for all people  everywhere.
