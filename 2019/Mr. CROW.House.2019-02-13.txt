 Madam Speaker, I rise in memory of the 17 students killed  nearly 1 year ago today at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. They  deserve more than our remembrance, though. They deserve action and the  promise that we as a country will do better. I speak today as a father,  as a soldier, as a sportsman, and as a resident of Aurora, Colorado.   I respect the Second Amendment and our heritage of responsible gun  ownership, but I learned while serving our country that citizenship  comes with duties to our fellow Americans. One of those duties is to  ensure that our fellow citizens can live without fear and safely pursue  their dreams and ambitions. I was sent here to speak the truth, and the  truth is we are not fulfilling that duty to one another.   So let us be the generation who has the courage to stand up to the  gun lobby and to the special interests. Let us be the generation that  recognizes that citizenship comes with responsibility. I know we can be  that generation.   The question is: Can we be that Congress?   I call on my colleagues to pass H.R. 8 and reinstitute the ban on  assault weapons to keep our kids and our communities safe.                            ____________________
