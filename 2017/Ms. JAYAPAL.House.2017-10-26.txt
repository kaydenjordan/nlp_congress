 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Yarmuth for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this fiscal year 2018  budget resolution for a number of reasons, not the least of which is  that the underlying assumptions are grossly misleading. It assumes  fictions like hundreds of billions of dollars from the repeal of the  Affordable Care Act, and it assumes an economic growth rate of 3  percent, which most economists on both sides do not believe is  possible.   This budget is merely a vehicle for Republicans to fast-track tax  cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and large corporations. Any  assertion of cuts for working families is debunked by experts like  Leonard Burman, cofounder of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, who has  called this ``utterly implausible.''   Mr. Speaker, the facts are these: 80 percent of the Republican tax  cuts go to the top 1 percent by 2027; the average tax cut for the top 1  percent in 2027 will be $207,000; and 42 million middle class  households will face a tax increase, including those earning between  $50,000 and $150,000, who will see a tax increase of one-third. That is  what this budget lays the path for.   If we want to see where this will lead, let's just look at Kansas, a  place where the Republican legislature has rolled back the tax cuts  that they passed from several years ago because they simply didn't work  and put Kansas' economy into a downward spiral.   We know who wins under this budget resolution. It simply paves the  way for a huge tax cut for the wealthiest millionaires, billionaires,  and corporations. That is wrong, and I urge a ``no'' vote on this  budget.
