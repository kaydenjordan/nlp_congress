 Mr. Speaker, in June 1944, 2 weeks after the D-day  landings in Normandy, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the  Servicemen's Readjustment Act, more commonly known as the GI Bill. That  landmark measure created both college tuition grants and a living  stipend for returning servicemembers who, according to FDR, had ``been  compelled to make greater economic sacrifice and every other kind of  sacrifice than the rest of us.''   Even though World War II would rage on for another year, leaders in  Washington at the time recognized that millions of drafted young  soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen would soon be returning to  civilian life, and, for their sake and for the sake of the postwar  economy, creating an educational pathway to the middle class made  tremendous sense.   It has been 74 years since the GI Bill was signed into law, and it is  now recognized as one of the most successful pieces of domestic  legislation ever enacted. The postwar economic boom of the 1950s and  1960s, and the blossoming of the American middle class, both have been  attributed, in part, to the GI Bill.   Many renowned Americans, including Bob Dole, Johnny Carson, Harry  Belafonte, Justice William Rehnquist, and even Clint Eastwood, to name  just a few, were beneficiaries of the GI Bill.   Economic studies have concluded that for every dollar the U.S.  Government spent on the GI Bill, our economy saw nearly $7 in return in  the form of additional economic output and tax revenues from income  growth.   Despite its stellar performance, the relative strength of the GI Bill  deteriorated over time. By 2008, it was clear that the tuition  assistance and living stipends had not kept pace with the rising costs  of college education.   As a freshman Congressman on the House Armed Services Committee, I  heard from Iraq and Afghan veterans that, because of the GI Bill  erosion, they were forced to choose between dropping out of school and  shouldering the burden of student loans.   To fix this inequity, the Post-9/11 GI Bill was passed by a  Democratic Congress on a bipartisan basis and signed into law by a  Republican President, George W. Bush. And I want to actually take a  moment to publicly acknowledge that the late Senator John McCain was  deeply involved in the final negotiations that made that passage and  enactment successful.    The updated law increased benefits to match the cost of 4-year public  university tuition in a servicemember's home State and increased the  living stipend to keep faith with the law. Critically, it also allowed  GI benefits to be transferred on a one-time basis to a spouse or  dependent child, a groundbreaking change that transformed the value of  military service.   After the bill signing, I flew to Iraq on a congressional visit and  vividly recall being in Baghdad surrounded by hundreds of soldiers  bursting with questions about when and how this feature would be  implemented.   Over the last 10 years, it has been clear that the transferability of  the GI Bill benefit has been an enormous morale booster and a valuable  incentive to enlist and remain in service.   Despite the 10 years of success of the new law, however, the Trump  Department of Defense announced a new policy this past July 12 that  would bar servicemembers with more than 16 years of service from  transferring their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to eligible family  members.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say, as someone who represents a military  district, in the August break when I was home visiting the submarine  base in New London and talking to Guard and Reserve members, they were  absolutely blindsided, stunned, and angry at this arbitrary change that  many of them had built their career decisions about staying in the  military to basically qualify for this educational benefit.   The Iraq and Afghan Veterans of America have started a national  petition drive to reverse this policy change. Really, it is our duty,  as Members of Congress, to make sure that that is successful.   Arbitrarily revoking transferability breaks our commitment to our  most dedicated and highly trained servicemembers. Such a policy change  sends exactly the wrong message to those who have chosen the military  as their long-term career, and sets a damaging and dangerous precedent  for the removal of other critical benefits to our all-volunteer force.   Two weeks after the Pentagon announced this policy, 83 of my  colleagues joined me in a letter that we sent to Secretary of Defense  James Mattis, objecting to this change and calling for its immediate  reversal. So far, they have not given a single public explanation for  this policy change, and  [[Page H7876]]  they are promising that that is coming.   But I will just say this: As someone who was involved when this bill  was first passed, we will make sure there will be a legislative  response if the Department of Defense does not keep faith with those  who wear the uniform of this country and who have volunteered based on  reliance of the fact that there would be a GI Bill benefit for them and  their spouse and children.   To use FDR's words, protecting transferability ``gives emphatic  notice to the men and women in our Armed Forces that the American  people do not intend to let them down.''                            ____________________
