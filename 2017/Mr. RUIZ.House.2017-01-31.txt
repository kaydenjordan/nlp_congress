 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724,  which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban and help unify the  family of Muktar and his wife, who spent 20 years in a refugee camp  after fleeing Somalia, and will continue to be separated from their  children who still live in the camp.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.
