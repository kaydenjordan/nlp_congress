 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Comer for yielding  time.   The numbers that were just shared are out of 2.1 million Federal  employees, and the figure is accurate. Some 10,000 were terminated in  2021, but this is a fraction. People in the private sector are three  times more likely to be terminated for poor performance than are people  in the Federal Government. That is because it is so restrictive and so  difficult to go through the process.   In fact, when the discussion deals with Federal employees that have  been on the job past the probationary period, the number of  terminations drops to half of what was just spoken of. These are skewed  numbers that are being shared, but also a fraction of the over 2  million Federal employees and a fraction in comparison to those who  were terminated in the private sector.   We must be able to deal with poor performers in the Federal  Government, and our Democrat friends want to protect them and make  Federal bureaucrats a protected class. That is absolute insanity. It is  bad for America. It is bad for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank the gentleman for yielding to me.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me begin by stating clearly that I oppose the underlying bill  here. Some of my Democratic colleagues claim that there is no such  thing as a deep state, that there are no problems that we have within  our Federal employee system. But there are genuine, valid concerns.   Take, for example, a Washington Post story titled: ``Resistance from  within: Federal workers push back against Trump.'' In that article:  ``Federal workers are in regular consultation with recently departed  Obama-era political appointees about what they can do to push back  against the new President's initiatives.''   We have a problem, and it is a problem that bureaucrats do not do  their jobs in fulfilling the will of a duly-elected President and the  will of the American people. Instead, over and over, as time has shown  it, they resist the will of the President.   This whole title here of H.R. 302, ``Preventing a Patronage System  Act,'' a patronage system is designed to get people in the front door.  That is not even what we are talking about. We are talking about people  who are already in the door who are not doing their job. For crying out  loud, it is the back door that needs to be dealt with, when you have  poor performers, people who are not doing their job.   President Trump dealt with this by instituting schedule F, giving him  the authority to do away with policymakers who refused to do their job.  That is something that is desperately needed, and that is what is at  stake. It is that issue that my amendment addresses.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Comer), the ranking member of the Committee on  Oversight and Reform,    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I respect greatly the gentleman from Virginia and enjoy working with  him, but his characterization that we are attacking Federal employees  is just not true.   There are millions of great Federal employees, and those who are  doing their job have absolutely nothing to worry about. That is not  what we are addressing here. We are addressing those who refuse to do  their job.   There needs to be a means of dealing with those--especially in this  schedule F that President Trump put in place--those who are responsible  for policymaking, to do the will of the elected President of the United  States. My Democrat colleagues are trying to protect those individuals  and enable them, give them the right to continue to force their will  upon the American people rather than the will of the American people as  expressed through the duly-elected President, whomever that may be.  This is absolutely wrong and beyond my comprehension.   Even Federal employees themselves, year after year after year, talk  about how difficult it is to get rid of poor performers in the Federal  workforce. Here we are trying to protect them rather than have the  ability to deal with and terminate poor performers and, specifically  with schedule F, those who are responsible, regardless of the  administration, to perform the will of that administration.   My amendment addresses these issues. I strongly urge my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to support this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   This will be a 5-minute vote.
