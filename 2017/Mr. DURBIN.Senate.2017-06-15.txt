DACA     Mr. President, today is the fifth anniversary of the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as DACA. DACA  provides temporary legal status to immigrant students who arrived in  the United States as children and infants, if they register with the  government, pay a fee, and pass a criminal background check.   The program is based on the DREAM Act, a piece of legislation I  introduced 16 years ago in 2001. That legislation gave undocumented  students who grew up in this country a chance to earn a path to legal  status and citizenship. These young people have come to be known as  DREAMers. What used to be a word reserved for rock-and-roll groups is  now a word that has become part of our common language to describe an  immigration challenge and opportunity.   These DREAMers came to the United States as children. They are  American in every way except for their legal immigration status. We  have already invested a lot of money in these kids. We educated them.  We made them part of this country, and it makes no sense to squander  their talents by deporting them at this moment in their lives.   In April 2010, I sent a letter to President Obama. Dick Lugar, the  Republican Senator from Indiana, joined me. On a bipartisan basis, we  said to President Obama: Stop deporting these young kids. They did  nothing wrong. Their parents made the decision to come here. Give them  a chance. The President responded. It is now clear the DACA Program he  created by Executive order has been a great success. More than 780,000  DREAMers have come forward and received DACA protection and status that  has allowed them to contribute more fully to this country as students,  as teachers, as nurses, as engineers, as entrepreneurs.   A recent study by the Center for American Progress found that ending  DACA--saying to these 780,000 young people they are no longer part of  America--would cost us. It would cost our economy over $400 billion in  gross domestic product over the next 10 years. These are productive  citizens doing good things for America. I should take that back. They  are not citizens yet. They are productive people doing good things for  America whom I want to make citizens if the DREAM Act becomes law.   I have many differences with President Trump on immigration. For  example, the President's January 25 Executive order makes up to 8  million immigrants priorities for deportation, and seeks to create a  deportation force by tripling the number of immigration agents. This  ignores the reality that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants  are law-abiding individuals who make important economic contributions  to this country, and have deep roots in the United States.   I am grateful, and I say that publicly. I have said it before. I am  grateful President Trump has decided to keep the DACA Program in place.  Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and the U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Service Director nominee, Francis Cissna, have promised me  personally and publicly that they will maintain the existing guidelines  for the DACA Program. I appreciate this commitment. I intend to hold  them to it.   Congress also has an obligation to do its job. We ought to do  something we rarely do in the U.S. Senate--pass legislation, fix our  broken immigration system. Think about this: On June 27, 2013--4 years  ago--the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, passed comprehensive  immigration reform by a vote of 68 to 32, better than 2 to 1. I was  glad to be part of the Gang of 8 Democratic and Republican Senators who  worked for months on the bill that passed by this margin. It  strengthened border security, protected American workers, and it  established a tough but fair path to citizenship for 11 million  undocumented people in this country.   Unfortunately, the Republican majority of the House of  Representatives would not debate it, would not consider it, would not  bring it for a vote, and it died in the U.S. House of Representatives.  If they had done their job, their work, it would have passed with a  bipartisan majority. President Obama would have signed it into law. I  might not be standing here today talking about this issue.   Over the years, I have come to the floor of the Senate to tell story  after story about DREAMers, the young immigrant students who grew up in  this country. These stories put a human face on the DACA Program and  the DREAM legislation. They show that immigration makes our country  stronger.   Today, I want to say a word about Gissel Escobedo. This is Gissel.  She came to the United States at the age of 3. Her family emigrated  from Mexico. She grew up in my home State of Illinois, in the town of  Cicero. She was an honors student in high school. She attended their  gifted program. She had a big responsibility personally. From a young  age, she was one of the primary caregivers for her brother who suffers  from severe autism. During the little spare time she had, Gissel was a  volunteer in her community, helping organizations provide care for  children with autism.   As an undocumented student though, Gissel was not eligible for any  Federal assistance to go to college, but as a result of her academic  achievements in high school, she received a private scholarship to  attend the University of Illinois at Chicago. As a college student,  Gissel was a writing tutor and a leader in student organizations for  future teachers. In 2010, she graduated from the University of Illinois  Chicago and the College of Education with a degree in elementary  education. After the graduation ceremony, Gissel received a Dean's  Merit Award. She delivered the graduation speech for her class.   She wanted to start using her degree as an elementary school teacher,  but because she was undocumented, that wasn't possible. Instead, she  continued her education and earned a master's degree at the University  of Illinois. She was accepted into a disability leadership program as a  family advocate.   Then, in 2012, the world changed for the better for Gissel. President  Obama established the DACA Program. She immediately applied for DACA.  Then, in 2013, she completed her master's degree and became an  elementary school teacher. For the last 4 years, Gissel has been a  teacher in the Berwyn South School District. Last year, she was awarded  a certificate of achievement for her leadership as one of two teachers  to implement the first-ever dual-language program in the district.   Gissel sent me a letter. I would like to read part of it as part of  the Record. Here is what she said:         DACA has enabled me to become a meaningful member of       society by opening doors that would have otherwise not been       accessible. DACA recipients, like myself, are more than just       a policy. My hope is that when people listen to our stories,       they will notice the kind of individuals that we are and the       kind of contributions we make--not only to the economy, but       to our society.    I reflect on that paragraph to think about this young woman, the  challenges she has faced within her family, and challenges imposed by  the fact that she was undocumented. She has never lost sight of her  commitment to her family, to her disabled sibling, and to many others  in her community.  [[Page S3507]]    Now she wants to be a teacher. Wouldn't you be proud and honored to  have your child in a classroom with someone with Gissel's master's  degree and values? I certainly would. Gissel and other DREAMers have so  much to give to the United States, but without DACA and without the  DREAM Act, Gissel would be deported back to Mexico--a country she  hasn't lived in since she was 3 years old.   Will America be a stronger country if we send away people like  Gissel, if we deport them and say we don't need them in our future? Of  course not. The answer is clear. Gissel will make America a better  place. Today we celebrate the DACA Program, which has given Gissel and  hundreds of thousands of other DREAMers the chance to finally come out  of the shadows, but we also recognize DACA as a temporary solution.   Ultimately, Congress--and especially the Senate--must step up and  show leadership here; make certain that we address the failings and  weaknesses of our broken immigration system; say to the 780,000  protected by DACA that you stepped forward, paid your fee, submitted  yourself to a background check, and have been given a temporary  opportunity to be part of America. Now it is our job to translate that  into a permanent opportunity for these young people to make America a  better place.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.                           Thanking Senator Durbin
