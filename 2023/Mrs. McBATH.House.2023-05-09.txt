 Mr. Speaker, I thank the honorable Representative  Cherfilus-McCormick and the honorable Representative Jackson for  hosting this evening's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour on  gun safety.   This evening we are in this Chamber just merely weeks before we  commemorate the massacre of 19 children in their elementary school, and  in the last few days even parents have died as human shields in  Cleveland, Texas. A woman was murdered, and four others wounded even in  my home State of Georgia, and a first grader lost both of his parents  and his baby brother in the same shooting in Allen, Texas.   Eight people were murdered as they just simply went about their day.   What is our answer?   Every day we wake up to more dead Americans, we wake up to thoughts  and prayers, and we wake up to a refusal to act.   Is this the God-given freedom endowed by our creator--the freedom to  go about our day and be gunned down in our malls, in our churches, and  in our schools?   Horrifically, first responders are finding little girls without faces  in their first grade classrooms.   Children are now orphans, wives are widows, and communities are  simply being ripped apart.                                time  2120    Thoughts and prayers, that is not stopping this carnage, this crisis,  this ugly, horrific public health crisis. If thoughts and prayers are  all that we have to offer survivors like myself and all the survivors  that we continue to see day in and day out in this country, I tell you  this: Faith without works is dead; our prayers without action are  hollow.   God has given us the path to action. He has given us the tools to dam  this river of despair that the American people are living in every  single day of their lives. It is commonsense solutions that save lives;  it is background checks; it is red flag laws; and it is banning assault  weapons.   How long are we going to simply stand here and do nothing? How long?  How long do we stand in the silence? How long do we listen to the cries  of mothers like me that have lost our children and our loved ones to  unnecessary gun violence?   This Nation is under siege, and we are simply without the courage to  act, the courage to pass laws that the majority of the American people  support, they are crying out for, they are begging this body to pass. I  and hundreds of thousands of people like me are terrified that this  carnage is going to continue.   My son was murdered by a man who never should have had a gun. These  children and these families were murdered by those who never should  have ever had access to these weapons of war. The life of my son and  all those that we have lost were endowed by our Creator. My son's life  was stolen from him. These children, these families had a God-given  right to live free from this violence, and it was taken from them.   God has called on each and every one of us in this body to act. Only  we can stop this. That truth is self-evident.   We can keep guns out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them,  and we  [[Page H2166]]  can feel safe in our communities, free from the terror of gun violence,  free from the grief and the heartbreak that our families and our  communities live with every single day. We should be free to live our  lives the way God intended us to live.   Mr. Speaker, I have been a part of this body, a Member of this body  for 5 years now, and I have lost count of the times I have come down  here and begged my Republican colleagues to act, to put public safety  over their love of guns. The sad thing about it is I know deep in my  spirit and my soul that this will not be the last time that I have to  come down here and beg again.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Kamlager-Dove).
