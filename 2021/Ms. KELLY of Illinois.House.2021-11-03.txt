 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my  colleagues to pass the Build Back Better Act.   The Build Back Better Act will bring transformational change to the  American people, create a more equitable healthcare system, and save  lives.   One of the greatest ongoing injustices in our country is just how  many people do not have access to affordable healthcare. That  population is overwhelmingly made up of people of color and rural  Americans.   Policymakers and medical institutions have not prioritized the  healthcare needs of communities of color and rural communities. The  Build Back Better Act will help these communities by closing the  healthcare coverage gap, create more affordable coverage options,  expand benefits for seniors, invest in improving access to mental  health and substance use disorders, attack the gun violence epidemic  with public-health focused interventions, invest in addressing the  Black maternal mortality crisis, and lowering the cost of prescription  drugs.   Investing in affordable care, preventative care, and targeted  reductions in violence will result in fewer extreme health scenarios,  fewer emergency room visits, and over time, will save us money and  reduce the burden on our healthcare system.   Healthcare is a human right. Passing the Build Back Better Act is a  step in the right direction.                            ____________________
