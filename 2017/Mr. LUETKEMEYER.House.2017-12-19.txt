 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his steadfast  support on so many important financial services issues.   Mr. Speaker, first, I want to quickly lend my support to the tax  package slated to be considered by the House today. This legislation  will bring simplicity and fairness to the Tax Code. It will lower tax  rates so individuals and job creators can invest in our communities and  hire more workers. I also want to commend Chairman Brady and the House  leadership for their incredible work on this issue.   Secondly, Mr. Speaker, believe it or not, there is another bill  slated to be considered today by this body, H.R. 3312, my Systemic Risk  Designation Improvement Act. It will remove the ill-conceived approach  taken in Dodd-Frank to designate bank holding companies as systemically  important financial institutions, or SIFIs.   Under the current regulatory framework, the designation of SIFIs is  based solely on size. Any bank holding company with more than $50  billion in assets is subject to enhanced regulatory supervision and a  variety of special assessments.   This approach fails to take into account differences in business  models or risks posed to the financial system. As a former bank  regulator, I can tell you this isn't a responsible basis for  supervision, a fact that has been recognized by Federal Reserve Chair  Yellen, Secretary of the Treasury Mnuchin, former Treasury Secretary  Lew, and many Members of Congress. Even Barney Frank, the former  Democratic chairman of the Financial Services Committee and author of  Dodd-Frank, has said the $50 billion threshold is completely arbitrary  and has negative implications on our economy.                                time  1045    This legislation closely ties the safeguards intended in the  designation of a bank holding company with real risk to the system.   My legislation would require the Federal Reserve to examine not just  size, but also interconnectedness, the extent of readily available  substitutes, global cross-jurisdictional activity, and complexity,  criteria they already use in their own risk calculation analysis.   An inefficient regulatory structure that does not reflect the reality  of the U.S. banking system can have real economic consequences. We  should no longer let the SIFI process lead to marketplace disruption or  penalize companies based on size alone.   It is time to take a more pragmatic approach to the SIFI designation  process and, more generally, the punitive regulatory regime hitting  financial institutions and their customers. It is time to actually  manage risk and limit real threats to our financial system.   This legislation received broad bipartisan support when it was  reported by the Financial Services Committee with a vote of 47-12. That  means nearly 80 percent of our committee members voted in favor of this  legislation. I hope our House colleagues will join us in supporting  H.R. 3312 later today. I thank the chairman for his leadership and help  with this initiative.    Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking Chairman  Hensarling for his support of this legislation and his dedication to a  more reasonable regulatory regime.   I would also like to thank my good friend, Representative David Scott  from Georgia, for being a cosponsor on the Democrat side and for all  the hard work and support he has given us throughout this labor of love  here on trying to get this thing done. He has been a champion for us,  and we thank him sincerely.   Today, the House will consider H.R. 3312, the Systemic Risk  Designation Improvement Act of 2017, a bipartisan piece of legislation  to address an inefficient regulatory structure by accounting for actual  risk, rather than the size alone in the designation of systemically  important financial institutions, or SIFIs.   Under the current regulatory framework for SIFI designations, any  bank holding company with more than $50 billion in assets is subject to  enhanced regulatory supervision and special assessments. This approach  fails to take into account differences in business models or risks  posed to the financial system. It has real world implications, too,  stunting economic growth and limiting access to credit.   The risk of a traditional bank is not the same as an internationally  active complex firm. In fact, the Fed has produced data showing the  risk of every single midsize and regional bank which pales in  comparison to risks posed by many and almost all global systemically  important banks.    H.R. 3312 will remove the completely arbitrary approach taken today  and replace it with analysis of actual risk posed to the financial  system. The bill would require regulators to examine not just size, but  also interconnectedness, the extent of readily available substitutes,  global cross-jurisdictional activity, and the complexity of each bank  holding company.   Today's method isn't a reasonable basis for supervision, a fact that  has been recognized by Fed Chair Yellen, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin,  and former Treasury Secretary Lew, and many Members of this body. Even  Barney Frank, as Chairman Hensarling just noted, the former Democratic  chairman of the Financial Services Committee and author of the Dodd- Frank Act, has said the $50 billion threshold is completely arbitrary  and has had negative implications on our economy.   It is important to note that this bill will not impact the authority  of the Federal Reserve to oversee institutions. The focused standards  set forth in the bill don't guarantee that any institution will be  permanently freed from the rigors that are associated with SIFI  designation. If the Fed so feels that a bank needs to have continuous  oversight, they will do so.   I want to take a moment to discuss the score issued by the  Congressional Budget Office. CBO opined that this bill would result in  direct spending. I disagree with the CBO interpretation of what this  legislation will do, and I believe that my bill will actually create a  safer financial system.   At the same time, it is important to me and my colleagues that the  bill comes to the taxpayers at no cost. The offset included in the  Rules Committee Print will more than cover any potential hit to the  Deposit Insurance Fund and makes this legislation budget-neutral.   The bottom line is this: an inefficient regulatory structure that  does not reflect the reality of the U.S. banking system can have real  economic consequences. We should no longer let the SIFI process lead to  marketplace disruption or penalize companies for size alone.   I have worked on this legislation surrounding the SIFI designation  process for the last 4 years, but I have not done it alone. H.R. 3312  was drafted in good faith with--and with considerable input from--many  of my friends on the other side of the aisle as well.   Because we worked together, this legislation received broad  bipartisan support when it was reported by the Financial Services  Committee with a vote of 47-12. That means nearly 80 percent of the  committee members voted in favor of this legislation.   I want to thank my colleagues for their help in this effort, namely,  Mr. Scott, Ms. Sinema, Mr. Hill, Mr. Williams, Mr. Stivers, Mrs.  Beatty, Mr.  [[Page H10223]]  Budd, Mr. Meeks, and Mr. Gottheimer. This is an important issue, and I  hope our colleagues will join us in supporting this bipartisan,  commonsense measure.   Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, this is a bill about being able  to allow these banks that are caught in a ``California Hotel''  situation here to be able to get out of this with a good analysis of  their risk profile, their business model, because, at the end of the  day, this is what this is all about. Their business model is not a risk  to this country or the economic system that we have. It is not like the  international connected banks, and, therefore, they shouldn't be  treated as such.   As a result, this is important for not only the midsize banks, but  for the banks below them because the regulators have been also allowing  these sorts of requirements and rules to roll downhill on community  banks as well. So it is time we put a stop to this.   It is important that we take a pragmatic approach to this designation  process, to manage actual risk, and limit the real threats to our  financial system.
