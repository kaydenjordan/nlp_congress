 Mr. President, I rise to speak about the President's  nomination of appellate judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve as an Associate  Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. On July 9, President Trump announced  his selection of Judge Kavanaugh to be the 114th Justice in our  Nation's proud history.   For a practicing lawyer, serving on our highest Court is the pinnacle  of achievement, and nomination to the Bench is testament to a  distinguished legal career. When we imagine a Supreme Court Justice, we  think of respected jurists, well-steeped in legal questions, rigorous  in attention to detail, respectful of traditions, faithful to the law,  awed by the recognition of the proud and profound responsibility  wielded, and fair to all involved. Our legal system requires it, and  the American people value it among their highest ideals of government.   Throughout our history, the central tension of our Republic can be  defined as the exercise of government power versus liberty. Each  expands at the expense of the other. Finding a way for both central  authority and individual freedom to coexist and support each other  remains our biggest challenge and will remain so long into the future.   To preserve the limits on an ever-expanding Federal Government, our  Founding Fathers conceived of a system of interlocking powers that  support each other but serve as a necessary restraint against  tyrannical behavior of any. We all know it as the principle of  separation of powers, with each of the three branches acting as a check  on the others.   The Constitution's appointments clause defines one of the most  consequential duties of our Federal Government, and it illustrates the  working application of the checks and balances dynamic.   Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution provides that the  President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of  the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and  Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court'' and others. This provision  interlocks the executive branch with the legislature. Neither can  succeed without the other. At its best, this is a partnership  functioning well. At its worst, either side can deny the other's  success.   One popular but misguided criticism made of Judge Kavanaugh centers  around his academic study of the separation of powers in our Federal  system. In one scholarly writing, he explores the legal structures of  our government and the dangers presented by over-politicizing the  relationship between the branches. He describes the enormous challenges  faced by President Clinton and President Bush in carrying out their  constitutional duties while political difficulties swirled about them  and the impact that had on the efficient administration of government.   Much hyperbole has been spoken about Judge Kavanaugh's keen  observations. Whether you find yourself on the political right or the  left, few would dispute his central point--that a government system  rendered inoperative benefits no one. To quote Alexander Hamilton in  Federalist Paper No. 70, ``A feeble Executive implies a feeble  execution of the government.'' Judge Kavanaugh offers a number of  options for the political branches of government to explore and points  out the pros and cons of them. The opposite view held by Judge  Kavanaugh's critics is, then, by extension, the status quo of  Washington's dysfunction.   As a jurist, in his legal opinions, Judge Kavanaugh has consistently  demonstrated a willingness to reign in both Congress and the Executive  when they overstep their constitutional bounds. In a town where  acquiring power seems ingrained, having a judge committed to preserving  the constitutional function of each branch cannot be overstated. Yet  some would have you believe that Judge Kavanaugh's understanding of the  proper operation of our system of government is a threat to the very  Republic and disqualifying to serve on our highest Court. I disagree.  His analysis is insightful and should be eagerly embraced by civic  students throughout the country.   In the weeks since President Trump nominated Judge Kavanaugh for the  Court, special interests have kicked into overdrive, peddling one  imagined conspiracy after another. Variously, I have heard people  suggest that Judge Kavanaugh is a threat to the people of every race,  creed, gender, and age. Some have even unleashed prophecies of biblical  gloom and doom awaiting the confirmation of a Justice Kavanaugh. Still  others have called on opponents of Judge Kavanaugh's to use every  possible tool to stop his confirmation, including the extreme step of  shutting down the government should things not go their way. So, facing  a nominee with impeccable credentials, opponents must imagine a  boogeyman. Fortunately, people see past those attacks because they are  the same attacks they lobbed when President Bush nominated Justice  Souter and when President Reagan nominated Justice Kennedy.   Failing at that, some opponents of Judge Kavanaugh's are hoping to  demand an endless stream of documents to delay confirmation proceedings  indefinitely. These opponents claim that the process is unfair and  lacks transparency, when in reality the opposite is true.   As Chairman Grassley of the Judiciary Committee so eloquently pointed  out at a recent Senate Judiciary meeting, none of these criticisms hold  any weight.   There will have been 57 days between the announcement of Judge  Kavanaugh's nomination and the date of his confirmation hearing--a  longer period than Senators had for Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and  Gorsuch. Judge Kavanaugh has submitted more than 17,000 pages with his  bipartisan Judiciary Committee questionnaire, which is the most  extensive questionnaire ever sent a nominee. The committee has also  received hundreds of thousands of pages of documents from Judge  Kavanaugh's service in the executive branch. This, too, is already more  than any Supreme Court nominee before him, and documents are continuing  to be sent to the committee for review. Chairman Grassley is working  tirelessly to make the vast majority publicly available as quickly as  possible, and I appreciate and applaud his transparency.   I recognize the politics and the purpose behind these creative but  misguided attacks, and so does the American public.   Judge Kavanaugh's experience and legal background are not in dispute.  His readiness for the Supreme Court is not contested. His law clerks  vouch for him. Lawyers who argue before him commend him for his  judgment, his fairness, and his temperament. His peers admire and  respect his intellect and draw regularly from his opinions. In short,  he is a judge's judge. In fact, nearly every one of his former clerks  signed a letter extolling the qualifications that he has, his virtues,  and his temperament. So widespread was the support of their former  mentor that only those who were prohibited by their employer from  signing were left off.   Newspaper editorial boards from across the country have endorsed his  nomination. Here are just some of the dozens of glowing testimonials  about Judge Kavanaugh:   The Wall Street Journal:         Judge Kavanaugh has an exemplary record that suggests he       will help to restore the Supreme Court to its proper, more       modest role in American politics and society. . . . He has       the experience and intellect to be a leader on the Court, not       merely a predictable vote on this or that issue.    The Detroit News:         Brett Kavanaugh's credentials, his commitment to judicial       independence, his unassailable character, his record as a       judge dedicated to the Constitution and his likability should       overwhelm the Senate skeptics who will be tempted to oppose       him simply because he was appointed by Trump.    The Richmond Times-Dispatch:         If one were to create an ideal resume for the position of       Supreme Court justice, it would not look terribly different       from Brett Michael Kavanaugh's curriculum vitae. President       Trump's nominee to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy is more       than qualified for the job. . . . Indeed, Kavanaugh's       qualifications are impeccable--unfortunately, that won't stop       him from being lambasted by the opposition on the left       concerned about his conservative values.    The Las Vegas Review-Journal:         Judge Kavanaugh is imminently accomplished. . . . Judge       Kavanaugh is firmly in the judicial mainstream, although       Democrats will no doubt try to twist him into a rabid,       dangerous extremist. He is, in fact, a  [[Page S5743]]       constitutionalist who believes that judges should follow the       nation's founding document rather than interpret law to       achieve desired ends.    The Lowell Sun in Massachusetts:         What Democrats cannot question is Brett Kavanaugh's       credentials. . . . After all the drama and histrionics,       sensible Democrats should put politics aside and vote to make       him the ninth member of the Supreme Court.    Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most qualified nominees ever for the  Supreme Court. He has been nominated to succeed Justice Kennedy, a man  for whom he once clerked and called a ``mentor.'' With over 300  authored opinions and 12 years of service on the bench, he is a judge  with a clear record demonstrating that he applies the law as written  and enforces the Constitution. He values precedent and wrote, along  with Justice Gorsuch and others, ``The Law of Judicial Precedent,'' a  scholarly piece on the importance of stare decisis.   Many critics argue that a Justice Kavanaugh would likely be the key  to unlocking any number of Supreme Court precedents. I wonder, though,  how many have actually read this book and understand that he is someone  who has given exhaustive and weighty consideration to important legal  questions. But we should take him at his own words:         The judge's job is to interpret the law, not to make the       law or make policy. So read the words of the statute as       written. Read the text of the Constitution as written,       mindful of history and tradition. Don't make up new       constitutional rights that are not in the text of the       Constitution. Don't shy away from enforcing constitutional       rights that are in the text of the Constitution.    Judge Kavanaugh is a respected jurist with a sterling reputation for  intellectual rigor and attention to legal detail. He understands the  proper role of a judge in our legal system--to fairly interpret the  law, not create it. He thinks deeply about the legal questions before  him and strives to build consensus on the court.   As stated by his former law clerks, ``Judge Kavanaugh never assumes  he knows the answers in advance and never takes for granted that his  view of the law will prevail.'' He actively solicits views from all  sides of the argument--all the better to form a lasting and well- reasoned opinion.   I look forward to the Senate Judiciary Committee's upcoming hearings,  when the public can hear directly from Judge Kavanaugh, in his own  words, the proper role of a judge in our legal system. I am confident  Judge Kavanaugh will demonstrate the rigorous intellect, the fealty to  law, and the judicial temperament that have long defined his career on  the bench.   Thank you.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today, I wish to salute Ken Flanz, my  longtime legislative director and senior-most legislative policy  adviser who is retiring from the Senate, for his nearly 30 years of  devoted congressional service.   Next month, he joins his loving wife, Meghan, in her hometown in  southern California. I was honored to attend their wedding in 2003 at  St. John's Church near the White House, with their families and  friends.  [[Page S5756]]    Ken has been an integral part of my legislative team since he became  part of my staff in 1997 during my service in the U.S. House of  Representatives. He joined my staff after working for former  Representative Martin Hoke, from 1993-1997 and former Representative  Bill McCollum, from 1990-1991. His tenure on Capitol Hill has a wide  range, having worked in both legislative bodies, in every Congress  stretching back to the 101st Congress, five Presidential  administrations, leadership shifts, and staff changes. His integrity,  dedication, and longevity have served my State and our Nation well  throughout.   Beyond his leadership on my senior management team, Ken has taken on  tremendous responsibilities, as I have counted on him to cover many  different issues over the years. He has been a trusted counsel,  providing detailed work and advancing my policy agenda on diverse  matters, including appropriations, international trade, intelligence,  foreign affairs, energy, the environment, government reform, and the  Federal judiciary. This includes his work covering my role as a  Commissioner on the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and  Reform and leadership with the Canada-U.S. Interparliamentary Group for  many years. Ken understands the nuance, skill, and discretion needed to  effectively navigate work with other countries and differing  viewpoints, and he has taken on the challenges with tact and diplomacy.   Ken also assisted with my assignments on at least six committees,  including Senate Finance; Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs;  Senate Environment and Public Works; Senate Judiciary; Senate Indian  Affairs; and the Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer  Pension Plans. During my tenure in the House, he also assisted me on  the House Energy and Commerce and Agriculture Committees.   He has always been ready and able to fill gaps and cover what needs  to be done as he has supported and filled out the staff. In addition to  his principal issue assignments, he has covered taxes, healthcare, and  education when staff vacancies occurred or the need required. Simply  put, the complete list of policy issues he has handled throughout his  time in Congress is extensive and likely too long test.   Ken can also point to achievements in helping me enact legislation  relating to environmental protections, defense initiatives, Tribal  sovereignty, land conveyances, and delivering assistance to Idaho  communities and institutions. He was also instrumental in advancing and  confirming executive branch and judicial branch nominees important to  Idaho.   As legislative director, Ken has managed, led, and mentored over five  dozen legislative team members and agency fellows. He has trained and  guided so many young legislative minds into successful careers and  shared his consummate understanding of the legislative process and  policy efforts.   It is telling on how much Ken has valued his relationship and  mentorship with those on his staff when he requested, as a farewell  gesture, photos with each one who could be available during his last  month in my office. Without exception, they all trust and admire Ken  and point to his guidance as part of their successes today.   He has an extraordinary depth of knowledge and understanding that has  been invaluable and will be deeply missed in and beyond the Senate  community where he has worked with many colleagues over the years. As a  Stennis Congressional Fellow and a Woodrow Wilson Foreign Policy  Fellow, Ken deepened his knowledge and skills that have made him  effective in his commitment to serve the public.   I extend my deep gratitude to you, Ken, for the more than 21 years  you have devoted to serving as member of my staff and the 28 years you  have worked in Congress. Thank you for your thoughtful guidance all of  these years. I wish you and Meghan all the best as you head West and  start your next chapter.                            ____________________
