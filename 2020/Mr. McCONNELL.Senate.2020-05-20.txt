 Madam President, week after week, this Capitol has  been a study in contrasts. Call it the tale of two Chambers. Over here  in the Senate, the lights are on, the doors are open, and we are  working for the American people. All month, we have been in session,  passing national security legislation, confirming key nominees, and  holding hearings on the coronavirus crisis and the effectiveness of the  historic rescue package the Senate wrote and the Senate passed.   We are heeding medical guidance and taking new precautions, but we  are showing up and getting things done.   Over across the Rotunda, in the House, crickets--their lights are  off. The doors are locked. The people's House has shown up for a grand  total of 2 legislative session days since March. Well, 2 days in 8  weeks is a blistering pace.   Last week, they flew into town to pass Speaker Pelosi's latest 1,800- page liberal wish list. Diversity and inclusion in the marijuana  industry wasn't going to study itself, after all. That had to be an A-1  priority during this crisis. The Speaker's proposal was so unserious  and so far left that it could not even unite her own conference. Even  after a 2-month sabbatical, House Democrats could not contribute  anything serious.   Yet they did find the time to keep fishing for another impeachment.  More than a year after the Mueller report thoroughly debunked the  collusion conspiracy theory, Democrats are still pursuing the  administration in court over that document. In a new Supreme Court  brief the day before yesterday, House Democrats said they have the  right to continue because--listen to this--the President's impeachment  did not actually end with his acquittal.  [[Page S2512]]    The House Democrats are now claiming the impeachment that ended in  February is not really over. Their brief says they are weighing  ``whether to recommend new articles of impeachment.'' And referring to  Chairman Nadler's Judiciary Committee, ``the Committee's investigation  did not cease with the conclusion of the impeachment trial.'' That is  Chairman Nadler's argument in a court case.   Perpetual investigation and perpetual impeachment--if only someone  could have predicted this. If only anyone had warned that House  Democrats' opening the Pandora's box of weak impeachments would affect  our country into the future. Of course, Senate and House Republicans  warned precisely that, and here we are.   It is a suitable complement to the other ongoing incident, where a  Federal judge has taken it upon himself to prolong a case that the  actual prosecutors want to drop.   These are fascinating legal standards. Investigations no longer end  when a jury acquits someone and prosecutions no longer end when charges  are dropped. The House Democrats would rather spend a fourth  consecutive year trying to cram their politics into the legal system  than actually govern the country during a pandemic   Fortunately, as I laid out, the Senate is up to the job. Every single  day, the historic CARES Act that we wrote and passed to fight this  pandemic continues to come online. Direct payments hit families'  accounts. Support for major industries helps to prevent mass layoffs.  Resources for doctors, nurses, hospitals, and healthcare providers help  to stabilize the system from coast to coast.   The Paycheck Protection Program has saved tens of millions of jobs  for American workers. From big cities to small towns, to industrial  suburbs, to farm country, Senate Republicans' bold program is turning  potential pink slips into paychecks every single day.   To be sure, the program is imperfect. That was guaranteed when banks  had to cram multiple years' worth of lending into a few weeks.  Yesterday, we saw a glaring example of that imperfection. The  legislation we passed contains specific eligibility requirements. One  rule said affiliates of national nonprofits could not pose as small  nonprofits and ask for money. But because time was and is of the  essence, the legislation set up a process of initial self-certification  with review to follow, rather than lengthy vetting upfront that would  have slowed the emergency money for rightful recipients.   We learned yesterday that the Nation's largest abortion provider,  Planned Parenthood, abused this emergency process and grabbed tens of  millions of dollars of taxpayer money for which they were completely  ineligible. This is the organization that fired its new president last  year because she was too focused on broader health issues and not  sufficiently fixated on abortion above all else. Disrespecting human  life is their central mission, and they just took advantage of a  national crisis and helped themselves to tens of millions of taxpayer  dollars they were clearly forbidden from taking.   It goes without saying that the money must be sent back immediately-- right now. As we shine a light on Planned Parenthood's  misrepresentations, we cannot let their actions jeopardize this  important program with the tens of millions of Americans who are  benefiting from it rightly.   Remember, the PPP has pushed $500 billion into the economy across  more than 4 million loans. The average loan size is just $118,000,  giving paychecks instead of pink slips for tens of millions of  Americans.   My hometown of Louisville, KY, is home to the baseball bat factory  that makes the world-famous Louisville Slugger. For a few months, the  bat factory was a temporary casualty of COVID-19. This month, the  manufacturer secured a PPP loan, and 171 employees were pulled off  furlough and put right back on the payroll. So 171 family stories went  from pain and chaos back to stability because of this program. That is  just one business in one city in one State.   There is also an automotive parts supplier and a hoagie shop in  Michigan, a fresh flower shop in Arizona, a burger joint and a  community nonprofit in North Carolina, and on and on and on. Four  million loans across all 50 States and new loans are still being issued  as we speak. This is what serious legislation looks like. This is what  serious solutions can accomplish.   Every day, the Senate's work is paying dividends to working families  all across our country.   The pandemic is not all we are working on. The Senate is also staying  on top of foreign relations, national security, and the personnel  business.   Yesterday, the Intelligence Committee reported out the nomination of  the next Director of the National Intelligence. The Armed Services  Committee reported out nominations for Secretary of the Navy, Chief of  Staff of the Air Force, and Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for  Policy.   I hope our Democratic colleagues will not block the Senate from  filling these key national security vacancies before we adjourn later  this week.                            ____________________     Madam President, throughout this health crisis, the  Senate, its Members, and our staffs have been lucky to have the steady  leadership of Dr. Brian Monahan in our corner. Our Attending Physician  has responded with the same ability and professionalism that have  benefited Congress and the Supreme Court for more than a decade. His  continued guidance is making it possible for the Senate to smartly and  safely fulfill our constitutional duty to the American people.   The last time our Nation faced a pandemic on this scale, the 1918  Spanish flu, the Attending Physician's office was still more than a  decade away from even existing. Dr. Monahan has had to break  unprecedented ground in his crucial role on multiple levels, but, true  to form, he has adapted on the fly to serve his country.   Dr. Monahan has developed detailed advice for Members and committees.  His team is working around the clock to answer questions and to keep us  healthy. Expertise and attention to detail are nothing new from our  Attending Physician, who has spent a proud career in military service.  The Senate is lucky that the public service of this decorated rear  admiral and celebrated instructor has brought him to us. We certainly  are grateful to him and his entire team.   I am happy to report that we aren't the only ones taking notice.   Mr. President, as a measure of our collective gratitude, I ask  unanimous consent that this recent New York Times feature profile of  Dr. Monahan be printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, May 16, 2020]   Doctor to Congress and Supreme Court Toils To Sidestep Politics Amid                                  Pandemic                            (By Emily Cochrane)         Washington--When Senator John Barrasso, Republican of       Wyoming, sought guidance on how to protect his family,       including his 94-year-old father-in-law, when he returned       home from the nation's capital amid the coronavirus pandemic,       a doctor offered him some blunt advice.        Don't go home just yet, Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending       physician of Congress, told Mr. Barrasso, directing him to       quarantine for 14 days before rejoining his family. ``You're       a visitor,'' Dr. Monahan said.        But when House Democratic leaders wanted counsel on whether       they could safely reconvene in the Capitol with Covid-19       still spreading--a debate with political dimensions as a       partisan divide was emerging across the country over how       quickly to reopen--Dr. Monahan was less absolute. Returning       to Washington carried health risks he would not recommend       taking, he told Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and       Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority       leader. But it was up to them to decide what to do.        They opted to delay their return, and on Friday, partly       because of Dr. Monahan's warnings, moved forward with plans       to institute remote voting in the future.        It was typical of Dr. Monahan, the 59-year-old Navy rear       admiral who is known in the halls of the Capitol as much for       his meticulous attention to medical detail as he is for his       efforts to stay completely out of politics.        ``He is both an executive with lots of health care       responsibilities--particularly now--and also has the unique       relationship with members that a small-town doctor would have       with the patients he knows and sees,'' said Senator Roy       Blunt, Republican of Missouri and chairman of the Senate       Rules Committee. ``He's in a unique role at a unique time''        As government doctors have emerged as trusted public voices       and political figures in the face of a fearsome pandemic--      appearing  [[Page S2513]]       in White House news conferences and as witnesses at marquee       hearings--Dr. Monahan has maintained an uncommonly low       profile.        He never issued a public statement offering his opinion on       whether Congress should reconvene, although he shared his       warnings with House leaders and privately told senior       Republican officials that his office did not have the       capacity to screen all 100 senators for the coronavirus when       they returned to work. When Alex M. Azar II, the health       secretary, said he would send 1,000 tests to Capitol Hill to       accommodate them, Ms. Pelosi and Senator Mitch McConnell,       Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, turned down       the offer, wary of the optics of receiving special treatment       at a time when testing was scarce--and prompting President       Trump to suggest on Twitter that ``maybe you need a new       Doctor over there.''        Dr. Monahan, who declined to be interviewed, has been a       calm and professional voice of reason during the pandemic,       according to interviews with more than two dozen lawmakers,       Capitol officials and medical professionals who know him.       They say he has taken a personal interest in his influential       clientele, which also includes the nine Supreme Court       justices, even as he fields politically charged questions       about reopening, testing and precautionary measures.        Operating out of a nondescript clinic tucked away in the       heart of the Capitol, Dr. Monahan and a small staff have been       exceedingly busy since the pandemic took hold, consulting       with lawmakers who have contracted Covid-19 or exposed to       someone infected with it, doling out health recommendations       in detailed memos ahead of votes, and producing a series of       videos released on an internal website to educate lawmakers       and their staff on how to protect themselves.        Dr. Monahan has filmed and produced the videos by himself       in his office, often seated next to an elaborate bouquet of       white flowers and a tiny plastic model of a pangolin, the       scaly mammal that may have been an intermediary carrier of       the virus.        In the videos, he typically walks through the most recent       recommendations offered by the Centers for Disease Control       and Prevention and demonstrates medical equipment, such as a       thermometer and a variety of masks (including one made by his       wife, using a black shopping bag and a sewing machine).        ``He has a big job--two houses of Congress, two parties to       deal with--but he's not political in any way,'' Ms. Pelosi       said. ``He treats us all with respect, and we respect his       judgment in return.''        Dr. Monahan in 2009 became the seventh man to serve as       attending physician, taking up a position that has always       been held by a Navy doctor. The House first approved a Navy       officer to work out of the Democratic cloakroom in 1928 after       one lawmaker died and two collapsed, with several hours       passing before a doctor could arrive in each case. Two years       later, the Senate extended that doctor's jurisdiction to       include its own members, leading to the establishment of the       Office of the Attending Physician.        The office provides care to lawmakers for a fee, as well as       offering some services and emergency care to staff and       tourists. The first physician, Dr. George W. Calver, who       began his work just before the start of the Great Depression,       displayed placards in cloakrooms and elevators across the       Capitol with his nine ``Commandments of Health,'' including       ``Accept Inevitables (don't worry)'' and ``Relax       Completely.''        Dr. Monahan was born in Connecticut, the son of Irish       immigrants who came to the United States in the 1950s. His       mother grew up in Kilkee, while his father grew up in a house       with a thatched roof without running water or electricity in       Lissycasey. The first in his family to attend college, he       worked full-time at a supermarket while commuting in a yellow       Volkswagen Beetle to Fairfield University, a Jesuit college--      an education, he would tell graduates in 2011, that meant,       ``you are called to be `men and women for others.' ''        He studied biology and chemistry, and after graduating,       joined the Navy through its Health Professions Scholarship       Program, enticed in part by the offer of free tuition and a       living allowance in exchange for a commitment to three years       of service.        ``Brian was always the smartest kid in the class,'' said       Dr. William Dahut, a medical oncologist who spent time with       him in both medical school and the Navy. ``If there was a       publication or data, Brian knew that data and knew that       well.''        In 1989, as a resident in the cardiology ward in what was       then the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., he       treated a 39-year-old woman for potentially fatal cardiac       arrhythmias. The patient had taken the popular antihistamine       Seldane, and his contribution to research on that medicine--      and its connection to the arrhythmias--later helped lead to       its removal from the market.        Dr. Monahan rose through the ranks of the Navy, becoming a       professor of medicine and pathology at the Uniformed Services       University of the Health Sciences in Maryland, as well as       participating in a number of national organizations related       to cancer, oncology and hematology.        While serving as the Chairman of the Department of Medicine       at the university, he received a call for a meeting in which       officials with congressional leadership asked him to become       the attending physician on Capitol Hill when his predecessor       retired.        He has since become a fixture on Capitol Hill,       participating in congressional trips and functions and       releasing health assessments for presidential and vice-      presidential contenders, including Senators Bernie Sanders,       the Vermont independent, and Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia.       (Mr. Kaine also asked him for ``a tuneup'' before hiking the       Virginia section of the Appalachian Trail.)        In 2016, it was Dr. Monahan's assessment of Justice Antonin       Scalia's health at the time of his death--including sleep       apnea, coronary artery disease, obesity and diabetes--that       influenced the decision to decline an autopsy of the justice,       The Associated Press reported at the time.        ``He was the one who advised me to go to the hospital,''       said Representative Ben McAdams, Democrat of Utah and one of       the first lawmakers to contract the virus, said of Dr.       Monahan. ``He was clear: `I strongly recommend you go to the       hospital--this is serious.' ''        The congressman has spoken with the doctor at least a dozen       times since, he said in an interview on Thursday--but had yet       to meet Dr. Monahan in person.        An avid photographer, Dr. Monahan's photos are present in       offices around the Capitol--and he has been known to offer       advice on how to best capture a scenic landmark or vista on       trips overseas.        He checks in with his powerful patients frequently,       including long after they have recovered.        ``I've been around for a long period of time, and he just       takes more of a personal interest than anyone else I've ever       known in that position,'' said Senator James M. Inhofe,       Republican of Oklahoma and chairman of the Senate Armed       Services Committee, who has been on Capitol Hill for more       than three decades. ``He just seems to be genuinely       interested in me--and he's that way with everybody.''    Madam President, we thank the good doctor for all he  does for this institution and for his country.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
