 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, one of the  bills in question--specifically, H.R. 478, would direct the Secretary  of the Interior to take 55.3 acres of land owned by the Gila River  Indian Community into trust.   The Gila River Indian Community Reservation is already 583 square  miles, with a population of 11,000. The Gila River Indian Community  already owns this land, so why we need to take more land into trust and  have the Federal Government more involved in the management of the land  is not immediately obvious or apparent to me. The answer is not at all  clear as to why it needs to be in trust.   Trust land responsibilities for the Federal Government are  significant and before we expand the size of our trust lands, we have  to have an understanding of what we are doing and the actual need to do  it  [[Page S3851]]    Proponents of this legislation have claimed that the Tribe has a  unique history with this particular plot of land--this particular 55.3  acres of land--adjacent to the trust land. But from the history shown,  the Tribe's interaction with the land is mostly that they have had  friendly neighbors with whom they have traded goods.   As many of my colleagues are aware, I have great concerns that I have  quite consistently expressed with further expanding the Federal  Government's management or involvement in public lands, including trust  lands.   Nevertheless, I have been engaging in negotiations, and I have made a  number of good-faith efforts to develop a possible path forward--one in  which the amount of acreage owned or held in trust by the Federal  Government would not grow, while taking this land into trust for the  Gila River Indian Community. While I continue to negotiate a path  forward, I am not inclined to abandon this concern. This is a  negotiation that has been in progress.   That said, with respect to the part of the request dealing  specifically with S. 789, the RESPECT Act, I am willing to let that go.  But if the request is to pass both of these by unanimous consent, I  can't support that, and on that basis, I object.    I fully am amenable to that, with the RESPECT Act                            ____________________     Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I just want to  reiterate again what we have dealt with.   As originally introduced, the bill was 160 pages. Yes, it ran through  committee. Then it went out of committee, and it was reported out by  the committee at 730 pages. Then you had the May 19 substitute--1,445  pages--and you had a substitute today that took it up to over 2,300  pages. Then at 10:59 p.m., just a little over an hour and a half ago,  we received notice of this managers' package. The list that we received  is a simple list of numbers attached to last names. It doesn't contain  the text of those; it just contains references back to other  amendments--10:59 p.m. We still don't know exactly how long that is.    Yet people are fond of saying, well, as I believe my colleague from  Washington said a minute ago, people have been talking about this for  hours. What does that even mean? It is not the same as presenting an  amendment, saying this will be presented as a package.   Keep in mind, these aren't just mere sequential pages, pieces of  paper. Every time you add another piece of paper, every time you add an  amendment, it  [[Page S3864]]  gets a lot more complicated because you have to know not just what each  page says but how it interacts with every other page.   Although this is how it came out of committee, this is the rest of  the bill as it existed as of early this morning. As of this afternoon,  we added about another 900 pages to it. Then at 10:59, again, just  about an hour and a half ago, we received an as-yet-to-be-ascertained  managers' package that we still haven't seen in its entirety. We have  just seen a list, and we are told that we have to vote on that right  now.   Look, the American people understand that when you are throwing  around hundreds of billions of dollars at a time, we really have an  obligation to know what on Earth we are voting for. We don't know that.  We can't credibly maintain that. We certainly shouldn't pretend to be  competent to understand everything that is in here.   I find it absolutely stunning--I find it disappointing more than  anything that in response to the very reasonable request made by my  friend and distinguished colleague from Wisconsin to give us 3 hours to  look at it, that even that was too much.   This, Mr. President, is too much for the American people, and I  object.
