 Mr. Speaker, last Friday, the Nunes memo was  released over the objections of the FBI, the Department of Justice,  Democratic Members of the House Intelligence Committee, and several  Republican Senators. This selectively edited document was political in  nature from the outset, as is evident in the gap between what some of  my colleagues claimed it contained and what the memo actually says.   The Nunes memo focuses on the most recent warrants for surveillance  of Carter Page, who has reportedly been  [[Page H765]]  under watch since 2013 for his relationship with the Russian  Government, years before his involvement with the Trump campaign. Yet  this document in no way questions those facts, while new reporting has  since revealed that Mr. Page boasted of his role as a Kremlin adviser  as far back as 5 years ago, when the first FISA warrants against him  were reportedly issued.   As Oversight Chairman Gowdy has noted, the Nunes memo has no impact  on the Russia probe, and Special Counsel Mueller's work must continue  unabated to allow the American public to know the full truth.                            ____________________
