 Mr. Speaker, this rule is a travesty. If we vote to  approve it, an amendment unanimously supported by the Armed Services  Committee--unanimously, all Democrats and all Republicans would  compromise language--to prevent President Trump from using our  military's money to build his border wall will suddenly vanish. It is a  legislative magic trick, a sneaky gimmick designed to disguise their  actions.   Once again, Speaker Ryan and the House Republicans are doing  President Trump's dirty work. They want to make sure that Trump can  build his wall, but they are also desperate to avoid a clean up-or-down  vote on this issue. They are hiding from the American voters.   They didn't have the courage to oppose my amendment in committee or  even on the House floor. They passed this rule late at night with  hardly anyone watching, in typical Republican fashion.   Republicans are resorting to deceptive legislative tactics to do  Trump's bidding just for his small, fragile ego.   Mr. Speaker, this self-executing rule, if it comes to fruition, is  going to attempt to slip one past Congress and the American people.   Just 6 months into this administration, it is already abundantly  clear that Mexico won't pay for Trump's stupid, dumb border wall. We  must not allow precious resources to be robbed from our troops simply  to score political points for Trump's ego.   Mr. Speaker, with Mexico refusing to entertain this absurd policy and  without a direct appropriation from Congress, President Trump is going  to get desperate. His administration will inevitably seek to pull money  from other sources to make good on his promise to build this wall,  including from the Defense budget.   That is why my amendment was so crucial. It would simply ensure that  DOD resources aren't siphoned off for a pointless wall that we don't  need and cannot afford. It was supported by Democrats and Republicans  alike, the ranking member and the chairman.   As a Member of Congress, we have a sacred responsibility to ensure  that money meant to address real national security challenges isn't  diverted to combat imaginary ones that the President has created.                                time  1300    As a Marine Corps veteran, I believe it would be an insult to our  members of the military if their resources were reallocated to build a  wall that we don't need, that won't bring us more security, when we  have tens of thousands of military members that are currently still on  food stamps while serving this country.   Mr. Speaker, make no mistake: a vote for this rule is a vote to build  the wall and take precious resources from the Department of Defense  budget. Please vote ``no.''
