 DOYLE of Pennsylvania led the Pledge of Allegiance as  follows:         I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of       America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation       under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.                            ____________________     DOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, millions of  Americans are suffering from skyrocketing prescription drug prices.  They have to choose between medicine and food, or rent, or utility  bills. People are actually dying because they have been forced to skip  or reduce doses.   Prices aren't soaring because of the cost of developing prescription  drugs. Some of these drugs are decades old. No. Prices are soaring  because drugmakers are jacking up prices wherever and whenever they can  to maximize their profits. And they can do this because the United  States is the only country in the world that subsidizes research on new  drugs and then refuses to negotiate with drugmakers for lower prices.   This is insane. Americans shouldn't be dying because drug companies  want bigger profits.   I am supporting H.R. 3 because it will allow Medicare to negotiate  drug prices, cap annual price increases, and set out-of-pocket maximums  for seniors.   It is way past time Congress allowed Medicare to negotiate for lower  drug prices. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3 to lower  drug costs now.
