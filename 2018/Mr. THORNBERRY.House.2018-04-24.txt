 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2809, the  American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act. I believe that this bill  strikes the right balance between supporting American innovation in  space while addressing the potential national security concerns related  to emerging space-based remote sensing capabilities.   It is not in our interest to overregulate emerging innovative space  companies and drive them overseas to be licensed. We saw this happen  with the synthetic aperture radar market, which fled to Europe in the  1990's, and our domestic market for that technology is still suffering  the consequences.  [[Page H3488]]    But we also cannot allow the physical security and operational  success of our warfighters to be jeopardized by new commercial  technologies. Technologies such as commercial signals intelligence and  space-based radio frequency mapping may contribute to the ability of  our adversaries to more accurately track our forces as they execute  their missions abroad.   We need to acknowledge the risks posed by these emerging technologies  and allow the Department of Defense to have a role in addressing any  national security threat posed by commercial remote sensing, space- based radio frequency mapping, and commercial signals intelligence.   This bill strikes a good balance in two core principles of American  free enterprise--promoting innovation and protecting our national  security. As it moves through the process, it may be that additional  concerns may rise or be dispelled. The full range of national security  concerns must be taken into account when making certification or  licensing decisions for commercial remote sensing satellites. It is  important that all relevant committees, including the House Armed  Services Committee, be involved at each step to ensure that the  totality of American national interest is promoted.   I would like to particularly thank Chairman Lamar Smith for his  vision and for his patience in working through the variety of issues  related to this legislation. The Congress will miss his leadership and  good nature in the years to come.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        April 24, 2018, on pages H3487-H3488, the following text block  appeared in Ionic typeface:  Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of H.R. 2809, the American Space Commerce Free Enterprise  Act.
