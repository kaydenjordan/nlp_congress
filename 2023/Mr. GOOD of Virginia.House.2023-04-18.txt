 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia  for his leadership on this critically important issue.   You might say what the House of Representatives does is tax and  spend. Thankfully, we are the party that wants to tax less and spend  less, so it is a win-win for the American people, a win-win for  freedom, a win-win for Americans as a whole.   It is appropriate on this day of all days, national tax day, to be  discussing the state of our tax system. It is no secret to most  Americans that the IRS does not serve their interests and, worse yet,  frequently uses its power to target law-abiding American citizens and  conservative groups. The American people are sick and tired of dealing  with a broken, confusing, and even hostile tax system.   My office regularly hears from constituents who simply want to get an  answer from the IRS when they are trying to do their taxes or want to  know why they are forced to pay taxes for things such as an inheritance  from their loved ones.   Rather than take a hard look at the current situation, the Biden  administration has made it clear they want to further weaponize the IRS  against hardworking Americans by spending $80 billion to hire an  estimated 87,000 new agents to harass, intimidate, and threaten  taxpayers.    In fact, in Virginia's Fifth District, one of the things I commonly  hear is what we need more of is IRS agents. Of course, I have never  heard that in Virginia's Fifth District.   The American people deserve a better tax system that does not  needlessly target them or even punish them for doing their best to work  hard, put food on the table, and comply with an ever-more-complicated  tax code.   The addition of these 87,000 IRS agents should raise alarm bells for  all Americans since the IRS and its employees regularly do not follow  the limits of their lawful directive. We can point to example after  example.   As a matter of fact, just last month, an IRS employee was found  guilty of three counts of wire fraud, two counts of aggravated identity  theft, five counts of aiding and assisting in the preparation and  presentation of a false and fraudulent return, and three counts of  making and subscribing a false and fraudulent tax return.   Clearly, the American people do not need a more powerful and  emboldened IRS. The current system must change, and that is where this  bill from the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) comes into play.   The FairTax Act tax system is easy to understand, and it will save  billions in compliance for taxpayers and the Federal Government. It  holds all Americans to the same standard, a 23 percent sales tax. In  doing so, Americans will not be onerously taxed on what they earn.  Instead, they pay a fair tax on what they consume. It puts Americans in  control of the taxes that they pay.   It removes the discrimination that is in the tax system because  everybody pays taxes based on what they consume. Organized crime pays  taxes. Crime cartels pay taxes. The Mafia pays taxes. Tax cheats are  paying. Under-the-table earners are paying. You get the idea.   Today, the average American worker is forced to pay the Federal  Government 33 cents of every dollar they earn as opposed to what we are  proposing today, which is the fair tax of 23 cents for every dollar  they spend if they choose to spend it.   Thanks to the prebate plan in this bill, taxpayers will be able to  spend up to the poverty guideline and have that amount be exempt from  the impact of the 23 percent tax.   Implementing this national sales tax will double the number of  taxpayers in the system. Instead of having just about 150 million  taxpayers who are currently having to pay income taxes, this would  bring about 300 million Americans as consumers into the tax revenue.  Everybody would be participating based on what they consume.   Wealthy people would pay more because they spend more and make more  expensive purchases, not to mention 51 million annual foreign tourists  and some 12 million illegal immigrants in our country, illegal aliens  who reside here.   The FairTax Act is a commonsense reform that will unburden the  American people and stimulate economic growth. Individuals will have  more control over their finances and not be threatened with penalties  or double taxation for investing and saving their own money.   Rather than guess how much you owe each year or how much the  government owes you, which a lot of us just had to do here, the FairTax  Act will enable taxpayers to know exactly how much they are paying.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend Buddy Carter for his leadership on  this that will put the American taxpayer first, unleash economic  growth, and hold everyone accountable to one simple tax requirement.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the great  Congresswoman from Illinois (Mrs. Miller), for her leadership on this  all-important issue, this all-important opportunity to discuss the  importance of faith.   We are so privileged to live in a country where our right to worship  or to not worship, our right to practice our faith or not to practice,  to believe or not to believe, is protected, literally enshrined in our  Constitution in the First Amendment to the Constitution.   Our Founders, in fact, with this wonderful, great experiment in self- rule and self-governance, in a constitutional republic, literally  sought divine intervention when they were forming this country. They  prayed together and asked for wisdom and courage. They certainly showed  that as patriots when they fought for our freedom some 250 years ago  from, at that time, the world's greatest economic and military power.  Our Founders fought for our freedom. They risked everything.   I have a painting in my office, an artist's rendering, of George  Washington, as general of the Continental Army, praying, seeking  wisdom, seeking protection, seeking courage in the battle for our  independence, for our freedom.   Then, as the Congress came together and established this country,  they sought again divine intervention. They sought wisdom. They sought  the Lord's guidance in forming this country.   Who were the Founders? Most of them were Christians. Most of them  were Bible-believing Christians. Virtually all of them believed in a  higher power, believed in a creator, believed in divine providence.   Of course, the First Amendment, the reason why it was the first  amendment, saying that Congress shall make no law establishing a  religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, the intention of  that, as they had escaped the oppression or the tyranny of England and  a monarchy where there was a blended church-state, an official state  church, they wanted the freedom from that so that everyone could again  worship as they chose, believe as they chose, practice their faith as  they chose, or do none of those things in a free country like the  United States.    Lest anyone should say, as commonly and incorrectly posited by some  today, that there is this mythical separation of church and state, the  Founders never intended that. All you have to do is read their  extraconstitutional writings to know what they intended. They were  seeking to protect the church from the government, never intending to  protect the government from the influence of the church.   That is why those very Founders, those signers of the Declaration,  many of them, are the ones who started the practice of opening Congress  every day in prayer, a practice we continue today.   Those very Founders are the ones who declared a National Day of  Prayer soon after founding this great Nation. Thankfully, that has  continued to this day.   America has been that shining city on a hill, not just because we  have been economically strong, not just because we have been militarily  strong, but as was famously said: America has been great because  America has been good.   America was founded upon Judeo-Christian principles, a belief that  our rights are God-given, God-given rights that preceded the founding  of our country, yet we are unique among the nations of the world, as  those rights are protected in this country by our Constitution.   No nation in the history of the world has ministered to more people  around the globe, has brought the Gospel to more people around the  globe, than the United States of America. No nation in the history of  the world has rescued more people, ministered to more people, and freed  more people than the United States of America. No nation in the history  of the world has been more welcoming to people from all over the globe,  immigrants from all over, to come to these shores from all ethnic  backgrounds, all nationalities, all races, and to provide more upward  mobility and opportunity than the United States of America.   I submit that is because we are founded upon Biblical principles,  Judeo-Christian principles, respect for life, respect for rule of law,  respect for God-given rights.   Again, that is protected in this country--unique among the nations of  the world in our founding, unique among the nations of world where our  rights are protected in our own Constitution.   Those rights are under assault in this country. You are seeing  increasing hostility from some on people of faith. You are seeing  protections being eliminated for individuals or businessowners to  practice their faith in the public square or to practice their faith in  the way they run their business.   You are seeing a lack of protection for people of faith from attack,  from violence, and from vandalism at places of worship or at places  like crisis pregnancy centers.   You are even seeing the Federal Government targeting people based on  their faith, as we recently saw with the FBI toward Catholics in the  city of Richmond, just 30 minutes from the outskirts of my district.   While it is still permitted in this country, we continue to open  every morning in Congress, every day in Congress, every session, with  prayer. While it is still permitted, I am going to take the opportunity  here, with the time granted to me by my friend from Illinois, to share  a little bit about my personal faith.   I am a born-again Christian. I came to know the Lord when I was 9  years old. That is when the faith that my parents had raised me in  became my own, where I personally made the decision to surrender to  Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour.   It doesn't matter what  Bob Good believes.  Bob Good has no more  right to truth or a corner on truth than anyone else does. It does  matter what the Bible says.   The Bible says, in Romans 5:8: ``But God commendeth his love toward  us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.''   God loved us so much that he sent his only son, Jesus Christ, to die  for our sins so that we could have salvation, to pay for the sins of  everyone in the world.   John 3:16 says: ``For God so loved the world that he gave his only  begotten  [[Page H1801]]  son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have  everlasting life.''   There is a reason why the protection of our faith and our religious  freedom, our right to the free exercise of our faith, is enshrined in  the First Amendment to the Constitution. What is more precious to a  person than their own belief, their own faith, their ability to  worship, their ability to assemble with other believers if they choose?  What is a more important right or a more precious freedom than that?   That is why, by the way, it is so egregious, just in the last couple  of years, where we saw the government clamp down on the ability of  people to assemble together, to worship, how they conducted their  worship, whether or not they could conduct their worship. We saw that  like no other time in the history of this country during the years 2020  and 2021, especially during the COVID years.   What an egregious violation of the right to express our faith and to  worship. We saw that on display during the 2 years when the China virus  was ravaging our country.   We kept liquor stores open. We kept casinos open. We kept other  essential places open, but we didn't keep houses of worship open. That  has done harm to our country.   I think many of us recognize that America has been blessed in large  part because of our dependence upon the Lord, our dependence on divine  intervention, our dependence on guidance from our creator, a belief we  were created unique in the image of God, created for a purpose, that  there is more to this life than just the 80 or so years that God gives  us if we live a long life.                                time  1930    There is an eternity. The most important thing in life is to be  prepared for eternity.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and my colleague from Illinois (Mrs.  Miller) for organizing, arranging, and leading on this very important  issue. I also thank her for letting me share today.
