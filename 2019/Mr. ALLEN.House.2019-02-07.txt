 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Walker for his work here  today and telling the story.   We have heard so many stories about people who have been affected by  this problem at our southern border.   My friends and colleagues continue to fight to resolve the crisis at  our southern border, end illegal immigration, and save innocent  American lives.   I would like to share the story of Eliud Montoya, a naturalized  American citizen, a hard worker, and a Georgia resident. He was  violently shot and killed in 2017 at the hands of three illegal  immigrants living just south of Georgia's 12th District.   Mr. Montoya, who worked for a tree service company, reported some  suspicious activity to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  alleging that illegal workers were being employed as a part of a scheme  to defraud that company. By doing his duty and reporting this illegal  activity to the proper authorities, Mr. Montoya was senselessly  murdered by illegal immigrants who reportedly collected more than $3.5  million of illegal profits.   Mr. Speaker, this is a very real crisis we are facing at our southern  border, and we simply cannot allow lawlessness to consume this nation.   In his State of the Union on Tuesday, President Trump said it best:  ``The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety,  security, and financial well-being of all Americans. We have a moral  duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs  of our citizens.''   Think about this, if you put in the most advanced security system in  your home, would you take down the front door?   I am 100 percent with the President.
