Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), who is my friend and the ranking member  of the Rules Committee, pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and  the underlying legislation. This rule provides for consideration of  H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of  2018; H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act of 2018; and H.R. 6756, the  American Innovation Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, just yesterday we had members of the Ways and Means  Committee and other Members who came to the Rules Committee. They came  to the Rules Committee to discuss before the committee the important  aspects of continuing the economic growth that we have currently right  now in our lifetime in the United States of America.   What a great time to be an American. Perhaps more importantly, what a  great time to look forward to a great future, a future not only where  the American Dream becomes available to each and every person, but even  if you happen to be on the lowest end of the totem pole, perhaps  beginning work today, those are the people who have benefited from not  only the tax cut that President Trump, this House, and the Republican  Senate made sure that we pass, but, more importantly, giving to the  American worker the opportunity to have, not just a sense of  accomplishment, not just a job, but potentially a career that moves  forward.   What has happened as a result of that is what brings us to where we  are here today.   They say that success has many fathers and mothers. In this case, it  is aunts, uncles, and all sorts of people, Mr. Speaker, who can proudly  look up and say: I am a part of what is probably the greatest economy  that so many people can now enjoy.   Instead of being isolated to one section of this economy, it will  abound.   You will hear me talk about even people who get up early in the  morning, early risers. I used to be one of those because I threw a  paper route. I would have to get up in the morning, and it gave me a  lot of time to think about my future as I served what was my paper  route, my small business, and my opportunity in second, third, fourth,  fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grade, as I developed myself as a  young man--not just as a Scout, to become an Eagle Scout--but as a  person who saw himself growing up in a great country, America.   That is how I developed my American Dream. I developed my American  Dream by sitting down with my family at a table and understanding  Americanism and opportunity. It was about the free enterprise system.  It was about a dream that I would have.   For too long, Mr. Speaker, we have had those in government who  controlled our lives. They controlled our lives with high taxes, more  rules and regulations, and a demand that Washington knew more about our  dream than we did.   No more, Mr. Speaker, because last December there was an  opportunity--a historic opportunity--that was seen as political because  our friends on the other side did not vote for the bill. Even today  they take advantage and talk about what are supposedly its frailties.  But the American people know differently, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, we have today in America a higher GDP rate than we do  unemployment rate. Today we have the opportunity to see that we are  going to grow that GDP by asking this Congress to make permanent that  which today is in law for only a short 10 years. We believe that what  we have done is to give the American people--even people at the lowest  end--the opportunity to take part in making America great again. At  that same time, we will make their lives so much better.   So, Mr. Speaker, what we are going to do is we are going to talk  about this today, and you will see that there are two different  visions. One vision wants to go back to higher taxation, rules and  regulations, and government control--government control not just in  taxation, but also in healthcare--and we are, as a Republican Party and  as the free enterprise party, going to stand up and say that we will be  there on behalf of all workers and that we believe that the free  enterprise system in this country has produced much that has helped so  many people.    That is how we pay for Social Security. That is how we pay for  Medicare. That is how we pay for Medicaid. It is done through more  people working, not through higher taxes, higher unemployment, and more  misery.   So, Mr. Speaker, you are going to hear today the argument that is  taking place all across this country on the floor of the House of  Representatives, and you are going to see that you, Mr. Speaker, and  every single Member, will have an opportunity to say that we believe  that the economic opportunity  [[Page H9103]]  for all Americans is equity. It is opportunity, and it is available at  not just a theater near you but in your hometown.   So we are proud of who we are.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As my colleague was talking about the dismal results, I turned to my  phone here and it is all green up and down on the stock market, because  the stock market knows that today we are talking about making permanent  the things that work for the American people; things that work well for  employers; things that work well for bringing stock market prices, not  only back, but understanding that many, many Americans and our seniors  across this country have invested in the stock market. It is up 40  percent since we have had an opportunity to pass the tax cut.    The success of the free enterprise system is what my colleagues hate.  They want to sell government, they want to sell defeat, they want to  sell  [[Page H9104]]  the things that are the fear about making progress. The facts of the  case are real simple, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from, of all places,  The New York Times, that was dated August 3 of this year. On August 3,  The New York Times, who does some inciteful reporting, said, ``Workers  Hardest Hit by Recession Are Joining in Recovery.''                  [From the New York Times, Aug. 2, 2018]          Workers Hardest Hit by Recession Are Joining in Recovery                 (By Nelson D. Schwartz and Ben Casselman)         The least educated American workers, who took the hardest       hit in the Great Recession, were also among the slowest to       harvest the gains of the recovery. Now they are a striking       symbol of a strong economy.        The unemployment rate for those without a high school       diploma fell to 5.1 percent in July, the Labor Department       reported Friday, the lowest since the government began       collecting data on such workers in 1992. At the economy's       nadir in the summer of 2009, the unemployment rate for high       school dropouts hit 15.6 percent, more than three times the       peak unemployment rate for college graduates.        Buffeted by technological change and seemingly out of place       in an economy where skills and credentials are in ever more       demand, this cohort struggled while more educated workers       scored jobs and promotions and rose on the economic ladder.        High school dropouts make up 7.2 percent of the labor       force, and some experts doubted they and other low-skilled       workers would ever fully recover from the effects of the       recession, said Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics at       the University of Michigan.        ``As economists, we worried these workers would be shut out       forever,'' she said. ``But the long duration of the recovery       has pulled them back in. As the economy adds more jobs,       employers have had to dig a little deeper.''                          reaching fuller employment         Unemployment among the least educated, the group hit       hardest in the recession, has been cut by two-thirds since       its peak of almost 16 percent in 2010.        The improvement in the fortunes of less-educated workers       was a highlight in a jobs report that showed continuing gains       across a broad variety of sectors.        Over all in July, employers increased payrolls by 157,000,       while the unemployment rate edged downward to 3.9 percent,       near the 18-year low achieved in May.        The data echoed other positive economic news recently,       including a report last week showing the economy grew by 4.1       percent in the second quarter.        And the headlines about President Trump's tariffs on steel       and aluminum and a widening trade war with China seem to have       done little to put a damper on hiring. The manufacturing       sector, which is particularly sensitive to exports, was       robust, adding 37,000 jobs.        Although the payroll increase in July was slightly below       what Wall Street was expecting, upward revisions for May and       June alleviated fears of a slowdown.        Several economists linked the shortfall to the shutdown of       Toys ``R'' Us, and the loss of 32,000 jobs at sporting goods,       book and hobby stores last month.        On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve upgraded its view of the       economy's underlying condition from ``solid'' to ``strong.''       The central bank remains on course to raise interest rates       twice more this year, in September and December, to avert       overheating.        Other indicators suggest the recovery is finally extending       its reach. The Labor Department's broadest measure of       unemployment, which includes workers forced to take part-time       jobs because full-time positions are unavailable, fell to 7.5       percent in July, the lowest since 2001.        All this has translated into better economic opportunities       for workers without a college degree, who account for a       majority of the work force. It is a contingent that was       championed by Mr. Trump during his presidential campaign, and       one that both parties want to appeal to in the midterm       elections in November.        The White House was quick to note that the economy is in       the midst of the longest monthly streak of job growth in       history.        And after 94 consecutive months of job creation, bosses and       human resource departments are recalibrating their       requirements.        ``You definitely get the sense that employers are willing       to look at workers they haven't looked at in the past,'' said       Martha Gimbel, director of economic research at Indeed.com,       the employment website.        Unemployed Americans who might not have put feelers out in       the past are also venturing back into the hunt for a job, she       said. On Indeed's search engine, much of the growth in       queries lately has been for positions like full-time cashier,       mobile home park manager, maintenance person and fulfillment       associate.        ``This is an indicator that low-skilled workers are seeing       opportunities for themselves in the labor market,'' Ms.       Gimbel said.        Until recently at Steel Ceilings in Johnstown, Ohio, the       company's president, Rick Sandor, insisted on a couple of       years' experience in metal fabrication before considering       applicants. But he's had a harder time lately finding workers       for his company, where shifts run from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. and       temporary positions start at $14 per hour.        He now settles for candidates who show mechanical skills,       like carpentry or heating and cooling repair. Mr. Sandor is       willing to waive the requirement for a high school diploma as       well and has even hired applicants with what he terms       ``minor'' prison sentences.        ``If a person was truly trying to get their life back       together, we thought it would be helpful to offer them a       job,'' he said.        Unemployment for less-skilled workers has been dropping for       several years, with a pickup in hiring in sectors like       manufacturing, construction and parts of health care. And to       be sure, the month-to-month figures for unemployment among       high school dropouts are volatile.        But the long-term trend is clear, as is hiring among the       sectors responsible for it. Last month, the leisure and       hospitality field recorded a 40,000 gain in positions, with       half of that coming from restaurants.        For example, Buffalo Wings & Rings, a restaurant chain with       60 locations in 13 states, has been stepping up hiring and       opening new restaurants.        Many outlets have seen double-digit sales growth over the       past year, and some are up as much as 40 percent, said Nader       Masadeh, the company's chief executive. The tax cuts that       took effect in January are playing a role, Mr. Masadeh said--      most families may have gotten a relatively small tax cut, but       it is enough to fuel a few more nights out.        ``People feel good. They're going out and spending more       money,'' he said. ``In our segment, $50 feeds you and your       family.''        Still, the hot economy brings challenges of its own. At an       annual gathering of the company's franchisees in June, Mr.       Masadeh said, he was bombarded with questions about how to       retain talent when workers can readily walk out the door and       find another job. And costs are rising throughout his       business.        ``Right now the economy is great, but we're also seeing       higher construction costs, higher commodity items, shortages       of labor, so there's always something that counterbalances       something else,'' he said.        That pressure, however, has not resulted in much fatter       paychecks for most workers. The Labor Department said average       hourly earnings ticked modestly higher in July, putting the       annual rise at 2.7 percent. That's below the pace of       inflation in recent months.        One reason for the lack of big raises is that a substantial       number of workers remain on the sidelines, including the       less-skilled ones who are now gradually coming back, said       Simona Mocuta, senior economist with State Street Global       Advisors.        ``We are bringing unemployment way below 4.5 percent, which       the Fed considers full employment,'' Ms. Mocuta said. ``But       we are getting very modest wage inflation. This is an issue       not just for the U.S., but in every other developed market.''        ``Because the labor market is tight, less-educated workers       have more of a chance of getting hired,'' she added. ``For       people with the highest level of education, it's easier to       find jobs even when the economy isn't doing well.''        A version of this article appears in print on Aug. 4, 2018,       on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Robust       Recovery Lifting Laborers Hit the Hardest.    All across this great Nation there are people who were  tired of the loss of jobs in this country, the movement of jobs  overseas, the continuation of a tax policy that did not allow jobs and  money that was earned by American companies to come back here.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 27, 2018, on Page H9104, the following appeared: All  across this great Nation there are people who were tired of the  loss of jobs in this country, the movement of jobs overseas, the  continuation of a tax policy that did not allow jobs and money  that was earned by American companies to come back here.      The online version has been corrected to read:  All  across this great Nation there are people who were tired of the  loss of jobs in this country, the movement of jobs overseas, the  continuation of a tax policy that did not allow jobs and money  that was earned by American companies to come back here.    ========================= END NOTE =========================   This is what we have created a change in, and this is the essence of  the argument: whether we, the free enterprise system, are going to win                   or whether it will be the government.   I think today it is obvious to the American people that the  Republican Party is on the side of the free enterprise system, small  business, entrepreneurship, and people who want to be left alone, but  make their lives work and make their communities work.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is not without notice to the American people that the  discussion may be on great economic policy that is working for people,  we are attacked here in Washington on the floor, and then the subject  changes to something else, rather than the overwhelming evidence of how  we are doing.                                time  1245    Mr. Speaker, there was a discussion I put in the Record, that New  York Times article about those at the very bottom who had been left  behind before, under the previous administration's tax increase, to  where they lost jobs because we lost jobs in America with the massive  spending spree that took place by President Obama and the Democratic  Party.   I am pleased to report not just what was said on August the 18th by  The New York Times, but even today. African American and Hispanic  unemployment rates are at some of the lowest rates that they have ever  been.   The Bureau of Labor Standards even passed out a report about the  weekly unemployment claims. Those are the claims where people who were  seeking jobs, we count those up across the country. They are at the  lowest rates since 1969. That means, even though we have a larger  amount of people in the country, a fewer numberwise--not percentage,  numberwise--are seeking unemployment compensation.   Mr. Speaker, it is working. There is success in the marketplace. What  Republicans did is so good that we want it to continue, because people  who have their jobs tend to want to protect those jobs. But the  protection of the jobs is being done by this administration to make  sure that we can sell more of our products overseas.   About 40 percent of everything made in this country is made for  export. We are for a larger export market. We are for jobs in this  country. Over $50 billion has flowed back into the United States from  overseas as a result of what we did last December 18 with the tax bill.   The overwhelming success of people back at home, wherever we are  from, is apparent. They are working. They have got an opportunity.  Their savings are increasing.   All over my hometown of Dallas, Texas, there are companies after  companies after companies after companies that have reinvested in their  businesses to make sure that not just ergonomics or new ways to  mechanize are employed in their businesses, but, actually, many  companies paid, doubling down the amount that they had contributed to a  retirement fund or to a 401(k) or to giving company stock or, as in the  case of many companies in Dallas, gave a $1,000 bonus and then said to  the employee: For the $1,000 bonus I give each of the employees, I want  you to know we are going to reinvest in making our business up to date  and better, too.   So, Mr. Speaker, no wonder--no wonder--the other side, as they come  to the table today with an equal opportunity for time, changes the  discussion point to something that is extraneous from how successful  this tax bill has been. So we will stand here until the end of our time  and say: We need to make it permanent because it works.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity for all the  lawyers in the House on the Democratic side to come down and argue  their case, but I would politely disagree with them.   The way you save this great democracy is by making it economically  sound and powerful and prepared so that we can pay for this government,  so that we can understand that America's greatest days lie in our  future, so that we can understand it is the American people who want  and need to make success, that they want their dream to succeed, not  just the government.   What we are hearing today is they have abdicated this debate today  from what was an economic debate all the way to a political debate.  Economics, you see, has that side of it where people can see what works  and what doesn't work, and that is why they have abdicated this fight  today on the floor. The fight that they thought they were bringing is  not about the success or failure of this; it is about another issue.   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is that America is economically  stronger. We have more people working today than in the history of the  country. There are companies that are making money, and there are  employees who are making money, and there are employees who are  successful.   When that happens, Mr. Speaker, you get an increase in take-home pay,  and that is also what Republicans understand about what we have done:  an increase in the amount of take-home pay to where the American people  gain benefit not just for their hard work, but for their families; to  pay for their families to be able to go to a Boy Scout outing; to make  sure they are prepared to send their children to school, so that they  can pay themselves, not looking to the government to make the payment  for them; not looking for a handout, but, rather, making sure that  people have the dignity of work, the dignity of opportunity, an honest  day's work, an honest day's pay, an opportunity for the free enterprise  system, the American Dream, to work.   That is what we are talking about today. We are talking about the  success and the limiting success. And the limiting success is, if we  make these tax policies permanent, it creates an opportunity for wiser  choices, wiser decisions, wiser long-term attributes of success, not  for the government, but for the American people.                                time  1300    And that is what the debate is on this side: helping the middle class  of this country to achieve a strong footing to where they can make  their American Dream work not only for them, but for their children and  grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the frailty of the arguments from my opponents is  staggering. The newest report out, ``the ACA healthcare market  stabilized nationwide for most customers,'' and yet we are told we are  not even funding it. It is funded by the government. It is mandatory  spending. But the good part is is that they now have an idea of who is  in the marketplace and what those correct rates are, and it is  stabilizing.   It is stabilizing because what we have done is made the opportunity  available for people to have a job to pay for their healthcare. And the  ability to have a job means that you not only have a chance to pay for  your car, your home or apartment, your daughter or your son's college,  but you also have an opportunity to pay for your own insurance, your  own healthcare, your own needs to take care of your own family.   This is where we see America, right now, has the largest number of  people who are employed in America. Every single economic and social  indicator indicates that more people at the highest level are employed.  More people at the highest level are having an opportunity to get up  and go to work, a chance to make their lives and their family better.   This is the essence of what we are talking about today: making life  better for people, giving them a better opportunity back home to have a  job that is available.   In Dallas, Texas, where I am from, last week, 2 weeks ago, we had a  seminar whereby people talked about and demonstrated what this economy  is doing. I had several employers who stood up and said to the media,  that was never reported:         We have 10 jobs that are available at a starting salary of       $60,000, but you have to be able to pass a drug test and you       have to come to work every day. We will train you. We will do       the training. We don't need the government or someone else to       do that, but you have to do two things: You have to be able       to pass the drug test, and you have got to come to work every       day, and you have got to be able to go be willing to be a       part of a team that is about your success and theirs also.    What a great deal the free enterprise offers today. Instead of us  begging for jobs and wishing they were here, they abound, Mr. Speaker.  It is called great economics. It is called making America great again.  That is why we want to make it permanent.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have one.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of song and dance on the floor, but it is  revisionist history. What some of our colleagues have forgotten is that  the African American unemployment during President Obama's Presidency  was 15.5 percent. It was called misery. It was called no job. It was  called unemployment. It was called more government assistance. It was  called, unfortunately, demise.   Mr. Speaker, what we have done by passing the tax cut is to make sure  that employers had an opportunity to hire employees. All across this  country, there is a marketplace available to people who were ready and  willing to come to work, and they have. The figures are, to us, as  Republican, normal and regular.   We were told by President Obama and Ms. Pelosi: ``We can't get the  4.2 percent GDP rate.'' That is right. You can't get to 4.2 because  your policies and procedures won't let the country do that. We are  going to be stuck in the ones.   But, Mr. Speaker, what happened is that a new energy abounded in this  country, and it is called optimism and opportunity and success and  redevelopment of ideas to bring the American spirit back to the top.  And that was, instead of Uncle Sam telling us what to do, we are  getting that opportunity to have the success back home.   That is why the largest number of African Americans ever in the  marketplace or, thereto, the largest number of women, the largest  number of Hispanics in the marketplace today. This is yet another  reason, Mr. Speaker, why Republicans are on the floor talking about the  economy and my friends are talking about another issue.   Mr. Speaker, we need to be very clear about this. I will be asking  all 435 Members of Congress, for them to see the reality and the truth  of what is available back home, and that is opportunity can abound for  a longer period of time with more success and more opportunity.   The next chance to make sure that the contract that is won by their  company or the next successful quarter or the next opportunity that  they get to get a pay raise can come because we are making sure that  the free enterprise system is sound and secure for the future.   And that is how you save Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid: by  working today and protecting American jobs. It is an effort that the  Republican Party has had, will have, has today, and we can't wait to  see the vote to see who is for the free enterprise system of seeing  that success.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the American Dream should be available to everybody:  young, old, African American, Hispanic, Native American, even those  people who have come to our shores. To make America work, American  business has to work.   Making American business work--which is why we have business schools,  why we have college-educated people, why we have entrepreneurship, why  we have small business owners, why we have people who dedicate  themselves to that free enterprise system--comes about as a result of  their opportunity to work within a series of rules, regulations, and  tax policy that is balanced.   A balanced tax policy would tell you that, if you have the highest  taxes in the marketplace, your opportunity levels diminish. Likewise,  it would say and tell you that, if you do not pay an honest day's work  for an honest day's pay, you would not have employees and would be  searching to try and make up that deficit another way.                                time  1315    Today, American business and American workers have more work than we  can get done in 1 day, and numbers of orders and opportunities for our  future abound. That is what we are here about also.   We are here about the youngest of people who we have in our midst who  are second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth grade. We are about those  people who are in college, who are studying hard because they want to  be a part of a workforce. They want to be part of making their dream  better.   But if there are no jobs, that is an indictment on this body. That is  an indictment of elected officials and of an administration, many of  them unelected, but who have a policy that fits their political  ideology, rather than what is intended for success of people back home.   Today, I am going to ask every Member of this body, and I will do it  right now, to please understand that you will have an opportunity to  vote to make what we have today even more successful for a longer  period of time; and to grow the amount of GDP; to grow the amount of  investment; to believe in the American worker; to expect the  opportunity for there to be an equal marketplace share, where the  employer and the employee can both gain, not only in the ability to pay  their own bills, but the ability to sustain what we do.   Mr. Speaker, let's not show the short side of this and talk about the  negatives or the frailties or the things that really, I don't think,  will come to bear, but let's talk about the success. The success is  that we are going to move our stock market, as it is doing today, with  the evidence that they have that we can, as a body, move our business.   Just this week, we had an opportunity to do what hadn't been done for  21 years. Those pesky Republicans in the House and the Senate and our  President are going to sign a bill funding 80 percent of the government  to avoid not just a continuing resolution, but to get it done on time,  expecting this government, in their balance, to do their job that we  have entrusted them with.   Today, we are taking part on the other part of that equation, to the  free enterprise system saying: Keep producing jobs. Keep doing the  things that small business does; whether you are in Weatherford, Texas,  and own a car dealership, and you sell your product and make it  available to customers back home, and you expect them to pay and your  product to sell and win, or whether we expect to produce products that  we sell overseas.   Mr. Speaker, it is the other half of the equation. This same week  that we gave 80 percent of the government, including the military and  Health and Human Services, the things that they have asked for and need  to produce, today, we are asking the other side of the equation, the  American people, to continue fighting, continue working, continue  believing, not only in your American Dream, but continue to believe  that the future of this country is bright and going to be successful  for you and your family.   They can drown out the detractors. They can drown out people who  brought a different idea to the table, because that brought us 15  percent unemployment for African Americans when we had a President who  claims he was there for equality also. Equality is a job and an  opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as a matter of fact, the gentleman is  correct. I will be closing for us, so anytime the gentleman chooses to  do that, he may expend his time.    Mr. Speaker, before I start, could you please advise me  on how much time remains for me.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the opportunity that we have to be on the floor today is  about one thing. They want to make it about something else, and that is  within their purview and their decision.   What it is about is whether we are going to continue to have the  highest rates of employment in this country; the highest and best  opportunity for people to continue take-home pay increases; the  opportunity for American jobs, workers, and business to have more work  than we have employees for; the opportunity to take and have, all  across this country, the opportunity for reinvestment; the opportunity  for people to be successful; the opportunity for people who are in  school today to look up and know they see a bright future.   That is the way the world sees it, at least I think we do here in  America, not in Washington. We might be a drug-free work zone up here,  but what we have is the ability for this majority to keep pushing its  opportunity for success for the American people.   So this week, we took care of making sure we fund, on time, perhaps a  little bit early, the government for next year. But we are also going  to fund the American people and the free enterprise system.   So, Mr. Speaker, what a fun day, what a great opportunity for people  all across schools, and in schools, and people who work to say, one  party is going to vote for me and one party is going to vote against  me.   I am asking every Member to do it, so that we get together on  economic outlook and view. I urge my colleagues to support the rule.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
