 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight H.R. 3816, the No  Pensions for Pedophiles Act, which I introduced in July.   This bill would require the forfeiture of Federal pensions for  individuals convicted of Federal crimes related to the sexual abuse of  children.   I was deeply disturbed to read news reports earlier this year  surrounding the conviction of Stanley Patrick Weber, a doctor at Indian  Health Service hospitals, who misused his position of trust and  responsibility to prey on vulnerable children. Inexplicably, he is set  to continue receiving his Federal pension during his 18-year prison  sentence, which could be as high as $1.8 million. He is also awaiting  trial in a second similar case.   I do not believe that taxpayers should be forced to fund the pensions  of Federal employees who have been convicted of crimes related to the  sexual abuse of innocent children, and the No Pensions for Pedophiles  Act would ensure that this practice ends.                            ____________________
