 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2382.  This legislation is a positive first step--and I emphasize first step-- to address a significantly more complex issue at hand: the financial  solvency crisis plaguing the United States Postal Service.   After a 30-year career in the Postal Service--and I think I am the  only member of Congress who is actually a letter carrier--I come to  Congress with the intention of helping USPS return to a strong  financial standing through legislative reform.   While decreased mail volume plays a role, there are other actions  Congress must take to provide the Postal Service with the flexibility  needed to reverse and mend the downward financial trend.   For the last few years, I have worked with several colleagues on the  Oversight Committee, including Representatives Connolly, Lynch,  Meadows, and the late, amazing Chairman Elijah Cummings, to  introduce comprehensive postal reform.    As the House stands poised to pass H.R. 2382, I look forward to  continuing to work with my colleagues on the committee to introduce a  comprehensive postal reform package that will provide the Postal  Service with the reform needed to help lessen the financial battle.   I want to thank Chairwoman Maloney for her leadership on this issue,  and I look forward to the continued work to build the Postal Service  Fairness Act.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I will start by thanking the leadership on the Committee on Oversight  and Reform for marking up this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3976, which would rename  a post office in my hometown of Detroit after the Queen of Soul, Aretha  Franklin. As was mentioned earlier, she was an 18 Grammy Award winner;  a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; and the first woman to be  inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.   She performed at three inaugural events for Presidents Carter,  Clinton, and Barack Obama. She was a woman who was respected on both  sides of the aisle where President Bush issued her the Medal of  Freedom.   ``A Natural Woman'' singer, she was more than just a music icon. She  was a civil rights advocate who used her platform and voice to advocate  for racial equality.   I knew her personally and she would talk to me about being a child  and having Martin Luther King in her home with her dad discussing  policies and what they were going to do to fight together for racial  equality.   In 1967, Aretha released ``Respect,'' which became a rally cry for  racial and gender political movements of the time.   Although people remember Aretha Franklin as the ``Queen of Soul'' she  was more than just a vocalist. Aretha used her platform to become a  beacon of hope for people during the civil rights movement and her  voice served as a perfect guiding light.   In 1967, she toured with Harry Belafonte and Sidney Poitier to raise  money for Dr. Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership  Conference. The organization was in a dire financial state and would  soon become the Poor People's Campaign.   In 1970, few people knew Aretha Franklin posted bond for Angela  Davis, a prominent activist who was jailed on trumped-up charges. In  1970, a Jet magazine article quoted Aretha Franklin: ``Black people  will be free. I have been locked up for disturbing the peace in Detroit  and I know you got to disturb the peace when you can't get no peace.  Jail is hell to be in. I'm going to see her free if there is any  justice in our courts . . . because she's a Black woman and she wants  freedom for Black people.''   In her 1999 autobiography, ``Aretha: From These Roots'' described the  impact Detroit had on her childhood and career. ``Detroiters realize  how deeply I appreciate the city in which I was raised. And it is in  Detroit that I continue to cultivate my career; it is to Detroit that I  direct most of my charitable activities; and it is from Detroit that I  receive much love and support, which I reciprocate.''   No matter how famous she became worldwide, Aretha always gave back to  the city she grew up in. She frequently hosted community events for  congregants in her father's church, and she donated to organizations  like Save the Children and Easterseals and supported local food banks  across Detroit.   In the year after her passing, an outpouring of support has led to  the renaming of Detroit monuments in her honor--and I am so proud and  happy to stand here today, personally knowing her, traveling with her  on her tours--to include a post office near her home in Detroit to the  list of ways to commemorate this amazing woman.   While there is little that can truly demonstrate our appreciation for  Aretha Franklin, I hope her family knows how proud and thankful we all  are for her lifelong support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to give a little support R-E-S-P-E- C-T, to this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4794) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 8320 13th Avenue in Brooklyn, New York, as the  ``Mother Frances Xavier Cabrini Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4794         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 4794, to designate the facilities of the United States Postal  Service located at 8320 13th Avenue in Brooklyn, New York, as the  Mother Frances Xavier Cabrini Post Office.   I want to thank Representative Max Rose, a fellow Member, for  introducing this bill honoring, literally, a saint. In November of  1880, Mother Cabrini, along with six other women, took religious vows  and founded the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The  purpose of the missionary was to care and educate orphans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Rose).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4981) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 2505 Derita Avenue in Charlotte, North Carolina, as  the ``Julius L. Chambers Civil Rights Memorial Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Chambers Civil Rights Memorial Post Office.   I thank Representative Alma Adams for introducing this bill to honor  Julius Chambers, a civil rights icon.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Ms. Adams).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to urge the passage of H.R. 4981.   Mr. Speaker, this is such a significant opportunity for us in  Congress to be able to recognize lifelong accomplishments that are  above the norm, people who give their lives so that their names will  never be forgotten.   It is with great honor that we recognize a queen, a saint, and now a  civil rights leader, and I urge the passage of H.R. 4981.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5037) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 3703 North Main Street in Farmville, North Carolina,  as the ``Walter B. Jones, Jr. Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

As you know, Walter Jones was born in North  Carolina and was a longtime resident of Farmville. He later graduated  from Atlantic Christian College and served 4 years in the National  Guard.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Price).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  the great State of North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I stand here today just always in awe of  the history of this House and those who have served, knowing personally  the sacrifices and the skill set that is needed to be successful. To be  able to honor one of our own is something that I support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 5037, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3317) to permit the Scipio A. Jones Post Office in Little  Rock, Arkansas, to accept and display a portrait of Scipio A.
