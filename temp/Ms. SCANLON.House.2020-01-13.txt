 Madam Speaker, I rise today to share the success of a  young constituent from my district whose story should make us all  proud.   Julia Tyler is a 24-year-old young woman with Down syndrome. Several  years ago with the support of her parents, her school district, and a  job coach, Julia was able to land a job at a local boutique in  preparation for her transition to the working world after graduation  from high school. With the help of her job coach, she began designing  totes, pillows, and table runners. She learned how to silkscreen  geometric designs onto this merchandise so she could then sell them at  the boutique where she worked and at local craft fairs. The boutique  owner took notice of Julia's creativity and determination, and together  they cofounded a new company, Dance Happy, to market Julia's creations.   In 2019, a subsidiary of American Eagle began selling Julia's totes  online for the holiday season. They quickly sold out, and a bigger  order has been placed for 2020.   I am so pleased to celebrate the success of Julia, Dance Happy, her  job coach, and her business partner at Compendium Boutique. Together  they provide an important reminder of what can happen when we look  beyond a person's disability and work together to provide opportunities  for all. I am also pleased to have a successful new business in  Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District, a business that started in  Swarthmore and is now housed in Aston, Pennsylvania.   Their success is also a great example of how the IDEA and well- funded, effective special education can prepare students with  disabilities for employment in our communities.                            ____________________
