 Madam Speaker, 10 years ago, March 2, 2009, big changes  happened back home in Sugar Land, Texas. Bill Heard Chevrolet went to  the dustbin of history. It was replaced by Classic Chevrolet. It opened  on the same lot at Southeast U.S. 59 and U.S. 90A. Don Kerstetter got  it rolling. Jeff and Tiffany Sebastian kept it rolling stronger.   In 10 years, Classic has made Sugar Land and Fort Bend County better.  In fact, they have been fully engaged in our community. A few examples:   They participate every year in an annual Classic Chevy Chili Cook- Off, raising tens of thousands of dollars for first responders;   They support local schools, the Fort Bend Education Foundation, last  Saturday, with Ray Aguilar of Classic emceeing the event;   They support the Boy Scouts, Child Advocates of Fort Bend boys choir,  Impact A Hero for combat-wounded veterans, and on and on and on.   For 10 years, Classic Chevrolet has had no need to find new roads.  All roads lead to Classic Chevrolet.                            ____________________
