 Mr. Speaker, President Biden's energy crisis is the  Christmas gift that nobody asked for.   The national average for a gallon of gas reached $3.39 as of last  Friday, the most Americans have paid at the pump since the Obama-Biden  administration.   Home heating costs are projected to rise as much as 54 percent for  some households this winter. House Democrats are even pushing a ``heat  your home tax'' just in time for the holidays.   If Americans thought Thanksgiving cost an arm and a leg, just wait  until President Biden's failed policies torpedo Christmas entirely. At  this rate, the only things Americans will find under their Christmas  trees and in their stockings are more bills, not presents.   Mr. Speaker, this lunacy must end.                            ____________________
