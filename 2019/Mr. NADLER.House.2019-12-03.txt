 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4803) to facilitate the automatic acquisition of citizenship  for lawful permanent resident children of military and Federal  Government personnel residing abroad, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to support H.R. 4803, the Citizenship for Children of Military  Members and Civil Servants Act. This bipartisan legislation provides a  simple solution to ease the burdens imposed by our current citizenship  laws on those who have chosen to serve our Nation abroad, and their  children.   Most children who are born outside the United States to U.S. citizen  parents are deemed U.S. citizens at birth. But under our current  citizenship laws, this process can be more complicated for children  whose parents don't meet certain bureaucratic requirements related to  residency, a concept that is generally defined according to where one  physically resides.   This often affects military families and certain other Federal  employees serving abroad. As a result, when establishing U.S. residency  is not possible because of a parent's overseas service to the Nation,  these families, who make great sacrifices for our country, are at a  disadvantage.   Without access to a streamlined citizenship process, parents must  either guide their children through a lengthy and expensive  naturalization process or find some alternative way to establish U.S.  residency, which may even require them to cut short their overseas  service commitment to the armed services.   In August, Members on both sides of the aisle were taken aback by the  administration's reversal of a 15-year-old policy that allowed families  of military servicemembers and Federal Government employees to meet the  residency requirement for acquisition of citizenship purposes while  serving abroad.   H.R. 4803 will implement a small but important fix to our citizenship  laws by restoring and codifying the previous policy and bringing  consistency to what were once differing policy provisions between the  Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State.   H.R. 4803 will provide greater flexibility to individuals who have  dedicated their lives and careers to serving our Nation by treating  their children like other children of U.S. citizens who were born  overseas, allowing them to be automatically recognized as U.S. citizens  once certain conditions are met.   H.R. 4803 will thus eliminate the inconvenience, expense, and delays  of the naturalization process that such children are required to  undergo under current law and allow their parents to continue serving  our Nation in the military without interruption.   I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins), my friend  and colleague, for partnering with me on this commonsense, bipartisan  fix, as  [[Page H9189]]  well as Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Thornberry, Subcommittee Chair  Lofgren, Subcommittee Ranking Member Buck, along with Mr. Gallego and  Mr. Lieu. I appreciate their willingness to work across the aisle and  to demonstrate that it is possible to find common ground on some  immigration and nationality issues.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, and I  reserve balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This bipartisan legislation would provide greater flexibility and  support to those who have dedicated their careers to serving our Nation  when they have children born abroad.   I again thank my colleagues for the bipartisan nature of the work and  support of this bill. I urge all my colleagues to support the bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
