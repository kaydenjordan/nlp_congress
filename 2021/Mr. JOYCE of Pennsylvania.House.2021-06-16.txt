 Mr. Speaker, under the leadership of the  Biden administration, Americans are facing escalating challenges to our  economy, to our national security and, ultimately, to our way of life.  As we have heard many times, our Nation continues to jump from crisis  to crisis.   On this floor, I have often raised concerns about the border crisis,  and it continues to spiral out of control as we record an increasing  number of migrants crossing the southern border, along with gang  violence, human trafficking, and deadly illicit drugs.   Border agents seized over 900 pounds of fentanyl at our southern  border last month alone. Today, we are witnessing an escalating crisis  and, unlike our Vice President, the American people aren't laughing.   More than 80 days ago, President Biden tasked Vice President Harris  with addressing the border crisis. Months later, she has yet to visit  the border and witness the devastation firsthand.                                time  2045    How many days will it take? One hundred? Two hundred? A year?   If Vice President Harris needs encouragement to get to the southwest  border, then Congress can provide an incentive. I am proud to support  Congresswoman Ashley Hinson's See the Crisis Act, which would defund  Vice President Harris' international travel until she visits America's  southwest border.   It is simple. If the Vice President wants to go to Europe, then she  must go to the border first.   This is no laughing matter. At home in Pennsylvania, the border  crisis is a matter of life and death. Lives are depending on border  security.   The truth is clear: We can't afford the Biden border crisis. We can't  afford the Biden economic crisis. We can't afford the Biden national  security crisis. And we can't afford the Biden energy crisis.   This pattern is rooted in the Biden administration's broken policies.  Under President Biden's watch, we are a nation in crisis.   The American people are paying attention, and they are counting on us  to stop this alarming trend and restore our Nation's path to recovery.
