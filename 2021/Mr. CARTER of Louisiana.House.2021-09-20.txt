 Madam Speaker, I was in New Orleans when  Hurricane Katrina made landfall. In the aftermath, the community came  together with Federal and State partners to invest in a regional levee  system to protect the New Orleans area from major flooding.   Sixteen years later, Hurricane Ida hit southeast Louisiana with  roaring winds of around 150 miles per hour. Power lines snapped like  popsicle sticks.   Luckily, the investments we made in flood protection largely worked.  The levees held.   Sadly, other areas outside of the risk reduction zone were still  heavily flooded. Sadly, we find ourselves in a situation that is all  too familiar. Our power grid was destroyed, leaving around 1 million- plus people without power in the sweltering heat in southeast  Louisiana.   Hurricanes are predicted to become more frequent and more intense due  to climate change.   The question is: Will our infrastructure be ready?   The needed investments to save lives were made after Katrina. As the  Ida recovery continues, we must future-proof our power grid and levees  to build back better.                            ____________________
