 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1948, the  VA Employee Fairness Act of 2021. Throughout my career in Congress, I  have always supported our veterans as well as those at the VA who  serve, assist, and treat our veterans, especially those who have health  care needs, so that they can optimally enjoy their post-service life.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        December 15, 2022, on page H9866, in the third column, the  following appeared: Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.  Madam Speaker,  I rise in support of H.R. 1948, the VA Employee Fairness Act of  2021. Throughout my career in    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Thus, I strongly support the VA Employee Fairness Act, which would  repeal provisions that exclude matters concerning professional conduct  or competence, peer review, or adjustment of employee compensation from  the applicability of collective bargaining rights for Veterans Health  Administration employees.   Specifically, H.R. 1948 restores full collective bargaining rights to  VA healthcare professionals including nurses, physicians, dentists, and  physician assistants.   This long overdue legislation grants millions of VA hospital  employees the same collective bargaining rights that are already  afforded to all other federal healthcare workers.   The ability to negotiate better working conditions and better wages  is a fundamental right to all Americans in the workforce.   When this bill passes, it will give a voice to the nurses and doctors  who work long and treacherous hours to treat and care for our veterans  when they return home from service.   Millions of veterans will live the rest of their lives with  disabilities due to service-incurred injuries and physical impairments  that resulted after they made the decision to protect our nation and  safeguard our freedom.   Our courageous service members have pledged that, on the battlefield,  they will leave no soldier behind. In carrying out this sacred  obligation, we must not forget those who treat them when they return  from service.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1948, and  resolve together that just as we will always support our veterans, so  too, we must and will always support those who compassionately treat,  serve, and restore them so that they can rejoin civilian life as fully  as possible.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8393-- Puerto Rico Status Act, to provide a plebiscite to be held on November  5th, 2023, to resolve Puerto Rico's political status.   Throughout my decades of service in Congress, I have been an ardent  and consistent supporter of the Puerto Rican peoples' right to self- determination.   I have stood alongside our Puerto Rican brothers and sisters on many  legislative efforts that would empower them to choose the governance  status of their preference, as is their right, both as American  citizens and in accordance with their basic human rights.   The population of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is 3.19 million.   Puerto Ricans are the largest group of U.S. citizens with Hispanic  heritage, and yet, are treated with only 2nd-class citizenship.   In fact, Puerto Ricans have been the largest body of U.S. citizens  which do not enjoy the privileges usually accorded to citizenship,  including voting representation in Congress and the right to vote in  Presidential elections.   It is a widely held belief in Puerto Rico that the residents of the  Commonwealth should be empowered to decide their own political status.  The Commonwealth's status is an internal matter among the people of  Puerto Rico.   Puerto Rico has hosted 6 referendums on the topic of statehood, with  the most recent being in November 2020. The results of that referendum  were that 52.5 percent of the electorate voted for statehood.   It is obvious that the people of Puerto Rico want to change the way  they are represented in their own governance and that of the United  States Government.   During the referendum in 2012, 54 percent of voters agreed that they  did not want to maintain their current method of governance.   The majority of those that did not want to maintain the status quo  chose statehood as the alternative that they preferred.   While many of these referendums have been held and have told us what  the people of Puerto Rico think, nothing has materialized as a result.   This is why it is essential that Congress allow a plebiscite to  Puerto Rico to resolve it's political status.   Voters in Puerto Rico should be provided with the opportunity to  choose independence, sovereignty in free association with the United  States, or statehood.   It is imperative that this voting process be fair and free of any  disinformation, propaganda, or wrongdoing.   All voters should be provided with voting materials in both English  and Spanish, and all voting campaigns should be dedicated to providing  voters with educational materials related to the plebiscites and  potential outcomes.   The Puerto Rico State Elections Commission shall ensure that any  educational campaigns are non-partisan in nature and provide voters  with accurate information that allow them to vote according to their  best interests.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 8393--Puerto Rico Status Act, so  that the Commonwealth can decide what is best for its people.   All Americans deserve representation, and this bill provides Puerto  Ricans the right to make that decision for themselves.
