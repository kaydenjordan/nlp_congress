 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Adam  Hammill and his business, Exile Burrito of Berlin, NH. Mr. Hammill, a  Coast Guard veteran, had the courage to open his business after years  of planning in May 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.   After honorably serving our country, both in the Coast Guard and with  the Bureau of Prisons, Mr. Hammill turned his passion for cooking  authentic Mexican cuisine into a family business and contributed to the  revitalization of Berlin's historic Main Street community by opening a  restaurant, creating jobs, and offering a new variety of table fare  that was previously not available within an hour of New Hampshire's  northernmost city.   Opening a new business is always a challenge, but that is especially  true for people like Mr. Hammill, who decided to start their business  during an unprecedented global pandemic. Mr. Hammill was committed to  staying open for his employees and his community by pivoting to a  takeout model and implementing safety measures for both his employees  and customers. As Mr. Hammill adapted to the ever changing business  climate due to the pandemic, he found that as a new business, he was  unable to access the critical pandemic relief funding passed by  Congress. Mr. Hammill recognized the gap in support and raised this  issue with me. As a result of advocacy from Mr. Hammill and other new  business owners in New Hampshire, I introduced the bipartisan Recovery  Startup Assistance Act with Republican Senator Mike Braun of Indiana,  which President Biden signed into law as part of the American Rescue  Plan. Now, thanks to Mr. Hammill's advocacy, new business owners will  be able to access payroll assistance through a tailored version of the  employee retention tax credit.   Mr. Hammill truly represents the best of the Granite State--serving  our country, showing his grit and determination to open a successful  business despite unprecedented challenges, and speaking up to help  other new businesses like his own. I look forward to seeing what he  accomplishes next.                            ____________________
