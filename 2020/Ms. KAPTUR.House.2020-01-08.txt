 Mr. Speaker, as we begin the new year and the new decade,  economic results feel tepid for working communities across our country.   The President touts and newspapers parrot his misguided belief that  America is experiencing the greatest economy for everyone.   No, not for everyone.   Sure, many indicators prioritized by Wall Street and Washington  support and reflect this statement, but speak with millions and  millions of lower and middle-class workers, Americans across our  country--especially in the heartland, in the Midwest--and you will find  they feel quite differently. They are falling deeper into debt.   Despite President Trump's exaggeration, a soaring stock market is not  indicative of a strong economy for all. Most Americans do not have a  significant stake in the stock market. They work paycheck to paycheck.  They have to pay higher prices for everything.   According to fact-checkers at PolitiFact, Americans of modest incomes  are significantly less invested in the stock market than wealthier  Americans.   No surprise there.   Other groups, including minorities and those without a college  education, also lag in stock ownership, meaning that the stock market  rally President Trump and the Republican Party so loudly brag about  misses--bypasses--the large majority of Americans.   While unemployment numbers are relatively low, tens of millions of  Americans continue to live and work below the poverty line. If you take  look at their paycheck, many of them have to get food support through  the government because they can't make ends meet--working people who  are poor, millions of them.   Millions more are unemployed and working multiple jobs just to make  ends meet for themselves and their families. Others have given up on  finding work altogether, especially in towns and cities, where good  work has simply disappeared and not been replaced. These families  simply exist.   Since NAFTA's passage in the early 1990s, communities across  America--especially in our industrial heartland--have endured the  outsourcing of living-wage, middle-class jobs to Mexico and other  penny-wage environments where workers are exploited to produce goods  for pennies on the dollar.   Because of disastrous trade policies such as NAFTA and lack of  enforcement by governments like Mexico, our young people have grown up  in the shadows of shuttered factories they have never seen in  operation. For too many, the pain of NAFTA's and other trade  agreements' broken promises remain raw and real.   So, while job creation numbers may be up in one place, one must  wonder: What sort of jobs are being created and how many are good jobs?  The answer is: not nearly enough.   Many of the lost living-wage manufacturing jobs weren't only  outsourced to Mexico; others shifted to China.   What has the President's unpredictable posturing with China has given  our heartland? Desperate farmers and even more pain for manufacturing  workers.   The 18-month-long trade war with China has undermined business  investment. It pushed the manufacturing industry into a recession and  cost an additional $42 billion for American consumers who have paid  more for needed goods, according to a new Federal Reserve Bank study.   This year brings small relief for the 7 million lucky Americans who  live in cities and States that will see wage increases; but this is no  thanks to the President or the Senate Republicans who still refuse to  move the Raise the Wage Act the House passed last year for the millions  of workers who live at the lowest level of paid wages in our country.   Millions of American workers remain left behind by the $7.25 minimum  wage, or $15,080 for a full year's work, because the Federal minimum  wage remains stagnant. American workers haven't had the benefit of a  Federal minimum wage increase in over a decade, yet the prices of  everything have gone up--right?--medicine, housing, food, cars, local  taxes.   There isn't a single congressional district in our Nation where a  full-time minimum wage worker can afford a two-bedroom apartment. How  about that?   Factor in the rising cost of healthcare and education, and more  American families continue to live at the breaking point and are going  deeper into debt. This President continues to push for the repeal of  the Affordable Care Act, despite no plan to replace it.   Here is another example of President Trump and Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell's failure to act to support workers: Our House passed  the Butch Lewis Act--with bipartisan support, it passed this Chamber-- to address the worsening multiemployer pension crisis.    Currently, there are about 1,400 multiemployer plans covering nearly  10 million people across our country who are retired--60,000 in Ohio  alone. These plans are certain to run out of money to support those  retirees. It is estimated that 1.3 million retirees and workers are set  to lose these benefits.   Mr. Speaker, the Senate should pass the bill that we passed here for  these retirees; and we all, as a country, should work to improve the  economic outlook for millions and millions of working Americans who,  frankly, are left out of this economy.  [[Page H21]]                    IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE FOR YOUNG JUVENILES     Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, President Trump is scheduled to  arrive in Toledo, Ohio, for his first campaign rally of 2020.   Does he know that Ohio has lost 286,332 manufacturing jobs since the  first NAFTA went into effect and even more jobs during his Presidency?  President Trump will not bring back those jobs.   And since his NAFTA 2 passed, called the USMCA, the U.S. automotive  companies have announced plans to expand production in Mexico. GM is  closing numerous U.S. plants, including in Ohio, while making popular  models in Mexico. Ford is even making its new electric Mustang in  Mexico, the first Mustang not to be made in the United States of  America.   American manufacturing workers who find reemployment are typically  taking pay cuts. What is more, the President has nothing to say or do  about providing for pensions for over 60,000 Ohioans who are going to  have them cut substantially because he does not support the Butch Lewis  Act, which passed this Congress in this House and is waiting for  passage over in the other body.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to end my comments by saying that maybe the  President, when he lands, should announce that Toledo's F-16 Air Guard  fighter wing should get a complement of F-35s, which that unit has duly  earned.                            ____________________
