 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from  Oklahoma for doing a great job today.   Mr. Speaker, when I look at the so-called HEROES Act, I don't see  legislation honoring heroes. I see an 1,800-page bill that takes 40  hours to read, written with zero bipartisan input. I see socialist  fantasies from previously rejected bills. I see a mortgage on our  children's future, financed by China, the very foreign adversary  responsible for the crisis in the first place.   This bill was formed outside the collaborative nature of the House of  Representatives. It was proposed without going through committee or the  amendment process, and no one, including the Democrats, knows what is  in it.   Passing a $3 trillion spending bill written behind closed doors in  the Speaker's office sets a dangerous precedent that will have  generational consequences. This is nothing more than a publicity stunt.  This bill shows no bipartisan strategy for economic recovery. We should  keep the House in session until we craft real bipartisan legislation  that gets our country back up and running.
