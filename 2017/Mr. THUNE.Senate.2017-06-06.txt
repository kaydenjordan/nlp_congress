 Mr. President, everyone remembers President Obama's  famous--or perhaps infamous--promise that he would sign a healthcare  bill that would ``cut the cost of a typical family's premiums by up to  $2,500 per year.'' Well, as everyone knows, that didn't happen. Between  2009 and 2016, the average family with employer-sponsored health  insurance saw its premiums rise by $4,767. That is just the beginning.   Two weeks ago, the Department of Health and Human Services released a  report comparing the average individual market insurance premium in  2013--the year when most of ObamaCare's regulations and mandates were  implemented--with the average individual market exchange premium in  2017 in the 39 States that used healthcare.gov--so 2013 to 2017  individual market premiums. Here is what they found. Between 2013 and  2017, the average individual market monthly premium in the  healthcare.gov States increased by 105 percent. In other words, on  average, individual market premiums more than doubled in just 5 years.   In my home State of South Dakota, premiums increased by 124 percent  or $3,588 over 5 years. As I said, that is according to HHS reporting  on the premiums in the individual market exchanges over the course of  the past 5 years. So $3,588 in South Dakota is money that South Dakota  families had to take from other priorities, like saving for retirement  or investing in their children's education.   Three States saw their premiums triple over those 5 years. The  average monthly premium in Alaska went from $344 to $1,041. That is an  increase of $697 per month or more than $8,300 a year. Think about  that. Over the past 5 years, the average individual market yearly  premium has increased by $4,800 in Arizona, by $3,648 in Louisiana, by  $5,064 in North Carolina, by $4,488 in Tennessee, and by $5,292 in West  Virginia. Those kinds of premium increases are just not sustainable.   Some people, of course, received tax credits to help offset their  premium payments, but many others are left to face these massive  premium hikes by themselves. And most people do not have the money to  easily absorb a 105-percent premium increase or more in many States, as  I pointed out, over 5 years.   Of course, premium increases show no signs of slowing down. Numbers  for 2018 are emerging, and they are not looking good. Insurers on the  New York exchange are requesting double-digit rate hikes. A Connecticut  insurer requested an average rate hike of 33.8 percent. One Virginia  insurer requested an average rate increase of 38 percent. Another has  requested an average 45-percent rate hike. In Oregon, the average rate  hike requested is 17.2 percent. Companies offering plans on the  exchange here in Washington, DC, are requesting average rate hikes  ranging from 13 percent to nearly 40 percent. In Maryland, average  increases range from 18 percent to almost 59 percent. One insurer in  Maryland has requested a rate increase of up to 150 percent--150  percent for just one year.   As if the premium hikes aren't bad enough, many Americans don't have  a cheaper option to choose. In 2017, roughly one-third of U.S. counties  have just one choice of insurer on their ObamaCare exchange--one choice  in one-third of all the counties in America. So you pretty much have to  take whatever rate they are going to quote you when that is the only  option in town. Talk about a lack of competition.   Several States, including Alabama, Oklahoma, Alaska, and Wyoming,  have just one choice of insurer for the entire State. The entire  State--in those States that I just mentioned--has one choice of  insurer. Things are only getting worse.   In 2018, a number of counties may lack any ObamaCare insurer at all.  On Friday, the Omaha World-Herald announced that 100,000 Nebraskans  could end up with zero options for individual market coverage in 2018.  Iowa is facing a similar situation. In April, Wellmark Blue Cross and  Blue Shield announced that it will withdraw from the individual market  in Iowa in 2018. Days later, Aetna announced that it would pull out of  the Iowa exchange. In the wake of these announcements, Medica, the last  ObamaCare insurer for most of Iowa, announced that it will likely leave  the State in 2018. That would leave 94 of the 99 Iowa counties with no  ObamaCare insurer next year.   Republicans in the Senate are currently working on legislation to  repeal and replace ObamaCare. Why? Because, as I just pointed out,  ObamaCare is broken. This law is not working. This law has never  worked. It shows absolutely no sign that it is going to work in the  future, particularly if those premium increases are any indication.  From first to last, this law has been a disaster--high premium costs,  high deductibles, customers losing health plans, customers losing  doctors, fewer choices, failed co-ops, unraveling exchanges. I could go  on and on because the list of the failures goes on and on.  [[Page S3276]]    Given all of this, it is hard to believe the Democrats are still  defending this disastrous law. I sometimes wonder just what it will  take for my Democrat colleagues in the Senate to accept the staggering  amount of evidence that says this law has failed. Do premiums have to  triple? Do they have to quadruple? Does every American on the exchanges  have to be reduced to just one choice of insurer or be without an  insurer at all?   ObamaCare was going to reduce premiums. It didn't. People were going  to be able to keep their healthcare plans. They regularly found out  that they couldn't. Buying insurance was going to be like shopping for  a TV on Amazon--well, maybe if Amazon had only one brand of television.   The responsible thing to do when a government program has turned out  to be a disaster is to repeal it. That is what Republicans are working  to do with ObamaCare. We are working to repeal this law and replace it  with real healthcare reform. My colleagues in the House have made a  good start. We are working to build on their bill in the U.S. Senate.  Chairmen Alexander, Enzi, and Hatch have been leading the charge on  this. I am grateful to them and their staffs for all of their hard  work.   Republicans are committed to restoring the millions of Americans  trapped on the ObamaCare exchanges and lifting the burdens this law has  foisted onto taxpayers. We are committed to addressing ObamaCare's  skyrocketing premium increases. We are committed to preserving access  to care for Americans with preexisting conditions. We are committed to  making Medicaid more sustainable by giving States greater flexibility  while insuring that those who rely on this program don't have the rug  pulled out from under them. We need to make healthcare more affordable,  more personal, more flexible, and less bureaucratic.   It would be wonderful if at least some Democrats would join us in  this effort and stop prioritizing partisanship over the needs of the  American people. Republicans know that the American people are  suffering under ObamaCare, and we are committed to bringing them  relief. They are ready for healthcare reform that actually works, and  that is what Republicans intend to deliver.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Madam President, today I would like to recognize the 100th  birthday of the Air Force's 34th and 37th Bomb Squadrons.   Two of the oldest active squadrons in the U.S. Air Force, the 34th  and 37th Bomb Squadrons first served our Nation during ``the war to end  all wars.'' Too soon after the conclusion of their service in World War  I, however, our country needed them once again. During World War II,  when our allies in Europe and in the Pacific called for help, the brave  airmen of these units answered the call. They served with distinction  during the historic Doolittle Raid, a daring mission that tested the  limits of the B-25 bombers that had been selected to strike a blow to  the heart of the Japanese empire. While their bombers delivered  payloads, their courage delivered hope to a world that longed for  peace.   The 34th and 37th Bomb Squadrons went on to fly numerous interdiction  and support missions during the Korean war, deployed during Operation  Desert Storm, and fought in Kosovo and Serbia. When terrorists attacked  our homeland in 2001, both squadrons took action in Operations Enduring  Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. In 2011, the 34th and 37th joined forces to  launch the first ever B-1 combat mission launched from the continental  United States, flying from Ellsworth Air Force base in South Dakota to  hit enemy targets in Libya during Operation Odyssey Dawn. During their  100 years of service, the airmen of the 34th and 37th Bomb Squadrons  have assisted allies around the globe and represented the very best of  who we are as a nation. I have full faith they will continue their  distinguished service in defense of our country, our allies, and our  freedoms.   So many times throughout the history of our republic, we have called  upon ordinary men and women to become extraordinary heroes. Today we  honor the legacy of the heroes of the 34th and 37th Bomb Squadrons, and  I thank you for joining me in wishing them the best as they celebrate a  century of service.                            ____________________
