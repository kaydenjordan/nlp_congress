 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 66, the  South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act of 2021.   South Florida suffers from blooms of harmful algae in both its marine  and freshwater systems that have led to worsening ecologic and economic  impacts. This region is impacted by toxic red tide and massive  freshwater blue-green algae blooms which can choke waterways and  coastlines. Red tide and other types of HABs also pose health risks to  humans from direct exposure and from eating infected seafood. When  these algae die and sink to the bottom of water bodies and decay, it  creates low oxygen conditions known as hypoxia.   This bill is largely similar to what we passed out of the House last  Congress on a bipartisan basis. It would authorize a scientific  assessment and action plan to help address the problem of HABs and  hypoxia in South Florida. This assessment and action plan will help  identify research gaps, and detail methods for mitigating and  controlling HABs and hypoxia in South Florida.   This bill takes an important step in helping address the HABs and  hypoxia issue in South Florida, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
