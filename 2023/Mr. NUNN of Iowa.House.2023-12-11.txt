 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5119) to amend title 31, United States Code, to provide  small businesses with additional time to file beneficial ownership  information, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5119         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Small Business and       Prevent Illicit Financial Activity Act''.       SEC. 2. BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP INFORMATION REPORTING DEADLINES                     FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.         Section 5336(b)(1) of title 31, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) in subparagraph (B)--        (A) by inserting ``(but which may not adjust the report       submission deadline)'' after ``Treasury''; and        (B) by striking ``in a timely manner, and'';        (2) in subparagraph (C)--        (A) by inserting ``(but which may not adjust the report       submission deadline)'' after ``Treasury''; and        (B) by striking ``at the time of'' and inserting ``not       later than 90 days after the date of such'';        (3) in subparagraph (D)--        (A) by inserting ``(but which may not adjust the report       submission deadline)'' after ``Treasury''; and        (B) by striking ``in a timely manner, and not later than 1       year'' and inserting ``not later than 90 days''; and        (4) by adding at the end the following:        ``(H) Unable to obtain.--FinCEN may not by rule, guidance,       or otherwise, permit a reporting company from submitting a       report relating to the inability of the reporting company to       obtain or identify information in the alternative to       submitting a report required under this subsection.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, American small businesses are the backbone of our  economy. There are nearly 32.6 million small businesses operating in  our country, and in my home State of Iowa, that makes up more than one- half of the businesses, those that are on Main Street in our hometown  communities and right in the storefront where Americans shop and spend  their time each week.   However, these small businesses are under attack from a Federal  bureaucracy in D.C. trying to burden them in red tape, and alarmingly,  also from our adversaries overseas, specifically Chinese Communist  Party entities, that have infiltrated our country with shell companies  that jeopardize our national security, violate our intellectual  property laws, and hurt our economy both locally and globally.   Recent reports suggest that the Chinese Communist Party has more than  40,000 shell companies operating in the United States today. They use  these companies to launder money, peddle drugs, and collect sensitive  information on our people and our Nation. We cannot, we must not, and,  today, we will not allow that to happen.   In 2020, Congress passed the Corporate Transparency Act to shut down  these illegal shell companies, but, right now, foreign-owned entities  use these shell companies and exploit a loophole in this law by  checking a box on the required form claiming that they don't know who  owns the company, which, of course, we all know--both Republican and  Democrat--is completely absurd.   Once enacted, our bipartisan Protect Small Business and Prevent  Illicit Financial Activity Act will finally close this loophole and  will also reduce the burdensome red tape for the legitimate American  businesses who are trying to do that which they have done so well for  so long: serve our hometown communities.   First, these shell companies will no longer be able to exploit the  system by  [[Page H6753]]  selecting ``unable to obtain'' or ``unable to identify,'' basically  saying that we don't know who owns us, when reporting their ownership  information. By removing the option to basically claim absentia when it  comes to ownership, we can crack down on the Chinese Communist Party's  economic incursion into the United States.   Not only will this bipartisan bill help crack down on Communist  China, it will also make it much easier for legitimate American small  businesses to comply with the law, no longer putting them at a  detriment to their overseas competitors.   Small businesses already face unique challenges in this economy:  brutal inflation, a struggling supply chain, and a bureaucracy based  right here in D.C. that is intent on burying them in red tape, making  them do far more work than adversary-owned entities or what foreign- owned companies do right now. Not to mention most operate with limited  resources, and that is on a good day.   This bill will reduce government-imposed burdens by ensuring small  businesses have sufficient time to satisfy requests for information  while the government fixes this egregious loophole.   The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is that the passage of this legislation  is a critical step forward by preventing our adversaries in the Chinese  Communist Party from exploiting our laws and engaging in illicit  activity and will also reduce the burden of red tape on new and  existing small businesses.   In closing, I thank my colleague from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), who is the  Ranking Member of National Security, Illicit Finance, and International  Financial Institutions Subcommittee, for helping champion this and  being a co-lead on this important legislation, and I also thank my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   First, I want to say thank you to Members on both sides of the aisle.  The House Financial Services Committee has led strongly in making sure  that the backbone of our economy, our small businesses, everyday  Americans, and the economy of this country can remain stronger. With  the passage of this bill we not only fight for the Main Street of  America, but we also ask that those who would do business in the United  States be held to the same standard.   As was highlighted by the gentlewoman from Texas, whether you are a  terrorist entity, whether you are a laundering agency from overseas, or  whether you are the Chinese Communist Party, no longer will you be part  of this myriad of 40,000 entities trying to operate with impunity in  the United States. We will hold you accountable. We will move forward  to support those Americans who are doing it the right way, and, most  importantly, we will stand strong for our national security.   Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to move this bill on a bipartisan path  with this House and the interests of the American people. I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation which I am proud to lead, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5524) to amend the start date of the pilot program on  sharing with foreign branches, subsidiaries and affiliates, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5524         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Affiliates Sharing       Pilot Program Extension Act''.       SEC. 2. FOREIGN AFFILIATES SHARING PILOT PROGRAM.         Section 5318(g)(8)(B)(iii) of title 31, United States Code,       is amended by striking ``3 years after the date of enactment       of this paragraph'' and inserting ``3 years after the date on       which the Secretary of the Treasury issues rules pursuant to       subparagraph (A)''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, first established in the Anti-Money Laundering Act, the  Foreign Affiliates Sharing Pilot Program allows financial institutions  to share Suspicious Activity Reports and related information with the  institution's foreign branches, subsidiaries, and affiliates to help  combat illicit finance risks.   Sharing financial intelligence is the bedrock of thwarting  terrorists' financial activity and the movement of dangerous drugs like  fentanyl across our southern border here in the United States. It  ensures that terrorists and  [[Page H6754]]  other criminals are not able to infiltrate the U.S. financial system.   In October of this year, an unlicensed money transmitting business  admitted in court that they are illegally helping to fund foreign  gamblers laundering money through the U.S. financial system to avoid  scrutiny or investigation by U.S. or foreign law enforcement.                                time  1500    From 2012 to 2020, the business helped move money through at least 15  countries, including ones the State Department has identified as major  money laundering countries like Mexico, Argentina, Switzerland, and the  UAE.   This is just one example of why it matters to have the opportunity to  share intelligence collected from suspicious activity reports to catch  illicit financing activity.   Currently, this pilot program is nearing its 3-year completion mark  without ever having been fully operational. The Foreign Affiliates  Sharing Pilot Program Extension Act extends the termination date for 3  years after the Treasury issues rules for the pilot program. This  extension allows Congress to adequately assess whether to make the  program a permanent solution.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Garcia, the gentlewoman from  Texas, for her amazing work in supporting this important legislation. I  urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense  legislation to protect our national security.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the members of the Financial Services Committee,  particularly the incredible staff that have helped to lead this effort  and recognize that this is a continuation of a program that has shown  remarkable success.   As a 20-year intelligence officer serving in both the military and  the intelligence community, we know firsthand that the illicit use of  financing is the blood that keeps terrorist, criminal, and foreign  entities active on our own soil and a threat to us overseas.   We must continue to march forward not only to hold them accountable,  but to be able to work with our subsidiary and overseas partners to  truly combat this threat on a global scale. The leadership shown on  this committee as well as within the subcommittee are a direct measure  to be able to empower our team, both in the administration, but  particularly at our frontline levels, our banks and financial  institutions, with the tools they need to be successful.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle and  recognize that together this is a bill that truly helps protect our  national security.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5224, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Support for  Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act, which includes my  bipartisan Communities of Recovery Reauthorization Act with the  gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. Pettersen).   Communities across this country are struggling with the opioid  epidemic. More than 60 million Americans are fighting substance abuse  disorders. These are our families, friends, and America's sons and  daughters. Tragically, death due to overdoses are skyrocketing, with  more than 150 citizens dying every day. That is why we must work  together to help pass this bill.   There is no doubt that we must do more to stop the illegal flow of  fentanyl and other drugs into our country--fentanyl made in China and  arriving on U.S. shores daily.   We can do much to help right here at home. By passing this critical  legislation, we will enhance support for community organizations that  are on the front line, helping people recover from addiction and return  to their communities and families through the use of rehabilitation  programs.   This is not a battle that anyone should have to fight alone. I urge  my colleagues to lead with compassion and vote for this critical  bipartisan piece of legislation and start saving lives today.
