 Madam President, I call up my amendment, No. 3317,  and ask that it be reported by number.    Madam President, I am joined on this amendment by  Senators Tester, Wyden, and Warnock.   Our amendment will protect family farms, ranches, and small  businesses while ensuring that the wealthy pay their fair share.  Family-owned businesses, farms, and ranches are the backbone of the  American economy. Many of these family-owned businesses have held their  assets for generations and have a deep connection to the land they  inherit. They are essential for feeding America.   Congress should protect these multigenerational, hard-working  families who have spent a lifetime creating jobs, building businesses,  and serving their communities. We are committed to protecting these  family-owned businesses while ensuring that the top 1  [[Page S6210]]  percent of corporations pay their fair share.   Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
