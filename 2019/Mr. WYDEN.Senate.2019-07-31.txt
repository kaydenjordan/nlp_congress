 Mr. President, in the coming hours, the Senate could take  up the nomination of Elizabeth Darling to serve as Commissioner for  Children, Youth, and Families at the Department of Health and Human  Services. If she is confirmed to that role, she would be a key official  overseeing the foster care system.   I previously had a hold on Ms. Darling's nomination, and I am going  to begin my remarks by saying my hold was never about her personally or  about concerns with her qualifications. In fact, I believe she is  qualified for the position. I placed a hold on her nomination because  of serious problems at the Department of Health and Human Services  affecting child welfare policies that would fall in her area of  jurisdiction if she is confirmed. I think this involves a matter the  distinguished Presiding Officer of the Senate might be particularly  interested in at this point.   I authored, with the former Finance Committee Chair, Senator Orrin  Hatch, landmark families legislation called the Family First Prevention  Services Act.   Family First, that Chairman Hatch and I authored, is a once-in-a- generation bipartisan update of child welfare laws in America, inspired  to a great extent by Marian Wright Edelman, the head of the Children's  Defense Fund. The implementation of that law, in my view, is moving too  slowly.   Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services followed  through on a request from me and a group of colleagues from both  parties and both Chambers to open up the availability of prevention  programs for States that Chairman Hatch and I felt so strongly about  under Family First. This was an important first step, and, if Ms.  Darling is confirmed, I expect to see the Department take more.   What I would like to address for a few minutes, though, is a deeply  discriminatory policy change that has been made by the Trump  administration in the child welfare system. Until the Trump  administration intervened, Health and Human Services regulations  explicitly banned religious discrimination in federally funded Social  Services programs, discrimination that should be barred by our core  constitutional protections. Unfortunately, under this administration,  that safeguard is no more.   This year, the Trump administration has set a precedent that foster  care agencies that receive Federal dollars can turn away qualified  prospective foster parents simply because they are Catholic, Jewish,  Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Mormon, or any other faith, or simply because  they are nonbelievers.   What this is all about, in short, is a green light for taxpayer- funded discrimination on the basis of religion. It stems from a case  involving Miracle Hill Ministries, a foster agency in South Carolina.  Miracle Hill is a faith-based social service organization--the largest  provider of foster care services in South Carolina. It serves around 15  percent of the State's foster care population. I have no reason to  doubt that Miracle Hill has a lot of wonderful staff and volunteers who  wish to do a great deal of good work.   Last year, the Governor of South Carolina asked the Department of  Health and Human Services for a waiver that would allow Miracle Hill to  continue receiving taxpayer dollars despite its practice of turning  away qualified foster parents based solely on their religious beliefs.  In effect, it was a request for a loophole to evade the Federal policy  banning religious discrimination. The Department of Health and Human  Services OK'd it.   At a time--the Presiding Officer of the Senate and I have talked  about this--when there are too many vulnerable kids and too few safe  foster homes in America, the Trump administration actually gave the  largest foster care organization in South Carolina permission to turn  away prospective foster parents because of their faith.   This is not an academic matter. Let me give an example of the  consequences. In 2018, Beth Lesser--a woman who unintentionally brought  this issue to light--went to Miracle  [[Page S5223]]  Hill Ministries to volunteer as a foster mentor. Before she moved to  South Carolina, she was a foster parent in Florida. You would think any  foster care organization would be thrilled to have Ms. Lesser walk  through their door--an experienced foster care parent coming to  volunteer her time, her energy, and her love--but during orientation  training, Miracle Hill found what they consider to be a problem: Ms.  Lesser, like me, is Jewish. After Miracle Hill discovered Ms. Lesser's  religion, they quickly turned her away.   Ms. Lesser is not the only person to experience this discrimination.  Another was Aimee Madonna, who grew up in a foster care home and has  three kids of her own. She contacted Miracle Hill and volunteered to  open her home in the screening process. But when Miracle Hill learned  that Ms. Madonna is Catholic, she got turned away too. She was  devastated by the decision. In February, she sued the State of South  Carolina and the Department of Health and Human Services over this  unconstitutional discrimination. I commend her for fighting for her  rights, and I believe she speaks for people of so many faiths whom I  mentioned earlier.   I do want to explain why I find this precedent the Trump  administration has set to be so objectionable, starting with the most  obvious.   It is horrendous policy because it is going to hurt vulnerable kids  all across this country, particularly if and when the Trump  administration hands out more waivers in more States. If they do it  this way, it is going to reduce the number of safe and loving foster  homes available to youngsters in the child welfare system. That is the  wrong way to go.   This policy is going to limit the diversity of foster homes and  foster parents and growing up around people of different views and  philosophies and religions. Diversity is important for kids. That is  particularly important for LGBTQ youth, who make up one in five kids in  foster care. There are homes where LGBTQ kids are not safe. They  benefit from the chance to grow up in these more inclusive  environments, where there are more diverse families who respect their  sexual orientation and their gender identity.   It raises troubling questions about what is going to happen to  children who were raised outside of evangelical Christianity before  they entered the child welfare system. What is going to happen to a  Jewish kid or a Muslim kid or a Mormon kid who is placed in a home  where they are considered heretics?   This is a personal matter for me. That kid could have been me. I was  so proud of my parents. They fled the Nazis in the thirties. Not all  got out. All my dad--just about the most red, white, and blue fellow  around--wanted to do was serve in our Army so he could drop propaganda  pamphlets on the Nazis, telling them they ought to give up. You can  read about my dad, Peter Wyden, in the Holocaust Museum. I am so very,  very proud of my dad.   I thought about, for example, what might have happened if my parents  had died in a car crash when I was 12 years old and I had been put in  one of these evangelical families through a foster agency that  discriminates. I could have been told that everything my wonderful,  patriotic, Jewish parents had taught me to believe was wrong; that my  parents--that my dad, who was honored in the Holocaust Museum--that his  beliefs were sinful. It would have added a lot more difficulty to a  situation that was already traumatic.   The thought that children who have lost their parents could have  another part of their identity stripped away is appalling. That  religious discrimination in particular, that fundamentally un-American  act--the idea that it is going to be propped up with Federal tax  dollars is just wrong.   In my view, what the Trump administration has done with the South  Carolina waiver is unconstitutional. I also believe it is the latest  iteration of a much larger assault on individual religious liberty.   From a legal perspective, the Department of Health and Human Services  justifies its discriminatory waiver by pointing to the Religious  Freedom Restoration Act, what is known as RFRA. Here is the problem:  That law was intended to stop religious discrimination, not promote it.  In this case, however, the administration is interpreting that law to  protect only the religious freedom of Miracle Hill, not the freedom of  Jewish or Catholic or Muslim or Buddhist individuals who want to become  foster parents in South Carolina.   HHS's waiver disregards the establishment clause in the First  Amendment of the Constitution, which prohibits the government from  ``respecting an establishment of religion.'' This is a Federal agency  using taxpayer dollars to elevate some religions above others. That is  unconstitutional every way you cut it.   The consequences at this point are limited to one State, but because  of this precedent, that is one too many. It only takes one small step  to set a harmful, dangerous precedent that will change everything.  There are already rumors that HHS plans to turn this waiver into a  nationwide policy. Make no mistake about it--that would be nationwide  religious discrimination.   The consequences of an action like that would reach far beyond our  child welfare system. It is not much further down the road before out- and-out discrimination against people of particular faiths, gender  identities, and sexual orientations under the guise of religious  freedom bleeds into other areas of American life. These debates are  going to keep hitting the courts, and they are going to keep  confronting the Congress. The Trump administration, Republican  lawmakers, and Republican judges are ensuring that will happen.   I mentioned at the outset that this debate is tied to a nomination  the Senate may take up today--we will see about later in the week. It  involves the Commissioner on Children, Youth, and Families at Health  and Human Services. I made that judgment, after a lot of reflection,  that I am not going to stand in the way of that vote. I believe Ms.  Elizabeth Darling is qualified. But in making that judgment, I was not  willing to let today pass without sounding an alarm on a very dangerous  precedent the Trump administration has set in this field. This is about  the prospect of State-sponsored religious discrimination. In this case,  it is going to come down hardest on vulnerable kids in our country. I  believe it is clear that what is happening is unconstitutional.   I will close by saying again that there is bipartisan interest in  improving our child welfare system. The distinguished Presiding Officer  of the Senate is from Utah. I wish he could have seen Chairman Hatch  and me work together on Families First. As you know, when Chairman  Hatch got enthused about something, he was really enthused.   Marian Wright Edelman came to both of us. This had been her dream for  30 years, to try some fresh approaches in terms of helping these kids.  In effect, what Families First does is it creates a third option. You  have kids in homes where a parent might have gotten caught up in drugs  or alcohol. We can get them some help. There is the foster care option.  We have some very good foster care facilities in this country, and we  have some that aren't exactly so great. So what Chairman Hatch and I  said and what Democrats and Republicans on the Finance Committee said  and what eventually the Congress on a bipartisan basis said was ``We  are going to do better by these vulnerable kids,'' and we created a  third option.   One of them is built on a dream that I was part of. Back when I was  director of the Gray Panthers, we were advocating for something called  kinship care where grandparents could play a bigger role in stepping in  and trying to help these vulnerable families, where maybe if a son had  gotten in trouble with the law or a daughter-in-law had problems with  alcohol and the like, the grandparent could help out.   Under Families First, Chairman Hatch, a Republican, and I, a  Democrat, said: We are going to try to help those families. We are  going to try to give them help. If you have a son who has had problems  with alcohol and drugs, they are going to be able to get some help. The  grandparents can step in and get some help. We are going to create more  options for the most vulnerable families and most vulnerable youngsters  in America.   We were moving forward. We were moving forward to be able to say--and  this, of course, is not driven from Washington, DC; it is driven at the  [[Page S5224]]  State level. The Presiding Officer of the Senate is a former Governor.  We were moving forward. Now we have the Trump administration seeking to  move backward.   There are nearly half a million kids in foster care in this country.  Democrats and Republicans ought to keep building on the work that  Chairman Hatch and I--and I was proud to be his partner, with him as  the chairman, in this effort to help those kids stay safe and get ahead  in life. Now the Trump administration is spending taxpayer dollars not  to help those kids but to promote discrimination. That is not the way  to help these kids, not the way to help these families. I hope my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in opposing these  policies of discrimination.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to give notice of my intent to  object to any unanimous consent agreement regarding S. 918, the E- FRONTIER Act.   In January of 2018, media reports revealed that officials in the  National Security Council were considering a proposal for the Federal  Government to pay for and build a national 5G telecommunications  network. This proposal was then widely criticized by top administration  officials, including Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit  Pai and White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow. The President  himself subsequently distanced himself from the proposal and made it  clear that he favored a 5G strategy that is private-sector driven and  led.   In response to this controversial proposal, a Senator introduced the  E-FRONTIER Act. This bill prohibits the Federal Government from  constructing, operating, or offering retail or wholesale services on  broadband networks absent congressional authorization.   My colleague stated the bill is intended to ``protect commercial 5G  broadband networks from nationalization without authorization from  Congress.'' While I agree that there is no need, at the current time,  for the Federal Government to offer commercial wireless service in  well-served urban markets, I do not believe that Congress should be  taking any options off the table when it comes to delivering high-speed  wireless broadband to rural communities that have long been ignored by  the private sector.  [[Page S5243]]    This bill is also drafted so that its impact would extend  significantly beyond its stated goal. Not only would my colleagues'  proposal prohibit the Federal Government from operating commercial  wireless networks without explicit congressional authorization, but it  would also prohibit the government from operating wireline networks,  such as fiber and cable networks.   Passing this legislation would bar the Federal Government from  offering fiber-to-the-home connectivity to the tens of millions or  Americans who currently have no meaningful option for high-speed  broadband internet access at home. In effect, it would tell Americans  in rural and low-income communities across the country that, if the  private sector does not think it can make a profit offering service in  their communities, that is the end of the line for them. Outside of  providing subsidies, the Federal Government would be barred from  addressing these market failures by contracting to build the  infrastructure itself.   Time and time again, Congress has, on an overwhelmingly bipartisan  basis, maintained the critical importance of delivering broadband to  all Americans, and not just those in big cities. This body should not  ban any option for internet connectivity without fulsome debate and  regular order.   Unfortunately, this need case is far from a hypothetical. As many as  162 million Americans across the country do not have access to internet  service at broadband speeds, according to one recent analysis cited by  the FCC. Congress should be passing laws that work to close this gap  and not those that tie our hands as millions and millions of Americans  are left behind in this new digital divide. It is an issue of fairness,  it is an issue of equality, and it is an issue that must be subjected  to vigorous public debate.   So I rise today with a simple and straightforward request: Before  Congress limits possible broadband buildout options for decades to  come, let's give my colleagues' proposal the careful consideration that  it deserves. I look forward to working with my colleagues to see if we  can resolve some of these outstanding issues in a manner that is fair,  transparent, and timely.   For all of these reasons, I will object to any unanimous consent  agreement to consider S. 918.                            ____________________
