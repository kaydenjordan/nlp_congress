 Mr. President, every day, I receive messages from  Michigan families who are struggling to cope with rising costs for the  things they depend on. We know that it has been challenging in a global  pandemic with supply chains broken down and consolidation, but we also  know that from food prices to household necessities to gas, corporate  price gouging is also taking a big chunk out of Michigan wallets. And  perhaps no industry has been price-gouging longer--actually for  decades--more deeply than the pharmaceutical industry.   Americans pay the highest prices in the world for prescription  drugs--highest prices in the world--even though we are the ones who  have invested so much partnering with the industry on new types of  medications and innovations. We allow research and development tax  credits to help pay for that cost. We support other efforts. The  National Institutes of Health helps to pay for the basic research,  hundreds of billions of dollars working with the industry. And yet we  have the highest prices in the world--the highest prices in the world.  And one in four Americans can't afford the medications they depend on.  This is just not acceptable. It is just not acceptable.   A senior with complex medical needs pays an average of more than  $6,000 a year on prescription drugs. And the median price for a new  prescription drug is $188,000 a year. That is 90 times the median price  for a new drug just  [[Page S3717]]  back in 2008. And that is more than most Americans earn in 3 years, not  just 1 year, but in 3 years.   Christina of Center Line, MI, knows this. She was prescribed Humira  for an autoimmune condition that affects her eyes. Unfortunately, even  though she needs it, she can't afford it. The medication costs more  than $6,000 a month--a month. She wrote this:         Autoimmune patients . . . struggle with the cost of       prescriptions being so high and some just give up and don't       even bother. That should never be an option in my opinion.    James, who lives in Manistee, suffers from narcolepsy. It is a  neurological condition in which patients can suddenly fall asleep  during other activities, including eating or driving. I am sure we have  all known someone or seen someone who has this disease.   James first started taking medication called Xyrem in 2015. Back  then, it cost about $9,000 a month. Today, that same medication costs  more than $18,000 a month--$18,000 a month, or $226,221.84 a year.   Who can do that? Who can do that?   Last year, James' doctor switched him to a slightly different drug  with less sodium, produced by the same company, Jazz Pharmaceuticals.  The new drug, XYWAV, costs even more--$239,000--$239,320, to be  specific, per year.   James writes:         Who is profiting from these huge price hikes? Will these       huge price hikes continue every year? Does Jazz       Pharmaceuticals have enough oversight? Are they putting       profits over people?    I think there is an answer to that. It sure seems like that to me,  James.   There is no fundamental reason for these prices to be going up and up  and up. Now, when I think about insulin, which has tripled in price in  the last decade or so, this was a drug that was actually discovered 100  years ago by two Canadian doctors who developed this patent for  lifesaving medicine, and because they felt it was unethical to actually  be making a profit off of something that would help people, they gave  it to the University of Toronto for the equivalent of $1.   That was 100 years ago. It hasn't substantially changed as a product  in 100 years. The company has more than recovered their research and  development--their costs and so on. And yet in the last couple of  years, the price has tripled--tripled. If that is not a sign of price  gouging, I don't know what is.   From 2000 to 2018, big pharmaceutical companies raked in $11.5  trillion in revenue. That is T--trillion dollars. Between 2016 and  2020, drug companies spent $577 billion on stock buybacks--not lowering  prices, but doing more for their CEOs and doing more for their  stockholders. The $577 billion on stock buybacks is about 10 times as  much as they spent on research and development.   They also have significantly increased executive compensation while  Americans struggle to afford lifesaving medications. For the record,  the CEO of Jazz Pharmaceuticals made more than $16 million in total  compensation last year; an awful lot of Michigan families could live a  good life on that one salary.   The pharmaceutical and health products industry spent $350 million on  lobbying in 2021, nearly double the spending of the second-highest  industry. In fact, at one point--I haven't done this recently, but at  one point, I looked at the number of lobbyists per Senator, and it was  15 lobbyists in the drug industry for every one Senator. And so we  wonder, what is going on here? And then we see what happens in  elections and so on; and, unfortunately, our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle who receive a lot of the benefits of the  contributions from the pharmaceutical industry then come to the floor  and try to block us from doing something on behalf of people to lower  these prices. And that is going to be what is happening again next  week.    So far in 2022, pharmaceutical companies have already raised the  price of 1,186 drugs, and they raised the price on 100 drugs just  this--right now in July, this month--100 drugs. Prices have gone up,  just this year.   It is appalling. There is no other word for it. And while Republican  colleagues are fighting to protect these absurd profits, Senate  Democrats are fighting for people who need their medicines, in some  cases just to survive, to live, or to be able to go to work, to be able  to do things to support their children to get what they need.   Our commonsense plan, which we will be voting on next week, to lower  drug prices will save $288 billion over the next 10 years. First, it  would empower Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices beginning  with 10 of the highest costing drugs, starting next year. I can't  believe it. We negotiate everything else, and we know the VA that  negotiates on behalf of veterans' prescription drugs gets about 40  percent less. Common sense tells you that we should be negotiating  these prices.   But, unfortunately, years ago, when the prescription drug bill, Part  B, passed in Medicare, the drug companies were successful in getting  specific language in that says you can't negotiate with them. Medicare  cannot negotiate. Well, that needs to change, and we are going to  change that.   So it would be 10 of the highest costing drugs next year that would  expand to 20 drugs in each year after that by 2029. Just imagine how  much money can be saved if Medicare was allowed to negotiate, and it  would directly benefit people who are living with conditions including  asthma, blood clots, COPD, as well as cancers as well as a whole range  of things--everything you can imagine.   Secondly, our legislation caps Medicare beneficiaries' out-of-pocket  costs for seniors, for people with disabilities on Medicare. We will  cap the out-of-pocket costs to $2,000 a year and allow people to spread  that out over the year so that it is easier to make that payment. So  instead of $6,000 a month or $9,000 a month or $10,000 a month or  whatever, we are talking about a cap of $2,000 you can spread out over  the year in out-of-pocket costs for seniors and people with  disabilities. Never again will a diagnosis like cancer mean $10,000 or  more for a single drug to treat it.   Medicare beneficiaries would also receive free vaccines, including  vaccines for shingles. That currently costs seniors $190 if they are  not enrolled in Medicare Part B. It would increase help for low-income  seniors, giving all qualifying Medicare beneficiaries the full low- income subsidy under Medicare Part B. So we would help low-income  seniors even more. That would save the average senior about $5,000.  That is a lot of money. And it would keep Part B premiums in Medicare  affordable for seniors and people with disabilities and ensuring that  premiums won't increase because of bad actions by drug companies, and  that means not faster than inflation. Speaking of bad actions by drug  companies, it would penalize them for outrageous price increases. If  they go above inflation, they are going to have to rebate those funds.   Today, drug companies are incentivized by keeping drug prices high by  secretly negotiating with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to  increase profits at the expense of patients. Under our legislation,  drug companies, not consumers, will be on the hook for drug price hikes  that exceed the rate of inflation. This proposal alone is expected to  save Medicare $71 billion.   For far too long, the drug companies have been taking advantage of  people like Christina and James. People should not have to go without  the medicine they need in this country, in America, where we fund  through our tax dollars so much of the innovation that creates these  drugs. They should not be forced to skip doses or take less than what  was prescribed to save money, and they should not have to choose  between taking their medicine and keeping the lights on or putting food  on the table.   Christina and James deserve better. Americans deserve better. And we  are going to fight until that gets done. That is what next week is all  about on prescription drugs. It is time. It is past time. People  deserve to be able to afford the medicine they need. It is time to put  people before profits, and that is exactly what we are going to do.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 10 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.
