 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North  Carolina for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I am speaking with you today because it is past time to  reopen critical functions of our government.   Aerospace and aviation are the backbone of my district. I just came  from speaking with aviation professionals who are employed by the FAA,  as well as pilots and other impacted organizations. It has never been  more clear to me that this is a crisis of both safety and national  security.    Air traffic controllers are given the huge task of ensuring that  millions of passengers a day fly safely. Thousands of support  professionals are furloughed or not working. They include specialists  who provide tactical, strategic, and administrative support, and this  puts Americans across the country in danger.   I have spoken to air traffic controllers in my district who are  picking up second jobs in order to pay their bills and feed their kids.   Just yesterday, Christy, a veteran and mother of two, came all the  way to D.C. from California to let me know the hardships that this  shutdown has put her family through.   We can't afford these men and women to be operating at anything less  than 100 percent. We need to pass this bill today and get our civil  servants, our veterans back to work and protect all American citizens.
