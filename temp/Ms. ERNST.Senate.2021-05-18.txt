 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great American and  an exceptional member of the United States Air Force. On this occasion,  I believe it is fitting to recognize Lt. Col. Anthony ``Tony''  Santino's distinguished service and dedication to fostering the  relationship between the U.S. Air Force and this Chamber.   Lieutenant Colonel Santino has distinguished himself through his  professional character and leadership by serving this Nation in  uniform. A leader and expert communicator, he has provided exemplary  service to our country while assigned to the Air Force Senate Liaison  Office. Tony is a senior missileer, operating at the highest levels of  America's nuclear enterprise, ensuring the United States and its allies  are strategically prepared to defend this great nation from external  threats.  [[Page S2572]]    Prior to his current assignment, Tony had the privilege of being an  Air Force fellow for Representative Liz Cheney. In addition to his  numerous and impressive professional accomplishments, it is worth  noting he flawlessly balanced his duties, evidenced by his ability to  allocate personal time to selflessly volunteer as local neighborhood  math tutor, where Tony's enthusiastic service empowered DC youth and  inspired community partnership. His passion for not only the  organization he works for but also the community in which he resides is  unrivaled.   As a legislative liaison in the Air Force Senate Liaison Office from  November 2019 to May 2021, Lieutenant Colonel Santino expertly  performed his duties without reservation. His strategic thinking and  strategic foresight helped to strengthen and improve our national  security. Tony accomplished this by utilizing his in depth Air Force  knowledge with numerous engagements between Congress and the Department  of the Air Force. During this assignment, Tony conducted congressional  engagements to provide Members of Congress and staff insights into the  Air Force we need and Air Force required to support the national  defense strategy. Tony transformed congressional engagement norms  amidst coronavirus limitations, leading more than 40 remote and virtual  engagements between Air Force senior leaders and U.S. Senators,  exponentially increasing trust and mutual understanding.   Tony's innovative efforts and trusted credibility on Capitol Hill  enabled the passage of foundational legislation in support of Air Force  priorities, securing more than $170 billion in annual requirements and  directly contributing to the stand-up of the United States Space Force.  All of these conversations and engagements helped stakeholders  understand the defense equities and impact on national security. Tony  remained engaged with Members of Congress to ensure all were informed,  advised, and educated on initiatives important to the Air Force and the  citizens of this great country. Due to his direct involvement and  stewardship, Members of Congress were able to make informed decisions  and ensure the Department of the Air Force was properly resourced and  funded.   After concluding this challenging assignment, Lieutenant Colonel  Santino will move to his next duty station at Vandenberg AFB, where he  will be the director of operations for the 576th Flight Test Squadron.  Tony has sacrificed much in service to our Nation. I am eternally  thankful for Tony's selfless service and superb work with my office and  the Senate over the past 18 months on issues important to the State of  Iowa and this great Nation. I salute this American patriot whose  selfless service has kept our country safe and strong.                            ____________________
