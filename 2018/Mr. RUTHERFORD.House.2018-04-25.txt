 Mr. Speaker, music has been an integral part of the  fabric of our culture for hundreds of years because it can capture a  moment in time and space like nothing else. You remember where you were  the first time you heard that special song, and time after time, it  takes you back to a moment and a place of significance in your life.   For me, Mr. Speaker, one of the most meaningful songs in my life is  ``More Today Than Yesterday'' by The Spiral Starecase. It just so  happens that that song signifies the bond between my wife, Pat, and I  that we have shared now for over 45 years. And I can tell you, it is a  priceless reminder of our lives and so many special moments together.  And while we may not be able to put a price on a song's ability to  transport us to a memory, we can all agree that the creators of the  music we hold so dear should be fairly compensated for their craft.   That is why I am so pleased to support the Music Modernization Act,  which offers a long-overdue update to our copyright laws to account for  the changing ways we consume music. Songwriters, musicians, producers,  engineers, and artists should all have the opportunity to receive their  fair due. And I thank Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Nadler, and  Representatives Collins and Jeffries for all their hard work to ensure  that our copyright laws are all singing from the same sheet of music.
