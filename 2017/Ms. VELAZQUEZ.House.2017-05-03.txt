 Mr. Speaker, let me take this opportunity to thank the  gentlewoman from New York for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased this legislation contains $295.9 million  for Puerto Rico's Medicaid program, which is running out of resources.  Absent action, hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens could lose  health care.   Make no mistake, we are in this situation because of years of neglect  from Washington. So, here we are again, fixing a hole created by Puerto  Rico's second class treatment under Medicaid.   The funding in this bill is a first step toward rectifying the  longstanding unequal treatment of Puerto Rico. By the way, Mr. Speaker,  and Mr. President, last time I checked the history books, it was the  U.S. Armed Forces who landed in Puerto Rico in 1898, and invaded Puerto  Rico. So we have a moral obligation toward the people of Puerto Rico,  American citizens.   Now, to the creditors, let me say this, and let me be clear: this  money was not appropriated to line hedge funds' pockets. This money,  and funds that would otherwise go to Puerto Rico's healthcare system,  is for Puerto Ricans.   So I support this funding and look forward to seeking solutions for  the island's long-term growth.   Finally, let me thank Leader Pelosi, Mr. Hoyer, Ranking Member Lowey,  and Minority Leader Schumer for their efforts in securing these funds.   I thank my colleagues.
