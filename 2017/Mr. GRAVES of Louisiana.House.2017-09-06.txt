 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman  from Alabama and the gentleman from New Jersey for their help.   The coast of Louisiana has experienced extraordinary challenges over  the last several decades--everything from the management of the  Mississippi River system through levees, the BP oil spill, and now, an  invasive end sector scale on some of the vegetation in coastal  Louisiana.   When you add up the cumulative impact of all of these things, our  State has lost about 2,000 square miles of our coast. That is 2,000  square miles that the Gulf of Mexico has encroached upon; that is 2,000  square miles where our communities are much more vulnerable now to  hurricanes. And we are certainly all sensitive to that with Hurricane  Harvey just hitting our State and Texas, and Hurricane Irma currently  headed toward the mainland of the United States.   An amendment that was agreed to as part of this en bloc package  simply transfers $400,000 from an administrative account to research  through APHIS, to study this invasive scale. And this may sound like  some small issue that doesn't matter, but it is causing significant  impact, to the tune of square miles of additional coastal loss in  Louisiana that is going to make our communities that much more  vulnerable and cause significant environmental impact.   So I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama and the gentleman from  New Jersey for their assistance and including our amendment today that  is going to ensure that we can research this, that we can find a  solution, and that we can be proactive and prevent additional loss and  additional assault on the coast of Louisiana.
