 Mr. Speaker, I stood in this very spot about 1 year  ago urging Congress to do the work of the American people, the work  they sent us here to do. I introduced a piece of legislation called the  Do Your Job Act, which is simple. It would not allow Congress to go  into recess unless we have actually done our work, passed all of our  appropriations bills.   Instead, I fear that we are going to find ourselves in the same  crisis that we found ourselves in just a few months ago. That is why I  was glad to see that the President recently said that we should cancel  the August recess, if necessary, if we can't do our job.  [[Page H4150]]    In just 2 months, we will once again adjourn for a month-long recess  without a budget or getting all our appropriations done, to say nothing  of the other issues that remain unresolved, like immigration--take your  pick.   Once again, if we don't make some hard choices, the government may  shut down. I think that is unacceptable. We know exactly how this plays  out. We saw it last year, as we careened from one budgetary deadline to  the next, with one short-term extension after another.   We simply can't keep repeating these same mistakes over and over  again. To do so would be the literal definition of ``insanity.''   So I urge my colleagues: let's put an end to this madness. Let's stay  here, if necessary, even if that means canceling recess. Let's work  with a sense of urgency and purpose to better this country, because  that is what our constituents sent us here to do.                            ____________________
