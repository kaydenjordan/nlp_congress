 Mr. Speaker, in addition to not showing up here  to do the job that their constituents sent them here to do, they are  literally lying about the reason they are not here.    Same here.    I have been tempted to interrupt during the  proxy voting to ask the Speaker to allow me to offer a prayer for the  healing and recovery of the dozens of Members of Congress who are not  at work and who are apparently too sick from COVID to show up and do  their job.                                time  1345     Of course. That is why they are getting rid of  it because it has been used to turn back some illegal immigrants at the  border.    We did. Where just a couple months ago you had  ``Bidentown'' with some 20,000 illegal Haitian immigrants gathered  under the bridge. We learned a lot while we were there, and I thank the  gentleman for leading that trip.   I also want to say thank you to my friend, the Congressman from  Wisconsin, for allowing us to do this, and Congressman Roy for allowing  me to join him.  [[Page H4425]]    But we had the 20,000 illegal Haitian immigrants gathered in  ``Bidentown'' under the bridge which they quickly--they weren't  concerned that the immigrants were coming in the country illegally.  They were concerned about the image and the embarrassment of 20,000 of  them in ``Biden's village'' there under the bridge, so they wanted to  distribute them into the interior of the country as quickly as they  could to hide it from the American people.   The gentleman will remember at first they tried to keep the media  from covering it. And then what they did was bus them into the country  to wherever they wanted to go. They flew a few back to Haiti, but most  of them they distributed into the country.   But we learned when we were in Del Rio--and my friend may have  already known this--I learned it that day when we were there that there  were 1,000 a day coming just through that corridor. Sadly, that is just  a fraction of the 7,000 a day who are coming across the southern border  along Arizona, New Mexico, Arizona, and, of course, Texas.   But to this President's policies now, what is the response?   We want to try to double or even triple that by rescinding title 42.    That is right.    I'm not aware that they have apologized.   As a matter of fact, at least the President and the Vice President,  to my knowledge, have never been to the border to see what is  happening.   Again, my friend led one of the trips I was on. I have been to the  border four times in my first 15 months here in Congress so that I  could see better and experience in person the crisis at the border, to  see the human toll, to see the environmental toll, and then to see  exactly where that was happening.   These are Border Patrol officers who were trying to stand in the gap,  to be on the front line, and trying to do their job despite the efforts  of this administration to prevent them from doing their job, and  putting their lives, literally, at risk.   The previous time I was at the border--not the Del Rio trip--but the  previous time I was in Arizona, there was actually a shooting of a  Border Patrol officer while I was there. And yet here we have--as my  friend has said--the Department of Homeland Security Secretary  besmirching, smearing, and demeaning his own employees knowing full  well that is a lie, knowing full they are just leading those horses as  they do and trying to protect us American citizens from what is  happening at the border.    That is right.   They say they want to identify the root causes. I can tell my friend  what the root causes are. The root causes of the massive surge across  our border, if you will, the invasion at our border: is the cessation  of the Trump policies that were working. It is the enhancement of the  catch-and-release practice. It is ending MPP. It is stopping building  the wall. And it is promising amnesty and an open border during the  2020 election for illegals to come. That is why they were coming with  their Biden T-shirts on. It is not mandating E-Verify. It is allowing  the economic incentive to come. It is allowing individuals to come and  be apprehended and provided free social services, free healthcare  services, free education, and to be flown or distributed wherever they  want to go around the country at taxpayer expense with no specific  court date to even appear to have their case heard.    I want to compliment the gentleman's Governor from yesterday. I hope  that he will follow through on this. I hope this will actually happen.  Perhaps the gentleman from Texas has some thoughts on that. He  announced yesterday that he is going to bus these illegal aliens right  here to Washington, D.C., so our Democratic majority and our Democratic  administration who are willfully and purposely facilitating this  invasion at our southern border through their policies can accommodate  these illegal aliens when they are brought here.   I call on my Governor from Virginia and Governors throughout the  country to do the same thing.    Absolutely.    Absolutely. And the four times that I have been  to the border in the last 15 months, I have never seen a Democrat  there. I have had Border Patrol, Texas State Police, sheriffs, and law  enforcement who are working there at the border--not just Texas, but  Arizona as well--where they tell me they never see Democrats at the  border.   We only need seven Democrats to join our discharge petition to get a  vote on maintaining title 42, but we can't get one Democrat, one  majority Member, to do this. One would hope that just in the States of  Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California--the border States--that we  could get, just in the State of Texas, in particular, that we could get  Democrats to say, Hey, don't mess with Texas.   We are going to join our fellow Republicans, and we are going to  support Texas' efforts to stand in the gap and do what the Federal  Government will not do in violation of the Constitution and protecting  the State from invasion.    Happy birthday to my brother Steve who is 55  today, April 7.    That is right.    Naming names.    Not one.    There is no excuse for it.   If this President was doing everything else right--just use your  imagination and just allow for a moment--if he was doing everything  else right and some of his other policies were working--let's pretend  some were working--what he has allowed to happen at the border as the  head of the Democratic Party, never in the history of the country has  our own President done more to intentionally harm the United States in  what he has done in his first year. So it is no wonder that not one  Democrat will join us in standing up for border security.   How did that become a partisan issue?   As you know, we were in an off-the-record meeting with Secretary  Mayorkas so I can't share what he said. I can share what I said.   I asked him: What is the end game?   Here we are going to take it from some 7,000 a day--it is estimated  18,000 a day--that means every 3 days you will have the equivalent  population of my home county, Campbell County, Virginia, 56,000 people,  in 3 days we will have that many illegal border crossings.   By the way, in my hometown of Lynchburg, Virginia, right outside  Campbell County there, we just had a murder conviction of an MS-13 gang  member who came across illegally. Again, demonstrating that every town  is a border town under this President. Every State is a border State  under this President.                                time  1400    I appreciate you leading on this issue, Mr. Roy, so passionately and  so consistently and so faithfully. Specifically, you helped lead that  letter that we sent to leadership of both the House and the Senate on  the Republican side, just 2 or 3 weeks ago, saying no Republican should  support any government funding that does not secure the border.   So what did we do with the potential leverage that we had that was  before us, if all Republicans would refuse to fund a government that  doesn't secure the border?    $1.6 trillion, less than 1 percent of which was  for  [[Page H4427]]  Ukraine support. Some justified their vote for that because it was  supporting Ukraine. So 99 percent of the bill had nothing to do with  Ukraine. Yet, 54 Republicans, one-fourth of our body, voted against  that $1.6 trillion spending, with no leverage, no concessions, nothing  really gained. We didn't secure the border; we didn't end the vaccine  mandates; we didn't unleash American energy independence.    Who also didn't vote for that bad bill, by the  way.    That is right.    That is right, for 2 years.    Into the interior of the country.    Yes. The illegal drugs that are pouring in  across the country, fentanyl and other dangerous drugs, at record  levels, is the reason why we had 100,000 overdose deaths last year in  this country. In 2021, the number one cause of death for individuals  between 18 and 45 was not COVID; it was overdose.   On the border trips that I have been on--again, a couple of those  with you--when you meet with the folks who live there, who live on the  front lines, and they talk about these illegals, they will find the  carpet shoes. We saw them. You see the carpet shoes and the camos. Once  they get picked up by their crime cartel contact and picked up to go  wherever they want to go in the interior of the country, you find the  carpet shoes and you find the camos left behind.    You will have those folks who live there tell you they are coming  onto their property, they are knocking on their doors, they are  threatening them and making demands of them. These folks who live on  the border are finding dead bodies. The previous trip I was on in  Arizona, they said they apprehended 30 Chinese nationals on their  property.   They are from 160 different countries, not just Central and South  America, as if that wasn't enough. But to your point, 160 different  countries are making every town a border town and every State a border  State.   It is a dereliction of duty on behalf of this President's  administration. It is a threat to the national security of our country,  to the sovereignty of our country, to the health and security of our  country, and to the financial security of our country. I appreciate  your leadership on this issue.
