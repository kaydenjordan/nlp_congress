 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators  Leahy, Klobuchar, King, and Tester be recognized in the next 40 minutes  or so for a colloquy with me.    Mr. President, it was 1986, a third of a century ago.  Six U.S. Senators wrote a letter to the Office of Technology  Assessment, the office then charged with providing technical and  scientific advice to Congress.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that their letter be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                               United States Senate,                                       Committee on Environment                                                 and Public Works,                                   Washington DC, December 23, 1986.      Dr. John Gibbons,      Executive Director, U.S. Congress, Office of Technology           Assessment, Washington, DC.        Dear Dr. Gibbons: The Senate Environment and Public Works       Committee has held three days of hearings this year on the       massive and, to some degree irrevocable, alterations in the       stratosphere commonly referred to as the ``greenhouse       affect'', as well as ozone depletion.        The testimony convincingly portrayed a fundamentally       altered planet, with shifts in ocean circulation and climate       zones; altered precipitation and storm patterns; more       frequent and extreme weather events such as droughts,       monsoons, and lowland floods. Individually and collectively,       these changes bring about others, ranging from disruption of       forest, crop, and ocean productivity to shifts in       populations. Witnesses before the Committee testified that       the Earth is now committed to a substantial greenhouse       warming, projected to be about 2 degrees Centigrade, as well       as an ozone layer depletion.        We are deeply troubled by the prospect of such a rapid and       unprecedented change in the composition of the atmosphere and       its implications for the human and natural worlds. It may be       necessary to act soon to at least slow these trends or,       perhaps, halt them altogether.        We therefore request that the Office of Technology       Assessment undertake a study for the Committee on Environment       and Public Works of policy options that, if enacted, could       lead to the stabilization and minimization of greenhouse       gases in the atmosphere. These gases include carbon dioxide,       methane, nitrous oxide, tropospheric ozone and       chlorofluorocarbons. This is a large and difficult task but       fundamental and perhaps permanent alteration of the       stratosphere has profound implications for the future of the       world as we know it.        The Office of Technology Assessment has proven itself       capable of policy analysis on difficult and complex issues.       Despite this, OTA may find it difficult to immediately       provide a set of options which both complete and detailed.       However, the Congress must soon begin to weigh the       alternatives facing the United States and other nations. For       this purpose, we hope that you can provide information on       omissions as well as other considerations relevant to those       decisions.        Due to the likelihood that legislation will be seriously       considered by the Committee early in the next Congress, it       would be most helpful if this analysis could be undertaken       without delay. If we or our staffs can be of assistance to       you or your staff, please do not hesitate to call upon us.            Sincerely,      Robert T. Stafford,        U.S. Senate,      John H. Chafee,        U.S. Senate,      Dave Durenberger,        U.S. Senate,      Quentin N. Burdick,        U.S. Senate,      George J. Mitchell,        U.S. Senate,      Max Baucus,        U.S. Senate.     These six U.S. Senators were troubled by testimony  they had heard about climate change in three separate hearings of the  Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee. They wrote:         The testimony convincingly portrayed a fundamentally       altered planet, with shifts in ocean circulation and climate       zones; altered precipitation and storm patterns; more       frequent and extreme weather events such as droughts,       monsoons, and lowland floods. Individually and collectively,       these changes bring about others, ranging from disruption of       forest, crop, and ocean productivity to shifts in       populations. Witnesses before the Committee testified that       the Earth is now committed to a substantial greenhouse       warming, projected to be about 2 degrees Centigrade, as well       as an ozone layer depletion.    Well, that was quite a prediction. Who were these six Senators?  Quentin  [[Page S1515]]  Burdick, Democrat from North Dakota; Max Baucus, Democrat from Montana;  George Mitchell, Democrat from Maine; Robert Stafford, Republican from  Vermont, the chairman then of the committee; Dave Durenberger,  Republican of Minnesota; and Rhode Island's Republican Senator, John  Chafee.   You cannot help but be struck that the prediction back then by these  six Senators is now our reality. Everything they predicted is  happening. The scientists they listened to had it right. Global  temperatures have already risen by around 1 degree Celsius, and we are  headed to over 2 degrees Celsius of global warming by the end of the  century.   Their grim predictions, which we now live with as fact, motivated  these six Senators to ask the Office of Technology Assessment for  policy options that ``could lead to the stabilization and minimization  of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.''   Why did they want these policy options? They wanted to learn about  policy options because, as they continued in their letter:         Congress must soon begin to weigh the alternatives facing       the United States and other nations. . . . Due to the       likelihood that legislation will be considered by the       Committee early in the next Congress, it would be most       helpful if this analysis could be undertaken without delay.    ``Without delay.'' Since then, Republicans have demolished the Office  of Technology Assessment; that office no longer exists. Republicans  have relentlessly blockaded legislation to address carbon emissions and  have trafficked in phony climate denial, all while accepting hundreds  of millions of dollars of political contributions from the fossil fuel  industry.   Today, five of those six States are represented again, having a  reunion on the Senate floor. I see Senator Tester from Montana here. I  will yield to him now. We will also be joined by Patrick Leahy of  Vermont, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Angus King of Maine.   I yield to Jon Tester of Montana, taking the position of his  predecessor, Max Baucus--whom, by one of the weird coincidences of the  Senate, I just passed coming out of the trolley.   Senator Tester, the floor is yours.    I thank Senator Tester.   I will turn to the Rhode Islander who was in that early bipartisan  effort to understand and address climate change. Senator John Chafee's  history of service to his State and country was remarkable. He saw  bloody combat in World War II on Guadalcanal and Okinawa with the 1st  Marine Division. He went back as a Marine rifle company commander  during the Korean war with Dog Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines. He  served in Rhode Island's legislature and as our Governor. In 1969, he  was appointed Secretary of the Navy. He was elected to the U.S. Senate  in 1976 and chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee from  1995 until his death in 1999. In the small Rhode Island world, he was  also my father's college roommate and lifelong friend.   The environment was an abiding passion for this man, and his devotion  showed in his work in the Senate. His legacy includes the Superfund  Program, the Oil Pollution Act, and the 1990 amendments to the Clean  Air Act, and his legacy is his early recognition that climate change,  driven by carbon pollution, caused by fossil fuels, poses an  existential threat to humanity and the planet we call home.   At the 1986 hearing that led to this bipartisan letter, Chafee  declared:         This is not a matter of Chicken Little telling us the sky       is falling. The scientific evidence . . . is telling us we       have a problem; a serious problem.    This is 1986, and the Republican chairman of the Environment and  Public Works Committee is saying that the scientific evidence is  telling us we have a serious problem.   He went on to say:         Scientists have characterized our treatment of the       greenhouse effect as a global experiment. It strikes me as a       form of planetary Russian roulette. . . . By not making       policy choices today, by sticking to a ``wait and see''       approach . . . [b]y allowing these  [[Page S1516]]       gases to continue to build in the atmosphere, this generation       may be committing all of us to severe economic and       environmental disruption without ever having decided that the       value of ``business as usual'' is worth the risks.        Those who believe that these are problems to be dealt with       by future generations are misleading themselves.    Senator John Chafee, 1986.   I yield now to the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations  Committee and honorary Senator pro tempore, Patrick Leahy, here on  behalf of the State of Vermont.    I thank the distinguished Senator from Vermont, who  is not only a towering physical presence on the floor of the Senate but  a towering historic presence on this floor, as well, and brings a rare  and valuable perspective. I appreciate his words so much.   The sad thing that we face is that despite words like those uttered  by Senator John Chafee--``allowing these gases to continue to build in  the atmosphere . . . may be committing all of us to severe economic and  environmental disruption''--or the words in the letter that John Chafee  signed right here and that Senator Leahy's mentor, Bob Stafford, signed  right here back on December 23, 1986, no Republican Senator can utter  those words today. Today's Republican Party will not even acknowledge  that climate change is a serious problem--let alone put forward a  serious proposal to tackle it. Republican Leader Mitch McConnell's  latest trick is to call, for the first time, a climate-related measure  on the Senate floor for his side to vote against it. The leader has not  brought a single piece of climate legislation to the floor for a vote,  ever, until this vote, which he is bringing up for his side to vote  against.   It actually gets worse. Since the infamous Citizens United Supreme  Court decision almost 10 years ago, no Republican in the Senate has  offered or sponsored comprehensive climate legislation to limit carbon  pollution--none.   So we look back with some real sorrow to 1986, when this bipartisan  letter was written. Of course, Minnesota was represented in that letter  by Dave Durenberger, and Minnesota is represented here on the floor  today by Senator Klobuchar.   I yield to her.    Mr. President, let me thank Senator Klobuchar for her  wonderful remarks, and of course Minnesota is a Northern State which  sees this up close all the time.   The Senator spoke of bipartisanship. Do you know who voted with  Senator Chafee for the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990? The Republican  Senate majority leader did, as did a majority of the Republican caucus  in the Senate.   In fact, those powerful 1990 Clean Air Act amendments passed 89 to  10. Where do I go to get a majority leader like that back? Where do I  go to get a Senate Republican Party like that back?  [[Page S1518]]    As late as 2009, Donald Trump published an advertisement in the New  York Times that said that the climate science was ``scientifically  irrefutable''--scientifically irrefutable--and that if we didn't do  anything about it, there would be ``catastrophic and irreversible  consequences for humanity and our planet.'' That is Donald Trump in  2009.   Where do I go to get that Donald Trump back? What happened? In 2007,  when I first joined this body, there were Republicans working on  climate legislation all over the place. Senator Klobuchar and I came  together that year. We had, by my count, five pieces of bipartisan  climate legislation that were working through this body in various  stages in 2007, 2008, and 2009, when Donald Trump put this  advertisement in the New York Times saying that the science was  scientifically irrefutable and the consequences would be catastrophic  and irreversible.   Then came January of 2010. Then came the Citizens United decision.  Then came unlimited and often anonymous fossil fuel money sloshing  around in America's politics and all the threats and promises that  unlimited money allows special interest to engage in. Now, those days,  the Donald Trump of 2009, Republican cooperation of 2007, 2008, and  2009, and of course this letter from as long ago as 1986 seems  impossible, but I hope we can get together. We have to do better than  Republican political mischief on climate change.   Calling up bills that you intend to vote against--give me a break.  Where is the plan, the Republican, conservative, serious plan for  addressing the climate crisis? I will tell you where it is. It is  nowhere. Zero. Nada. Nothing. That has to stop.   Here, on this letter, is one of the most distinguished, wonderful men  ever to serve in the U.S. Senate, Mr. George Mitchell of the State of  Maine, and here, representing him today, is Senator Angus King from the  great State of Maine.   I yield the floor.    I will close out this colloquy by pointing out that  the Republicans of 2007, 2008, and 2009 who were working on climate  legislation before the Citizens United decision have left or died or  gone to ground. It is sad to see. These Republicans of 1986, a third of  a century ago, would be shocked at what has become of their party. So,  today, we, their successors in five of these six States, gathered on  the floor to honor their memory, to mourn what has become in the  intervening years of the Republican Party, and to grieve for what this  body has lost.   I yield the floor.
