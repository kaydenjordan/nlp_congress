 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for making this day  possible. Without the architecture of the work that the House Financial  Services Committee did, the Senate wouldn't be able to come to terms  with this major change to Dodd-Frank.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my Democratic colleagues for  participating in these bipartisan negotiations that made this day  possible.   The long, dark shadow of the financial crisis is over, and  policymakers  [[Page H4343]]  are now shifting to the much-needed reforms we need in our banking  system.    We know that we have fewer community banks now than we did before the  financial crisis, we have fewer community banks now than we did 5 years  ago, and our communities are more starved for capital now than ever  before, especially with the economy changing and economic growth now  coming back to communities across this country.   Now, today, Congress is coming to terms with a bipartisan bill, a  bipartisan approach to make our banking system more inclusive and more  accessible for everyday Americans.   I am proud my provision that I authored, the Supporting America's  Innovators Act, is included, which helps small businesses get the  investments they need to grow and prosper. Those communities have not  been traditionally focused upon by investors.   I am also proud that this bill allows community banks to get into the  business of lending to their community, getting back into the business  of mortgage lending in their communities. And I am proud that this bill  will allow consumers to freeze their credit reports in the event that  there is a data breach or identity theft.   These are bipartisan pieces of this very important package. It is  high time Congress gets on with it and passes this bill. I look forward  to the outcome of today's vote, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes.''
