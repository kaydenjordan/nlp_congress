 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 4366, the  Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act for FY 2024.   I am proud that this legislation fully funds programs to care for our  Nation's heroes, and it ensures that our military infrastructure needs  are met to address critical national security priorities. This bill  focuses on the important work of these agencies while also preventing  the radical woke policies of the Biden administration from distracting  these departments from their primary responsibilities.   A recent example of these policies can be seen in my home State of  Mississippi, where a VA facility chose to replace an American flag with  an LGBTQ Pride flag.   The mission of the VA is to fulfill President Lincoln's promise, a  promise to care for those who have served in our Nation's military,  their families, their caregivers, and their survivors. The work and the  message of the VA should not be divisive but, rather, respectful toward  our veterans and consistent with the purpose for which the VA was  created.   I am grateful that language is included in the bill to ensure that  the only flags flown over VA facilities or national cemeteries are  government, military, or POW/MIA flags.   Mr. Chair, I am proud to support this bill. We owe our veterans a  debt of gratitude, not a political message.
