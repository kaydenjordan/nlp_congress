 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the  American people to express my support for the maintenance of effort of  the robust housing provisions of the Build Back Better Act that is  before us as a body.   I would like to thank the chairwoman of the Financial Services  Committee, a champion for all of us in the United States of America,  but particularly for the poor and disenfranchised.   I rise on behalf of all our American families who are directly  impacted by our affordable housing crisis, and I rise today, Mr.  Speaker, because despite the proposed solutions Democrats fought to  secure in the bill to address our housing crisis head-on, they are at  risk of being eliminated, negotiated away from the revised package.   The housing crisis in America is real and growing exponentially each  and every month. Housing insecurity is very real in the lives of far  too many American families.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my constituents in central and  south Brooklyn who continue to struggle due to the lack of affordable  housing and for whom overdevelopment of market-rate units has created a  gentrification juggernaut that has swollen the ranks of the homeless in  New York City and across this Nation, working families stuck who can't  afford to stay in their apartments but can't afford to leave their  towns.   The effects of gentrification and COVID-19 have truly compounded this  crisis, causing many to be evicted from their homes and experiencing  homelessness at a rate we have never seen, all due to the lack of real  and sustained investment in affordable housing.
