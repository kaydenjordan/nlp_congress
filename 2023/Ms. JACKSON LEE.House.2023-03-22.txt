 Madam Speaker, we can honor Women's History Month in  many different ways, and I rise today to acknowledge women in all walks  of life and around the world.   I particularly want to mention a crisis that involves women in my  Congressional District.   Can you imagine the State of Texas attempting to take over the  largest school district in our State, and the seventh or eighth largest  school district, the Houston Independent School District.   Why women? Because parents, many of them single household, women.  Teachers, women. Support staff, women. Cafeteria workers, women--women  who love the children and wonder why a State would eliminate the school  board--which by the way, has the largest number of women as school  board members on the Houston Independent School Board District.   There is no definable reason to take over a district that has a C  rating for one school, an overall B plus, a Chinese immersion school, a  Arabic immersion school, an art and professional school, virtual arts,  and as well children performing after the pandemic.   When I met with the parents at this meeting that was being held, they  asked why. They were women.   Madam Speaker, I stand with them.   We will fight against the takeover, and I will listen to the women,  the parents of the children of the Houston Independent School District.                            ____________________
