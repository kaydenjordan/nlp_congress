 Mr. President, once again, I come to the floor to call  for action in light of revelations that President Trump appears to have  no problem in seeking the assistance of a foreign government for his  own political gain. Today's summary of the telephone call from the  White House between him and a foreign leader exposes this in black and  white. Given this White House's lack of transparency, I have little  faith that this so-called transcript reflects the totality of the  conversation, but what it did release was shocking enough.   He clearly pressured the Ukrainian Government to investigate former  Vice President Biden for his own political benefit. He mentioned the  Attorney General of the United States or his personal lawyer six times,  and in using the levers of State, the President sought to weaponize the  Justice Department to pursue a personal political vendetta.   We now know that for more than 2 months, the President urged Ukraine  to investigate a political opponent while holding $391 million in  urgently needed security assistance that Congress appropriated to  support U.S. national security interests. In fact, Congress approved  this security assistance,  [[Page S5689]]  including $141.5 million from the U.S. State Department and $250  million from the Pentagon, with overwhelming bipartisan support.   Indeed, for years now, the Republicans and the Democrats have come  together to offer America's support to Ukraine in the face of  relentless Russian aggression. We have stood together on Ukraine  because we have known what has been at stake. Our friends in Ukraine  sit on the frontlines of a struggle against the Kremlin's vision of a  world that is not guided by democratic values or the rule of law but,  instead, ruled by Putin and his corrupt cabal of oligarchs. The  Democrats and the Republicans have stood together behind a free and  independent Ukraine because, together, we stand behind our shared  values of freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and human rights.   We have stood in support of Ukraine in pursuit of our own strategic  interests in the region. That is why we came together when Russian  forces illegally invaded Crimea in 2014 and worked to bolster American  support of Ukrainian sovereignty. I was proud of that moment as the  chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee at the time; that we passed  the Ukraine Freedom Support Act with strong bipartisan support. In an  era of growing political divides, our support for a democratic, free,  and sovereign Ukraine inspired us to transcend partisanship and to work  together in common cause.   I applaud my Republican colleagues who have worked on these efforts,  who have traveled to Ukraine, who have been strong advocates for our  partners, standing up against Kremlin aggression.   That is why it is all the more puzzling that Republicans have largely  been silent over the past few days. Whatever happened to solidarity  with Ukraine? Whatever happened to standing up to Russia? Whatever  happened to putting the national security of the United States ahead of  petty partisan politics?   We have found ourselves with a President in the White House who has  now sought to manipulate aid to Ukraine to advance his own personal  political agenda.   Let's examine what we know.   President Trump admitted that he spoke with President Zelensky and  raised the issue of investigating the family of Vice President Biden.  That was included in today's so-called transcript of the congratulatory  call with President Zelensky.   We know that after Congress appropriated this funding, the Department  of State sent a notation to the White House Office of Budget and  Management on June 21. We know deliberations over this kind of funding  typically just take 5 days. Instead, the White House sat on this  funding for 2 whole months.   My staff met with the State Department last Friday. We tried to glean  what could be the cause for this delay. Did the Department have an  objection to this money moving forward? No, they did not.   Did they know why the White House sat on it for 2 months? No, they  did not.   Did the White House ask them any substantive questions on the  security assistance to Ukraine over these months? No, they did not and  neither did the Defense Department.   In other words, the State Department was unaware of any policy  motivation that could have delayed the dispersal of urgently needed  security funding to Ukraine. There was no policy motivation.   On the contrary, the revelations of the past few days suggest a  political motivation. It appears that President Trump's willingness to  use the powers of his office for grossly inappropriate behavior on the  international stage is pretty vivid.   We need to know exactly who in the Trump administration played a role  in the improper withholding of congressionally appropriated funding for  Ukraine and how. That is why today I am calling for unanimous consent  for my bill, the Ukraine Foreign Assistance Integrity and  Accountability Act of 2019.   This bill would require an inspector general, State Department,  investigation into the Office of Management and Budget's delay in  obligating these funds.   My legislation would require the State Department to share all  records in its role in facilitating the President's personal lawyer's  engagement with the Ukranian Government.   It would require that the administration obligate all Ukranian  security assistance funds and authorize additional funds to counter  Russia malign influence across Europe.   It would also express solidarity with the Ukranian people by imposing  new sanctions on Russia for its continued aggression in eastern  Ukraine. Those sanctions would target Russia's shipping sector,  oligarchs, and cyber attacks.   I want to be clear that I am an advocate of regular order in the  Senate, but we are in a crisis. It is a crisis potentially of  constitutional proportions, a crisis that goes to the heart of our  democracy, and how we respond to it will forever define our willingness  as a Congress to defend the rule of law and live up to our article I  responsibilities.   President Trump has once again stood in the way of congressional  efforts to support Ukraine and all of Europe in the face of Russian  aggression. The administration has once again flouted the rule of law,  this time with the Acting Director of National Intelligence refusing to  disclose to Congress the whistleblower complaint on President Trump's  conversations with President Zelensky--and we don't know what more--as  he is mandated to do.   It is time for this Congress to stand up for its article I powers. We  need to act quickly to send a message to the White House and to the  Kremlin.   If there is anything we have learned from President Trump, it is that  lawlessness begets lawlessness. It is time for us to remind the  American people and the world that the rule of law means something.   We will not allow the corrupting of our national security assistance.  We will not allow our relationship with Ukraine to become a political  football, and we will not let the foreign policy of the United States  be corrupted for campaign purposes.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2537    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Foreign  Relations be discharged from further consideration of S. 2537; that the  Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.    Mr. President, I understand we are supposed to be  heading to a briefing on Iran. I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes,  and then I will cease, and I ask unanimous consent for my entire  remarks to be included in the Record.    No. 1, it is not unusual for--there have been many  times when the urgency of the moment has had legislation come to the  floor. I think this is one of those moments. But I do appreciate the  Chairman's suggesting that he will take up consideration of this issue,  and that is something I think is incredibly important.   On Russia, I would just say the congressionally mandated sanctions,  which the committee and the Congress passed, gave very little  flexibility to the administration and have been the driver on sanctions  on Russia. But  [[Page S5691]]  there is a lot that hasn't been done that Russia has done subsequently,  which we should be ultimately pursuing, and I look forward to the  Chairman's having a markup on DASKAA and other related legislation to  actually continue to fight Russia.   Lastly, I would simply say that holding money from Ukraine doesn't  make other countries give money to Ukraine. That was money that was  directed by the U.S. Congress, which was promoted, as well, by the  State Department and the Department of Defense. They had no concerns  about corruption as it relates to this money. They understood the  importance of the security assistance.   Finally, on the question of the transcript, overwhelmingly, there  wasn't banter there so much as there was a direct effort to get  President Zelensky to use his powers to investigate former Vice  President Biden's son. That is crystal clear, and any plain reading  will do it, and I do hope the American people will read the summary.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, reserving the right to object, every  Member of the Senate knows that Venezuela's illegitimate dictator,  Nicolas Maduro, has created an unprecedented and harrowing humanitarian  crisis in that country. Extreme food and medicine shortages, widespread  criminal violence, and brutal state-sponsored repression have forced  more than 4.3 million Venezuelans to flee their homeland. This number  could be 8 million by the end of next year.   As Venezuelans flee their country, it is time for the United States  to place itself fully on the side of the Venezuelan people.   Unfortunately, just this week we have seen news stories about the  Trump administration deporting Venezuelans from Florida. It is  unconscionable that anyone would be sent back to the catastrophic  humanitarian conditions that exist in Venezuela. That is why, in  February of this year, Senator Durbin and I, along with Senators Rubio,  Leahy, and Booker, introduced bipartisan legislation to provide TPS to  Venezuelans living here in the United States. The House of  Representatives has already passed a version of this bill back in July,  with support from dozens of Republican Members.   However, rather than providing TPS for vulnerable Venezuelans in the  United States, the junior Senator from Florida has brought up an  amendment that seeks to overhaul existing TPS statute and make it  easier for the Trump administration to strip status from vulnerable  migrants who are legally in the United States.   Respectfully, the suggestions that the courts have made it impossible  to end any TPS is just not based in fact. This debate is not about  watering down our immigration laws. It is about using the laws that we  have right now to provide protection to Venezuelans so that we can  ensure that the Trump administration doesn't deport them back to the  nightmare they fled.   While I join the Senator in the same goal, it is unfortunate that the  Senator from Florida would prefer to pass legislation that advances the  administration's immigration agenda rather than help the Venezuelan  people--something we all agree about.   As a matter of fact, we don't even really need congressional action  because the President has the right to give temporary protected status  to the Venezuelans living in the United States and he doesn't need an  act of Congress to do that. He has failed to do that. It is in that  failure that the House of Representatives acted to try to create a  legislative response.   For all these reasons, I object to the unanimous consent request of  the Senator from Florida.    Since the Senator from Florida and I do agree on the  need to provide TPS for Venezuelans, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee  [[Page S5697]]  be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 549, the bill that has  already passed in the House, and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration; further, that the bill be considered read a third time  and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, very briefly, I regret that my colleague  has gone down the road of questioning political motives here.   The reality is, in a bipartisan way, the Senator from Florida joined  with us in February of this year to provide legislation that would  provide TPS for Venezuelans and the United States. The House of  Representatives, which has a Democratic majority--and he mentions the  Democrats--passed a version of this bill in July of this year with the  support from dozens of Republican Members, a bipartisan effort in the  House of Representatives.   At the end of the day, it doesn't take undermining TPS--dramatically  changing TPS--in order to give Venezuelans temporary protected status.  That is something the President could do without having the House of  Representatives or the Senate act, but he has chosen not to. There are  those who want to try to create an excuse for the President, but he has  chosen not to do it, No. 1.   No. 2, the reality is, if we wanted to create TPS for Venezuelans, we  could immediately do that right now by accepting my unanimous consent  request because the House of Representatives passed it with broad,  bipartisan support. We could do it right now. It would be on the way to  the President, and then, of course, he would have to sign the  legislation even though he could do it on his own right now.   I hope we can work toward the goal of actually giving the Venezuelans  that opportunity who are living in the United States and seeking refuge  from the violence, from the chaos that is Venezuela, but I am not ready  to undermine all of the temporary protected status in order to do that.   I yield the floor.
