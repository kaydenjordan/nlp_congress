 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the rule that  includes consideration of the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act, an  important step to ensuring America's children have access to healthy,  nutritious options in their school cafeterias.   I represent the southern tier of New York, known for its proud  tradition of dairy farming. Today, the southern tier is one of the top  dairy-producing areas of the country. The entire Nation, including our  Nation's children, depend on the ability of farmers to make ends meet  and to get their products onto shelves, whether it is in our grocery  stores or our school cafeterias.    Time and again, we have listened to the challenges dairy farmers are  facing, from regulatory overreach, including from the Biden  administration, to the volatility in the marketplace that is putting  their long-term survival at risk.   The Biden administration's latest changes to the USDA Dietary  Guidelines, restricting access to whole milk for children in school  cafeterias, are certainly not helpful either.   Contrary to what this administration claims, the science is  indisputable here. Milk provides essential minerals and nutrients for  growing children. Sadly, thanks to the overreaching policies of  bureaucrats here in Washington, the vast majority of America's children  are unable to meet the recommended levels of dairy consumption  necessary for their health and growth.   Mr. Speaker, we need to ensure that all milk options, including whole  milk produced by dairy farmers like those in New York's southern tier,  are available to America's kids in school. That starts by passing H.R.  1147 and reversing the Biden administration's scientifically  unsubstantiated Dietary Guidelines.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Whole Milk for  Healthy Kids Act. As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, I  look forward to supporting this legislation and ensuring that we don't  take healthy, nutritious whole milk from America's kids.
