 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize an Idaho  educator who has committed himself with distinction to mentoring some  of my State's brightest students. Since 1993, Dr. Jasper LiCalzi has  been a member of the College of Idaho faculty, most recently as the  chair of the Department of Political Economy. There he offers courses  on national government institutions, State and local politics, and  public policy issues such as healthcare, the environment, and  macroeconomics.   Dr. LiCalzi's research at the College of Idaho has concentrated on  interest groups in Idaho and the Idaho State Legislature. He recently  completed a book, ``Idaho Politics and Government: Culture Clash and  Conflicting Values in the Gem State''. The book examines governmental  and political institutions in Idaho through the prism of political  culture.   Dr. LiCalzi is also the political analyst for KIVI Channel Six in  Boise, ID, and is frequently featured as an expert on political economy  by radio and newspapers both locally and nationally. He is also a  member of the advisory board for the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy.   As Governor and U.S. Senator, I have had the pleasure of hiring many  students of Dr. LiCalzi's as staff members, from interns to the highest  leadership positions. His dedication and quality of education was  apparent in each and every one of them.   After a generation of educating Idaho's brightest, he has announced  his much deserved retirement. Beyond the classroom, Dr. LiCalzi has set  the bar for what a college mentor should be. It is not unusual to find  him outside the classroom most nights advising student groups, cheering  for the ``Yotes'' and contributing to the community of Caldwell, ID.   Finally, Mr. President, those of us in this business know you cannot  do it without support and great advice, and the best advice comes from  your wife. I would be remiss not to pay tribute today to Dr. LiCalzi's  wife, Deborah. At every turn, she has been standing next to Dr.  LiCalzi, many times cheering louder than he. Their decades of marriage  and commitment to each other exceed even the high accomplishments Dr.  LiCalzi has made at the College of Idaho.   The College of Idaho and the State of Idaho have been made a better  place due to the career and commitment of Dr. and Mrs. LiCalzi.                            ____________________
