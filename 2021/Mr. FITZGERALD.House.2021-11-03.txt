 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Miller for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, our Nation's students are the future. They are our  future police officers, doctors, technicians, and manufacturers. And to  accomplish this, students will need localized education that is  sensitive to the thoughts and concerns of students, parents, and  teachers. That is the system we have had in the United States of  America for many years.   But lo and behold, inside this multitrillion-dollar infrastructure  budget reconciliation package that is being crafted right now, as we  stand here this evening, there are plans--and I don't want to blow this  out of proportion--to nationalize and radicalize our Nation's education  system.   The Washington takeover of education would give the Biden  administration unprecedented levels of Federal oversight and the  ability to approve early education standards and provide childcare to  wealthy families while pushing small providers out of the market.   This proposal comes at a time when across the country parents are  already feeling a little bit cast aside or excluded from some of the  major decisions that are being made in their children's education.   Students are being taught divisive and harmful curriculum. The one  that is obviously at the forefront is CRT. When parents come to their  local school board meetings to express their concerns, they have been  met with hostility, and in some cases--extreme cases--they arrested a  parent. It is crazy.   This is especially important for parents in Wisconsin, my home State.  Parents are fed up with the bureaucracy telling them they--not the  parents--know better. And when parents ask  [[Page H6168]]  what their children are being taught, they often get a very limited and  unsatisfactory response.   So I came up, along with some of my colleagues, with a bill that we  thought made sense; very easy, common sunshine-type of bill that  ultimately would resolve many of these issues. We call it the CRT  Transparency Act.   Madam Speaker, the bill requires schools to post their curriculums  online so that parents can see what their students are being taught.  Seems simple to me. Just post it online. You have got nothing to hide.  It gives the parents the opportunity to see exactly what their children  are being taught.                                time  1745    The merits of this bill, I think, would ultimately warrant no  controversy. The bill doesn't ask school boards to make private  information public. Elementary and secondary curriculums are already  public information. The parents who wish to call their school districts  and inquire can do that. The problem is, the onus should not be on the  parents to jump through hoops to get this information. No matter what  the class may be, the bottom line is that the parents have the right to  easily access this information.   If schools aren't teaching divisive and backward curriculum, then  there should be absolutely no reason not to make this information  public. I have spoken to local education leaders back in southeastern  Wisconsin, the Fifth Congressional District, who agree with the  commonsense sentiment behind the proposals. Unfortunately, I think that  President Biden, the Secretary of Education, and the Democrats don't  agree, necessarily, with the parents having that much input. They  certainly believe that they could bring influence to that entire  educational system, which is not something they want.   That is why the attorney general issued a memo instructing the  Justice Department to investigate parents speaking up at the local  school boards. This is wrong. Despite what my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle may believe, parents do have the right to speak up at  school board meetings and complain and be vocal about what their  children are being taught. In fact, this is the hallmark of being a  good parent, right? You just don't want to send your kid off to class  and not be involved in what they are involved in every day.   What we saw in Virginia last night sent an undeniably clear message.  Those who embrace radical education policies and box out our parents do  not represent what the American people want.   My colleagues across the aisle want you to believe that they  prioritize students and education, but the text of this budget  reconciliation will tell a very different narrative. A narrative that  expands the Federal Government's role in education at the expense of  good parenting and student outcomes.   I, and I think my Republican colleagues, will oppose any proposal  that puts the bureaucracy before students.
