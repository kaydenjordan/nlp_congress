 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, the 118th Congress is in full  swing now. We are here working full time again for the American people.   I just wanted to take a few moments tonight here on the House floor  to clarify some things about how this new Congress has begun.   I point out, first, for scheduling purposes, of course, the State of  the Union is next week. It is a time for the President to take stock  and speak to the American people about where our country is today and  where we are heading.   I hope the President is able to make good use of the opportunity, but  I am afraid we are going to be subjected to more spin and few solutions  to the major challenges, even the crises facing the American people.   Mr. Speaker, much has been made by the Democrats and the press about  how House Republicans have kicked off the 118th Congress, but we all  know the chatter is not an accurate representation of what is really  going on around here.   The cameras don't capture it all. We are delighted that the C-SPAN  cameras are roving about the floor now. It gives a little more personal  view of what is happening here in the Chamber, but so much of what goes  on outside these walls is not apparent to the American people.   Let's be plain about this. Let's put it plainly in real terms what is  actually happening now. There are some real reforms that have been  brought forward by the new House Republican majority.   We now have a much more open legislative process. As I explained to  some friends back home over the weekend, we all remember the cartoon. I  am 51 years old. We remember the cartoon Saturday mornings, ``I am just  a bill on Capitol Hill,'' and it explained how a bill becomes a law. I  explained to our friends from Louisiana who were in town that that has  not actually been the way a bill becomes a law in this Congress for  several years now.   We are getting back to that process. We are getting back to what we  were taught in civics about how this is supposed to work. Bills have to  be limited now to one single subject. We will no longer vote on a bill  without giving Members at least 72 hours' notice to review it first.  What a concept. You might have to actually read that legislation before  you vote on it.   This is an important change: Any tax increase must now meet a higher  threshold to pass. It was a simple majority, but now it is a two-thirds  vote. That is a really important reform for the American people, given  the state of the economy.   There will be no new mandatory Federal spending increases without  equal or greater budget offsets. We have a $31.5 trillion Federal debt.  We cannot continue on this trajectory. These reforms are really  important for us.   By the way, remote voting and committee work are finally ended. No  longer will you see Members phoning in their work. They have to be  here. They have to come to work.   Let's contrast that with the old way of doing business. Under the  previous leadership of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi--the Democrats had  been in charge here for 4 years--we had bills written behind closed  doors, sometimes literally by just a handful of people. The bills were  loaded up with unrelated policies. These bills were unveiled, then  brought for a remote vote before anybody could possibly read them, much  less debate or amend the legislation.   We all know the Democrats are obsessed with having a top-down  approach to legislating. I mean, they have all but shouted it from the  rooftops over the past few weeks. Sure, that might have made former  Speaker Pelosi's job easier, but it was not good for the American  people. It was not good for the country. It was not good for this  revered institution.   I suspect if you ask the American people, they would all agree. This  is just common sense. We are restoring common sense here. We made  commitments to America, and we are going to fulfill them.   Here is the reality: House Republicans have started this year by  instituting the most positive reforms to this House in a generation.  With Republicans back in charge, the status  [[Page H618]]  quo, where there is no transparency, no accountability, outright  disregard for regular order, is finally over, and that is a very, very  good thing for the country.   Mr. Speaker, this week we are voting to end the COVID pandemic  emergency order. This is one of the topics we have taken up, we have  committed to the American people that we would do it when we started  the Congress, and we have.   President Biden has said the pandemic is over. His press secretary  says it isn't. Since the White House couldn't get its story straight,  we voted now to put an end to the public health emergency declaration.  Since the pandemic is over, the emergency declaration should be over as  well.   Mr. Speaker, this week we are also passing the SHOW UP Act. Talk  about something that is popular with the American people. This House  has ended remote work in this body, the Senate did it long ago across  the hall, and now we are voting to do the same thing for the remainder  of the Federal Government. It is beyond time to require that the  teleworking Federal employees return to work in order to remedy  widespread terribly poor customer service.   Consider this: The IRS, just the IRS, they have a backlog right now  of more than 8 million tax returns from 2021. Prior to widespread  teleworking, the backlog was approximately just 1 million. That is an  unacceptable thing. We have Federal employees at all these agencies who  literally have not come to work. Well, we are going to end that. It is  clear that these backlogs and customer service problems are due at  least in part to ongoing teleworking policies, even as the pandemic is  now in the rearview mirror.   Mr. Speaker, with Republicans back in charge, I could give you many  examples of things that are going to be improving around here. That is  just a couple. The House is back to work, and we intend to get the rest  of the government back to work for the American people as well, whether  all of our colleagues like that or not.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of  California (Mr. Kiley), my new colleague on the House Judiciary  Committee, to discuss another important issue from this week.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the  gentleman from Wisconsin. That is very well said. The evils of  socialism have crept into all manner of our politics and areas of our  culture.   Mr. Speaker, I will end our Special Order hour by just reminding the  American people here watching and keeping track of this, that again, as  I said in the opening, the Republican majority is in charge. The  Congress is now fully operational and we are back to work for the  American people.   Every week now, we will be passing substantive legislation that will  send a message to the people that there is a new sheriff in town.   Today, in our House Committee on the Judiciary, we had an hour's long  hearing on the catastrophe at the border, hearing from those who are  down there contending with that situation every single day. The  hearings like that one will lead us to legislative repairs for some of  these problems that have been created by the Biden administration and  the Democrats in charge here the last couple of years.   This week, we are voting to end the COVID pandemic emergency order at  long last. We are passing the SHOW UP Act to get all these Federal  employees back to work. And as Mr. Grothman indicated, tomorrow we will  be voting to condemn socialism.   There is going to be a dramatic change between the Republicans in  charge of this House and the Democrats. We are grateful for the  opportunity to lead. We will do that every day and we will make the  American people proud with our policy reforms and our process reforms.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
