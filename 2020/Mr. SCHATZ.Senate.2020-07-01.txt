 Mr. President, today is the 1st of the month, and that  means the rent is due, but for the 9 million renters who have lost  their jobs, they may not be able to pay.   Now, in March, we made sure that the CARES Act included cash  assistance, unemployment benefits, and suspensions on evictions and  mortgage forbearance to help the people who have been hurt the most by  this pandemic. Lots of States and counties have set up their own  programs, either subsidies or prohibitions on evictions themselves, but  we are now 3 months later, and unemployment benefits stand to expire at  the end of this month and moratoriums that allowed families to stay in  their homes are ending. Eviction courts are reopening. Think about  that. Eviction courts are reopening.   So what we are facing is a ticking timebomb. We are facing the fact  that it is true that people got forbearance on their rent or  forbearance on their mortgage, but I remember very well in March and  April, as I explained to the people of Hawaii, you are getting  forbearance not forgiveness, which means you just simply don't have to  pay your mortgage or your rent this month. You do have to eventually  pay your mortgage or your rent.   So what is going to happen is, for the most economically challenged  among us in the United States, they are going to face a huge  backpayment at the beginning of August or the beginning of September,  and they are going to lose the place they live in.   Now, I am very, very hopeful that cooler heads will prevail and that  we will intervene in July and incorporate the legislation Senator Brown  is leading because the rent is going to be due, and we are going to-- just as we faced this pandemic square in the eyes, we are going to be  facing a massive eviction crisis. We have to take action.   I yield the floor.
