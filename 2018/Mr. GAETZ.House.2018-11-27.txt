 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express our support for our  great ally, Israel, and also to share my concern about a recent  decision from the company Airbnb.   On November 20, Airbnb made the decision to delist about 200 Jewish  homes in the West Bank. This decision is a win for the boycott,  divestment, and sanctions movement, the BDS movement, which is  blatantly anti-Semitic and consistently targets businesses that are  operating in Israel.   As a Representative from northwest Florida, I am proud to serve a  State that has stringent BDS laws. I am incredibly proud of Governor- elect Ron DeSantis for sharing his concern and for stating  unequivocally that if Airbnb continues to engage in BDS activities,  they have a right to speak, but they will hear from all of us very  soon.                            ____________________
