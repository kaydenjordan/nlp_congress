 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud how the  Inflation Reduction Act is delivering for our country and California's  37th Congressional District.   I am proud of the work that California has already done to be a  leader in renewable energy. With key investments from the Inflation  Reduction Act, our country can benefit from a clean energy market that  puts our workers first and brings the United States into the 21st  century.   The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act has already created $242  billion in new investments with $5.45 billion announced in my State  alone for clean energy and manufacturing projects.   It has already created 142,000 new jobs across 41 States: red, blue,  and purple. The IRA is projected to create 9 million new, good-paying  jobs for Americans over the next decade, but that is not all it will  do.   It will help us achieve our climate goals, boost clean technology  manufacturing, make EVs more accessible and affordable, ensure families  breathe clean air and drink clean water, and make gains toward  environmental justice for historically forgotten communities.   What does this look like for my community?   It is funding for air quality monitoring grants in historically  disadvantaged communities, clean schoolbuses for our children, and low- emission public transportation in Los Angeles.   After years of insufficient Federal action to address our climate  crisis, Democrats came together to enact this historic law, and we  cannot go back.   Unfortunately, Republicans prefer to help their corporate polluter  friends roll back environmental safeguards and are currently working to  use our economy as a bargaining chip to erase major clean energy  provisions in the IRA through debt limit discussions.   If the Speaker and his ultra-MAGA colleagues got their way, they  would inflict dire consequences on our efforts to stop the worst of  climate change from happening.   They would end renewable energy credits for wind and solar, limit  rooftop solar growth in homes and businesses, stop the expansion of  electric vehicle sales and EV charging stations, repeal funding for  low-income communities that was intended to address pollution, and  repeal the Methane Emissions Reduction Program.   These are investments in clean energy that have largely benefited  Republican districts, even though they won't admit it, and Republican  actions today will take away the wealth and economic opportunity from  everyday American households.   This law is our strongest chance to create a safer, healthier Nation  for our  [[Page H2508]]  children and families and regain credibility with allies around the  world.   We cannot allow Republicans to take us back to a time where fossil  fuels and toxic policy decisions hold hostage our health and economy.  Congress must pass a clean debt limit increase now.                Recognizing May as National Foster Care Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize May as  National Foster Care Month. Nearly 500,000 children fall under the care  of our foster system.   As overseers of their welfare, Congress has a sacred duty to support  these children and those who work tirelessly on their behalf to ensure  that they have safe and loving homes.   Our child welfare system is in desperate need of reform. We must have  supportive policies that fairly compensate social workers and invest in  the needs of our children.   Supporting the growth and development of a child and giving them safe  shelter are incredibly important tasks that have fallen by the wayside.   Foster youth are feeling the economic impacts of the COVID-19  pandemic, alongside the disparities they face in education, healthcare,  and employment.   This is why I joined my colleagues in the Caucus on Foster Youth to  introduce a resolution to recognize the month of May as National Foster  Care Month.   I will continue to raise awareness around our foster care system and  the work of selfless social workers and advocates.   If we want to talk about adoption and providing for our children, we  must take a real and lasting look at the problems we are facing and  come together to work on solutions.                            ____________________
