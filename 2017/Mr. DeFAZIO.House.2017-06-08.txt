 Mr. Chair, In 2008, Wall Street's criminal behavior  drove the economy into the greatest financial crisis since the Great  Depression, creating the grossly unbalanced playing field that is our  economy today. In response, Congress passed the Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) in 2010. While Dodd-Frank fell  short on major banking reforms, I supported it because it was better  than no reforms at all.   I am appalled that House Republicans pushed through the Financial  CHOICE Act, which would gut major provisions of Dodd-Frank and allow  Wall Street to return to the same reckless practices that occurred  before the law was passed. The Financial CHOICE Act removes the  watchdog from Wall Street, opening the door to destructive trading at  the expense of pension funds, value investors, and average Americans.   Additionally, those on Wall Street who broke the law and used  Americans' investments as a casino should be held accountable for their  deceptive actions, including jail time. Yet, to this day, no Wall  Street executive has seen jail time for the damage they did on our  financial system. Instead, Wall Street executives are being rewarded  with powerful jobs in the Trump administration.   It is outrageous that Republicans want to allow the banking sector to  return to ``business as usual'' with dangerous financial products and  high-speed speculation. We need stronger, not weaker, financial  reforms, which is why I'm taking on reckless Wall Street trading with  my `Putting Main Street FIRST Act' legislation to discourage  speculative trading by imposing a tax of a fraction of a percent on  stock, bond, and derivative trades. Congress should be fighting for the  interests of the American people, not Wall Street.
