 Madam President, the bill that we will be voting on  shortly reflects intense bipartisan collaboration here in the Senate,  the type of collaboration that we need to see a lot more of in this  institution.   I share a lot of credit--let me put it differently. I thank the  coleads, Senator Murray and Senator Collins, for working so hard to get  all the appropriation bills out of committee and finding a path forward  for us to make sure that, with the CR, we can keep the government open.   It doesn't have things in it that I would like--a lot more disaster  aid for folks around the country, a lot more support for Ukraine. But I  think it represents exactly the type of modest package that is  appropriate at this moment, while, as the chair of Appropriations  pointed out, we will continue to work together in the month to come to  pass the actual appropriation bills.   The issue that I am very concerned about on the House side right now  is that they are taking and putting together a package that has no  support for Ukraine and that bans the administration from moving funds  throughout the Defense Department and the State Department to be able  to support Ukraine.   If you want China and Russia being No. 1 and No. 2 in the world, then  that would be the path to go. If you want to have dictatorships,  authoritarian governments crush democracy, then that would be the way  to go.   But I want our vision of a republic, our vision of a democracy, our  vision of a state that has freedom of speech and freedom of assembly to  be able to be the model that expands freedom in this world.   Let's support this package before us, and let's support a package  that has both disaster aid and aid for Ukraine.   I yield the floor.
