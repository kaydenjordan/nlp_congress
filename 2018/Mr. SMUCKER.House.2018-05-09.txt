 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Nurses  Week, a celebration of our dedicated healthcare professionals  throughout our country.   National Nurses Week begins each year on May 6 and ends on May 12,  which is the birthday of Florence Nightingale, widely considered the  founder of modern nursing.   National Nurses Week was first celebrated in 1954, in honor of the  centennial anniversary of Ms. Nightingale's renowned humanitarian  mission during the Crimean War.   In 1982, President Ronald Reagan signed a proclamation officially  proclaiming May 6 as the national day of recognition for nurses.   During my time in Congress, Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege to  meet with nurses and nursing associations from central Pennsylvania and  to hear from them about their critical work around the Commonwealth.  The tremendous impact that these nurses have on our entire medical  system through their passionate work never ceases to amaze me.   I am extraordinarily grateful that Pennsylvania ranks fourth among  all States in the number of professionally active nurses, with nearly  220,000 currently serving our great Commonwealth. Hospitals and medical  clinics certainly couldn't operate without them. Their tireless  dedication to the well-being of our children, parents, spouses, and  friends supports and strengthens our local communities every single  day.   I would also like to thank the families, educators, and medical  facilities that have allowed these wonderful healthcare professionals  to flourish in their selfless vocation.                            ____________________
