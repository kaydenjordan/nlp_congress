 I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back.    Mr. President, next Tuesday, June 21, there will  be a memorial service to honor Stephen H. Sachs, who died on January 12  at his home in Baltimore at the age of 87. Steve Sachs was U.S.  Attorney for Maryland for 3 years and Maryland's Attorney General for  two terms. He was one of the finest lawyers in the Nation--a proud son  of Maryland, a proud son of Baltimore. He was an indefatigable, ever  optimistic Orioles fan. He had a brilliant intellect and a sparkling  sense of humor.   Steve was born in Baltimore on January 31, 1934. His father was  director of the Baltimore Jewish Council and a labor arbitrator, and  his mother was a homemaker. Steve received a bachelor's degree in 1954  from Haverford College and then served in the Army from 1955 to 1957.  He received a Fulbright scholarship to study at the University of  Oxford in England. He received his law degree from Yale Law School in  1960. He worked as a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the  District of Maryland. In 1967, then-President Lyndon Johnson appointed  Steve as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, a position he  held until 1970.   Steve prosecuted cases involving white-collar crime and public  corruption. In 1968, he prosecuted Vietnam war protesters known as the  Catonsville Nine, Roman Catholic anti-war activists who broke into the  Selective Service office in Catonsville, MD, in an attempt to destroy  draft records. It was a high-profile case. The Rev. Daniel Berrigan and  his brother, the Rev. Philip Berrigan, led activists on a raid at Draft  Board 33 in Catonsville. Steve secured a guilty verdict in Federal  court for destroying government property.   Fifty years later, in a retrospective article in the ``Baltimore  Sun'', Steve wrote with a searing honesty, ``I believed then, and  believe now, that the nine were brave men and women who acted out of a  conviction that the war in Vietnam was profoundly evil. But I believed  then, and I believe now, that the conduct of the nine--particularly  their insistence that their action at Catonsville should have been  condoned because they were `right'--offends both the rule of law and a  fundamental tenet of the American democracy.'' I think that statement  captures Steve's character perfectly.   Steve was in private practice from 1970 to 1978 when he ran an  outsider campaign to become Maryland's Attorney General. He didn't  align himself with any gubernatorial candidate, which had been the  practice. He stated, ``The attorney general should be independent. The  attorney general should be the people's lawyer.'' After several public  corruption scandals, Marylanders appreciated Steve's unquestioned  integrity and were receptive to his activist, reform-oriented campaign.  He served two terms as Attorney General and practically reinvented the  position. He established a strong Consumer Protection Division within  the Office of Attorney General that assisted Marylanders against  corporate abuse. As the State's Attorney General, he argued three cases  before the U.S. Supreme Court--and won all three. Steve's 8 years as  Attorney General overlapped with my service as speaker of the house of  delegates, where I had the benefit of Steven's excellent counsel.   In 1986, Steve decided to run for Governor, but he lost the  Democratic primary to then-Baltimore mayor William Donald Schaefer.  After that defeat, Steve returned to private practice as a partner in  the Washington, DC, office of Wilmer-Hale, then known as Wilmer, Cutler  & Pickering. He retired from the firm in 1999.   Steve's political career may have officially ``ended'' when he was  just 52, but over the years, he became an elder statesman of Maryland  politics. As his former colleagues at Wilmer-Hale said, ``Steve was an  elegant writer, a powerful advocate and an extremely accomplished trial  lawyer. He was a generous partner, colleague and mentor. He taught a  generation of lawyers how to write a brief, take a deposition and try a  case . . . He was a mensch.''   Steve's passion for justice never waned. After he retired from  Wilmer-Hale, he joined the Public Justice Center, where he had a  significant impact on the development of the center's Appellate  Advocacy Project. Steve was a passionate advocate of the civil right to  counsel movement, helping to establish the National Coalition for a  Civil Right to Counsel. In 2008, then-Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley  appointed Steve to head an independent  [[Page S2963]]  review of the Maryland State Police, which had infiltrated activist  groups that were lawfully protesting against the death penalty and the  war in Iraq.   Steve may be gone, but his legacy is firmly established. Last Friday,  I had the honor of attending the investiture of Erek Baron as the first  Black U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland. Erek is just one of  Steve's countless proteges carrying on his mission. Erek said, ``Steve  Sachs was one of the most respected public servants in Maryland's  history and a personal mentor to me and many others.''   Deuteronomy 16:20 implores us, ``Justice, justice you shall pursue .  . .''. That was Steve Sachs' guiding principle. He did all he could to  make the world a better place. It wasn't always easy or comfortable,  but he understood the importance of justice under the law. I respected  his legal passion, and I am grateful that he shared it with generations  of Maryland attorneys as a mentor and a friend. On behalf of the  Senate, I send my condolences to his daughter Elisabeth Sachs, his son  Leon Sachs, his three grandchildren, and other family members and all  those who were fortunate to have him as a friend, colleague, or mentor  and mourn his passing.                            ____________________
