 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 229, I  call up the bill (H.R. 1430) to prohibit the Environmental Protection  Agency from proposing, finalizing, or disseminating regulations or  assessments based upon science that is not transparent or reproducible,  and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 229, the bill  is considered read.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1430         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Honest and Open New EPA       Science Treatment Act of 2017'' or the ``HONEST Act''.       SEC. 2. DATA TRANSPARENCY.         Section 6(b) of the Environmental Research, Development,       and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 4363       note) is amended to read as follows:        ``(b)(1) The Administrator shall not propose, finalize, or       disseminate a covered action unless all scientific and       technical information relied on to support such covered       action is--        ``(A) the best available science;        ``(B) specifically identified; and        ``(C) publicly available online in a manner that is       sufficient for independent analysis and substantial       reproduction of research results, except that any personally       identifiable information, trade secrets, or commercial or       financial information obtained from a person and privileged       or confidential, shall be redacted prior to public       availability.        ``(2) The redacted information described in paragraph       (1)(C) shall be disclosed to a person only after such person       signs a written confidentiality agreement with the       Administrator, subject to guidance to be developed by the       Administrator.        ``(3) Nothing in the subsection shall be construed as--        ``(A) requiring the Administrator to disseminate scientific       and technical information;        ``(B) superseding any nondiscretionary statutory       requirement; or        ``(C) requiring the Administrator to repeal, reissue, or       modify a regulation in effect on the date of enactment of the       Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017.        ``(4) In this subsection--        ``(A) the term `covered action' means a risk, exposure, or       hazard assessment, criteria document, standard, limitation,       regulation, regulatory impact analysis, or guidance; and        ``(B) the term `scientific and technical information'       includes--        ``(i) materials, data, and associated protocols necessary       to understand, assess, and extend conclusions;        ``(ii) computer codes and models involved in the creation       and analysis of such information;        ``(iii) recorded factual materials; and        ``(iv) detailed descriptions of how to access and use such       information.        ``(5) The Administrator shall carry out this subsection in       a manner that does not exceed $1,000,000 per fiscal year, to       be derived from amounts otherwise authorized to be       appropriated.''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 229, the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Eddie Bernice Johnson) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 1430.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 1430.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1430, the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment  Act of 2017, or HONEST Act, requires the Environmental Protection  Agency to base its regulations on science that is publicly available.   Why would anyone want to hide this information from the American  people?   I thank former Science Committee member and former Environment  Subcommittee Chairman David Schweikert for his longtime commitment to  this issue, and for sponsoring the Secret Science Reform Act in the  113th Congress. In the last Congress, a similar bill passed the House  with bipartisan support. Our goal is to help advance not just any  science, but the best science.   The HONEST Act is a nonpartisan bill: a change in administration does  not affect the public's right to know and see the science behind the  EPA's regulations.   This legislation ensures that sound science is the basis for EPA  decisions and regulatory actions. The days of ``trust-me science'' are  over. In our modern Information Age, Federal regulations should be  based only upon data that is available for every American to see, and  that can be subjected to independent review. That is called the  scientific method.   We can all agree that the government should rely on the best  available science. Unfortunately, the government does not always hold  to this standard. Looking at the EPA's past record, it is clear that  the Agency has not followed an open and honest process. For example,  many major air-quality regulations from the previous administration  were justified by data that the EPA said they had not seen, even though  they proposed the regulation.   This means that the EPA's claims about the cost and benefits of its  regulations and the real risk they are meant to address cannot be  independently verified by unbiased experts. If the EPA's mandates  really are based on sound science, then the American people should be  allowed to see the data. The EPA's past refusal to cooperate, leads to  the question: What have they been hiding?   Americans have a right to be suspicious.   Mr. Speaker, we all care about the environment, but if policies are  not based on legitimate science, regulations will result in economic  hardship with little or no environmental benefits. In other words, the  regulations would be all pain and no gain.   This bill strengthens the previous House-passed legislation of the  last Congress, the Secret Science Reform Act. That bill also required  the EPA to base its decisions on information fully available to  scientists and the American people.   You may hear from opponents of this legislation that it costs too  much money. That is based on a CBO estimate from 2 years ago that  misinterprets the implementation requirements of the bill. CBO has not  reissued that misinterpretation this year after consulting with the  EPA.   All the HONEST Act requires is that the EPA use science that is  publicly available, not make all science public itself. So the cost is  negligible.   Some critics may claim that it puts personal data at risk. This is  false. The HONEST Act specifically requires  [[Page H2537]]  redactions of personally identifiable information and confidential  business information.   It is also misleading to assert that the bill tells scientists how to  conduct science. The opposite is true. The bill reinforces the  scientific method and its tenets of observing, hypothesizing, testing,  gathering and sharing data, and analyzing and challenging the resulting  theories. It allows independent researchers to evaluate the studies  that the EPA uses to justify its regulations.   The HONEST Act promotes sound science and restores confidence in the  EPA decisionmaking process.   Finally, the HONEST Act ensures that the EPA is not promoting a one- sided ideological agenda. The legislation provides for the type of open  and accountable government that the American people want and deserve.   You are either for an open and honest government, or you are not. If  you are, then support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1430, the so-called HONEST Act.  This is the third time the majority has tried to move this misguided  legislation, which was formerly known as the Secret Science Reform Act.   Unfortunately, in this case, the third time is not the charm. The  Secret Science bills that the Republicans tried to enact over the  previous two Congresses were insidious bills designed, from the outset,  to prevent the EPA from using the best available science to meet its  obligations under the law. Those bills were constructed to hamstring  the ability of the EPA to do just about anything to protect the  American public.   As the American Lung Association said at the time: ``The legislation  will not improve EPA's actions; rather, it will stifle public health  protections.''   The HONEST Act, if anything, is even worse than those two previous  bills. There are several reasons for this. Like the prior Secret  Science bills, the HONEST Act requires the EPA to release the  underlying data from any science that is relied upon when taking  action. This would cause a host of cascading problems for the Agency,  which is, of course, the real reason they are pushing this bill.    First, the EPA relies upon science drawn from many sources. Since EPA  does not own or control the data for most of these scientific sources,  the EPA would have no authority to order the public release of such  data. This would preclude the EPA from using the vast majority of peer- reviewed science in existence today.   Second, under the HONEST Act, scientific studies relied upon by the  EPA must be reproducible from the data that is publicly released.  However, the EPA frequently investigates and relies upon scientific  studies that are inherently not reproducible.   For instance, the EPA might study natural or manmade environmental  disasters, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, to better  understand the effects on the environment and to improve disaster  response. Under this bill, the EPA couldn't use this type of  information at all.   These problems with the legislation were apparently not enough for my  Republican colleagues. They have worked hard to make the bill even  worse this Congress. The newest addition to the bill would permit the  EPA to redact from public disclosure confidential information, such as  trade secrets and public health information. However, the bill then  sets up an unrestricted process whereby anyone who signs a  confidentiality agreement can access any restricted information in the  EPA's possession.   This provision is a Pandora's box, which could have untold  consequences for the EPA, industry, and the general public. First, the  EPA will find it much more difficult to collect scientific data in the  first instance if people think it will be disclosed at will. This will  cripple the EPA's ability to conduct their own science, which is  important since the rest of the HONEST Act essentially places all non- EPA science off limits.   This provision is also in direct conflict with any number of other  Federal laws, like the Freedom of Information Act, and HIPAA. The bill  provides no guidance to the Agency on how to navigate the minefield it  creates, which will surely lead to a morass of lawsuits and legal bills  for the EPA.   Finally, this provision places no restrictions on who can access  restricted information. For instance, could a chemical manufacturer  obtain access to the trade secrets of a competitor simply by signing a  confidentiality agreement? Could insurance companies seek the health  information of potential customers?   The potential for abuses with this provision are endless.   In a day and age when the most valuable commodity on the black market  is personal information and trade secrets, it is unconscionable that we  are providing an easily accessible source for criminals around the  world.   Finally, the HONEST Act also foists upon the EPA a massive unfunded  mandate. While we have no CBO cost estimate for this bill, prior  versions were estimated to cost the EPA $250 million per year. However,  the bill restricts the EPA to spending only $1 million to implement its  provisions. In essence, this hits the EPA with a $249 million unfunded  mandate every year.   If that were not bad enough, this bill comes in the face of massive  proposed budget cuts to the EPA's science program by the Trump  administration.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans claim that this bill is just implementing  scientific's best practices. It is odd, then, that a host of scientific  societies and science stakeholder groups have expressed their  opposition to this legislation. This includes the American Association  for the Advancement of Science, the Association of Public and Land- grant Universities, the Association of American Universities; and the  American Chemical Society.   If Republicans don't want to be labeled as flat-Earth science haters,  I think they would want to listen to what scientists say instead of  lecturing them about things they don't understand.   In reality, this bill isn't about science. It is about undermining  public health and the environment. That is why a host of public health  and environmental groups are actively opposing the bill. This includes,  among others, the American Lung Association, the American Thoracic  Society, the American Public Health Association, the Union of Concerned  Scientists, and the Environmental Defense Fund.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record some of the letters I received  in opposition.                                                     March 27, 2017.        Dear Representative: The undersigned health and medical       organizations are writing to express our opposition to the       EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017 and the Honest       and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017. Our       organizations are dedicated to saving lives and improving       public health.        Science is the bedrock of sound medical and public health       decision-making. The best science undergirds everything our       organizations do to improve health. Under the Clean Air Act,       EPA has long implemented a transparent and open process for       seeking advice from the medical and scientific community on       standards and measures to meet those standards. Both of these       bills would restrict the input of scientific experts in the       review of complex issues and add undue industry influence       into EPA's decision-making process.        As written, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act would       make unneeded and unproductive changes that would:        Restrict the ability of scientists to speak on issues that       include their own expertise;        Block scientists who receive any EPA grants from serving on       the EPA Scientific Advisory Board, despite their having the       expertise and conducted relevant research that earned them       these highly competitive grants;        Prevent the EPA Scientific Advisory Board from making       policy recommendations, even though EPA administrators have       regularly sought their advice in the past;        Add a notice and comment component to all parts of the EPA       Scientific Advisory Board actions, a burdensome and       unnecessary requirement since their reviews of major issues       already include public notice and comment; and        Reallocate membership requirements to increase the       influence of industry representatives on the scientific       advisory panels.        In short, EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act would limit       the voice of scientists, restrict the ability of the Board to       respond to important questions, and increase the influence of       industry in shaping EPA policy. This is not in the best       interest of the American public.        We also have concerns with the HONEST Act. This legislation       would limit the kinds of scientific data EPA can use as it       develops policy to protect the American public from  [[Page H2538]]       environmental exposures and permit violation of patient       confidentiality. If enacted, the legislation would:        Allow the EPA administrator to release confidential patient       information to third parties, including industry;        Bolster industry's flawed arguments to discredit research       that documents the adverse health effects of environmental       pollution; and        Impose new standards for the publication and distribution       of scientific research that go beyond the robust, existing       requirements of many scientific journals.        Science, developed by the respected men and women       scientists at colleges and universities across the United       States, has always been the foundation of the nation's       environmental policy. EPA's science-based decision-making       process has saved lives and led to dramatic improvements in       the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the       earth we share. All Americans have benefited from the       research-based scientific advice that scientists have       provided to EPA.        Congress should adopt policy that fortifies our scientists,       not bills that undermine the scientific integrity of EPA's       decision-making or give polluters a disproportionate voice in       EPA's policy-setting process.        We strongly urge you to oppose these bills.            Sincerely,      Katie Huffling, RN, CNM,        Director, Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments.      Harold P.

Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House Majority Whip,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative McCarthy: As leading U.S. science,       engineering, and academic institutions, we are writing to       express our concerns regarding H.R. 1430, the Honest and Open       New EPA Science Treatment (HONEST) Act of 2017. We encourage       you and your colleagues to take additional time to evaluate       the unintended consequences of this bill before considering       it on the House floor. This bill is virtually identical to       the Secret Science Reform Act of the 113th and 114th       Congress, on which we expressed similar concerns that have       remained unchanged.        Of course, regulations and agency actions should be       informed by the best available science and a rigorous       scientific process. Undermining the integrity of the       scientific process, or the ability of federal agencies to       utilize rigorous science in establishing policies, could have       long-term negative consequences. It is with this in mind that       we urge caution in setting laws that submerge science beneath       politics.        The research community is concerned that some key terms in       the bill could be interpreted or misinterpreted, especially       terms such as ``materials,'' ``data,'' and ``reproducible.''       Legislation removing concepts like reproducibility and       independent analysis from the hands of scientists and into       the hands of legislators could undermine the scientific       process and reduce the benefits that science could bring to       society.        With respect to reproducibility of research, it is often       impossible to repeat an experiment down to the last detail.       Some scientific research, especially in areas of public       health, involve longitudinal studies that are so large and of       great duration that they could not realistically be repeated.       Rather, these studies are verified utilizing statistical       modeling or independent data analysis. The same may be true       for scientific data from a one-time event (e.g., Deepwater       Horizon Gulf oil spill) where the data are gathered in real       time. It is unclear if data from studies like these would be       permitted under this bill. As a result, we could foresee a       situation where the EPA would be prevented from using the       best available science and disseminating public information       in a timely fashion.        In addition, H.R. 1430 would give the EPA administrator       sole authority to disclose private information gathered in       research studies, which might include confidential health and       proprietary business information, to anyone who signs a       confidentiality agreement with the EPA. It is unclear whether       the EPA has this authority, and very clear this would deter       individuals and businesses from participating in studies used       by the EPA. This would again constrain the EPA from making a       proposal based on the best available science.        We thank you for your consideration and stand ready to work       with you to evaluate the unintended consequences of this bill       before consideration on the House floor.

Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, for the many reasons  I have spoken about today, I strongly oppose this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to alleviate the ranking member's unfounded  concerns and remind her that the National Academy of Sciences itself  has explained that transparency in science is possible without any risk  to confidentiality or privacy.   This is what the National Academy of Sciences said: ``Nothing in the  past suggests that increasing access to research data without damage to  privacy and confidentiality rights is beyond scientific reach.''   So I hope that will alleviate her concerns. Really, it comes down to  whether you are for an open and honest government or not. That is what  this bill is all about.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Babin), who is the chairman of the Space Subcommittee of the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee.                                time  1400     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. Banks), who is the vice chairman of the Science,  Space, and Technology's Subcommittee on Environment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, I don't see how we can make it more clear to anybody who  brings up the privacy arguments. If they go to lines 17 through 21 of  page 2 of the bill, it states:   `` . . . any personally identifiable information, trade secrets, or  commercial or financial information obtained from a person and  privileged or confidential, shall be redacted prior to public  availability.''   Any misconstruing of that is unfortunate, and it is not an accurate  description of that provision.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  LaHood), who is also the chairman of the Science, Space, and  Technology's Subcommittee on Oversight.   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Lamar Smith for yielding  time and for his leadership on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, my district in central and west central Illinois is home  to some of the most fertile farmland in the entire world. My district  is the ninth largest congressional district in terms of corn and  soybean production. With that said, farming families across the 19  counties I represent are faced every day with burdensome rules and  regulations created by the EPA with little or no transparency into the  data that influenced those regulations in the first place.   These rules and regulations have and continue to cause real-world  consequences to the agriculture community. Moreover, these EPA  directives have far greater reach outside the realm of just farmers.   Manufacturing and trade industries in my district have also seen a  direct negative impact from these agency actions. They have continued  to hurt the ability of these industries to create jobs and economic  opportunities in central and west central Illinois.   As such, I am here today in support of the HONEST Act, which  encourages a more open and transparent Federal Government. It requires  data and studies used by Federal agencies in the rulemaking process to  be made publicly available to the American people and independent  scientists. The goal is to promote more accountability for Washington,  D.C., bureaucracies, such as the EPA.   The bottom line is costly Federal regulations should only be based  upon data that is comprised of sound science and that can withstand  scrutiny and review.   Simply put, the HONEST Act is a step in the right direction to  restore trust in the EPA and in Federal bureaucracies.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, it is hard to keep up with all the misstatements about  this bill, but I am going to try. The immediate past speaker on the  other side talked about the cost of the bill; and I am sure he didn't  do it intentionally, but he was using a 2-year-out-of-date cost.   We have an email from the CBO as of this past Monday that says the  CBO estimates this legislation would not affect direct spending or  revenues, so there is no cost, despite what Members might hear  otherwise.   Also, it is just hard for me to understand how any Member of Congress  [[Page H2542]]  could oppose open and honest government. All this bill does is to say  that the data has to be transparent, the data has to be publicly  available.   If they want more government control, more environmental regulations  that can't be justified, that is one thing; but don't oppose the bill  for the wrong reasons. The bill does nothing more than require open,  transparent, and honest government.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Gosar), who is a member of the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard a couple of times today that the bill  prevents the EPA from using the best available science.   I hope that Members who are listening to this debate, and others,  will take the time to actually look at the language of the bill. Here  is the exact language, page 2, line 13. The first requirement of the  bill is that the EPA ``use the best available science.'' I don't know  what more we can do and how better we can spell it out.   The bill is only a little over three pages long. I really do  recommend that the folks who oppose it read the bill itself and  actually look at the language and the usual understanding and  definition of the words, and I hope they will be satisfied.   We have also heard that the scientific community opposes the bill,  but let me quote from a couple of Obama administration officials. Dr.  John Holdren, the President's science adviser, said that: ``Absolutely,  the data on which regulatory decisions are based should be made  available to the committee and should be made public.''   The same was said by the chair of the EPA's Science Advisory Board.  This is the EPA's Science Advisory Board. They testified before the  committee that literature and data used by the EPA be made available to  the public.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  Marshall), who is the vice chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman from Colorado attended the hearing  we had this morning on the scientific method and climate change, but I  am not sure he was listening, because not a single witness on either  side denied the facts around climate change.   I also want to reassure him--he is worried about Colorado, and I  understand that--that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  found that there was low confidence in any connection between climate  change and extreme weather events. So I hope there will not be any  unusual extreme weather events in Colorado.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa), a member of the Natural Resources Committee and the  Agriculture Committee.   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for yielding time  here today, as these issues affect my constituents in northern  California as well. So being here to support H.R. 1430, the HONEST Act,  really pleases me because we haven't had a lot of honesty the way the  EPA has applied new interpretations of new rules to some of the folks  in my district here, that farm and ranch and other activities that use  their resources and their land in the way they see fit.   We need to ensure that the EPA rules and regulations are made using  verifiable, publicly available data and science.                                time  1430    A fundamental tenet of our Nation is that citizens have the right to  know how and why the government makes decisions and, just as  importantly, have the ability to challenge those decisions. However, we  have seen an increasing tendency of Federal agencies to refuse to  disclose the data they have based decisions on, claiming it is too  sensitive to share. Really, now.   For example, the Obama administration's waters of the U.S. rule,  which would have inserted the Federal Government into local land use  decisions across the Nation, directly conflicts with publicly available  data prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers, yet the EPA refused to  release data it claimed supported its conclusion.   Farmers, in some cases, cannot even use their land under the threat  of litigation, fines, or even arrest. Even the Army Corps of Engineers  disputes the EPA's refusal, noting, in 2015, that EPA provided no  scientific basis for its jurisdictional power grab.   Under waters of the United States, we have heard interpretations that  [[Page H2545]]  people plowing their fields could be interpreted now as a regulatable  land because that could be seen as a watershed because you now have  furrows that are new watersheds.   This is the kind of thing that needs to be heard publicly in review  of Congress and the people, not made in a back room of the EPA  somewhere. That is not an honest way of doing business. That is why  H.R. 1430 is an honest way to bring them back to the accountability we  need to have so people can have their day and have a right to dispute  nonscience-led decisions made by the EPA.   The Obama Administration did not even rely on peer-reviewed science  or on publicly available Scientific Advisory Board determinations  despite EPA claims that its effort was backed by science.   The tendency for Federal agencies to develop regulations based on  secret data is even more insidious when we note that these are not even  elected officials. They don't have to stand for election. These are  career bureaucrats who cannot be removed or even sometimes met up with  by the voters, by their constituents.   Mr. Speaker, when Americans face regulations imposed by unelected  bureaucrats and based on secret science that cannot be verified or even  viewed, how can they employ their First Amendment right to petition  their government? The answer, colleagues, is simple. They can't.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill to protect every American's  right to know how and why their government makes decisions, to protect  their First Amendment rights, to protect their property, and their  ability to thrive.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time, and I thank you for  bringing this effort and for your battle.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), who is the chairman of the Environment  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), who is the chairman of the Environment  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side?  And I would like to know if the other side, the minority, has any more  speakers.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaMalfa). The gentleman from Texas has  8\3/4\ minutes remaining, and the gentlewoman from Texas has 10\1/2\  minutes remaining.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  requests for time, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), a former member of the Science  Committee, who is still missed, a former chairman of the Environment  Subcommittee, and the author of a very similar bill to this in a  previous Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, costly environmental regulations should only be based  upon data that is available to independent scientists and the public  and that can be verified.   H.R. 1430, the HONEST Act, gives independent scientists an  opportunity to validate the studies the EPA uses to make new  regulations. What this bill does not do is roll back the laws that  protect the air we breathe and the water we drink. It simply requires  the EPA to base regulations on science that is publicly available.   This is a nonpartisan bill. A change in administration does not  change the need or justification for it. This is the same bill,  virtually, introduced in the last administration, and that is evidenced  by my introduction of this good-government legislation with my  Democratic colleague Henry Cuellar. That shows it is a good, bipartisan  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and  promote a more open and honest Federal Government. We should not be  afraid of letting the American people see the data that the EPA or  other agencies say justifies their regulations.   So let's vote for an open and honest government and support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Graves of Louisiana). All time for  debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 229, the previous question is ordered on  the bill.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                                time  1445                              Motion to Recommit    Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?   Mr. McEACHIN. I am opposed.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mr. McEachin moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1430 to the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology with instructions       to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the       following amendment:        At the end of the bill, add the following:       SEC. 3. EXCEPTION.          Notwithstanding the amendment made by section 2, the       Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall,       in carrying out the activities described in that amendment,       make use of the best available science, whether or not it is       publicly available in any form, when responding to threats to       public health, including black lung disease and asthma,       caused by or exacerbated by exposure to pollution or toxic       chemicals.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, my amendment is simple. It ensures that the EPA  continues to use the best available science to respond to threats to  public health, including black lung and asthma, caused by or  exacerbated by exposure to pollution or toxic chemicals.   This motion to recommit reverses harmful restrictions imposed by this  bill that make it almost impossible to base public protections on the  best available scientific information, much of which is private or  proprietary and cannot always be published.   In its current form, Mr. Speaker, this bill, the so-called Honest and  Open New EPA Science Treatment Act, seriously impedes the EPA's ability  to protect the American public from pollutants, toxins, and other  dangerous threats to their well-being.   The true intention of this bill is not to increase transparency in  policymaking but, rather, to bar scientists and civil servants from  enforcing the intent of bedrock protections in the Clean Air Act, the  Clean Water Act, and other important laws.   If this ``secret science'' bill passes in its current form, the EPA's  work will grind to a halt and countless Americans will suffer or even  die as a result. Hardworking miners, whose work and contributions have  been overly politicized in the debate to keep access to science, are  the greatest at risk. Generations of miners toil dutifully to support  their families, all the while exposing themselves to toxicity and  pollution that can leave them with lifelong debilitating diseases, such  as black lung and asthma.   Families who will struggle from the costs to treat these expensive  diseases and from loss of income due to days missed from work do not  need more obstruction or political football. They need access to the  best care available, which relies upon evidence-based science. They  deserve far better than what the majority is offering.   Mr. Speaker, I came to Congress with a mission to uphold the values  and principles of the great constituents living in Virginia's Fourth  Congressional District. I believe that includes advocating for the  health of all Americans. That means advocating for sound science and  reasonable policies. It means rejecting dangerous, shortsighted, and an  astonishingly hard-hearted piece of legislation that is currently  before you.   Mr. Speaker, science is the bedrock of sound medical and public  health decisionmaking. EPA's science-based decisionmaking process has  saved lives and led to the dramatic improvements in the quality of the  air we breathe, the water we drink, and the Earth we share.   All Americans have benefited from the research-based scientific  advice that scientists have provided the EPA, and that is why I urge my  colleagues to support my motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when  the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Tenney). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
