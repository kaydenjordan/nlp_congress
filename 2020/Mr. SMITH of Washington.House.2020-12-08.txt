 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the order of the  House of December 3, 2020, I call up the conference report on the bill  (H.R. 6395) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2021 for  military activities of the Department of Defense, for military  construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy,  to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and insert extraneous material on the conference report  to accompany H.R. 6395.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference report before  us today. This is the defense policy bill, and this is an incredibly  important piece of legislation. There is a lot of public debate about  different issues that sort of rise to the level of people arguing  about, and they are very important, passionate issues. But lost in that  sometimes is the basic substance of what we do in the defense policy  bill, and that is, we exercise our legislative authority to do  oversight of the Pentagon and national security policy.   And on that measure, this year's bill is an incredibly important  piece of legislation. To begin with, we address the issue of diversity  within the military. I really want to thank the Congressional Black  Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, specifically Anthony  Brown, Veronica Escobar, and Ruben Gallego for putting forward policy  that will address the diversity problems that we have.   Mr. Speaker, our military right now in its leadership and in its  recruitment does not adequately reflect the diversity of this country.  This bill puts in place a chief diversity officer at the Pentagon and  takes a number of other steps to try to correct that, to make sure that  we have a military that reflects diversity of this country and that  meets the equity and social justice requirements. I think that is an  incredibly important policy statement, and a step forward.   We also implement a number of the provisions from a defense policy  board led by Eric Schmidt and Bob Work focusing on artificial  intelligence. I heard some Members speaking earlier about the  importance of that. We have a series of recommendations for how the  Department of Defense can do a better job of getting AI right,  developing the technology and using it, but also broader technologies  as well. The Pentagon is woefully behind right now in taking advantage  of the technologies that are crucial to getting us the proper defense  going forward. I think that is incredibly important.    Mr. Speaker, we also have a provision that Ranking Member Thornberry  worked on. It is not the most sexy or exciting thing in the world. It  is 300 pages of cleaning up the technical problems within the  acquisition process at the Pentagon, but it is crucially important.   We have so many innovative technologies, so many small businesses out  there that are generating great ideas that would be terrific for the  Pentagon, but they can't get in. They can't penetrate the bureaucracy  and figure out how to even do business, so most of them walk away. It  is crucially important that we take steps to fix that.   We also have a provision I have worked on a lot dealing with  satellites and launch. Same thing--encourage competition, encourage  innovation. Regrettably, the Pentagon has a somewhat understandable  bias towards incumbents. They also have a bias towards large companies.  But what that does is it makes it harder for that innovation, for those  new technologies that are crucial to get through. We make changes to  address that.   We also have a provision in this bill to deal with Agent Orange, to  make  [[Page H6920]]  sure that we are taking care of our troops, because that is a crucial  part of our oversight as well, to make sure that once the fighting is  done, we don't forget the people who fought, that we help them.   For too long, veterans have not been able to access the healthcare  they deserve. This bill addresses that. I know that Mark Takano and  Josh Harder on our side worked very hard on that issue and I thank them  for that. It is crucially important.   Mr. Speaker, I also take a moment to address the concerns that  Representative Gaetz raised. He is not accurate in saying that we stop  the President from being able to move troops. All we do in Afghanistan  is we say, Make sure you give us a reason. And then, frankly, if the  President doesn't give us a reason, he can exercise a national security  waiver and not follow our advice. It is simply advice that says, Yes,  in our opinion, we need to get out of Afghanistan, but we need to do it  responsibly.                                time  1230    It is a way crazy overstatement to say that we prevent a Chief  Executive from pulling out of Afghanistan. This bill does not do that.  It merely says, if you are going to do it, make sure that you do it  right so that we protect our troops as we make that decision.   I think that is not an accurate description of what this bill does.   But overall, I want to remind people, it is incredibly important that  we pass this piece of legislation for a couple of basic reasons.   Number one, we are the legislative body. The one thing we have in  common--House, Senate, Democrat, Republican--is that we are all  legislators. We all represent people. If we don't do our job, if we  don't pass this bill and exercise oversight, we are ceding authority to  the executive branch, authority that is too great already. I think  Democrats and Republicans agree on this as well. Granted, when there is  a Democratic President, Republicans are more enthusiastic about it, and  when there is a Republican President, Democrats are more enthusiastic  about it. But we all agree there is too much executive power and not  enough legislative oversight.   Let's not walk away from our biggest opportunity every year to  exercise that legislative oversight. This is a good bill. If we don't  do this, we are not fulfilling one key aspect of our duties to our  constituents.   Also, the legislative process itself, I think, is incredibly  important. These are times when we have a deeply divided Nation and a  deeply divided Congress, but that is precisely the moment when  legislative authority is so important. It is how we come together and  solve problems.   I will tell you, Senator Inhofe and I disagree on a lot. We also do  not have a lot in common.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 1  minute.   Mr. Speaker, we have come together on this bill because we recognize  the importance of that process. You have to learn how to work with  people you disagree with in order for civil society to function. That  is what we have done.   Now, sadly, this is the only conference report that we will vote on  this session. I think it might be the only one we have voted on in the  last 2 years. I could be wrong about that. But if not, it is one of the  precious few. That shows you how far we are drifting away from  exercising our responsibilities.   If Senator Inhofe and I can come together and agree on this, then I  think we can all understand that this is a good bipartisan compromise  that we all should support.   I want to close by thanking the staff. I have not worked with a  better group of people on anything I have ever done in my life; the  House staff, the Senate staff, all outstanding people doing a difficult  job.   I also want to do something I haven't done before, and that is  specifically thank the legislative counsel and also apologize. Every  year, we put this bill together seemingly at the last minute. It is a  very big bill. We come up with our ideas, we turn them over to the  legislative counsel at 2 o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and say,  ``Please do this.''   I am sorry. We are going to try to do better in the future. But thank  you, thank you, thank you for the outstanding work that you do.   Lastly, I want to thank Mac. This bill was named after him--over his  objection, by the way. He has done an outstanding job as chairman and  as ranking member of this committee. He will be missed. I really thank  him for his leadership. Without him, this would not be possible.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Intelligence and Emerging Threats and Capabilities, and  I thank him for his leadership.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier), the chair of the Subcommittee  on Military Personnel.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cooper), the chairman of the Subcommittee  on Strategic Forces.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross), the chair of the Subcommittee  on Tactical Air and Land Forces.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis).   I recognize Mrs. Davis is retiring after 22 years of service on the  committee. It has been great working with her, and I appreciate her  leadership.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Brown), the vice chair of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Luria), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters), the distinguished chair of  the Financial Services Committee.   I really want to thank her for her leadership. The Financial Services  Committee provided a number of key pieces of legislation on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute  to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority  leader of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Correct.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mostly, I would like to associate myself with Mr. Thornberry's  remarks. I think that was the perfect statement  [[Page H6931]]  of why it is so important to vote for this bill and why every Member of  this body should vote for this bill. It contains incredibly important  provisions, and the excuses for not doing those provisions just don't  hold up.   As Mr. Thornberry points out, every year near the end of the process,  because we are the only bill that actually makes it through the  process, people who have been working on issues for a long time are  desperate to get them taken care of. We respect that, we honor that,  and we are the last vehicle to find.   Many times we are able to help, but not always. That is not a reason  to not do the bill because of all the other issues, as Mr. Thornberry  laid out, that we have not addressed.   Then, as people want to find reasons to oppose the bill, they start  saying things that aren't terribly accurate. I think Mr. Gaetz wins the  award for that one this year in his remark on Afghanistan.   Our bill says that if the President wants to go below 2,000 troops in  Afghanistan--he said he is going to go to 2,300. So this bill doesn't  have anything to do with what President Trump said he is going to draw  down in Afghanistan. If he wants to go below 2,000 or a future  President wants to go below 2,000, then he has to file a report. It  doesn't say that he can't do it. He has to file a report.   I actually agree with Mr. Gaetz on where we need to go in  Afghanistan. And I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, this bill does nothing  to prohibit the next President, President Biden, from completely  drawing down in Afghanistan. That is a policy debate he will have.   So anyone who comes to the floor and says they are voting against  this bill because of that is really not telling the truth. That is not  what this bill does.   I also want to mention the top line because that is a favorite  argument on our side to not vote for the bill. I will let you in on a  little secret: the defense policy bill does not control how much money  we spend at the Pentagon.    I know that sounds a little odd, but it doesn't. The budget process  does that. And when we don't have a budget process because of how much  things have broken down, which has happened frequently, then the  Appropriations Committee decides how much we spend. What we do is we  decide how that gets spent and the oversight of it.   A few years ago, Mr. Courtney pushed us to do two submarines a year,  a great provision that saved a lot of money. We can control that. But  if you think the Pentagon should spend more than it is spending, or  less, then your beef is on the appropriations side. We could take the  tables out in terms of the amount of money that we have in this bill,  and it wouldn't change the amount of money that is spent at the  Pentagon.   So, again, if you have a reason to vote against the bill, that is  great. But the top line, Afghanistan, those are not valid reasons. This  is an important piece of legislation that has been unduly complicated  by the fact that, of all people, the President is one of the people  this year who, near the end of the process, said: I want to fix that.   He wanted to fix something about section 230 having to do with social  media platforms, and he went looking for the only possible vehicle. Let  me just say to people on that issue, that section is not going to be  addressed in this bill. You can not address section 230 and pass a  defense bill; or you can not address section 230 and not pass a defense  bill. There is no choice here where you can do both, Mr. Speaker.   So please make the right choice. Please recognize all of the  incredibly important bicameral, bipartisan provisions that are  contained in this bill. This is one thing in a very tumultuous time  that we ought to be able to agree on. There are enough provisions and  good policy in here for everyone in this body.   Mr. Speaker, I want to close by thanking everyone in this body. We  have worked together in this process. I am now finishing up my 2 years  as chairman. My caucus, in their infinite wisdom, has given me another  2 years to do the job, but these first 2 years I really enjoyed the  process.   Members keep coming up to me and saying: You have a terrible job, it  must be difficult, you have all these people making all these demands.   I love what I do. I am in a position with all the other team here to  help people. We don't always succeed and we don't always get it done,  but we have a chance. Every Member of the House and Senate, I think,  have worked together, and we have produced an outstanding product. Let  us reward ourselves for our work. Let us take care of the troops, as we  are supposed to do, and pass this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.
