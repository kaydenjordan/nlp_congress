 Madam Speaker, I am strongly opposed to H.R. 4. When our  Founders created this self-governing constitutional republic, they  vested the power to administer time, place, and manner of elections  with our State legislatures. They knew the sacred right to vote would  be better preserved by democratically elected, accountable State and  local officials rather than unelected Federal bureaucrats. This  principle has endured for two centuries. However, this principle is now  under attack here in the people's House.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue that democracy is  somehow in peril. And their solution to this problem is to relinquish  total control of our elections, again, to Federal, unelected  bureaucrats--a complete opposite of democratic concepts; bureaucrats  with the power to prosecute based on political views and party  affiliations.   These are the same officials who were absent when now-disgraced  former Democrat Governor Cuomo unilaterally altered New York election  laws last year in violation of New York's constitution, which  chaotically overstressed the system and compromised the guarantee of a  free, secure, and fair election.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this legislation.
