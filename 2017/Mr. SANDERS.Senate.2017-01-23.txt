 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of  Mike Pompeo to be the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. At a  time when we are facing massive attacks against privacy rights thanks  to the explosion of technology, we should be greatly troubled by giving  power to a person who has stated flat-out that he wants to expand the  surveillance state, not rein it in.   Here is the kind of world we are now living in, a world that should  be of concern to every freedom-loving American, whether you are  Democrat or Republican or Independent, conservative or progressive. We  are living in a world where government and the private sector often  know where you are at any time. They know where you are. They know  where you are traveling. They know what books you are reading, what Web  sites you are visiting, and maybe the emails you are sending out or  reading.   I hear a whole lot of discussion on the floor of the Senate about  freedom, about our desire to live and defend a free society. I would  ask my colleagues and the American people--when we talk about freedom,  one of the attributes of a free society is the right to live our lives  the way we want to live our lives, without Big brother knowing  everything there is to know about us. You want to do what you want to,  it is your business; I want to do what I want to do, it is my  business--if we are not harming other people. I believe that is a basic  American right and a basic constitutional right, and I want to see  people at the CIA, at the NSA, at other intelligence agencies who, yes,  will be vigorous about defending us from terrorism but will do it in a  way that is constitutional, that protects the civil liberties and the  civil rights of the American people.   According to the Pew Internet Project, today 95 percent of American  adults own a cell phone. More than three-quarters of American adults  own a smartphone. Eighty-eight percent of American adults use the  Internet. These advancements obviously have enormous advantages.  Everybody knows all of the extraordinary things we can do on the  Internet and all the information we can gain. It is almost unthinkable  that we were living not so many years ago without the advantages of the  Internet. All of these advantages, all of these conveniences come with  a price.   If you have a Google account and the GPS enabled on your phone,  Google creates a map for you of every single place you go in a given  day. Facebook amasses a massive amount of data on you to better target  commercials and advertisements to you. Credit card companies track your  spending habits. Even innocuous things like a loyalty program in which  you gain benefits by buying at a certain store give the private sector  and the government eventually access to a massive amount of information  about you.   When you go to the grocery store and scan your card, it is very  convenient, moves things faster, and you can get a discount, but the  store gets to track everything you purchase. Is that really what want?  Do you want the whole world to have knowledge of everything you  purchase? For just one rather famous example, Target--a huge chain in  America--could tell if a woman was pregnant based on what she was  purchasing at the store. Do we really feel comfortable about that kind  of information getting out into the private sector or the government  sector?  [[Page S383]]    If you are wearing a tracking device today to count your steps, to  count your heart rate and your sleep patterns, you may see it as a way  to become healthier. Your employer or health insurance company,  however, may see it as a way to charge you more if you don't meet  certain employee wellness targets. Are we really comfortable about  corporations knowing all about our health? If you are dealing with a  serious illness, maybe it is something you and your family want to keep  within the bosom of your family and not spread to the whole world.   That companies are collecting this much information on their own is  very troubling to me, but Mr. Pompeo apparently wants to go even  further. Last January, he published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal  in which he wrote:         Congress should pass a law reestablishing collection of all       metadata, and combining it with publicly available financial       and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable       database. Legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance       should be removed.    Wow. What we are talking about is the U.S. Government having, in many  ways, more information about us than we may even understand about our  own lives. In many ways, it sounds to me that we are moving toward an  Orwellian society where, between the government and the private sector,  there is very little about ourselves that is not known by somebody  else. I am very, very uncomfortable about that.   I want at the head of the CIA somebody who understands thoroughly the  Constitution of the United States and privacy rights and understands  that we can fight terrorism effectively within the Constitution and the  privacy rights guaranteed to the people of our country.   Since June of 2013, here is what we have already learned that the NSA  collects: phone call metadata, including the numbers of both parties-- my number and the number of the person I call--the location, time, and  duration of that telephone call. NSA has access to text messages, email  chat, and Internet browsing history, smartphone app data, including map  data, which can pinpoint a person's location to within a few yards.  They have maps of people's social networks and bank and credit card  transactions. That is a lot of information held by the government and/ or the private sector on the personal lives of the American people.   As I have mentioned, there is nobody in this Congress who does not  understand the threat of terrorism and does not want to see our  government be as strong and vigorous as possible in fighting terrorism  and getting all the information we need to effectively combat  terrorism, to make sure that if somebody is a suspect in terrorist  activities, that we go after that person as strongly and as effectively  as we can. I believe from the bottom of my heart that we can do that  without invading the privacy rights of the American people.   It is not acceptable for Senator after Senator to come here and say  we are defending freedom, we live in a free society, and then vote to  allow the government or the private sector to have an unbelievable  amount of knowledge about each and every one of our personal lives.   Now more than ever, it is vital to have a head of the CIA who will  stand up for our Constitution, stand up for privacy rights.  Unfortunately, in my view, Mr. Pompeo is not that individual.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the  Record some of the finalist essays written by Vermont high school  students as part of the seventh annual State of the Union essay contest  conducted by my office.   The material follows:      FINN ABBEY, MOUNT MANSFIELD UNION HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN (FINALIST)         Our country has faced many issues in the past, but today we       face one of our greatest challenges. Division. We have       forgotten to care for each other; forgotten that we are only       strong with each other. We are growing too uncompassionate,       too distrustful of each other. We can and must remember that       we are not enriched by the success of one person, but rather       the success of many. We prosper not with the defeat of       others, but with their success. And keeping with the       philosophy that we must succeed together, we must work       together on smaller challenges.        Our country needs a system that not only doesn't punish the       poor for their very existence, but offers every person the       chance to better themselves. The hope that your children will       have a better life than you has long been a staple of the       American dream. To accomplish this, we need to create a       liveable wage of $15, and create a progressive tax system       that leaves the poor with more and takes fairly from those       who can afford it. We cannot be satisfied in the splendor of       ourselves and people like us when our fellow Americans are       living in the streets.        We must also institute universal health care. This will       involve higher taxes, of course, but, combined with strict       laws about pharmaceutical pricing and a fair tax system, will       ensure that our country is healthy and our middle class stays       strong. No one should ever have to choose between food and       medicine. We need change.        We also must guarantee everyone the right to vote, and that       their votes count. Time and time again voter ID laws have       suppressed the African-American vote. We cannot say we are       equal when we pass laws with the purpose of lowering voter       turnout.        We also have to remove another recent mistake in election       law: Citizens United. We cannot accept catering to special       interests as a side effect of democracy; we must recognize it       as a barrier to a fairer system. We must put the redrawing of       congressional districts in the hands of independent       commissions to prevent gerrymandering. Anything  [[Page S394]]       less is a conflict of interest and a mockery of democracy. We       need to replace first past the post with ranked choice       voting, allowing for a greater variety of candidates. This       will serve as another booth in the marketplace of ideas.        To many these goals are mountains too tall to climb. But in       America, we don't know how to give up. It's what makes us       great. The idea that if we want change, we'll fight until we       reach it. It's what got African-Americans equality under the       law. It's what got women the right to vote. It's what has       brought equal love to our entire nation. And it's what led to       independence for the plucky colonists who took on the world       because they thought it could be better. Throughout our       history, all we've needed is an idea, an ideal, and each       other. After all, out of many, we are one.          EMILY BALLOU, SOUTH ROYALTON HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR (FINALIST)         It is both a privilege and an honor to live in a nation       where I have the right to speak my mind without the fear of       failure or retribution, where liberty of expression is       celebrated, and diverging views, though challenged, are       entitled to develop according to their merit.        The greatest problem we have is that the people of our       country lack compassion. We lack empathy. We need to       integrate our passions instead of separating them. Love       should trump hate, but it seems as of late that that is       reversed. We must renew our nation, and to do so, we must       stop the ignorance of the public. We must end the bigoted,       chauvinistic, and discriminatory ideologies and mindsets of       our people.        What we have in common is more important than the       differences used to divide us. Groups of like-minded people       acting in a similar fashion are not a new phenomenon, but the       engagement of these groups has become dedicated to excluding       the expression of other views.        What makes a country great is not how rich the monetary       funds of the upper class is, but how well its most vulnerable       citizens are treated. This is why we must start early and       teach the next generation to kindness and to love.        When someone of power misuses his or her status to bully       those more vulnerable, their actions are desensitized. This       disrespect incites more discord which invites both fear and       hatred into the minds of all ages. The very young feel no       hatred. Currently, not all adolescents are being taught the       importance of tolerance and empathy in their homes, schools,       or in public. These lessons must begin in their earliest       years of schooling before they acquire biases from around       them and their beliefs are negatively impacted.        The vernacular must include words of kindness, not       derogatory terms or racially-charged slurs. No matter what an       individual's values are, they should not value the       discrimination and hatred associated with these words.       Silence is compliance. The cycle of history will continue to       repeat itself unless people begin to empathize with all. If       one wishes to ``Make America Great Again,'' hate should not       be the weapon of choice. We must be more inclusive and       accepting of the diversity in which this nation has prided       and built itself on, for change begins with ourselves.        Love does trump hate. Although we adhere to the flaws in       society, we must not. We must instill hope into those of the       coming generations. There is hope that our world will see       peace. There is hope that our world will be preserved. There       is hope for change. We are ``a nation of the people, by the       people, for the people that shall not perish from the       Earth,'' where people, no matter their race, religion, sexual       orientation, or gender, should take comfort in. We are the       great United States of America, and the day we forget that,       we will cease to exist, because despite current       circumstances, the world is not entirely lost if everyone       resists, together.            BILLY BENDER, HANOVER HIGH SCHOOL SOPHOMORE (FINALIST)         Mr Speaker, Mr Vice President, Members of the 115th       Congress and Distinguished Guests,        As Americans we face many difficulties, but two are of       particular concern: one is a challenge to our world, the       other to our republic. We can and must do more to stop global       warming, and we can and must get big money out of politics.        Climate Change is real. The scientific debate is over. We       have already begun to see its effects in the United States.       Large sections of the country have experienced severe       droughts and wildfires, hurricanes have been more violent,       and our summers are becoming dangerously hot in the south.       Internationally, long-term droughts are causing malnutrition,       threatening coastal cities, and creating climate refugees.       This is real, it is urgent, it is a direct result of the       actions of humans, and its impact will be felt       disproportionately by the most vulnerable peoples on our       planet. We caused it, and we can stop it. We have a       responsibility toward our children, our grandchildren, and       all of the future inhabitants of our planet.        Our government needs to invest heavily in large scale clean       energy infrastructure projects. We need to renew and add to       the existing subsidies on renewable energy to make solar or       wind a viable financial option for homeowners and businesses.       We need to invest heavily in clean energy research and stop       subsidizing fossil fuels. When renewables like solar, wind       and hydro power are cheaper than oil, then the massive oil       companies will have no choice but to become energy companies       instead of oil companies and build dams, wind farms and solar       fields. We will no longer have to tolerate the risks of       nuclear energy.        However, to achieve the goal of powering our nation with       renewable energy, we need to take the influence of huge,       anonymous donors out of American politics. Citizens United       has allowed huge corporations to funnel millions of dollars       into electing politicians who regard them favorably. The       fossil fuel industry is hugely profitable, and the       millionaires and billionaires who control them want to delay       and diminish the impact of renewables on their bottom line.       Their huge sums of money give them a massively       disproportionate voice in elections, allowing them to create       Super PACs which will ensure the continued existence of       dangerous, damaging practices like fracking.        Climate change is a critical problem facing our nation and       our world, but it will be difficult to take the bold steps       necessary to mitigate its effects without first eliminating       the advantage that billionaires have in our elections. It is       time to take large scale legislative and judicial steps to       eliminate the out sized voice of the extremely wealthy and       save our planet for all who come after us.        SIMON BUPP-CHICKERING, BELLOWS FALLS UNION HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR                                 (FINALIST)          ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice       everywhere.''--Martin Luther King Jr.        A nation that neglects to confront and eliminate injustice       is no true defender of its people's rights. Due to the death       penalty's inherent inability to be more than state sponsored       revenge, its exorbitant cost, and the lack of statistical       evidence showing it does anything to stop murder, the death       penalty is an antiquated and medieval punishment that has no       place in a modern democracy.        One of the most common arguments brought up by proponents       of the death penalty is the idea that enforcing the death       penalty acts as a deterrent for other criminals. However,       this argument fails to account for the fact that the vast       majority of murderers aren't executed, less than one percent.       In addition, 88 percent of criminologists, experts who study       crime for a living, refute the idea that the death penalty       works as a deterrent. Furthermore, as the South accounts for       80 percent of all executions in the United States, if the       death penalty did act as deterrence, then those states would       have the lowest rates of murder. However, the South holds the       country's highest murder rate, and the North, which accounts       for less than 1 percent of the country's executions, has the       lowest murder rate.        The death penalty as it is practiced today is simply a tool       for revenge, misguidedly used in an attempt to help grieving       families. The finality of the punishment destroys any hope of       reflection, apology, or forgiveness, thus eliminating any       chance of true healing. Additionally, revenge is an emotional       response to tragedy, and the judicial system in America       should be about providing just and emotionally unbiased       decisions. Instead of perpetuating a cycle of violence, the       United States government should promote restorative justice,       which promotes rehabilitation and the improvement and       bettering society rather than resort to base human emotions       in response to tragedy.        In order to prevent this outdated and pointless practice of       state-funded murder from damaging our justice system any       further, the death penalty must be abolished nationwide, and       those on death role should have their sentences commuted to       life in prison without parole. In a modern, civilized       society, there is no place for such a horrific punishment.       Most other enlightened nations around the world have removed       the death penalty from their judicial systems. Instead of       remaining among the questionable company of nations such as       North Korea, America must prove that it understands the       egregious error in killing as punishment for killing.        Ultimately, the fact that the United States still uses the       death penalty reveals a fundamental lack of ethical maturity       in our nation, and is a mark of shame to Americans who want       to believe that the country they live in has evolved from the       barbaric practices of antiquity along with the rest of the       civilized world.                            ____________________
