 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to tell the story of  Markiya Simone Dickson.   She was an energetic, kind, and spunky 9-year-old girl. She was a  beloved daughter and an adored sister. She was in third grade, and she  was preparing to sing a Justin Bieber song in her school's upcoming  talent show.   On May 26, 2019, Markiya and her family attended a community picnic  in Richmond, Virginia. From across the park, a random gunshot went  through the crowd, and this senseless, cruel act of gun violence took  Markiya's life.   During and since this unimaginable time, Markiya's parents, Mark  Whitfield and Ciara Dickson, have demonstrated extraordinary strength,  determination, and courage. They continue fighting to ensure Markiya's  name and her beautiful life are never forgotten.   They stand by their steadfast wish to fight back against gun violence  in our communities so that other parents will never have to experience  the pain that they feel following Markiya's death.   Markiya was beloved by those who knew her, and the Richmond,  Virginia, community stands with her family at this time. Together, we  share her story; we mourn her death; and we promise to fight for safer  communities for all our children.                            ____________________
