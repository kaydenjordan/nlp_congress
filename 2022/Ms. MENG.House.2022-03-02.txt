 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of H.R. 3967, Honoring  our PACT Act, authored by my friend and esteemed colleague, Chairman  Takano.   This important bill includes the text of my bill, the Mark Takai  Atomic Veterans Healthcare Parity Act, named after our dear, late  friend and colleague, Representative Mark Takai.   H.R. 3967 would permit veterans who participated in the nuclear  cleanup of Enewetak Atoll in the Western Pacific to be treated as  radiation-exposed veterans and receive service-connected compensation  benefits.   Current law only covers servicemembers who participated in active  nuclear tests and not those who participated in the cleanup. With the  passage of this bill, Congress will finally right this wrong.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank Chairman Mark Takano for his  tremendous leadership on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to  vote for the passage of H.R. 3967.
