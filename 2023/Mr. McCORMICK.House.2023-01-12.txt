 Madam Speaker, I rise on this occasion to appreciate  my constituents, especially those who have immigrated from India. We  have a very large portion of my community that is made up of almost  100,000 people who have immigrated directly from India.   One out of every five doctors in my community are from India, they  represent some of the best citizens we have in America. We should make  sure that we streamline the immigration process for those who come here  to obey the law, pay their taxes, and be the most creative and  productive in society.   Although they make up about 1 percent of American society, they pay  about 6 percent of the taxes. They are amongst the top producers, and  they do not cause problems, they follow the laws. They don't have the  problems that we see other people have when they come to the emergency  room for  [[Page H220]]  overdoses, depression, and anxiety because they are the most  productive, most family-oriented, and the best of what represents  American citizens.   God bless my Indian constituents. I look forward to meeting with the  ambassador. God bless Dr. Kulkarni as she finishes her appointment as  Consulate General of India to Atlanta.                            ____________________
