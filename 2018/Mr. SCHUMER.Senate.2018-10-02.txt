 Madam President, I like the majority leader. We get  along quite well. He even laughs at my jokes, which sometimes aren't  very good. We are very proud we are working on the appropriations bills  together in a bipartisan way, as this place ought to work. But  sometimes his comments are so absurd and so filled with double  standard, innuendo, and hypocrisy that you don't know whether to laugh  or cry.   He has been on the floor every day saying that Democrats are causing  delay. Democrats are causing delay? First, to say that Democrats are  causing delay, coming from the same man who delayed the nomination of  Supreme Court Justice nominee Merrick Garland for over 300 days without  a shrug of his shoulders--give me a break. The leader delayed for 10  months when he thought it was right to do, and he can't wait for a week  to get an honest report out of the FBI? What a double standard. How  galling. Accusing Democrats of needlessly delaying a Supreme Court  nomination is galling and hypocritical coming from a leader who delayed  the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice for over 300 days, until his  party had a chance to win the White House. So no one--no American-- should accept his admonishments about delay. He is the master of delay.   Second, he blames Democrats for these delays. As the leader well  knows, Democrats are not in charge. We can't set the calendar. These  things have been delayed because people on his side of the aisle who  had sincere concerns about having a fair process said they will not go  forward unless the process is made fairer.   Even the initial hearing where Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh testified  was because a member of the Judiciary Committee on the Republican side  said he didn't want to go forward until he heard from them. It had  nothing to do with Democrats. Did we agree that should happen? Of  course. And so did most people who are fairminded. But it wasn't caused  by us.   On the reopening of the FBI investigation into these new allegations,  the background check investigation, I would ask Leader McConnell, who  caused that? Who caused this delay? It is not the Democrats. We don't  have the ability to do it. It was three Members on his side who  sincerely were  [[Page S6419]]  seeking better truth because they heard two arguments, they weren't  sure which was right, and they saw that without some kind of  independent investigation, it would tear the American people apart in  ways for which we will pay a price years down the road no matter what  the outcome of the vote on Judge Kavanaugh.   Democrats didn't cause the delay, and he knows it. It was the  inability of all of the Republicans to be unified--with justification,  because the truth should be sought after in a more sincere way for a  nomination to the highest Court of the land.   Leader McConnell has said: We are going to ``plow right through'' the  recent allegations. Fortunately, some Members on his side of the aisle  didn't want to plow right through. They didn't want to delay  unnecessarily. One week--give me a break--compared to 10 months,  leaving the Scalia seat open? Who are we kidding? Who are we kidding?  Who is making this a political argument? Let's ask.   One final point. The leader kept accusing the people who came forward  of engaging in political smear campaigns, of being in the mud. I want  to ask the leader to answer a direct question: Does he believe or not  believe Dr. Ford? Yes or no. I happen to believe her. He refuses to  answer that one way or the other because he knows that Dr. Ford had  tremendous credibility. Instead, he calls her names. He uses it as  Democrats--but she came forward on her own.   By the way, one of the first things she did was she called the  Washington Post and spoke to the reporter who later wrote the story.  That was long before any Democrat knew what was going on. She felt a  sincere need to come forward.   To call her political--which is what, by ricochet, the leader is  doing--is so unfair and is so wrong. To call all three of these women  who came forward, whether or not you believe them, political actors is  treating women in the same way that unfortunately too many women, as we  have learned over the last few years, have been treated in the past.  That doesn't mean allegations shouldn't be proven. That doesn't mean  there shouldn't be a discreet, fair process to try to get to the bottom  of it, which is what the FBI investigation is. That doesn't mean all  men are guilty before proven guilty. It means there deserves to be a  fair hearing even if it takes 1 week--1 week compared to 10 months of  delay.   Finally, the investigation itself should only take a week. That is  for sure. No Democrat has called for it taking more than a week. We are  not moving the goalpost. But it should be thorough. It should not be  limited by the Senate Judiciary staff, who was initially calling the  shots, and they have been biased to begin with. When the Democratic  staff asked to be on the phone with the counsel to the President, Mr.  McGahn, the Republican staff refused. That is not bipartisan. That is  not fair. That is not evenhanded.    Fortunately, yesterday the President said the FBI should go forward.  They can interview many people in a week. When there has been a crime  situation that called for it or a terrorism situation that called for  it, from what I understand, they have interviewed hundreds in a week.  So a list of 20 people to be interviewed in a week, when the FBI has  thousands of agents, many of them well trained in the art of figuring  out how to interview somebody, is not unreasonable. It is only fair.   We hope there are still no limitations on the FBI investigation. We  hope there are no limitations because that would jaundice the whole  process, and that is not what those who called for it on either side of  the aisle had asked for. We had asked for it to be full and fair and  open, and then everyone would make his or her judgment. That is all  people are asking for.   On that issue, I once again call on President Trump and the White  House to release in writing what White House Counsel Don McGahn has  instructed the FBI to pursue. Until then, we have to take President  Trump's off-the-cuff comments with, perhaps, grains of salt. We have to  be shown that what he said is actually being implemented.   Let me read a few quotes.   ``The Supreme Court must never, never be viewed as a partisan  institution.'' That is what Judge Kavanaugh said in his 2006  confirmation hearings.   Here is one more from a speech Judge Kavanaugh gave in 2015: ``First  and most obviously . . . a judge cannot be a political partisan.'' I  think most Americans would agree with that. I certainly do.   A lodestar in our consideration of judicial confirmations should be  whether the nominee is independent and within the ideological  mainstream. The Judge Kavanaugh we saw last Thursday did not meet the  standard laid out in his past statements. His prepared statement to the  committee--prepared; if you will, malice aforethought--accused sitting  U.S. Senators of a phony smear campaign, lambasted ``left-wing  opposition groups,'' and portrayed the recent allegations--the  allegations of Dr. Ford, Ms. Ramirez, and the third person who came  forward, Ms. Swetnick--as ``revenge on behalf of the Clintons.''  Frankly, Judge Kavanaugh's testimony was better suited for FOX News  than a confirmation hearing for the august U.S. Supreme Court. But that  is in character with Judge Kavanaugh's long history of working for the  most partisan legal causes--Ken Starr, Bush v. Gore, all the myriad  controversies of the Bush era.   It would be one thing if Judge Kavanaugh discarded his partisan  feelings once he donned the black robes of a jurist. Unfortunately, he  has been on the bench for many years, and in Thursday's hearing, he  revealed that his bitter partisan resentments still lurk right below  the surface.   It should give us all pause to consider what it means to elevate such  a partisan world view to the Supreme Court, whether it be a Democratic  or Republican partisan view, where rulings must be made on the legal  merits, not--not--on the side of the aisle which most benefits.   The greatest issue against Judge Kavanaugh, the one that really  brothers most people, is his credibility. Is he telling the truth? That  issue supersedes all the others.   There may be some who say: Well, what happened in high school  shouldn't count. It is many years later. People grow. People change.   I think what happened to Dr. Ford--she seems credible to me--is  something you can't predict. It is not what men do. Some may say that,  but we are looking at what Judge Kavanaugh said at age 53, not what he  did at age 18. We are looking at his credibility now as a grown adult.  If you believe Dr. Ford, then Judge Kavanaugh is not telling the truth.   If this were the only instance, it would be one thing. That is bad  enough, but there are many more. Over and over again, it is hard to  believe what Judge Kavanaugh swore under oath at the committee hearing.   Just yesterday, NBC News reported that either Judge Kavanaugh or  people close to the judge were in communication with his Yale  classmates to get them to rebut allegations by Deborah Ramirez, later  published in the New Yorker.   Beyond the unseemliness of a Federal judge pressuring former  classmates to support his nomination, it seems that Judge Kavanaugh was  at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about Ms. Ramirez's  story. When asked by Senator Hatch when he first heard of Ramirez's  allegations, he answered ``in the New Yorker story.'' That is when he  first heard. Based on the NBC reports, if they are correct, that was  not truthful.   It would be one thing if that were one isolated incident, but, again,  there are far too many misstatements, far too many inaccuracies, far  too many mischaracterizations. He pled ignorance to many Bush-era  controversies, only for emails to be released showing he was aware of  them all and played a role in many. He offered explanations for high  school yearbook quotes. And it is not the quotes themselves or what  they indicated; it is that his explanations sort of defy belief. And,  of course, based on the accounts by his high school and college  classmates, he has grossly mischaracterized his relationship with  alcohol.   The common thread is that Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly tiptoes around  the truth. He doesn't tell the truth in many instances, it seems, to  paint his nomination in a favorable light.   We want a Supreme Court nominee, whatever their politics and whatever  their party origins, to be a shining example of someone who tells the  truth  [[Page S6420]]  without doubt and without equivocation. If you say ``Well, maybe he is  telling the truth, and maybe he is not,'' then he doesn't belong on the  Supreme Court, and I think most Americans are saying that.   Again, even if you want to discount--as some people do--what happened  when he was 15 in high school and 18 in college, you cannot discount  what he is saying and professing at age 53 when it flies in the face of  being truthful. That is the key question here.   There is demeanor. He sure didn't show the demeanor of a judge at the  hearing. There is partisanship. He brought out the most raw form of  partisanship, so unbecoming of someone on the appeals court, let alone  the Supreme Court, and he did not show any semblance to always being  100 percent honest and truthful, which is what we need in a Supreme  Court Justice.    So, again, even if you feel that what happened when he was 15 and 18  shouldn't matter, what happens when he is 53 does matter, and his  credibility is in real doubt--doubt enough, I think, for most Americans  to say that this man does not belong on the Supreme Court, and there  ought to be somebody--many people--who would be a whole lot better.

Congress finds the following:        (1) Since 2008, incidents of murder, other violent crime,       and corruption perpetrated by criminal networks, armed gangs       and groups, and illicit trafficking organizations have       remained at alarmingly levels in El Salvador, Guatemala, and       Honduras.        (2) In 2017, El Salvador and Honduras--        (A) continued to be among the most violent countries in       Latin America and the world, with 60 and 42 murders for every       100,000 people, respectively; and        (B) were characterized by a high prevalence of gang-related       violence and crimes involving sexual and gender-based       violence.        (3) El Salvador and Honduras are both among the top 3       countries in the world with the highest child homicide rates,       with more than 22 and 32 deaths per 100,000 children       respectively, according to the nongovernmental organization       Save the Children.        (4) A November 2017 report by the United Nations       Development Programme and UN Women stated that femicide ``is       taking on a devastating magnitude and trend in Central       America, where 2 in every 3 women murdered, are killed       because of their gender.''.        (5) Since 2014, elevated numbers of unaccompanied minors,       women, and other vulnerable individuals have fled violence in       Central America's Northern Triangle and left for the United       States in search of protection.        (6) Unaccompanied minors emigrating from El Salvador,       Guatemala, and Honduras cite violence, forced gang       recruitment, extortion, poverty, and lack of opportunity as       reasons for leaving their home countries.        (7) Challenges to the rule of law in the Northern Triangle       continue to be exacerbated by high levels of impunity related       to murders and violent crime. In 2015, approximately 95       percent of murders taking place in Honduras and El Salvador       remained unresolved.        (8) The presence of major drug trafficking organizations in       the Northern Triangle contributes to violence, corruption,       and criminality. According to the Department of State's 2017       International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, El Salvador,       Guatemala, and Honduras continue to be transit countries for       illicit drugs originating from countries in South America       that are destined for the United States.        (9) In June 2018, the Office of the United Nations High       Commissioner for Human Rights found that in El Salvador, a       pattern of behavior among security personnel and weak       institutional responses may have resulted in extrajudicial       executions and excessive use of force, with official figures       indicating an alarming increase in the number of persons       (alleged gang-members) who have been killed by security       personnel.        (10) Widespread public sector corruption in the Northern       Triangle undermines economic and social development and       directly affects regional political stability.        (11) Human rights defenders, journalists, trade unionists,       social leaders, and LGBT activists in the Northern Triangle       face dire conditions, as evidenced by--        (A) the March 2016 murder of the prominent Honduran       environmental activist, Berta Caceres; and        (B) the ongoing targeted killing of civil society leaders       in all 3 countries in the Northern Triangle.        (12) The Northern Triangle struggles with high levels of       economic insecurity. In 2016, 60.9 percent of Hondurans and       38 percent of Salvadorans lived below the poverty line. In       2014, 59.3 percent of Guatemalans lived below the poverty       line.        (13) Weak investment climates, low levels of tax       collection, and low levels of educational opportunity are       barriers to inclusive economic growth and social development       in the Northern Triangle.  [[Page S6441]]         (14) In January 2018 and May 2018, the Trump Administration       announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status       designations for Honduras and El Salvador, respectively,       which would affect more than 500,000 individuals and their       United States citizen children who may have to return to       dangerous conditions in those countries.        (15) In a November 2017 letter to the Department of       Homeland Security, then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson       warned that as a result of ending Temporary Protected Status,       the Governments of El Salvador and Honduras ``may take       retaliatory actions counter to our long-standing national       security and economic interests like withdrawing their       counternarcotics and anti-gang cooperation with the United       States, reducing their willingness to accept the return of       their deported citizens, or refraining from efforts to       control illegal migration.''.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) United States support is necessary to address irregular       migration by addressing the violence and humanitarian crisis       in the Northern Triangle, which has resulted in the elevated       numbers of Central American unaccompanied children, women,       and other refugees and migrants arriving at the Southwestern       border of the United States;        (2) the violence and humanitarian crisis is linked to the       severe challenges posed by--        (A) high rates of homicide, sexual and gender-based       violence, and violent crime perpetrated by armed criminal       actors, including drug trafficking organizations and criminal       gangs, such as the MS-13 and 18th Street gangs;        (B) endemic corruption carried out by organized networks       and the weak rule of law, including the limited institutional       capacity of national police forces, public prosecutors, and       court systems; and        (C) the limited capabilities and lack of political will on       the part of Northern Triangle governments to establish the       rule of law, guarantee security, and ensure the well-being of       their citizens;        (3) the United States must work with international       partners--        (A) to address the complicated conditions in the Northern       Triangle that contribute to the violence and humanitarian       crisis; and        (B) to guarantee protections for vulnerable populations,       particularly women and children, fleeing violence in the       region;        (4) the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern       Triangle, which was developed by the Governments of El       Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, with the technical       assistance of the Inter-American Development Bank, represents       a comprehensive approach to address the complex situation in       the Northern Triangle;        (5) the United States Strategy for Engagement in Central       America, as first developed by President Obama and Vice       President Biden, provides important support for the Alliance       for Prosperity and other United States national security       priorities, including rule of law and anti-corruption       initiatives;        (6) the Trump Administration's proposed cuts in United       States foreign assistance for Central America for fiscal       years 2018 and 2019, if implemented, would undermine the       United States ability to work with the Governments of El       Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to address critical United       States national security priorities and the factors driving       migration to the United States;        (7) the Trump Administration must reverse its decision to       terminate the Temporary Protected Status designations for El       Salvador and Honduras in order to prevent negative       consequences to United States foreign policy objectives;        (8) the United States should partner with the Government of       Mexico--        (A) to strengthen Mexico's internal asylum system; and        (B) ensure that Mexico upholds international and       humanitarian standards;        (9) combating corruption in the Northern Triangle must       remain a critical priority and the United States must       continue its public and financial support for the United       Nation's Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) and       the Organization of American States' Mission to Support the       Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH) as       part of this effort;        (10) the Government of Guatemala should reverse its       efforts--        (A) to terminate CICIG's mandate; and        (B) to undermine the effectiveness of CICIG's ongoing       operations, including prohibiting the current CICIG       Commissioner from entering the country; and        (11) it is imperative for the United States to implement a       multi-year strategy and sustain a long-term commitment to       addressing the underlying factors causing Central Americans       to flee their countries by strengthening citizen security,       the rule of law, democratic governance, the protection of       human rights, and inclusive economic growth in the Northern       Triangle.       SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
