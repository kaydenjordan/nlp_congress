 Mr. President, I rise to join my voice with a growing  chorus of citizens, as well as members of the scientific community and  colleagues, who are deeply disturbed by this CRA to repeal vital  wildlife protections from Federal land in Alaska.   Before I speak on this CRA, I would like to be clear that I am not  someone who believes all regulations are good. In fact, I don't believe  we should be trying to regulate our way out of all of our problems. I  am proud of the work I have done, with people on both sides of the  aisle, in an effort to make our government work smarter and more  efficiently for the benefit of my constituents in New Jersey, as well  as all Americans, but today I am profoundly disappointed.   Instead of working to create bipartisan policies that will serve all  Americans, we are now considering a CRA resolution--unfortunately, one  of many ones of this type--that prioritizes special interests above the  good of the public, and it is deeply unpopular, in fact, with the  public at large.   I oppose this CRA that would repeal the U.S. Fish and Wildlife's rule  called the non-subsistence take of wildlife on national wildlife  refuges in Alaska rule. The rule was finalized by the Fish and Wildlife  Service in August of 2016, with the clear goal to forever ban  unnecessary and extremely cruel methods of killing bears and wolves and  other animals on more than 70 million acres of public land managed  under our Federal National Wildlife Refuge System in Alaska.   Let's be clear. When it says the word ``take''--that it prevents the  ``take'' of wildlife--that means the killing of wildlife. Specifically,  the rule prevents inhumane killing of animals on our wildlife refuges.   Examples of the rule are: prohibits the killing of mother bears and  their cubs. It prevents the killing of wolves and pups in their dens.  It prohibits using planes to track and kill bears. It prohibits using  snares to strangle and kill bears, steel traps to kill bears, and it  prohibits baiting and killing of grizzly bears.   Why was this rule issued by the Fish and Wildlife Service in the  first place? Our national wildlife refuges are public lands that exist  for the benefit of all Americans. Refuge lands are managed by the Fish  and Wildlife Service for the express purpose of conserving natural  diversity in wildlife populations. This means that any management  activity that favors certain species over others is inconsistent with  the goals of the National Wildlife Refuge.   It doesn't mean that hunting is not allowed on Federal land. Hunting  is one of many permitted practices on wildlife refuges, and this rule  does not prevent hunting on any wildlife refuge. What is permitted on  refuges under this law is the indiscriminate killing of bears and  wolves in an attempt to boost populations of moose and caribou.   Unfortunately, this is exactly how Alaska has been managing its  wildlife since 1994 on State and private lands, when it adopted an  intensive management strategy for its wildlife that is specifically  designed to artificially reduce populations of predators so hunters  might have more prey, more animals to kill.   In Alaska, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the State work together  to manage wildlife within the National Wildlife Refuge System. However,  when any State's wildlife management approach is in direct conflict  with the goals of the refuge system, the Federal Government has the  authority--indeed the obligation--to step in and ban certain practices.  This is exactly what the Fish and Wildlife did last year when they  issued their rule prohibiting this inhumane killing method on 16  Federal national wildlife refuges in Alaska.   It is important to note that the predator control practices I have  described, some of which are currently allowed on certain State and  private lands in Alaska, have never been allowed on national wildlife  refuges in Alaska. This rule simply clarifies that these practices-- even those explicitly authorized under State regulations in Alaska--are  never to be used on Federal wildlife lands in Alaska, regardless of  what is decided to be allowed under this State law.   I have heard concerns from my colleagues in Alaska that they believe  the Fish and Wildlife Service rule triggers a State sovereignty issue  by dictating which practices can and cannot be used on Federal refuge  lands in Alaska. However, I don't believe this rule conflicts with any  of Alaska's State sovereignty. The Fish and Wildlife Service has clear  statutory and constitutional authority to prohibit wildlife management  practices that are incompatible with the objectives of national  wildlife refuges in Alaska, as well as other States, including New  Jersey.   I have also heard the concerns of my Alaska colleagues that this rule  threatens the many Alaskans who rely on subsistence, hunting of deer,  moose, and caribou, to feed themselves and their families. I have  sympathy for that concern and believe again that this subsistence  hunting is not affected.   We know these predator control practices have never been done on  Alaskan refuges before. This argument makes no sense. It is not  affecting the subsistence hunting of deer and moose and caribou for  them to feed their families. It has never been allowed to go on in the  first place. How can these practices be necessary to preserve  subsistence hunting when they have never been done before on Federal  wildlife refuges? I want to be clear about something. Alaska is free to  manage its wildlife on State lands and private lands however Alaska  chooses. This point is not up for debate, not up for discussion. It is  not the subject of the Fish and Wildlife Services rule in question. The  rule only applies to federally owned and federally managed wildlife  refuge land, which must be managed for the benefit of the American  public, including the requirement to manage for national diversity of  wildlife.   As former Fish and Wildlife Director Dan Ashe announced in a press  release in August, ``Whenever possible, we prefer to defer to the State  of Alaska on regulation of general hunting and trapping of wildlife on  national wildlife refuges unless by doing so we are out of compliance  with Federal law and policy. This regulation ensures that we comply  with our mandates and obligations.''   Let's move beyond talk of mandates and obligations. The hunting  practices banned by this rule are flatout inhumane. They are an  anathema to the type of thoughtful, humane wildlife management that  should be taking place on national wildlife refuges.   In a committee hearing, I asked management experts about this rule  last  [[Page S1879]]  week, and they agree that these practices were not necessary on  wildlife refuges. In fact, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Acting  Director Jim Kurth--who was the former manager for many years of the  Arctic Wildlife Refuge in Northern Alaska--testified that the service  did not find that the practice prohibited by this rule was in any way  necessary.   Another witness, Brian Nesvik, Chief Game Warden with the Wyoming  Game and Fish Department--again, a Republican-invited witness-- testified that Wyoming has a different perspective on utilizing  national wildlife refuges in their State. The practices discussed in  this rule, he said, are not used in Wyoming's wildlife refuges, nor did  he make an appeal to use these inhumane practices because they are not  necessary. Killing a mother bear or mother wolf when she has young cubs  virtually guarantees that those cubs will not survive, creating the  potential for much broader negative impacts on the overall population.   The baiting of grizzly bears, which involves putting piles of food  out to attract bears in unusually high numbers at the start of hunting  season, is literally akin to shooting fish in a barrel. Bear baiting  often occurs when bears are desperately searching for those extra  calories to store energy for hibernation. It is an inhumane practice  and is recognized so by many experts.   The use of aircraft hunting--using a plane to track wild animals and  then landing to kill them--violates the principle of fair chase in  every sense of the word. In fact, killing wolves from aircraft or on  the same day that air travel occurred was already prohibited on refuge  lands prior to this new rule being issued. The new rule merely extends  that same protection to bears.   Finally, the use of snares--these are these choking traps--and steel  traps to kill the bear is a practice that is particularly troubling,  and I am not alone. A statewide poll of Alaskans themselves shows that  nearly 60 percent of Alaskans oppose trapping and snaring bears in  their State.   Charles Darwin called the leghold trap one of the cruelest devices  ever invented by man, stating:         Few men could endure to watch for five minutes an animal       struggling in a trap with a torn limb.        Some who reflect upon this subject for the first time will       wonder how such cruelty can have been permitted to continue       in these days of civilisation.    That was Charles Darwin decades and decades ago in 1863. I echo that  again today, more than 150 years later. Such cruelty should not be  permitted on Federal wildlife refuges of all places, and the Fish and  Wildlife Service was absolutely right to permanently protect bears from  such cruelty on Alaska's wildlife refuges.   I would like to take a few more moments to talk about the animals  that are subject to this rule. Grizzly bears and wolves are the top  predators in North America. Predators in any ecosystem play a critical  role in maintaining populations and in preventing problems like we have  actually seen in New Jersey by the overgrazing and disease that can  occur when deer, moose, and caribou grow in high numbers.   These charismatic animals also attract huge numbers of tourists to  national parks, refuges, and other wild lands in the United States. All  across the country, nearly 72 million Americans spend over $50 billion  on wildlife watching.   In Alaska, wildlife watchers outnumber hunters by nearly five to one,  and they also contribute more than four times as much money to the  State's economy as hunting does. Put another way, even considering the  issue from an economic perspective, these animals are worth far more  alive than they are dead, killed by these savage inhumane practices.   There are few values as deeply entrenched in the American culture as  conservation. This legacy is our American heritage, and the coexistence  of people, wildlife, and wild lands remains a key objective for our  public lands today.   Americans interact with nature in many different ways on public  lands, some through consumption uses, like hunting and fishing, and  others through more hands-off activities, like camping and wildlife  watching. No single use is more important and more valuable than  another. So public lands should be managed in a way that minimizes  conflict across those different uses while allowing for natural  diversity.   The Fish and Wildlife Service rule does just that. Our wildlife  refuges are not game parks, and they should not be managed as though  they are.   The cruel practices this rule prohibits--killing mother animals and  their babies and the trapping, snaring, baiting, and aerial hunting of  bears--are practices that I believe do not align with who we are as a  country. They are practices that have no place on our national wildlife  refuges in Alaska or any other State.   I want to close with something that my friend Senator Heinrich  already mentioned. Many people know that Teddy Roosevelt was an avid  hunter, a naturalist, a wildlife enthusiast. When he was President,  Roosevelt went on a bear hunting trip in Mississippi. Roosevelt's  hunting party cornered a Louisiana black bear. They tied it to a willow  tree and suggested the President shoot it.   Viewing this as an extremely unsportsmanlike way to kill a bear,  Roosevelt refused to do it. A political cartoonist heard the story and  drew a cartoon that celebrated President Roosevelt's decision. A  Brooklyn candy shop owner saw the cartoon and decided to create a  stuffed toy bear and dedicated it to the President, who refused to  engage in this kind of inhumane hunting of a bear. He called it a  ``Teddy bear'' or ``Teddy's bear,'' and little children for generations  have been loving them ever since.   Teddy Roosevelt knew that using certain methods to kill animals was  immoral and wrong. We know this too.   With all of the issues going on right now--from healthcare to tax and  all of the issues and urgencies, such as infrastructure--why are we  about to consider a CRA that would literally, on our Federal lands,  allow the cruelest types of killing to go on of bears and wolves and  their pups in dens.   Why, with all that is going on, would we, as Americans, violate our  culture and history by allowing the most inhumane, cruel killing  practices to go on? Why, with all that we have to do, are we going to  allow this to happen?   Well, I will not support it, and I stand against it. Our national  wildlife refuges--our refuges for wildlife--have never allowed these  cruel practices, and we should not start now.   We should not CRA this rule. I stand strong and firm in honor of our  traditions and stand against this CRA.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that floor  privileges be granted to the following member of my staff, Ariana  Spawn.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
