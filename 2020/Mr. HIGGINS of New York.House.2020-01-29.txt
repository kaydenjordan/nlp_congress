 Mr. Speaker, 80 years ago this week,  Americans began receiving Social Security benefits. Social Security is  a highly popular and successful program with a trust fund exceeding  $1.9 trillion.   With rising life expectancy since the program's inception,  adjustments need to be made to improve and strengthen Social Security  for future generations.   The Social Security 2100 Act, sponsored by Congressman   John Larson  of Connecticut, will increase benefits for all current and future  beneficiaries; will improve cost-of-living-adjustments to keep up with  real inflation; will cut taxes for millions of beneficiaries; and  improve and strengthen Social Security through the 21st century and  beyond.   I urge passage of the Social Security 2100 Act.                            ____________________
