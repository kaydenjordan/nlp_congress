 Mr. Speaker, a year ago, this pandemic changed our  country; and during this year, more than 525,000 Americans have died  from the virus, including 7,800 Marylanders. Too many jobs have been  lost, too many families are struggling, and too many businesses have  shuttered.   The American Rescue Plan provides a lifeline for our country. The  average family of four in my district will receive approximately  $10,000 of direct assistance. With another round of stimulus checks and  the expansion of the child tax credit, we will get families back on  their feet and cut child poverty in half.   The American Recuse Plan will also aid our communities during this  crisis, funding that will expand vaccinations, especially in Black and  Brown communities; money to help safely open schools; and assistance to  keep teachers, transit workers, and other public servants on the job.   This unprecedented crisis calls on us to meet the moment with  decisive action. Mr. Speaker, the American Rescue Plan is that decisive  action.                            ____________________
