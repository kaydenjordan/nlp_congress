 Madam President, I would ask unanimous consent that I be  recognized for such time as I may consume.    Madam President, let me just say to my good friend from  New Jersey how wholeheartedly I agree with him. I have known Tony  Blinken for a long period of time. I have worked with him in different  venues. I talked to him today at some length, and we talked together on  many issues that I think are significant.   One issue out there is the one we have been talking about in the  Western Sahara. He understands the issues. So I join my friend from New  Jersey in encouraging a fast and quick confirmation.    Madam President, we recently said goodbye to a lot of  really good, hard-working men and women from the previous  administration, and I want to highlight a few of them.   We refer to them--some of my friends and some of my enemies refer to  them as the ``Inhofe mafia.'' It comes from the committees that I have  chaired, both the Armed Services Committee as well as the Environment  and Public Works Committee. But anyway, they are really a great bunch  of people.   I am going to start with Andrew Wheeler. Andrew Wheeler was with me  for a number of years--14 years--before he became the Director of the  EPA. Here is a guy who was nominated to be the Administrator. At that  time, I said that there is no one in America who is as qualified as  Andrew Wheeler for this job. The first job he had out of law school was  with the EPA. When he was nominated to be Administrator, I kind of gave  his whole life history.   All of my Senate colleagues know Andy and have known him for a long  period of time--Democrats and Republicans. He has worked for me in the  Senate as well as becoming one of my ``has-beens,'' as we refer to  people who used to be with me and are still my good friends.   Andy started in my personal office as chief counsel and went on to  serve as the staff director and chief counsel during my time as  chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. He has decades  of experience and is one of the most skilled energy and environmental  policy experts I have ever come in contact with, and I am immensely  proud of what he has been able to accomplish throughout his career, but  particularly as EPA Administrator.   Andy understood that the EPA's mission is to implement the laws that  are passed by Congress for the American people. The EPA's job is not to  legislate. A lot of people think that. That is our job, to legislate,  and then he carries it out, and he did really just a great job with  that.   Contrary to what many on the left say Republicans want, we do want  clean air and clean water and clean land, and Andy proved that he could  accomplish that without burdensome overregulation. During his time at  the EPA, he spearheaded a number of the rules and deregulatory actions  that brought important relief to American job creators while protecting  our environment.   He rolled back the economy standards on cars that were created to try  to force Americans to drive vehicles they don't want to drive and that  they can't afford. In its replacement, Andy developed the SAFE vehicles  rule, which expands consumer choice and lowers the price of vehicles.   Andy also repealed and replaced the waters of the United States rule,  or WOTUS. On the WOTUS rule, if you talk to any of the agricultural  groups--I am talking about the Farm Bureau and other agricultural  groups--they would say that was the rule we really had to do something  about. States like mine don't need Washington bureaucrats imposing  their radical regulations like WOTUS on people who know the waters  better than they do. It is not an overstatement when I say that this  was probably the greatest regulatory burden facing Oklahoma's farmers,  landowners, and ranchers during the Obama administration. I was proud  to see WOTUS repealed by the navigable waters protection rule, which  provided a clean and lawful definition of waters of the United States  and doesn't try to overregulate the arid parts of the State.   Oklahoma is an arid State. If you go out to the western part of  Oklahoma, the panhandle of Oklahoma, it is really arid. If you take  that regulation out of the hands of the States and give it to the  Federal Government, there is always a concern by our farmers and  ranchers in Oklahoma and across the Nation that they would turn these  arid areas into wetlands.   Another of the regulatory overhauls accomplished by Andy was for the  affordable clean energy or the ACE rule that replaced the illegal Clean  Power Plan, which regulated emissions of coal-fired powerplants. I had  long been critical of the Clean Power Plan and led the charge against  it in the Senate.  [[Page S93]]  Like most of that era of the rules, it was a Federal power grab, and it  would have sent Americans' electricity bills soaring, and we all knew  that. But we made it history when we repealed and replaced the Clean  Power Plan with the ACE rule. It was good. Not only did this rule help  Americans' electricity costs be affordable, it is expected to benefit  the environment as well.   Just last month, the EPA finalized another big rule that requires EPA  to prepare a cost-benefit analysis before coming up with new  regulations. How is that at all unreasonable? Americans shake their  heads, and they wonder why we would pass things that don't have any  kind of a cost-benefit analysis. What is it going to cost? What kind of  sacrifices are we going to have to make? Well, we put that into effect,  and I think it is something people are very thankful for.   Throughout his tenure, Andy has been focused on what is in the best  interests of the taxpayers and not just the Washington bureaucrats.  That is clear with this rule and countless others.   You know, one of the good things about Andy, as I already mentioned,  is that he knows more about the process than anybody else does--more  about the EPA. He has always been a star, and he started at the bottom.  When he was first put into that office and was confirmed as EPA  director, he gave a speech over at the EPA. He didn't know I was there.  I went over there to hear it. He had 300 people at the EPA all  listening to him and looking at him and saying: There is room at the  top for me. Here is a guy who started at the very bottom and ended up  as director of the EPA. It didn't go unnoticed. Everybody realized  that.   So I would ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an E&E  News article from July 2018, which details a number of the former staff  people and their backgrounds   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                               [July 6, 2018]                `Brave New World' as Team Inhofe Takes Over                            (By Robin Bravender)         It's official: Alumni of the best-known climate skeptic in       Congress are leading EPA.        Former aides to Sen. Jim lnhofe (R-Okla.) have helped shape       President Trump's energy policy agenda since even before he       was elected. Many of them quickly landed top spots at EPA and       in the White House, and Inhofe alumnus Ryan Jackson helped       shepherd Scott Pruitt through the confirmation process before       becoming his chief of staff at the agency last year.        But now an ex-Inhofe staffer is taking the reins as Pruitt       leaves under a cloud of controversies.        Andrew Wheeler, who steps in as EPA's chief on Monday, was       staff director and chief counsel to Inhofe on the Senate       Environment and Public Works Committee for much of the George       W. Bush administration.        Jackson, a longtime friend of Wheeler, is expected to       remain as EPA's chief of staff after Pruitt's exit. Jackson--      a native Oklahoman--was an Inhofe aide who worked as EPW       staff director and Inhofe's chief of staff.        Brittany Bolen became the acting head of EPA's policy shop       after Samantha Dravis left earlier this year. Bolen was       Republican counsel to Inhofe on the EPW Committee. Daisy       Letendre, a communications adviser in the policy office, was       Inhofe's communications director.        And former Inhofe counsel Mandy Gunasekara is now principal       deputy assistant administrator in EPA's air office.        Republicans and some energy industry lobbyists say Inhofe's       alumni network brings deep policy knowledge to EPA and is       well-positioned to bring calm to an agency that has been       mired in controversies under Pruitt.        ``With these Inhofe staff, you get all of the Pruitt policy       and none of the Pruitt baggage,'' said an energy lobbyist and       former congressional staffer.        It makes sense that ex-Inhofe aides would populate EPA       under a Republican administration, the lobbyist said, given       Inhofe's long tenure as the top Republican on the Senate       committee charged with overseeing the agency. ``He has hired       a lot of smart people to work for him who were goqd and have       gone on to do various other things,'' the lobbyist said.        Those staffers have a history of working closely with       Democrats on Capitol Hill, that person added: ``I think that       the Democrat staff and members believe that Inhofe and the       Inhofe staffers treated them fairly when they were up       there.''        They also share an appreciation for process, said Matt       Dempsey, Inhofe's former communications director.        He expects his former colleagues to take a ``back to       basics'' approach at EPA. ``It's not necessarily a political       agenda, but it's a policy-based agenda,'' he said.        That contrasts with how many people viewed Pruitt, who was       widely thought to be trying to use EPA as a stepping stool to       reach higher political office.        Under Wheeler, ``the whole tone is going to be different,''       the energy lobbyist said. ``People are going to perceive that       Andy is going to spend his time on policy and not thinking       about whether he's the next senator from Oklahoma.''        But as Republicans and many in industry are celebrating the       rise of the Inhofe crowd at EPA, some on the left are furious       that disciples of the Senate's most vocal climate change       skeptic--famous for throwing a snowball on the Senate floor       to try to disprove global warming--are leading the agency       tasked with protecting the environment.        ``It is a brave new world of pro-fossil-fuel ideologues who       seem not to care about anything but industry profits, the       rest of the country be damned,'' said Bill Snape, an attorney       at the Center for Biological Diversity. ``We're all getting       hit in the head by the snowball at this point. It's obviously       disturbing'.''     Madam President, at the top of the list was my chief of  staff, Ryan Jackson. Like Andy, Ryan also went on to be my staff  director of the EPW Committee, Environment and Public Works, where he  helped negotiate bipartisan bills for highway, water, and  infrastructure to environmental bills like TSCA. Remember, that was the  one that had the chemical regulations. In his role he helped me  negotiate with former California Senator Barbara Boxer.   This is kind of interesting. I think the Presiding Officer would find  this to be interesting. Barbara Boxer and I--for many, many years,  every time the Republicans were in the majority, I was the chairman of  that committee, and she was the ranking member. Every time the  Democrats were in control, she was the chairman, and I was the ranking  member. So we worked together, and we accomplished more. I won't  divulge where the meeting is, but there is a meeting that Republicans  have historically had at 12:15 p.m. on a Tuesday with all the members  of the committees, the chairmen. We would talk about what we have done,  and when it was my turn, I would say: Now from the committee that  actually gets things done. That was Barbara Boxer and I. No two people  could be further apart philosophically than Barbara Boxer and I, yet we  were able to do that with the help of Ryan Jackson.   I actually hired him when he was still in college. He left my office  early 2017 to go to work as Chief of Staff at the EPA, where he was a  central player in the implementation of the last administration's  policies.   In February, he left the EPA, which was when Mandy Gunasekara took  office as chief of staff. Mandy worked for me in the EPW Committee for  several years as the majority counsel. In that role she helped me craft  air and other policy priorities. While at the EPA, she has been  instrumental in advancing priorities like the ACE rule that I mentioned  earlier. She is a skilled and devoted public servant, and I am proud of  all that she has done to advance policies that benefit all Americans.   A number of others of what I refer to as my ``has-beens'' have served  at the EPA over the last 4 years. Susan Bodine was the chief counsel on  EPW and went on to serve as Assistant Administrator in the Office of  Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.   Brittany Bolen was counsel for the EPW, Environment and Public Works  Committee, and went on to serve as Associate Administrator for the  Office of Policy.   Byron Brown was senior counsel at the EPW and went on to serve as  Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy.   Then there is Daisy Letendre. She was communications director in my  office and went on to serve as a Senior Advisor in the Office of  Policy.   So I am proud of all my ``has-beens'' and the big impact that they  have had on our country. We are grateful for their service, past and  present--especially that of Andrew Wheeler and Ryan Jackson. I say to  our friends Wheeler and Jackson: Thank you and good luck in your next  endeavors. You did great work.   Let me just mention one last thing. I urge the Biden administration  not to repeal a lot of the rules and regulations and deregulation  initiatives that gave us the economy that was unprecedented during the  time before the pandemic set in. It would be devastating to our  country, which is already trying to recover from the pandemic. Now is  not  [[Page S94]]  the time to impose costly new regulations on Americans and the job  creators in this country. Everyone knows that this pandemic has wreaked  havoc on our economy, and I am certain that, had we not had the virus,  we would have broken even more economic records than we already had.   Prior to the pandemic, we had the best economy of our life. We set  records, with small business optimism reaching the highest level on  record in its 45-year history and unemployment hitting a 50-year low of  3.5 percent. We have always said in the past that full employment is 4  percent. We brought it down that entire year, and in February of 2020  it was down to 3.5 percent. It never had happened before. The median  household income rose to a record high in 2019, the highest since 1967.  The wealth of American families rose. That is an indicator. It rose to  the highest level in history. So these good things were happening, and  I would urge this administration not to repeal some of these  regulations. Repealing some of these regulations would simply reverse  gains like these.   I urge the Biden administration to work with me and others to reach  compromises on regulations that would benefit all Americans. That seems  to be pretty reasonable, and I think that is a good program to do.  Let's give it a try. OK?   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
