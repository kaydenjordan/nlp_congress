 Madam Speaker, last week, my wife,  Penny, and I honored those who make Independence Day possible by  attending our son Logan's reenlistment and promotion to Army sergeant  first class at Fort Drum, New York.   This occasion reminded me that our independence relies upon the  vigilance of our citizens and those who have fought to defend our  freedoms.   Regarding Independence Day, John Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail:  ``It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance by solemn acts  of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and  parade, with shews, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and  illuminations from one end  [[Page H5732]]  of this continent to the other from this time forward forevermore.''   Following the Constitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin was asked  what sort of government the delegates had created. Without hesitation,  he responded, ``A republic, if you can keep it.''   President Reagan aptly stated that freedom isn't something passed to  our children in the bloodstream.   Preserving our freedom is certainly a responsibility of this  generation as any past.   Madam Speaker, I commend those who continue to make these freedoms  possible, and I look forward to a future where these freedoms will be  defended for generations to come.                            ____________________
