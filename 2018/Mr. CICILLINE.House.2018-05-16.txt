 Mr. Speaker, when it comes to affordable healthcare  and prescription drugs, President Trump and the Republicans are forcing  the American people to swallow a raw deal.   They have voted to dismantle protections for preexisting conditions.  They have voted to raise out-of-pocket expenses. They have voted to  take away health coverage from 23 million Americans. And they gave  billions of dollars in tax breaks to pharmaceutical companies and other  healthcare organizations. Last week, President Trump outlined his plan  to further line the pockets of big drug companies and their CEOs.   Democrats have A Better Deal. Our plan will fundamentally reform the  pharmaceutical industry, will put government on the side of consumers  and middle class families--not giant corporations--by cracking down on  outrageous prescription drug price increases, allowing Medicare to  negotiate lower prices for drugs, and requiring drug manufacturers to  publicly release hard data justifying any significant price increase.   This is the kind of deal the American people deserve: A Better Deal  that will produce higher wages, lower costs, and the tools to succeed  in the 21st century--not the raw deal that the President and the  Republicans are offering on prescription drugs.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the  underlying Republican farm bill, which could devastate working  families, seniors, and the vulnerable who rely on food assistance.   Currently, more than 41 million Americans receive benefits through  the Federal food assistance program known as SNAP. Close to two-thirds  are children, the elderly, and the disabled. However, this partisan  bill would reduce SNAP benefits by $23.3 billion, denying hundreds of  thousands of American families who rely on this food support. Millions  more will see their benefits reduced because Republicans are recklessly  increasing the burden on recipients and changing eligibility  requirements.   In December, Republicans passed a tax bill benefiting the wealthiest  Americans and the most powerful corporate special interests. This  Republican tax scam increases our national debt by $2 trillion over the  next 10 years, and now our Republican colleagues are hypocritically  trying to pay for these huge tax cuts for the wealthy by taking away  resources for Americans who need them most.   Republicans are using this formerly bipartisan process to continue to  undermine the well-being of children, the elderly, and the disabled to  give gifts to the wealthy. This goes against everything we stand for as  a country.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule and to oppose  the bill.    Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 185.
