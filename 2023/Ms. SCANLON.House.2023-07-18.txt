 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Indiana for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, with the two bills under consideration in today's rule,  we have a striking example of the best and worst that this Chamber can  produce.   The first bill reauthorizes the Federal Aviation Administration for  another 5 years. That bill is the product of bipartisan negotiations  between the members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.  It was debated and amended in committee with the full participation of  all members, Republicans and Democrats, and it passed out of that  committee with unanimous support--unanimous support.   So this FAA bill is an example of how the legislative process can and  should work when Members of Congress seek results and are willing to  work together to address the interests of the American people.   The other bill in today's rule could not be more different. It is an  unserious, hyper-partisan proposal from rightwing extremists designed  to sow division and fear by pushing false narratives about immigrants  and what is happening in our public schools.   In a truly bizarre twist for the party of small government, this bill  would have the Federal Government dictating to our local governments  and schools what they should do with their buildings.   All of this is done under the guise of solving a fake crisis  manufactured by Republicans, both by sending migrants to cities run by  Democrats in a failed attempt to score political points and, more  importantly, by refusing to come to the table and genuinely address the  critical need for substantive reforms to our immigration system.   If everyone would follow the lead of our colleagues on the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and if our rightwing  colleagues could drop the heated rhetoric and partisan nonsense, there  are many solutions that Republicans and Democrats could work on  together to serve the American people, and we would welcome that  opportunity.   I will return to this point, Mr. Speaker, but first let's talk about  the two bills.   H.R. 3935, the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American  Aviation Act, will reauthorize the FAA for 5 years and make a variety  of much-needed improvements to the laws governing aviation in the  United States.   I am encouraged by many of the policy wins that Democrats achieved in  the bill, including policies to increase funding for airport  infrastructure, increase the scope of projects eligible for funding,  hire more air traffic controllers, and grow the talent pipeline for  hiring and training the next generation of pilots, mechanics, and  aviation manufacturing workers.   This bill also takes some much-needed steps to improve the passenger  experience. The bill requires airlines to reimburse passengers for  hotel and meal costs when their flight is canceled or significantly  delayed.   It requires airlines to allow families to sit together, and it  requires airlines to make accommodations for passengers traveling with  wheelchairs or other assistive devices, and to compensate those  travelers if their property is damaged.   While this bill is good, it is far from perfect. I recognize that  when you negotiate, Mr. Speaker, you don't always get what you want.  However, Mr. Speaker, when you negotiate with this House Republican  majority, it is not only that you don't get what you want, it is also  that you get less than what is needed to actually fix the problem at  hand.   Mr. Speaker, anyone who has taken a flight knows the sorry state of  our Nation's airports. While our country was once First in Flight, our  airports are now collectively second and third rate, and that is a  policy choice by Congress.   Over the past 30 years, we have underfunded our airports, forcing  them to get by on inadequate budgets and limited revenue streams. The  result is crystal clear to anyone who flies: old, crowded airports,  large backlogs in runway maintenance, and a passenger experience that  is often unpleasant from the moment you try to check in, Mr. Speaker,  until you arrive at your destination. We did hear a fair amount of  commentary on that from our colleagues in the Rules Committee last  night.   The passenger experience at many U.S. airports is eclipsed by  virtually every other airport in Europe and Asia, and there is no good  excuse for that.   Beyond the benefits of improving the flying experience for American  travelers, having first-class airports should be a point of national  pride. We are not putting our best foot forward when foreign tourists  visit the United States, the richest country on Earth, and the first  thing they experience is a crumbling, unattractive, and inefficient  airport.    The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act made a massive investment  in our Nation's airports, and dozens of projects have broken ground as  a result. However, the IIJA was a onetime investment and gives us about  5 years of boosted airport funding. We need to build on the success of  that bill, not rest on our laurels and pretend that this short-term fix  was a long-term solution to decades of underinvestment.   In addition, I would have liked to have seen stronger protections for  workers and consumers. I strongly oppose the provision in the bill to  raise the pilot retirement age to 67, and I would have liked to have  seen reforms to organize and form a union and to hold the airlines  accountable for junk fees, delays, and cancellations.   However, Mr. Speaker, again, I recognize that any bill of this sort  is a compromise, and in a compromise you have to work with others who  don't share your beliefs, and you can't always get your own way.   It is important to pass this bill in a timely way so that we are able  to maintain and improve our aviation functions without a lapse.   Mr. Speaker, the other bill in today's rule is the so-called Schools  Not Shelters Act or, as one of my colleagues called it, the defund our  schools act.   This bill is a monumental waste of the House's time and taxpayer  dollars.  [[Page H3652]]  It is nothing more than an attempt by House Republicans to double down  on their demonization of immigrants. The House had this same debate  last month when Republicans brought to the floor a poorly drafted and  fact-free resolution to the same effect.   Now they have turned that resolution into a bill so they can continue  their failed efforts to sow fear of immigrants in order to score  political points. This bill does nothing to address the needs of  communities facing an influx of migrant families or to solve the  problems facing our schools. It is nothing more than another vehicle to  create division and stoke culture wars because that is the point.   Starting with the last administration, rightwing Republicans at the  State and Federal level have abused migrant families and children  fleeing poverty and violence to manufacture a crisis using them as  pawns to score points.   For example, if Greg Abbott, the Governor of Texas, was genuinely  unable to safely shelter migrants, he could have reached out in good  faith to State and local leaders around the country to collaborate on  solutions instead of shipping migrant families to those places without  any notice or coordination.   He could have reached out to the Biden administration for additional  resources, and he could have come to Congress and asked for emergency  funding.   Instead, when faced with all those options, Governor Abbott decided  to mislead or trick migrants and ship them to other parts of the  country with no coordination or communication to the receiving  communities.   One of the destinations chosen by Governor Abbott, and Governor  DeSantis as well, was Philadelphia. I met some of those migrant  families last winter. During the week between Christmas and New Year's  when temperatures were at or below freezing, they sent buses of  families and children to Philadelphia. These families arrived in T- shirts and sandals. They had no jacket and no gloves, and they were  dropped off on the street at 6 a.m. and in the middle of the night.   If not for the mercy and decency of our city officials, charities,  churches, and advocates, those poor souls would have been left on the  street in the middle of winter.   These are human beings. These are families with children. They are  people escaping horrors that apparently our colleagues can't even  imagine. I still struggle to process the willingness of those  Republican Governors to harm people and the willingness of our  colleagues to enable them.   While those Republican Governors thought that everyone shared their  contempt and disregard for the humanity of these families, they were  dead wrong. All over the country, the cities that have received these  migrants did so with open arms and worked in unison with their faith  communities, with volunteers, and with advocates to find solutions  rather than to inflict further harm.   They refused to play this sick game. They welcomed the migrants with  compassion. I continue to be inspired by the fundamental decency and  kindness of the Americans who mobilized to help migrants come to our  shores yearning to breathe free, as we have throughout our American  history.   We are the country we are today because of the innumerable  contributions of immigrants from all over the world. So instead of  debating rightwing messaging bills to posture for the Republicans'  extremist base, we should be using our time to pass a clear, legal, and  efficient path to work, residency, and citizenship.   We need to pass the American Dream and Promise Act again to provide  Dreamers with a pathway to citizenship. However, our colleagues are not  offering solutions to our immigration challenges, they are just  offering complaints. They don't have a single, serious proposal for how  we can address the needs of our immigration system.   It is particularly galling that they have tried to reframe their  active mistreatment of migrant families as a threat to public  schoolchildren calling to defund public schools in retaliation against  local governments for addressing the mess that Governor Abbott created.   As my colleague, Mr. Neguse, pointed out in the Rules Committee  hearing last night, the House majority has made clear its priorities:  pushing unserious bills like this anti-immigrant bill while failing to  address the actual issues facing our public schools, including teacher  pay, student achievement gaps, gun violence, and hunger--daily hunger-- for schoolchildren.   Later this week when Republicans host their press conference to  celebrate passage of this bill, all these problems will still exist.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to passage of the FAA reauthorization  later this week, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am so sorry my colleague across the aisle  [[Page H3653]]  misunderstood me. The fake crisis I was referring to was the crisis  that this defund our schools bill is seeking to address, which is the  use of active public school buildings to house migrants.   That is a fake crisis. It is actually not happening across the  country, and it was brought up only after the Texas Governor sent  migrant families unannounced to New York State.   Obviously, we have an issue with the amount of migration occurring  throughout our hemisphere and the impact on our communities. I would  gladly work with anyone to make sure that all of our communities,  whether in Texas or New York or Philadelphia or Martha's Vineyard or  anywhere across our country have the resources they need to feed and  clothe the hungry and unsheltered people in those communities.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Speaker, as I suggested, this is just about  rightwing messaging, pushing a false narrative that anybody is  advocating for an open border--they aren't--while still refusing to  come to grips with what do we do with the people who come here? What do  we do with the people who are here?   If there are solutions, we would love to work together on them. One  of them appears to be providing enough resources for our communities to  feed and house folks.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to provide for consideration of a resolution  which unequivocally states that it is the House's duty to keep our  sacred promise to American workers and seniors to protect and preserve  Social Security and Medicare and reject any cuts to those essential  programs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record along with any extraneous material  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Escobar) to discuss this proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I find myself in complete agreement that we  should be addressing the actual issues, like student achievement, that  are impacting our students, but, obviously, this bill does none of  that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico  (Ms. Leger Fernandez), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New Mexico.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As I was listening to some of the prior speakers, I started to  understand why we have this defund the schools bill before us today. It  is based upon a whole bunch of misunderstandings.   The idea that migrants who are in the position where they are  potentially being housed in our communities, these folks have, in fact,  been vetted by our immigration agencies.   Second of all, no Federal school funding can be used for that  purpose. That funding is already restricted, and if it were to be used  for the purpose of housing migrants, it could be immediately clawed  back.   Again, this is a bill that accomplishes nothing and is based on a  series of alternative facts, and I strongly urge that we reject it and  the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we heard the gentleman describing parents of  schoolchildren being frightened, upset, and agitated because their  school needs, their education needs, their needs for food or remedial  education, are not being met.   I remind my colleagues that they hold the majority. They are able to  bring forward those bills and have the committee work to address those  needs, but, again, the bill before us today does none of that.   We would love to work together in a bipartisan manner, as the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has done, to present a  really good, forward-looking bill to address our Nation's aviation  needs. We would just like to extend that ability to work on solutions,  as opposed to culture wars, throughout the work before us for the good  of the people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, what we are seeing this week is a tale of two  Congresses, one that is capable of working across the aisle to solve  real problems but one that is increasingly held hostage by forces more  interested in culture wars and punching down on vulnerable people to  score political points.   I ask my House colleagues, again, to follow the example set by the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee as well as the House Armed  Services Committee. I think this building and our country work a lot  better when Members put their heads down and work on solutions to the  problems facing the country. I would like to think there are many  Members in both parties who would agree with that view. However, we  learned a lot last week from Kevin McCarthy and the most extreme  members of the Republican Party.   Since the first day of the 118th Congress, particularly on the Rules  Committee, we have heard countless lofty speeches from our Republican  colleagues about the need for more transparency in our processes, for  more amendments to be considered on the floor, for more debate, and for  more rank-and-file Members to have their priorities considered by the  whole House.   Last week, House Republicans had the chance to stand behind those  words and instead blocked over 1,000 amendments submitted to the NDAA.                                time  1315    Today's rule and the amendments allowed on it were negotiated behind  closed doors--not between Democrats and Republicans but between  Republicans and the most extreme members of that party.   Next week, Kevin McCarthy has already signaled that he is abandoning  his commitment to consider appropriations legislation under an open  rule.   It has become increasingly clear what the real deal is. It is an open  rule for the rightwing Freedom Caucus and a closed rule for everyone  else, including many Republicans who do not endorse the chaos and  antidemocratic impulses pushed by the far-right members of their party.   Despite the griping about regular order and empowering individual  Members, this Congress remains enthralled by a power grab--plain and  simple--by the most extreme members of the Republican majority.   We can now expect Speaker McCarthy to fold at the first sight of  trouble, meaning that the House is now run by its loudest and most  extreme Members.   Beyond being an embarrassing way to run a democratic institution,  this arrangement only serves to weaken the House and all but guarantees  that the Senate will jam us on big legislation like appropriations, the  NDAA, and the FAA reauthorization.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question and  the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, there have been more mass shootings this  year than there have been days.   We do not have to live like this.   Children are scared to go to school, parents are scared to put their  kids on the bus, and teachers are scared that they will have to protect  their students from a mass shooter in the classroom. The daily gun  violence that often goes unreported by the media, including suicide and  domestic violence, impacts neighborhoods in every corner of the  country.   We do not have to live like this.   Last Congress, House Democrats passed into law the most significant  gun violence prevention legislation in 30 years, but we know that was  only a baby step in the right direction. We have seen that evidence- based violence prevention programs, like group violence intervention,  can dramatically reduce gun violence. When it was implemented in the  city of Chester, Pennsylvania, 3 years ago, homicides by gun dropped by  over 60 percent. The expansion of that program to other cities around  the country is already yielding results, but we have also seen the  fatal impact of guns flooding our streets nationwide and making their  way into the hands of criminal or mentally unstable users.   We can't give up. Democrats are working to prevent the bloodshed.   We are offering commonsense legislation that will address the  epidemic of gun violence and protect the Second Amendment rights of  responsible gun owners.   Democrats introduced three discharge petitions last month to ban  assault weapons, require universal background checks, and close the  Charleston loophole. The MAGA Republicans running Congress don't want  these bills to come to the floor because they would have to make a  choice, and voters would see it, whether to side with the gun lobby  that funds their program, their campaigns, or to protect our kids and  our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, especially those who claim to be  moderates, to have the courage to sign the discharge petitions and  force Speaker McCarthy to bring the legislation to the floor and to  have the courage to choose kids over guns.   We do not have to live this way.
