 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent  that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last Saturday, October  7, we saw evil personified. We saw the deadliest attack on the Jewish  state since the Yom Kippur War, over 1,400 dead Israelis. And, for  context, think of that. If that were America, it would be over 40,000  dead Americans. On top of that, we have seen 30 Americans lose their  lives because of the evil brought upon Israel. We saw Hamas--an evil,  terrorist organization--launch an unprecedented, unprovoked, undeniably  devastating attack on the Jewish state.   I can't think of anything more evil than the images that we saw  coming out of Israel where grandmothers were taken captive, where  babies were burned alive, and where babies were beheaded. For what  reason? For what reason did we see the atrocities and the evil brought  upon a people? Simply because they were Jews.   Hamas, their goal is to eliminate the Jewish state, but that is not  where they stop. They want to annihilate every single Jewish person on  the planet, with more than 6 million living here at home in America.  But they go one step further. They despise Western democracy. They want  the elimination, the annihilation, of our entire way of life.   Fighting that war with the single-minded focus is exactly what we  should expect from the Jewish people, from the State of Israel, from  the Prime Minister, Prime Minister Netanyahu. He needs to have a  single-minded focus.   But that is not the case because we have seen, in the last 24 hours  or so, the emergence of a different kind of war that they now must  fight. It is the war of misinformation. The disinformation, the  misinformation war could be just as deadly, if not more deadly, than  the actual attack we saw last Saturday, October 7.   One might ask the question: Why would I say that? Well, I would say  that because immediately what we have seen since the devastation in  Israel was Prime Minister Netanyahu sending the signal that they were  coming into Gaza, giving people, the Palestinians, a chance to find  themselves out of harm's way.   But the misinformation campaign takes a different turn, a different  spin,  [[Page S5072]]  a different direction. What it said was that the hospital strike was,  in fact, carried out by Israel. That misinformation was carried in the  New York Times, the AP, and other news outlets in America. That  misinformation campaign caused a summit in Jordan to be canceled. It  caused President Biden's meetings to be canceled. It caused protests at  embassies around the globe. Our Embassies, around the world, felt the  devastation of misinformation, of lies, signaling to the world that now  Israel must fight a different kind of war at the exact same time that  they have a proportional response, which is and should be wiping Hamas  off the face of the map.   We saw, as a result of that misinformation war, Hezbollah mobilizing.  We have seen very clearly an attempt to weaken Israel and their  standing in the world. Devastation after devastation and then, on top  of that, we see the emergence of another deadly encounter.   Rather than waiting for the facts, these outlets carried the Hamas  narrative, carrying the narrative of an evil, lying terrorist  organization.   On top of that and equally as devastating is to see the divide within  the House of Representatives, where the vast majority of Republicans  and Democrats stand firm with our ally Israel. But there are Members in  the Squad who have decided to continue spreading the propaganda of  Hamas. Congresswoman Tlaib has yet to delete the tweet that says  ``Israel just bombed the Baptist Hospital killing 500 Palestinians  (doctors, children, patients) just like that.''   Delete the tweet. We cannot have Members of the U.S. Congress sending  out and being an extension of the Hamas propaganda machine. It is  despicable behavior from elected representatives of the greatest Nation  on God's green Earth.   Those Members did not start their anti-Semitic comments on October 8.  This started months and even years prior. There is a cancer that is  metastasizing on the radical extreme left that has to be dealt with in  America. I have said several times over the past several days that  Psalm 122:6 is so important, that we should ``pray for the peace of  Jerusalem,'' and those who do ``will prosper.''   There is no doubt in my heart, there is no doubt in my mind that we  find ourselves living in dangerous times in this world. Conflicts in  Eastern Europe, now conflicts in the Middle East, and real threats in  the Indo-Pacific. We need American mettle. We need American leadership.  And we need it to be strong, defiant, clear, and undeniably the  strongest force for good on the planet.   It is one of the reasons why I made strong comments about the  terrible decision--the unbelievable decision--to release $6 billion for  hostages.   I said this during the Obama administration--that paying $400 million  for hostages would make more Americans less safe abroad and raise the  price on every head. Now with $6 billion being paid to Iran, with Iran  being the chief funder of Hamas--after the attacks, Hamas thanked Iran  for the help. We do not need an administration to be complicit with  such challenging evil attacks on the Jewish State.   That is one of the reasons why I seek consent to pass my legislation,  the Solidify Iran Sanctions Act. In 1996, we put in place sanctions on  Iran. We did so in the sector of their energy sector, because we  understood that causing pain--causing pain--would be an important and  necessary component of keeping Iran in its place, to slow down, if not  stop, the spread of terrorism.   I am thankful. I am thankful that in 1996 we did act, but that action  is set to sunset. It is set to expire. We must keep those sanctions in  place, without any question.   I look at the support. I look at the support for my legislation. This  legislation predates the attacks on the nation of Israel. This bill has  the support from both sides of the aisle. It is a commonsense step to  make permanent the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, and support comes from  both sides of the aisle, including the only Jewish mother in the  Senate, Senator Rosen. These are one of the many steps we must take to  restrain this regime from developing weapons that threaten the safety  and security around the world.   I believe that if we want to respond to this brutality, if we want to  respond to this evil, one of the ways that we can respond is by making  permanent the sanctions on Iran.   I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Banking, Housing, and  Urban Affairs be discharged from further consideration of S. 1390 and  the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.   I further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    Madam President, I am deeply  disappointed that common sense seems to be harder to find in  Washington, DC. It is just not common enough.   I certainly hope that we have an opportunity to see SISA--my bill-- make permanent the sanctions against Iran. It is critically important  that we show progress sidelining the largest state supporter of  terrorism in the world.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
