 Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about the  ``Abolish ICE'' movement and the reasons that is a misconceived idea by  some on the left, but first I feel compelled to respond just briefly to  some of the comments made by our friend from New York, the Democratic  leader.   First of all, the Democratic leader says we need to have hearings on  the matter of Russian interference in our elections. I would remind the  Democratic leader that we have been doing that for a long time--ever  since the intelligence community assessment was released at the end of  the Obama administration documenting Russia's meddling in the election.  That assessment was released on an unclassified basis. It is on the  website of the Director of National Intelligence if anybody wants to  read it.   Also, I would submit to him the 29-page indictment that Robert  Mueller had issued by a grand jury against 12 Russian intelligence  officers. It lays out in minute detail what the Russians were doing to  try to cause confusion and undermine public confidence in our  elections. As a matter of fact, this afternoon the Senate Select  Committee on Intelligence is hearing from some Obama administration  officials on why they didn't do more to stop it back when President  Obama was in office when they knew very clearly what was going on but  did not do--well, did virtually nothing to stop it.   So I would say to my friend from New York, the Democratic leader,  there have been a lot of hearings, and the hearings are ongoing.  Obviously, Special Counsel Mueller has issued this indictment. I only  wish that it was more than a name-and-shame exercise because there is  no chance the Russians will extradite these intelligence officers over  here for a trial. But I think it does serve a useful educational  purpose by pointing out in minute detail what the Russians have been up  to. They have upped their game in a way that is surprising to many  people, having used everything from propaganda, to social media, to  cyber theft of information like the Clinton emails and the DNC emails  during the course of the last election. It has gotten very  sophisticated. We better be about fixing it and getting ready for the  next election rather than coming to the floor and engaging in the  favorite Washington pastime, which is the blame game.   Senator Schumer said we need to issue sanctions against Russia. Well,  I have in front of me about two single-spaced pages of actions that we  have taken since the beginning of the Trump administration to support  our allies against Russian aggression and to punish Russian misconduct,  whether it is in the elections or otherwise. I would entertain--I  understand the Senator from Colorado has some additional sanctions he  thinks would be appropriate, and I think that would be something that  would sting.   Rather than just sending a press release or trying to message this or  use it for partisan political purposes, let's consider additional  sanctions that will actually discourage and hold accountable the  Russians for their election meddling and deter them, hopefully, from  doing it again.   I understand the fourth thing my friend from New York said is that we  need to stop criticizing the Comey FBI and the Department of Justice  under the Obama administration. Well, it is pretty clear from the  investigations that have occurred that something rotten was happening  at the leadership of the FBI. Just to listen to Mr. Strzok--and his  protestations that there was no bias associated with those  investigations are patently unbelievable. It is unbelievable, not  credible.   So I understand that the Democratic leader wants to focus his  attention on the President. That is his prerogative, and, indeed, he  has been the leader of the anti-Trump resistance since President Trump  was elected.   Many of us do disagree with the President's assessment of the  intelligence, as I have suggested. I firmly believe there is solid  evidence of Russian meddling in the election. I think President Putin  misrepresented the facts. I am not surprised by that given who he is  and how he operates. As the Democratic leader said, as a former KGB  colonel, he is accustomed to dissembling and distorting, manipulating  information in a way that serves his purpose.   I think we should be absolutely clear. We all support the men and  women who are the professionals who make up the intelligence community  in this country, many of whom expose themselves to great danger, and,  indeed, many have lost their lives trying to protect this country  against adversaries around the world. I think the findings of the  intelligence community assessment during the end of the Obama  administration provides a roadmap to what the Russians did, as did the  indictment of the 12 Russian GRU intelligence officials.   We better wake up. Rather than the blame game and pointing fingers,  we better get ready for the next election, the midterm election in  2018.   I think there is a lot we can do together, but as long as this  becomes a political, partisan, stop-Trump-at-all-costs effort, I don't  think we are going to make much progress.   I will conclude this part of my remarks by saying that I trust our  intelligence community. I trust their assessment that there was Russian  meddling in the election. But I also trust the investigation so far,  which has shown absolutely no collusion with the Trump campaign and  Russian intelligence activity leading up to the election. That is what  I think has the President so spun up, because he feels as though this  is an attack on him personally. I wish we could separate those two.  But, indeed, our Democratic colleagues don't want to separate them  because they realize this is the best way to keep this story going for  as long as they can through the next election and, who knows, through  the next Presidential election as well.
