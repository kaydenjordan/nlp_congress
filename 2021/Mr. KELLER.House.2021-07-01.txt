 Mr. Speaker, every 5 years, this body deliberates a  surface transportation reauthorization, which is traditionally a  bipartisan effort to deliver improvements to America's infrastructure,  like roads, bridges, highways, and transit.   Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are  stripping this bill of its bipartisan roots in favor of their my-way- or-the-highway plan that is riddled with Green New Deal priorities,  wasteful spending, and a clear prioritization of urban America over  rural America.   The Democrats' bill provides an estimated $307 billion for Green New  Deal-related mandates, ties the hands of States to address their unique  projects, fails to streamline the project delivery process, and pulls  resources away from programs upon which rural communities rely.   That is a losing deal for every American waiting for real improvement  to  [[Page H3584]]  infrastructure they use every day, and it is a losing deal for our kids  and grandkids who will be forced to foot the bill.   We must reject this harmful proposal and work together on a  bipartisan surface transportation bill that meets the mark for every  American who relies on our Nation's transportation systems.                            ____________________
