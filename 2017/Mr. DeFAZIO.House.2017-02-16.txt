 Mr. Speaker, let's talk about what this rule didn't do.   First off, ANILCA did not grant the State of Alaska any additional  authority to manage wildlife on Federal lands. This rule is totally  compliant with ANILCA. ANILCA actually prioritizes conservation of  these species we are talking about here today, apex predators, on more  than half the refuges in the State.   As required by ANILCA, the rule ensures that national wildlife  refuges--that is what we are talking about here, wildlife refuges-- conserve species and habitats in their natural diversity. That doesn't  mean you kill the predators so that people who don't have good hunting  skills are going to have an easier time getting a caribou or moose.  That is not what this is supposed to be about on the national wildlife  refuges. It actually prioritizes conservation of these species.   I just heard that something about this will severely restrict hunting  and fishing on these lands. Absolutely not true, unless you say  shooting wolves and their pups in the den or gassing them in the den is  hunting--and we are restricting that.   Bears and cubs would be killed during hibernation, hunters crawling  around killing bears during hibernation. No, hunters don't do that.   Brown and black bears would be trapped, snared using steel-jawed  traps, wire snares--again, not hunters, not sportsmen.   Luring and baiting grizzly bears? Wow. Now, that is a real  sportsmanlike hunter with a lot of skills kind of guy or woman who has  to use bait to kill a grizzly bear.                                time  1300    Aerial gunning of bears by State agency personnel, that is hunters?  No, not quite.   Sportsmen? No, don't think so.   And using aircraft to track bears and kill in the same day, those are  the things that would be prohibited. That is what is prohibited.   Subsistence hunting? Absolutely no impact.   Fishing? Fish? I guess the fishing thing would be the grizzly bears  eat the fish, and people who don't have good fishing skills want to  catch the fish. So if we kill the grizzly bears, they won't eat the  fish. So it does impact fishing, I guess, sort of, maybe. No, it  doesn't.   This is absolutely inhumane, unsportsmanlike, and unnecessary. The  State of Alaska is doing this just to decrease the natural balance of  predation, which actually creates healthier herds of caribou and  healthier moose populations.   There was a study done in 2015 by professors from both Alaska and  Washington that showed that actually having these predators present  increases the health and the diversity of the herds of caribou, because  the sick and the lame and the old get killed, but the rest of them  flourish and breed. There would be more than enough still to hunt.   Yeah, maybe you won't be able to drive your pickup truck, stick your  rifle out of the away, blast away, and get one. You might actually have  to get out of the pickup truck. You might actually have to have some  hunting skills and track a little bit to get the caribou or the moose.   But if we kill off all of the grizzlies and the wolves, it will be a  lot easier. They will overpopulate. Actually, what they will do is they  will start going down at the riparian areas, like happened--it is a  different ecosystem--in Yellowstone, and then the streams will not be  as plentiful with fish.   This is about natural balance, it is about Federal lands, it is about  sportsmen and women, and it is about prohibiting the State of Alaska  from using its extreme predator control methods. That is what this is  called: extreme predator control methods. That is all it prevents.   This is a very sad day in this House if this resolution passes, and  it is long-term bad for Alaska.
