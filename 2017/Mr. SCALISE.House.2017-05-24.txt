 Mr. Chairman, I want to first thank my colleague from  Ohio for his leadership on bringing forth this important legislation to  actually help us focus more resources on killing mosquitoes, especially  as the mosquito season starts, as we see so many threats with Zika,  with West Nile, just the damage that we see happening around our  country from mosquitoes. We have decided we are going to put resources  into killing mosquitoes, and then we come about and find out about  these regulations that were imposed by the courts in a way that  actually makes it harder for us to kill mosquitoes.                                time  1530    What you hear so often from people around the country is: Why is it  that you have got things happening out of Washington that make no  sense?   Congressman Gibbs identified one of those areas and said it really  doesn't make sense. We tried to work through a different remedy to try  to get the administration to fix it, and they pointed to a court case  that keeps them from fixing it.   It is one of the big frustrations you have that it actually takes an  act of Congress to bring common sense into the process of killing  mosquitoes, for goodness sake. But here we are doing it. At least we  are spending the people's business doing something that actually  injects common sense back into the things that people do in their daily  lives.   All across our community and across this country, you have local  governments that are really the ones that focus on killing mosquitoes,  and we started hearing about this problem. Of course, Mr. Chairman, we  asked the EPA to identify just how much this is actually costing.   So as everybody scrambles and fights and you hear agencies saying ``I  need more money to do this,'' ``I need more money to do that,'' we need  to be more responsible with the taxpayers' money, and people are  saying, ``Live within your means.''   And we have asked the EPA. The EPA, Mr. Chairman, told us that the  cost of implementing these EPA regulations is an extra $50 million a  year. Think of how ludicrous that is. Because of the way the EPA is  implementing the law, as we are trying to kill more mosquitoes, it is  costing $50 million a year to comply with burdensome, duplicative  regulations--rather than killing mosquitoes. We should be spending that  money, $50 million, killing more mosquitoes, not killing trees to  comply with ridiculous regulations.   So I want to commend my colleague from Ohio for bringing this back.  The House passed this in a very bipartisan way last Congress. We didn't  get it all the way to the President's desk. So this year, hopefully, we  will get this bill not only passed through the House, but through the  Senate and to President Trump's desk, where he will sign a bill that  injects common sense back into the process of killing mosquitoes.   Let's spend our money killing mosquitoes, not killing trees and  having to comply with ridiculous regulations that come out of  Washington and make no sense. Let's pass this bill.
