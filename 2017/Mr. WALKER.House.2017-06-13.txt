 Mr. Speaker, many times as our Members in the House  travel throughout our districts, we are often asked: What is being done  in the House? What is being accomplished?   Well, this afternoon we are going to take a few minutes and allow you  to hear directly from the Members, something that we like to call the  People's Night. This is the people's House, so from time to time we  like to bypass any of the outlets and talk directly to the American  people.   Now, a lot of people might not know specifically what has been going  on in the House. Well, I think these visuals may aid in specifically  talking about some of the things that we are accomplishing.   For example, if you will see the chart, this chart lists the House- passed bills to date. It also includes the last four Presidents. As you  can see, the House of the 115th Congress has passed 158 pieces of  legislation; 158 bills we have sent to the Senate or to the President.   The House isn't the only one that has been busy. Our President has  been busy. In fact, if you will notice this chart behind, you will  notice that we are also at a record pace if you look at the last four,  five Presidents. Of these bills, the President has signed 37 bills into  law, compared with the next most, which was George Herbert Walker Bush  many years ago, with 35.   That is what the House is working on; it is what we are working with  the Senate, we are working with the President.   But this afternoon I want you to hear directly from some of the  Members themselves who have been very instrumental not only in what we  have accomplished, but also some of the things that we are looking  forward to accomplishing over the next few months.   The first person I would like to introduce to you is our chairman of  the Financial Services Committee, Jeb Hensarling. Representative  Hensarling is from Texas' Fifth District and has been instrumental in  doing something that we have been promising and trying to accomplish  for many years.   Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield to Chairman Jeb Hensarling, my good  friend.    Thank you, Chairman Hensarling. Most people would not  describe your role as a small part in making sure that people have more  opportunities in our financial industry.   Not that we are showing Texas any partiality this evening, but our  second Representative is a former Federal prosecutor from the great  State of Texas, and many would consider one of the top conservatives in  all of the United States Congress, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Ratcliffe), my friend, is here to talk about the CFPB, among some other  issues. So without further ado, I yield to Mr. Ratcliffe.    I thank Representative Ratcliffe for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, once again, if people are watching at home or are  gathering here today, I want to remind them that, many times--Members  of Congress, when you go back home, you hear a lot of times: Do your  job; get things done.   And as I reflect your attention again to our chart here this evening,  we can talk a little bit about what we have passed in the House: 158,  the most in several different administrations.   However, even though we are going to talk tonight a little about what  we have done and what we look forward to, we are not stopping with 158,  we are not stopping with the 37 that have been signed into law. We are  looking forward to doing some new things.   I think one of the best people to talk about something that we are  excited about is certainly somebody that I call a friend, a fellow  member, a colleague from North Carolina, someone who allows me to tag  along into NASCAR country from time to time, a real friend of the  people, someone who I have learned that will tell you the truth no  matter what you ask. It is my privilege to yield to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Hudson).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Hudson for his  passion about that.   Speaking of passion, in the 2\1/2\ years that I have served in the  United States Congress, there are Members who work on different  projects, different concerns, different issues. I will tell you  [[Page H4904]]  someone who I have really grown to love and appreciate, someone who has  lived it out on the battlefield as he has worked to literally put  veterans back together as a surgeon on the battlefield, someone who  understands and has worked well into the life arena, and that is Dr.  Brad Wenstrup, a fellow steering committee member on the Republican  Steering Committee.   Without further ado, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio, Dr.  Wenstrup, to please share what is on his heart today.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Wenstrup. I  appreciate his passionate plea.   Speaking of life, one of the most outstanding voices that I have  gotten a chance to meet, someone who, without compromise, unashamedly  talks about the value and the worth of an unborn child is  Representative Trent Franks from Arizona. He is here today to talk  about a future bill, hopefully one that we can add to this total of 37  in the not too distant future.   Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Franks), someone who is a warrior in Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Franks as he  continues to stand year after year in fighting and standing up for the  unborn child.   Many times you get to meet some wonderful people here in the United  States Congress. And someone asked me the other day: Who is a strong  Member? Who is someone who is willing to stand up?   I guess they might have thought I would have said the Speaker or the  majority leader, as well they do in their own right. When I think of  somebody willing to engage, it is the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs.  Black). She is not just known in the Sixth District; she is known  throughout all of Tennessee as far as being willing to stand up for  those who cannot stand up and protect themselves.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Black.   When we talk about what is getting done, I want to remind our  audience this evening, Mr. Speaker, that our President, even without a  full Cabinet, has been busy taking time to make sure that what the  House and the Senate are sending him is being signed into law.   As you can see on my chart this evening, 37, that is the most. You  have to go back. In fact, the last four Presidents haven't equalled  that total. And 158 bills from the House have been passed.   One of the things that has been promised by this administration and  by Members of Congress is to make sure that we are doing everything we  can to take care of a very important segment of our population, and  that is our veterans.   It wasn't long after I arrived 2\1/2\ years ago that I had a chance  to meet someone. Now, as a former pastor, you can always tell the  character and integrity of someone when they have gone through a  hardship.   I met Dr. Phil Roe after he had lost a loved one in his life. He  could have gone home, but he had a mission to complete, and that is to  stand up for those veterans who needed standing up. A former physician  himself, he was willing to come back and continue to fight. What a  privilege it is to serve with the chairman of the House Veterans'  Affairs Committee, Dr. Phil Roe.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe and appreciate his  continued service. It is a privilege to certainly work with him in the  House.   One of our newest Members who came in the 115th class, a gentleman by  [[Page H4906]]  the name of Jim Banks--in fact, he is the only new Member serving on  the Republican Steering Committee. Some would describe him as a quick  study, I guess, but he is here this evening to specifically talk about  continued VA accountability and the Department of Defense readiness.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Banks, and I  appreciate this is such an important issue that he is battling.   Once again, this evening, Mr. Speaker, we are reminding that tonight  is the People's Night here in the people's House. We are focusing in on  the work of the Members of Congress.   As you can see in our chart this evening, 158 bills have been passed  through Congress. So many times we continue to hear: What is Congress  working on?   Well, not only have we passed these 158, we are still working on  passing things in the future.   One of the great Members from South Carolina, Mr. Jeff Duncan, is  someone who has a genuine heart and passion for others, but also has a  wonderful heart for the outdoors, as he is currently chairman of the  Sportsmen's Caucus.   Without further ado, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Duncan.   Many times in Congress you hear sometimes maybe big words or crazy  words, words like ``appropriations'' or ``appropriators.'' We have one  of those appropriators with us tonight, a strong conservative from the  State of Georgia, my friend, Representative Tom Graves, who is going to  talk a little bit about his proposal and an idea that I believe helps  us continue adding to this number of 158.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Graves.   It doesn't take you long, around the Halls of Congress, to see  someone who has a genuine heart for service, someone who can quickly  give up his chair, or someone who sees someone that is without.  Sometimes I think that is a person who has served in faith many years,  and sometimes I just think that is part of the natural tendency of a  person who certainly has a heart, not only for God but to serve others.    I can think of nobody who better fits that description than our  chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, here to talk a little bit  about his passion and his vision for tax reform.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for his comments. It  is an honor to have him with us this evening.   We have talked a little bit about veterans tonight. Former veteran,  chaplain, and pastor, Representative Collins, we would love for you to  talk about something that is part of that 158 pieces of legislation  that has been passed, what we called the REINS Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Collins for his  comments.   As we continue to talk about some of the things that have been  accomplished and also things that we are looking forward to, it is a  wonderful opportunity to introduce my friend, Representative Jody Hice  from the great State of Georgia, a fellow former pastor who still  enjoys those opportunities, I am sure, when you have a few. But tonight  I want him to talk about the Free Speech Fairness Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B.  Hice).    I thank Representative Hice and I appreciate his courage  in being willing to stand and speak out.   My great friend, Representative Gary Palmer, from the home of the  University, Crimson Tide Alabama football, great to have you here  tonight talking about a very important issue, the Agency Accountability  Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer), who  will close us out this evening.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Palmer and all the Members for  coming out this evening and listening to our presentation on the  passage of 158 bills.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
