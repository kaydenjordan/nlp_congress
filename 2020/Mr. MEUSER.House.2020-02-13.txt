 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Dallas  High School Mountaineers football team for their outstanding  championship season.   Dallas football went undefeated during their regular season, going  15-0 with playoff wins and a district championship.  [[Page H1144]]    For the first time since 1993, the Dallas Mountaineers made it all  the way to a Pennsylvania State championship.   Back in 2016, Dallas football went 2-9, with 12 freshmen on the team.  Three years later, these players led their team to a championship  season.   Under the leadership of the one and only coach Richie Mannello and  his great assistant coaches, Dallas was strong on all sides of the  ball, with a great gang-tackling defense, a super-solid offensive line,  an electrifying passing game, and a backfield I will never forget.   The Dallas Mountaineer parents, student body, band, and cheerleaders  were a huge part of the Friday night victories, and they made the games  an awful lot of fun. The entire community, restaurants, fire  department, all the residents of the Back Mountain were all part of  this great season.   We are going to miss these boys wearing Dallas blue under the Friday  night lights, but we know the Dallas tradition, long established, will  live on.                            ____________________
