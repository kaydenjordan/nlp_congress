 Mr. President, on this Veterans Day, I want to express my  profound admiration for the unwavering service and sacrifices of our  veterans. Their commitment to our Nation, its people, and the values we  hold dear transcends generations. Democracy requires constant  vigilance, and it is facing tough challenges at home and abroad.  Despots and authoritarians worldwide would like nothing more than to  see us retreat from defending freedom. But in the face of adversity,  the United States stands resilient thanks to the courageous men and  women who have worn the uniform.   From the American Revolution, where the Maryland Line fought bravely  under General George Washington, to the defense of Fort McHenry in  Baltimore that inspired the Star-Spangled Banner during the War of  1812, to today, where Maryland is home to almost 400,000 veterans, our  State has a proud history of fighting for freedom.   Our veterans are among the best our country has produced. Each one  answered the call to serve their country, leaving friends and family to  go in harm's way. In today's divisive world, I especially want to thank  our veterans for coming together from all walks of life to serve a  purpose greater than themselves. Our veterans come from all over the  country, from all backgrounds, races, and religions. Time and time  again, veterans put their country before themselves and make sacrifices  that most Americans do not even realize. They miss birthdays,  anniversaries, births, funerals, and countless other life events so  they can stand guard on the frontlines of our Nation's defense. Most  servicemembers volunteer to join the military not long after graduating  high school or college. Some serve a few years, and others make the  military a career. All of them have earned the title of veteran.   In Maryland, prominent military installations stretch across the  State from Aberdeen Proving Ground in the north to Patuxent River in  the south. Marylanders have always answered the call when our liberties  have been attacked. During World War II, Maryland produced over 5,000  B-26 Marauder aircrafts that bombed Nazi fortifications in advance of  Allied landings on D-Day. Baltimore's shipyards built 384 Liberty cargo  ships during the war to transport troops and supplies to Europe.  Marylanders have stood shoulder to shoulder, unphased in the face of  monumental challenges.   Marylanders from across the State continue to volunteer to serve our  country, both overseas and at home with our Active-Duty military  components, Reserves, and National Guard units. Our veterans'  dedication to country and democracy is felt around the world.  Unfortunately, many of our veterans know all too well the cost of war.  Our brave men and women continue to serve their communities even after  their time in uniform is over.   Our veterans are humble patriots, and while I know they appreciate  the public thanking them for their service, I want to encourage each  Marylander to go a step further this Veterans Day: shop at a veteran- owned business, donate to a veteran's charity, hire a veteran for your  company, or call a veteran and ask them to share stories about their  time in the service. Our veterans are among the most highly trained,  educated, and responsible citizens, and their skills make them  incredibly valued members of their communities and their companies. On  this Veterans Day--and every day of the year--put your thoughts into  action and show our veterans how much we truly appreciate their  service.                            ____________________
