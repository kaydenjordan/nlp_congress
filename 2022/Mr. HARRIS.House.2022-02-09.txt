 Mr. Speaker, we surpassed 100,000 overdose deaths this  year, a 28 percent increase. The amount of fentanyl seized at our  southern border--seized--is over 100 million pills and 11,000 pounds.  Now, as a physician who has administered fentanyl, this is enough to  kill hundreds of millions of Americans. The price of heroin is now down  to $20 a dose; the price of fentanyl down to $2.   One stunning supply chain success this administration has under its  belt is the fentanyl supply chain across our southern border. One place  this administration has successfully fought inflation is in lowering  the price of illegal opioids on our streets.   The latest effort by this administration to promote drug use is now  to spend $30 million to supply clean crack-smoking pipes to addicts.   Mr. Speaker, just say no.                            ____________________
