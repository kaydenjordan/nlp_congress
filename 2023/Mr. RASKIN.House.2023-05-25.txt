 Madam Speaker, the 14th Amendment to the U.S.  Constitution says that the validity of the public debt shall not be  questioned.   We made a commitment to every Social Security recipient in America,  to Medicare and Medicaid recipients, to the veterans, to the  bondholders of the United States, that we would pay our debts, as we  are fiscally, morally, politically, and constitutionally required to  do.   Yet, Donald Trump has issued the order. He said it is inevitable,  default on the debt of the United States for the first time in American  history, crash the economy, lose 9 or 10 million jobs.   Now, in the words of Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, who appears  not to be here right now: The GOP will not negotiate with their  hostage.   Who is the hostage?   The American people are the hostage. Our government is hostage. The  Constitution is hostage.   I introduce to the MAGA Republicans who have split today, but who  increased the debt ceiling three times under Donald Trump, who gave us  a quarter of all the debt of the United States between George  Washington and Joe Biden, I introduce them to the Constitution of the  United States: The validity of the public debt shall not be questioned.                            ____________________
