 Mr. Chair, I rise today on behalf of Mr. Cloud of Texas  to offer amendment No. 5 to H.R. 277, the REINS Act.    Mr. Chair, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the REINS  Act, which is an important effort to ensure Congress reclaims its  rightful authority and responsibility to legislate.   This amendment is technical in nature, but it is important,  nonetheless. In April of this year, the Biden administration issued an  executive order on modernizing the regulatory review.   The purpose of this executive order is to allow the administration to  implement their agenda more quickly and efficiently.   The executive order also raises the threshold for centralized review  by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, or OIRA, from $150  million to $200 million.   The order also gives the administrator of OIRA a discretionary role  in determining which regulations are considered for full OIRA review.   OIRA serves as a responsible check on major regulations, reviewing  the cost and benefits of each regulation, and ensuring that all public  comments have been reviewed and considered before the regulation goes  into effect.                                time  1245    OIRA, in other words, is a check on due diligence. This order will  mean that fewer rules are reviewed by OIRA and, thus, less due  diligence will be conducted over the administrative state.   So long as this executive order stands, a loophole will exist in the  REINS Act. Fewer rules would be classified as major, and consequently  would not be subject to congressional approval under the REINS Act.   My amendment would close this loophole by clarifying that OIRA must  issue a finding of the full cost-benefit analysis of each rule and  issue a determination as major or minor according to that finding.   Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I think that my colleague on the other side  of the aisle just confirmed why this amendment is necessary and why the  REINS Act is so important.   What I believe I heard him say is that because it is difficult for  the administration to determine what the cost of these regulations are,  they shouldn't have to make any determination at all and there should  be no oversight whatsoever, either from OIRA or OMB, because it is just  too doggone difficult to figure out how much these regulations are  going to cost.   Frankly, I find that argument absolutely and complete absurd. We are  talking about tax money. We are talking about a cost and expense that  is being imposed against our small businesses, our mom-and-pop  businesses, against our industry groups.   What the gentleman from the other side is saying is that nobody,  including this administration, should ever have to disclose what the  cost of those regulations are. That is exactly the reason as to why we  need a robust review by OIRA as provided for in this amendment.   Mr. Chair, in closing, I do think it is clear that it is important to  make this technical change for the REINS Act. It is important that we  have an understanding as to what the cost of these regulations will be.   The very purpose of the REINS Act is to ensure that Congress is part  of the legislative process for any regulation that would have an  economic impact of over $100 million.   Without a robust review by OIRA, it is not possible to determine  which of these regulations, in fact, would fit within that category. It  is for that reason that I request the adoption of this amendment. It is  a good one for the REINS Act, and it ensures that we close an important  loophole to make sure that it is the Congress that is legislating and  not the executive branch and unelected bureaucrats.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is simply an attempt to delay  implementation of a bill that the Democrats do not support. If the  Democrats don't like the bill, they can vote against it.   Even if implementation was delayed a year, it is unclear what, if  any, value a study could provide. However, during that year, agencies  would continue issuing more and more major rules at the expense of the  American public.   It is time for Congress to reclaim its constitutional role as the  body that makes policy in this country.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I just have a couple of points.   One is that the REINS Act has enjoyed longstanding, bipartisan  support. In fact, the House passed prior versions of the REINS Act with  bipartisan support in each one of the 115th, 114th, 113th, and 112th  Congresses. In other words, this is an act that has been studied and  discussed extensively over the years, and there is no reason for a 1- year delay in its implementation once the bill passes.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment undermines the purpose of  the REINS Act. The REINS Act rejects a standard of legislative  disapproval concerning major rules. Instead, the REINS Act creates a  standard of legislative approval for major rules.   The fact is that in listening to my colleagues on the other side, it  is very clear that they simply do not want to legislate. They want to  turn over that authority to the executive branch in violation of  Article I, Section 1 of the United States Constitution.   We don't believe in doing that. The fact is that the administrative  state has enacted unpopular and unwise regulations that could never  pass Congress, and that is why President Biden and his predecessors  have sought to legislate through regulation versus our constitutional  process.   If Congress does not approve a major rule, it should not go into  effect. This amendment would leave the status quo in place.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am prepared to close.   Again, this is just one more effort to try to undermine the very  purpose of the REINS Act and make it so that it would not work as it is  intended to work.   It is this body's responsibility to legislate, not the executive  branch, not unelected bureaucrats, and not administrative agencies. We  are the ones who represent the people of this country and are  accountable to them through the decisions that we make.   Madam Chair, I urge the opposition to this amendment as it would  undermine the very purpose of the REINS Act and is unnecessary, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I think this amendment perhaps defines the  incredible contrast between this side of the aisle and the folks on the  other side of the aisle.   I believe that $100 million is an astronomical amount of money, and  they don't see that it is all that much. I don't believe that unelected  bureaucrats in agencies ought to be making decisions that have impacts  on our businesses of over $100 million without any legislative  oversight, and they think that $1 billion is pretty low. I think that  that really epitomizes the difference in our philosophy, how we view  government, and how we view our responsibilities.   Under no circumstance should unelected bureaucrats in agencies be  imposing hidden taxes against the people of this country without the  accountability of the legislative branch being involved in the  decision. I believe $100 million is too high and $1 billion is  absolutely absurd.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am ready to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Again, Madam Chair, I am going to say I think that this  is clearly an effort to abdicate our responsibilities to legislate.   As far as protecting our air and water, I point out that the EPA is  responsible for one of the worst environmental disasters in the history  of the United States of America when it blew out the Gold King Mine and  turned the Animus River yellow several years ago in southwestern  Colorado.   So while they want to turn over the responsibility of governing in  this country to unelected bureaucrats in agencies that cause those  kinds of disasters, I am unwilling to do so. I believe that this body  ought to be accountable to the people and in making the decisions that  have an economic impact of $100 million on their lives.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
