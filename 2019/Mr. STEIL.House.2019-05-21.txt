 Madam Speaker, today we celebrate an important moment in  our Nation's history: 100 years ago, today, Clifford Randall, the  Representative from the First District of Wisconsin, left his office  like all of his colleagues in the House, walked to this very Chamber,  and cast his vote in favor of women's suffrage.   The 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote. Today we commemorate  that vote.   Wisconsin was a leader in the women's suffrage movement. In fact,  Wisconsin was the first State to ratify the 19th Amendment.   I am wearing a yellow rose today just as the supporters of women's  rights did a century ago.   As we commemorate the 19th Amendment, let's focus on how we can work  together to support women and ensure that future generations will never  forget that historic vote.                            ____________________
