 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a nonprofit  organization in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that is celebrating its  20th year of service helping immigrants settle in the United States.   Welcoming the Stranger, based in Langhorne, was founded in 1999 by  the late Reverend Sturgis Poorman.   Welcoming the Stranger has provided countless opportunities for  immigrants in southeastern Pennsylvania from over 100 countries.   Welcoming the Stranger offers English language classes and courses in  citizenship preparation and computer science. Their programs have been  so popular that they often expand to 300 attendees, packing houses of  worship and community centers across Bucks County.   Madam Speaker, I applaud the work of Welcoming the Stranger, and I  wish the organization all the best as it enters its 20th year of  service to our community.   I would also like to extend my appreciation to Meg Eubank, the  executive director of Welcoming the Stranger, for her work and her  vision.                                time  1030                     Honoring Friends of Five Mile Woods     Madam Speaker, I rise to honor a group of  conscientious citizens in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who were recently  recognized for their environmental stewardship.   Earlier this month, the Lower Makefield Board of Supervisors and the  Lower Makefield Environmental Advisory Council awarded Friends of Five  Mile Woods with its annual Environmental Stewardship Award. Friends of  Five Mile Woods, which has been a presence in Bucks County since the  1980s, seeks to protect the landscape of Five Mile Woods Preserve.   One of the most successful programs the organization has implemented  is its volunteer cleanup efforts on the second Saturday of the months  of March through November. During these Saturdays, dedicated volunteers  pick up trash, maintain trails, and repair infrastructure in the 285- acre preserve.   Madam Speaker, Friends of Five Mile Woods helps provide amazing  nature experiences and educational opportunities for our community in  Bucks County. I congratulate them on this award and applaud the work of  John Lloyd, chairman of the organization, and the Lower Makefield Board  of Supervisors.            Recognizing Meghan Schulz for Her Win on ``Jeopardy''     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a resident  of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who recently made us all proud from her  successful appearance on ``Jeopardy.''   Meghan Schulz, a resident of Bristol and an environmental engineer  for SEPTA, appeared on the hit television show last month. Going into  the final round, Meghan was in second place with $14,000. She was able  to clinch her victory, however, when she successfully answered that  Mariah Carey was the New York native who, in the 1990s, had eight of  her first 10 Billboard Top 40 hits reach number one.   Her closest competitor, whom she trailed by $400 going into Final  Jeopardy, incorrectly guessed Whitney Houston, putting Meghan over the  top.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Meghan on this major accomplishment. It  is a major feat to be selected to participate on this famous show to  begin with, but to win against other highly intelligent competitors is  something truly noteworthy.   I wish Meghan and her family all the best, and we congratulate her on  this achievement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Natural Resources Management Act. I am especially proud this bill will  permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund.   This vital piece of legislation will benefit millions of Americans in  innumerable ways, from promoting recreational activity to contributing  to our Nation's robust economy, along with furthering environmental  protection and wildlife conservation.   The Land and Water Conservation Fund benefits 98 percent of counties  across the United States and contributes to an economy that encompasses  1 out of 15 American jobs.   Since its establishment over 50 years ago, the Land and Water  Conservation Fund has greatly benefited my home district in Bucks and  Montgomery Counties in Pennsylvania.   Treasured public lands, such as Nockamixon State Park and Tyler State  Park, and cherished community venues, such as Hatfield Community Park,  are all just a few of the examples of the beneficiaries of this  valuable fund.   Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged by the strong bipartisan support the  Natural Resources Management Act has received, and I compliment my  colleagues from both sides of the aisle for advancing this. It is long  overdue, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.
