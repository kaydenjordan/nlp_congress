 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 326, a  resolution that reaffirms the House of Representatives' longstanding  support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   Throughout my life and my 31 years serving in this great body, I have  never lost hope that there will one day be two states for two peoples-- a democratic Jewish state of Israel and a democratic Palestinian state  living side by side in peace, security, and mutual recognition.   We cannot be naive. This will not be easy. Gaza continues to be run  by Hamas, a terrorist organization responsible for attacks on Israel  and the suffering of Palestinians in their borders. The Palestinian  Authority has been a poor partner for peace, walking away from  reasonable peace plans and the negotiating table altogether. And  rhetoric from the Israeli Government officials about unilateral  annexation pushes a future, negotiated solution farther from reality.    But we cannot and we must not lose hope. Simply put, a  two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians is the only means to  ensure Israel's long-term security and enable Palestinian aspirations  for their own state.   I thank my colleagues whose hard work brought this important  resolution to the floor, and I urge immediate passage.
