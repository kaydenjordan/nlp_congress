 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of a young  mother. Her name is Rosa. Just like my mom, she came to America in  search of a better life.   Rosa's home was in Trujillo, Honduras, where she lived with her aging  parents and her son, Juan. Violent gangs controlled the town, and Rosa  feared her young son would be targeted like so many others in her  neighborhood.   Under these desperate circumstances, Rosa did what any loving mother  would do. She took her modest life savings and her son and fled north  in search of safety. When they finally made it to the U.S. border near  Yuma, Arizona, Rosa and Juan were met by American authorities who asked  her an ominous question: Don't you know we're separating children from  their families here? She told them no, but it was too late. Rosa and  Juan are still separated.   Mr. Speaker, the administration is now reuniting a small number of  these families due, in part, to Donald Trump's orders. But let's be  clear. This isn't happening out of concern for their welfare. As usual,  Donald Trump is only doing the right thing because a court is making  him do it.   Trump still wants to set up tent camps in our military bases. He  still wants to eviscerate legal protections for migrant children, and  he still wants to lock up families. Donald Trump's goal is to present  mothers and children fleeing unspeakable violence with an impossible  choice: immediate deportation or indefinite detention. That is  appalling.   On the other hand, the Members of this body have an easy choice: make  excuses for Trump, or take a stand against the state-sponsored  mistreatment of children. It is not a tough decision. We know what we  need to do.
