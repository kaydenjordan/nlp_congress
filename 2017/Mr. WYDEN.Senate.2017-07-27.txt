 Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk here on the  Senate floor about this so-called skinny health package, and if you  believe the reports, the skinny health package was going to be written  today at the Senate Republican lunch. On the day that the Senate is  supposed to vote, the future of American healthcare may have gotten an  overhaul between the salad course and the entree.   I would like to talk a little about where things are and really  contrast these reports about the skinny health package with the process  that brought together the Affordable Care Act.   Our colleague, the Presiding Officer, now serves on the Finance  Committee. There were dozens of hearings in the Finance Committee about  the Affordable Care Act, and there were dozens of hearings in the HELP  Committee. Both committees had markups that lasted longer than a week  and incorporated ideas from both sides. I was a pretty junior member of  the Finance Committee at that time, and I remember a flock of  Republican amendments being added, in the Finance Committee, to the  Affordable Care Act. When the bill came to the floor, the Senate  debated it for 25 legislative days. It was the second-longest  consecutive debate in history.   We are not seeing anything that resembles that today. You have a rush  job. So I am going to try to spend a few minutes talking about what  comes out when you have a rush job and about some of the red flags that  I think my colleagues might want to think about, particularly some on  the other side of the aisle who are thinking about voting for this  skinny package.  [[Page S4373]]    Any Senator who believes that Medicaid makes it out of the skinny  package without taking a hit ought to take a look again. Senator Murray  and I spent a long time in working with the Congressional Budget Office  to, in effect, get them to do some analysis of some of the ideas that  are part of a CBO package. What the Congressional Budget Office said-- and it is the impartial, nonpartisan umpire--is that under this skinny  package that is not supposed to do any harm to Medicaid--and it is on  the first page of the CBO report--Medicaid gets hit with a $220 billion  reduction for over a decade under this so-called skinny proposal.   So if you are one of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  who say they really feel strongly about Medicaid and about seniors-- Medicaid, we all know, picks up the cost of two out of three nursing  home beds, and it covers a wide variety of community-based services.   I have loved to watch the development of those community-based  services. We started them in Oregon back in the days when I was the  director of the Gray Panthers.   In this so-called skinny budget, according to the Congressional  Budget Office, Medicaid would get hit with a $220 billion reduction. I  think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are saying  ``Hey, the skinny package isn't going to have any implications for  Medicaid'' would want to take a look at it because I think the  Congressional Budget Office is saying there really are implications for  vulnerable seniors, for kids with special needs, for the disabled, and  for all of those Americans who are walking on an economic tightrope  every single month in balancing their food costs against their fuel  costs and their fuel costs against their health bills.   The numbers on skinny repeal show that 16 million Americans will lose  coverage and that premiums are going to jump by 20 percent immediately  if it becomes law. Industry experts are saying there is not any way  this can work. It just causes too much bedlam and uncertainty. It is  like pouring still more gasoline onto the fires of uncertainty in the  marketplace. Republican and Democratic Governors have come out against  the skinny bill.   By the way, as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee-- I guess we have 100 percent of the Senators who are here who serve on  the Finance Committee. I do not even see Republican Senators making  much of an attempt to defend the skinny bill on its merits. In fact, in  the halls, many of them seem to be telling folks, including some folks,  I believe, in the press, that they are kind of worried about its  becoming law.   There are a few directions for this process to take. It is possible  that, if you pass it, the House could just take up the skinny repeal  and then they could pass it. My guess is that when people around here  think about what that means and what those CBO numbers mean, the  premium hikes and the implications for Medicaid, they will look at  those CBO numbers and probably get a little heartburn--my Republican  colleagues in this Chamber who are thinking about being for this.   The other possibility is that passing the skinny repeal bill leads to  a conference. I am telling you that if it heads to conference, a skinny  repeal is sort of a gateway drug to TrumpCare. The fact that a  conference is going to fix every problem and solve every disagreement  is just fantasy. If this gets to conference and if suddenly there is a  new Republican replacement plan that everybody likes--that is about as  likely to happen as my joining the NBA for the upcoming season.   Let's take an honest look at how the debate has unfolded.   Republicans have had 7 years to come up with a replacement to the  Affordable Care Act that they can all agree to. Obviously, that has not  worked out. In the Senate, the process flatlined until the majority  leader began the shell game that has culminated in today's vote. There  were not 50 votes for TrumpCare here in the Senate. There were not 50  votes for repeal. That is why a skinny repeal is the only proposal left  on the table. As I indicated, who knows what was done at the Republican  lunch today at noon between the salad course and the entree?   Yet let's be clear about what is likely to happen when the House gets  involved. The guarantees that Members of this body will get to protect  their constituents are out the window--kids with disabilities and older  people--say, a baby boomer. My colleague in the chair, who is a skilled  physician, understands this. You have a baby boomer who has had a  stroke, who is in his late fifties, early sixties, and he is in a  nursing home. He is going to really face some challenges in terms of  how to be able to afford that care with the kinds of cuts that, on page  1 of the report to Senator Murray and me, the CBO has said it believes  will take place in Medicaid.   We know these rural hospitals are the economic engine of communities.  I have made eight stops on a rural healthcare listening tour in my home  State, and what we see is, without rural healthcare, you aren't going  to have rural life. It is going to be particularly important because  other efforts could conceivably result in seniors between 55 and 64  paying five times as much as younger people and getting fewer tax  credits. Nobody can honestly say that the millions of Americans with  preexisting conditions will be shielded from discrimination, and what a  step backward that would be.   Before the Presiding Officer was here in this body, 14 Senators--7  Democrats and 7 Republicans--joined me in the 2008, 2009 period. Many  of them are still here on both sides of the aisle. Republicans were a  part of the effort and Democrats were a part of the effort. We wrote a  bipartisan bill that had air-tight, loophole-free protection for those  who have preexisting conditions. We got it in the Affordable Care Act.  All of the Senators who joined on that bill ought to feel pretty good  about taking a big step to move America away from healthcare that is  just for the healthy and wealthy. Now we are talking about the prospect  of policies that will walk that back.   It is my view that the clear choice for my colleagues who don't like  the risks in skinny repeal and don't like TrumpCare is to reject the  process. It seems to me the surest way to prevent a bill you don't like  from becoming law is to vote against it. Quaint idea: Just vote against  it.   I want to turn, as well, to another bit of breaking news, which comes  from our Parliamentarians who do so much good work, and they have an  extraordinarily stressful job. Another key part of the Republican plan  has been deemed ineligible in the last few hours to move forward via  the partisan approach--reconciliation. The decision pertains to a  proposal that lets States undo the consumer protections built into  insurance marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act. That proposal  will not get fast-track privileges or a 50-vote threshold under  reconciliation here on the Senate floor.   Here is what that section of the bill was all about. I wrote a  provision--and, again, our group of 14 bipartisan Senators, seven  Democrats and seven Republicans, can take credit for this as well-- about an issue that the Presiding Officer and I have talked about a  number of times: letting the States be the laboratories of democracy,  taking the lead on creative health solutions.   So out of our bipartisan bill--14 Senators--we said that we are going  to give the States the chance to do better. The States would have the  chance to do better. When we did it, we got some flak from all over the  political spectrum. But we pushed very hard, and we got it in to the  final legislation. It was about providing flexibility to States because  so many on both sides of the aisle--my guess is our friend from  Pennsylvania, and anyone who is on the Finance Committee, has heard  again and again that State officials, business leaders, and others have  said: If you just give us the freedom, we can do better. They don't  say: Give us the freedom to let us do worse. They say: Give us the  freedom to let us do better.   That is what section 1332 was all about. It said that States could  chart their own course on healthcare as long as they were going to do  better--better for coverage, better for affordability. They made it  clear that if you feel you can do better--if the Louisiana Legislature  says: We have ideas for what works for Louisiana, which may not  necessarily work for Oregon; give us the freedom to go do our thing-- that is in the Affordable Care Act, the freedom to do better.  [[Page S4374]]    I would be the last person to tell my friend from Louisiana, a  skilled physician who has a great interest in health policy--I would be  the last person to say: Hey, I am going to dictate to Louisiana what an  approach involving a waiver should be all about. It is quite the  opposite. I am prepared to say to Louisiana, to Pennsylvania, to all of  our colleagues, if you have ideas that are going to do better by  people--better coverage, more affordable--God bless you and your  constituents. That is what 1332 is all about.   We said that all we are going to say is we have to have some basic  consumer protection here. You can't just get a waiver and go off and do  nothing or just spend the money on some pork kind of project; you have  to do better by people--better coverage, more affordable coverage,  having basic consumer protections. The Senate TrumpCare bill tried to  basically throw those consumer protections out the window. States would  be able to get waivers to opt out of basic consumer protections--basic,  plain, vanilla consumer protection for coverage and affordability. My  view was that kind of stuff is a backdoor way to set up junk  insurance--junk insurance that wouldn't cover much more than gauze  bandages and aromatherapy.   Some people may wonder why this is important today, since the Senate  resoundingly voted down the Better Care Reconciliation Act earlier this  week.   The answer is that my colleagues on the other side still seem to be  trying to shoehorn this scheme for worse coverage--not better  coverage--under a waiver into the skinny repeal proposal the Senate is  going to vote on in a matter of hours. But the decision has come down.  The decision has come down from the Parliamentarian that regulatory  changes that gut consumer protection, that was right at the heart of  that waiver in the Affordable Care Act, isn't going to fly. And,  frankly, I think it calls into question what the Parliamentarian said-- it calls into question whether any of these big anti-consumer schemes  are going to get 50 votes.   So this is yet more uncertainty ahead if Senate Republicans pass this  skinny repeal bill and the debate drags on.   Now, at the risk of boring our wonderful pages and the staff who have  heard me on the floor saying this before, there is a bipartisan  approach. I think I have shown my bona fides over the years with  respect to bipartisanship. I mentioned our universal coverage bill--the  first time Republicans, Democrats came together and said that this is  something where there is common ground because it is common sense. I  have worked with colleagues who are perhaps some of the most  conservative Members of the Congress on initiatives to move healthcare  forward. That is what I have wanted to dedicate my entire professional  service to--bipartisanship in health. Ever since those days with the  Oregon Gray Panthers, that is what I always thought was the most  important thing because if Senator Toomey, the Presiding Officer, all  of our colleagues--all the people here--if you don't have your health,  then pretty much everything else is uphill. So healthcare has always  been the most important issue--an important issue we have to deal with  in a bipartisan way.   I have said--which is why I wanted to alert the pages and the  professional staff about the prospect of true boredom and just nodding  off through the afternoon--that there is an alternative. If Republicans  drop the reconciliation, the our-way-or-the-highway approach,  colleagues on this side have said that they want to work on a  bipartisan basis. It doesn't take rocket science to figure out what  that needs to be.   The first thing that Democrats and Republicans would do is stabilize  the private insurance market--the first thing. Everyone over here has  said that the Affordable Care Act is far from perfect. We have  colleagues here, including Senator Kaine with his reinsurance proposal,  Senator Shaheen with her cost-sharing effort, Senator McCaskill to try  to help areas where there is little or no coverage, and I am certain  there are Republicans who have ideas that would be part of a good  bipartisan package if we drop this our-way-or-the-highway partisan  approach.   We ought to be working together to bring down prescription drugs  prices. I have spoken on a number of occasions with the Presiding  Officer about the fact that literally out of nowhere over the last few  years we saw a whole industry develop around prescription drugs, where  a bunch of middlemen are supposed to be getting the consumer a good  deal on medicine, but nobody knows what they put in their pocket and  what they put in the consumers' pocket. They are called pharmaceutical  benefit managers. So I said: How about a little sunlight on that? How  about a little sunshine, the best disinfectant?   I sure think people ought to be able to work together on those kinds  of things. That, colleagues, is not what is on offer right now.   I urge my colleagues to say: We are getting out of this shell game.  Nobody has to accept the skinny repeal option or the dictates of the  other body. If you are unhappy with the option on the table--and I hope  more people will be unhappy now that I have outlined what some of the  key considerations are in this Budget Office report Senator Murray and  I worked hard to get--I hope some people are going to think again,  especially on the other side of the aisle, about voting it down. Twenty  percent premium hikes--those go into effect on January 1 of 2018. And I  expect we will have more information on it, but I think there are going  to be 20-percent hikes after that. That is real. That is not what some  interest group made up or some liberal partisan or anybody else who has  an ax to grind. That is what our impartial umpire found.   So if you are unhappy with a proposal with those kinds of options,  you ought to vote it down.   I want to close by way of echoing a point that so many colleagues on  this side have said. This is not about saying: Look, we are just  against what you want to do. Quite the opposite. For all my time in  public service, I have said what I want to do is try to find common  ground with people with common sense.   Let us defeat this skinny, sham, shell game kind of process that  looks like what we are going to be voting on tonight and then get  serious about doing what legislators do, which is not take each other's  crummy ideas, but take good ideas and work on them in a bipartisan way.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?    Mr. President, I will be very brief.   To respond to my friend from Pennsylvania, No. 1, none of what he has  discussed has come up in the Senate Finance Committee. What I can tell  you about past debates is that our side was always interested in  reform-minded ideas, for example, bringing the private sector into the  delivery system of Medicaid. That is No. 1. No. 2, we still have not  seen the skinny bill.   I said earlier: Who knows what happened at the Republican Senate  lunch between one course and another. We would like to see the skinny  bill. I think, once again, we have heard from the other side that they  disagree with the umpire. They disagree with the impartial CBO, and I  think that is unfortunate.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question?    Mr. President, just very quickly, the Senator pointed out  this analysis we have gotten where the premiums go into the  stratosphere. Senator Murray and I worked a long time on it.   Wages for working people are going up about as fast as a snail trying  to climb uphill. I am curious what you think that means for working- class families in Virginia, because I know in my home State--and  Senator Merkley and I have talked about this--we have working families  right now who every single month are walking on an economic tightrope,  balancing their food bill against the fuel bill, the fuel bill against  the rent bill.   Because my colleague was correct with respect to the fact that this  would start, by the way, in January--this is not some kind of far- removed thing--people are going to feel the hit of these skyrocketing  premiums right away. What does my colleague think that is going to mean  for working-class families in his home State?    Thank you, Mr. President.   I thank my leader, Senator Schumer.   Colleagues, before morning, millions of Americans could be on their  way to lives filled with healthcare misery, eye-popping cost increases,  hollowed-out coverage, and gutted consumer protections.   Colleagues, there are already stories of Americans hoarding pills and  clamoring for screenings because they fear what the future is going to  bring. These are the Americans who took deep breaths of relief 7 years  ago when the Affordable Care Act became law. Women were no longer  penalized for their gender. Cancer survivors no longer had to worry  about busting a limit on coverage and facing personal bankruptcy.  Entrepreneurs with a big idea had the freedom to set out on their own,  no longer tied to their employer insurance because they had a  preexisting condition. Now all of them are looking at lives on hold.   The skinny repeal package makes a mockery out of the President's  promise to lower premiums. He made that promise repeatedly to the  American people: no reductions in coverage, no increases in premiums.  This bill makes a mockery out of that Presidential  [[Page S4414]]  pledge. Don't take my word for it. The Congressional Budget Office--the  independent umpires--have told us the premiums are going to jump 20  percent next year as a result of this bill. That goes into effect,  colleagues, January 1 of this year. Some happy New Year: Your premiums  have jumped through the roof.   Colleagues, vote for this and try to explain it to the people you  represent and have them tell you that there is not going to be anything  they can sacrifice to pay for that rate hike. Their wages are flat,  they are on an economic tightrope, and they are going to have to have  premium hikes with a 20-percent hit.   The Finance Committee is accountable for funds that are critical for  women's health. This measure begins the effort to take away the right  of women to go to the provider they choose. That, too, will be hard to  explain to millions of Americans who simply want what we have: the  right to make your own healthcare choices.   Colleagues, the damage may get worse. Skinny repeal could be the  gateway drug to TrumpCare. We still don't know what is going to happen  with Medicaid so seniors are worried, kids with special needs, disabled  folks. If the Senate and the House head to a conference--that is a big  ``if''--this body is going to face a radical set of demands from a very  stubborn extreme on the other side of the Capitol.   My time has expired. I appreciate Leader Schumer getting me this  time. The promises Senators have gotten to protect their constituents,  those promises could well be in the trash can within 48 hours.   I urge my colleagues to think about what it is going to be like to go  home and explain to their constituents how this misery--how this  healthcare misery came to be a part of their lives every single day. I  don't think they are going to be able to make the case.   I urge my colleagues to support Senator Murray on this motion to  recommit.   I yield back.    Mr. President, I want to recognize Les and Eva Aigner, two  brave Oregonians who lived through the horrors of the Holocaust. I want  to honor Les and Eva in the Senate today and share how they survived  Nazi atrocities and went on to live in Portland, OR, where they have  taught countless young men and women about the dangers of intolerance  and hate.   Eva Aigner, nee Speigel, was born in 1937 in Kosice, Czechoslovakia,  where she lived with her sister, mother, and father. Two years after  her birth, Eva's father lost his business license due to growing anti- Semitism, prompting the family to move to Budapest. There they hoped  they would be safe from Nazi extremism, but even in Hungary, as a Jew,  Eva's father struggled to find work.   As time went on, new laws forced Eva and her family to wear the  yellow star, and Eva and her sister were soon unable to attend school  due to growing intolerance. Soon after, Eva's father was taken to a  forced labor camp where he was killed. Eva and her remaining family  members were then taken to the Budapest ghetto where the Nazis selected  Eva's mother for deportation to a concentration camp.   The remaining children, including Eva and her sister, as well as the  sick and the old who were unable to work for the Nazi war machine, were  taken to the Danube in the middle of the night to be shot. Eva and her  sister only managed to survive because their mother escaped from the  deportation train and bribed a guard to spare their lives. From there,  they were taken back into the Budapest ghetto where they hid, without  food or running water, until the Russian soldiers liberated the ghetto  on January 18, 1945. The rest of Eva's extended family, who remained in  Czechoslovakia, with the exception of one cousin, did not survive the  Holocaust.   Like Eva, Leslie ``Les'' Aigner was born in Czechoslovakia. In his  case, the small town of Nove Zamky, on June 3, 1929. He had two  sisters--one older, one younger. The Aigners moved to Hungary in the  early 1940s to escape the growing Nazi threat, settling in Csepel, on  the outskirts of Budapest. Since Jewish children were not allowed  access to higher education, Les went to a trade school to become a  machinist. Eventually, it became unsafe for Les to even walk to school,  and his devoutly religious family stopped attending synagogue for fear  of attack. Les's father was soon taken to a labor camp, and his 16- year-old sister was taken to a paper mill to do forced labor. Les, his  mother and his 8-year-old sister were then forced into the Budapest  ghetto before being taken to Auschwitz. Upon arrival, the Nazis  selected Les's mother and sister for the gas chambers and took Les to  the camp.   Les spent 4 months in Auschwitz. He worked in the kitchen and  survived by stealing food. During his imprisonment in the concentration  camp, Les was injured after a guard threw a pitchfork through his foot.  While Les was in the hospital with an infection from this injury, a Dr.  Epstein warned Les that the Nazis planned to execute prisoners who were  no longer able to walk. At Dr. Epstein's urging, Les limped out of the  hospital in the middle of the night to avoid being taken to the gas  chamber. Dr. Epstein, a prisoner himself, saved Les's life that night.   Les then exchanged his clothing with another prisoner who wanted to  stay with his father in Auschwitz and was transferred to Landsberg, a  sub-camp of Dachau. He performed hard labor for several months and was  then transferred again to Kauffering Camp, where he contracted typhus  before being sent to Dachau on the so-called Death Train.   By the time he arrived, Les weighed only 75 pounds. He was finally  freed by American soldiers on April 29, 1945. It took over a month of  treatment before Les was able to walk on his own. When Les finally  regained his health, he made his way back to Budapest, where he  reunited with his father and older sister. Most of their other family  members had been killed.   After the war, both Eva and Les began to rebuild their lives in  Budapest. They finished school and joined the workforce, Les as a  machinist and Eva as an office worker at a collective fur company. In  1956, Les and Eva where introduced to one another by Eva's colleague,  who happened to be a distant relative of Les. Les and Eva quickly  became engaged and were married only 59 days later. When the Hungarian  Revolution began against the communist regime, Les and Eva, along vat  Les's father and stepmother, fled to Austria and then the U.S.,  eventually settling in Portland, OR.   Starting over in a new country was challenging, but the Aigners  carried on and made a life in Portland, finding work and starting a  family. Les continued to work as a machinist, and Eva worked as a  cosmetologist, eventually opening her own salon. Eva's mother came to  live with them in Portland as well. Les and Eva are the proud parents  of their daughter Sue, and their son Rob, who blessed them with four  wonderful grandsons. They are waiting to welcome their first great- grandchild.   Les and Eva rebuilt their lives, but they never forgot the horrors  they had endured. As Holocaust deniers became increasingly vocal in the  1980s, the Aigners began telling their stories publicly and speaking  out against discrimination and intolerance. They have worked with the  Holocaust Memorial Coalition since its inception in 1994. Eva was even  the vice chair of the project to build the Oregon Holocaust Memorial,  which she said was the proudest achievement in her life besides giving  birth to her children.   Many of my colleagues in the Senate have heard me speak about my own  family's experience fleeing the Nazi regime during the Holocaust. We  lost family and loved ones on Kristallnacht and at Theresienstadt.  Tolerance, inclusiveness, and compassion are issues my family takes  very seriously. That is why I am so deeply honored to be able to  recognize the Aigners today and to pay tribute to the invaluable work  that they do.   At a time when hate and intolerance seem increasingly pervasive in  our social and political discourse, it is now more important than ever  that we remember the horrors that so many people endured at the hands  of the Nazi regime, the death and pain they suffered in the name of  hate, discrimination, and fear. In Eva Aigner's own words,  ``Discrimination can start with little things. It can start with as  much as racial jokes or religious jokes. It can start with just small  hatred which can grow. . . . The way to fight is to educate the young  people. To let them know what discrimination can do. And how innocent  people can get killed and go through such terrors . . . and have their  family pulled apart.''   We must not forget; we must educate. We must educate ourselves and  each other so that nothing like the horrors of the Nazi regime will  ever happen again. Les and Eva Aigner have dedicated their lives to  exactly that, and that is why I am so incredibly grateful to honor them  today, for their strength, their compassion, their generosity, and  their willingness to educate and make Oregon, our country, and our  world a more tolerant, safer, and better place.   For that reason, I offer both Les and Eva Aigner my deepest affection  and warmest thanks for using their voices to teach generations to come  to never, ever forget.                            ____________________
