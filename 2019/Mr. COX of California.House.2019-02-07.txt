 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Black  History Month. This month, as we pay tribute  [[Page H1398]]  to the pioneers, the trailblazers, and the leaders who have helped bend  and force the moral arc of our Nation closer to that more perfect  Union, I rise to recognize my constituent, Paula Massey of Hanford,  California.   Paula is the founder of Women with Visions Unlimited, a nonprofit  organization that works with youth in literacy and summer school  programs to improve the academic attainment of children in the Central  Valley.   Through her organization, Paula raises scholarships for high school  seniors; organizes numerous events to empower African-American women;  and focuses on bringing awareness to valley fever, an illness deep in  and dear to her heart.   Paula lost her son to valley fever in 2017 and quickly realized there  was a lack of knowledge about the disease, not only from the community,  but from the physicians treating their patients.   Thanks to the advocacy of Paula and many others, in 2018, California  Governor Brown signed a bill requiring the California Department of  Public Health to create outreach and awareness to educate healthcare  providers and physicians in the public about the symptoms and treatment  of valley fever.   As Paula put it: ``Awareness is the key. In the Central Valley, we  are an agriculture community with many open fields where the dust and  dirt blow in the air. Unless there is awareness, many more people will  contract this disease and not know until it is too late.''   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent Paula in the 21st Congressional  District.                            ____________________
