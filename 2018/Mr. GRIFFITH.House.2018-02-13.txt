 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for giving me this  opportunity.   Unlike Mr. Walden, who met him back in 1988, I did not have the  opportunity to fall within Ray's orbit until he became the staff  director at the Energy and Commerce Committee about 13 months ago that  I got to know him. I didn't serve on the Communications and Technology  Subcommittee, so I never had any opportunity to work with him.   I found him absolutely delightful to work with, extremely  intelligent, always caring about the issues, passionate about his work,  his honesty, and his forthrightness. You could always go and talk with  him.   Then I was particularly struck when it became clear that he was well  aware of the severity of his illness and how he handled that, Mr.  Speaker, with courage and grace.   But knowing that the Energy and Commerce Committee would be handling  and involved with the great issues of the day, he and I had several  conversations about how he wanted to continue working and spending  time, helping Chairman Walden on these issues, helping the committee,  and helping our great country.   So to his wife, Kristine, and their children, I thank them for  sharing their great American husband, father, and citizen servant. We  will all miss Ray Baum.    He certainly did. It was remarkable and memorable. I  will certainly always remember that great attitude and just all his  other great attributes that we heard about tonight.
