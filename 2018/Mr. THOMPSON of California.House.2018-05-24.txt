 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit  at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to the bill in  its current form.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment  to the bill, and it would not kill the bill or send it back to  committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final  passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, less than 1 week ago, 10 people were shot and killed in  their school in Santa Fe, Texas. As usual, Members sent thoughts and  prayers. They said that things have got to change, and then they did  nothing.   We held our 47th moment of silence since the tragedy at Sandy Hook  Elementary School 5\1/2\ years ago. For every Member who looks into the  face of yet another grieving family and says, ``I am with you,'' and  then does nothing, I have a message for you: You are complicit. You are  allowing criminals and the dangerously mentally ill easy access to  guns. Your inaction is leading to gravestone after gravestone.   We have not had one vote on legislation to keep guns out of the hands  of people who shouldn't have them. If we are not allowed a vote, there  is blood on the hands of Congress.   Since Sandy Hook, more kids have been killed by someone using a gun  than all of our troops killed in combat since 9/11.   Let that sink in.   Seven thousand young kids are dead, in part, because of our inaction.  I don't know about you, but that number keeps me up at night.   These are children who are robbed of a lifetime of experiences and  robbed of their future. Instead of going to their graduation, their  parents go and visit their grave.   This amendment is straightforward, and, if adopted, it will not kill  the bill. It does two things:   First, it provides grants to States to get more records into the  background check system. I think we can all agree, for the system to  work, it has to have the most up-to-date records.   Second, it would expand background checks to all commercial sale of  firearms. So if you walk into a gun show and try to buy a gun, you have  to undergo a background check. If you go online and try to buy a gun,  you have to undergo a background check.   This isn't some radical idea. 208 Members of this Congress, Democrats  and Republicans, are cosponsors. Even 94 percent of gun owners support  expanding background checks, and we can't get 94 percent of the people  to agree that the sky is blue. This kind of consensus should unify us.  It should empower us on this floor to do what is right.   We know that background checks work. Every day, background checks  stop more than 175 felons, some 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 20  fugitives from buying a gun. But in some States, these same folks can  walk into a gun show and buy the same gun without a background check.  This motion would change that.   Yesterday, the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force heard from young  leaders who are begging Congress to pass laws to help prevent gun  violence. One of the hardest things for me to hear was one student  saying that he was not actually surprised that there was a shooting at  his school. Kids now have an expectation that one day it will happen to  them. This is shameful, and it is the future that we are leaving for  our children and our grandchildren.   I know what the chairman is going to say. He is going to say the NDAA  is no place for this amendment.   First, this isn't an extraneous provision. The NDAA has language  directly addressing guns and gun ownership. Without that language in  the bill, we wouldn't be able to offer this amendment today.   Second, the NDAA has long been a place for extraneous provisions. In  this bill alone, the majority has weakened environmental oversight and  permitted drilling, has addressed medical fees in national parks, and  has addressed yacht safety, just to name a few extraneous provisions.   So I ask you to join me: No more complicity. No more blood on the  hands of Congress. No more moments of silence.   It is time for moments of action. Vote ``yes'' on this motion. It  will not kill the bill, but it will save lives.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                Point of Order     Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the  Chair.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
