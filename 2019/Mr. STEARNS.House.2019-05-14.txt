 The Chair now recognizes the president of the United  States Association of Former Members of Congress, the Honorable Martin  Frost of Texas, to address the Members.    The Chair announces that 27 former Members of Congress  have responded to their names.    Mr. President, thank you, Martin.   I think, as you pointed out, we were waiting for both the majority  leader, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, and the minority leader, Kevin  McCarthy, between 8:45 and 9:00, and they might have had different  schedules/commitments. So we will probably be here, in effect, if they  come by.    We thank the distinguished minority leader.   And with that, let me close by saying, the Chair again, wishes to  thank the former Members of the House and Senate for all of your  presence today.   And before terminating these proceedings, the Chair would like to  invite those former Members who did not respond when the roll call was  called to give their names to the reading clerk for inclusion in the  roll.   I think Tom McMillen came in. Is there anyone else to add?   If not, the Association of Former Members of Congress and the report  to Congress is closed.   The meeting stands adjourned.                            ____________________
