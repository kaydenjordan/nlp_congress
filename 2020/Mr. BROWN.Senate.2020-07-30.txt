 I want to thank Senator Stabenow and Senator Wyden.   I will speak for just 2 or 3 minutes. I know that Senator Schumer  will make another unanimous consent request.   Think about what Senator McConnell wants to do. Senator McConnell is  going to cut $400 in unemployment insurance to tens of millions of  unemployed workers, hundreds of thousands in my State alone--in Oregon,  Michigan, Illinois, New York, Minnesota, Texas, Florida, and Wisconsin.  Thousands of workers are going to lose $400 a week.   Think about what is going to happen. Around the country, the  moratorium on evictions is expiring. Around the country, in community  after community, a moratorium on electric and water cutoffs is about to  happen. So workers are going to lose $400 a week. They are going to  face eviction.   What is going to happen?   We know what is going to happen. What is going to happen is more  people will lose their homes, more people will be in homeless shelters,  more people will spend the night in their cousin's basement in the  middle of a pandemic.   It is cruel, and it is really stupid policy to cut their income for  unemployment for the millions of unemployed workers and then provide no  dollars for rental assistance, no dollars for paying their mortgage,  and no help for those workers. How can we? We are the United States of  America. How can we do such a thing   I yield to Senator Schumer.
