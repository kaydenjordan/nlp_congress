 Mr. Speaker, we are at a precipice as we face a debt  ceiling crisis coming down in a few short days. The President doesn't  seem to have a sense of urgency in the negotiations that is required to  meet the moment.   Over the past 2 years, costs have gone up over 15 percent. Inflation  is eating away at American paychecks. American families are finding it  harder to get by. Our Nation's debt now surpasses $31 trillion, and  Washington continues to spend more. It is time to get our spending  under control.   This House passed a reasonable, sensible bill to raise the debt  ceiling. The Limit, Save, Grow Act moves our debt ceiling up by  eliminating the growth of government, saving taxpayers' money, and  growing the economy. The plan will claw back unspent COVID funds,  making sure we are protecting taxpayers. It calls for able-bodied,  childless adults to work a minimum of 20 hours a week in order to  receive benefits. Bringing people back into the workforce will actually  grow our economy and help address poverty.   We can limit government growth and spending, we can save taxpayers'  money, and we can grow the economy all at the same time.   Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful the President of the United States  understands the urgency of the moment and comes together to save  taxpayers' money.                            ____________________
