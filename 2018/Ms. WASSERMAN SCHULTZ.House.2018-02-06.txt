 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding and for her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this continuing  resolution which, yet again, is a complete and total abdication of our  responsibilities as Members of Congress.   For the fifth time so far this fiscal year, Republicans are asking us  to fund the government for just another flip of the calendar. The last  time Republicans dragged us down this path of budgetary incompetence,  we had the first ever complete government shutdown when one party held  the House, Senate, and the White House. Yet here we are again, left  with this ludicrous approach of funding the U.S. Government month to  month while ignoring so many of the pressing issues Americans want us  to address.   Today we have heard Republicans pay endless lip service to their  devotion to military spending--and that  [[Page H894]]  funding is certainly vital--but what Republicans have not mentioned is  that this latest stopgap gimmick is going to rob from crucial  nondefense budgets that also keep Americans safe. That means veterans,  homeland security, counterterrorism, and State Department programs will  be neglected and ignored.   That is why Democrats are asking for a simple compromise to raise the  spending caps that are unreasonable and uncompromising. That is because  we all want a strong national defense, but we also need equal increases  in our domestic budget so that hardworking families can feel safe and  financially secure.   We also want Republicans to join us in confronting the dire shortfall  at the VA so no veteran is denied care upon returning home.   We want Republicans to work with us to ensure urgently needed  recovery funds go to Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin  Islands, and all areas impacted by wildfires.                                time  1815    We want Republicans to truly help us fight this opioid scourge,  protect America's pensions, and do what the vast majority of Americans  want us to do: pass a clean Dream Act.   Don't tell me we don't have the funds to support those needs. This  Congress just gave a huge handout to billionaires and giant  corporations that exploded the deficit by $1.5 trillion.   But this cynically crafted continuing resolution fails to address  those real needs, the needs of the people who actually sent us here to  stand up for them. We must end this cycle of budgetary neglect.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
