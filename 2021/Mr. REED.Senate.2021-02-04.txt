 Mr. President, today I am introducing the Layoff Prevention  Act. This bill would extend the financing and grant provisions for work  sharing that I authored and worked to include in the Middle Class Tax  Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, and, most recently, the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.   The concept of work sharing is simple. It helps people who are  currently employed--but in danger of being laid off--to keep their  jobs. By giving struggling companies the flexibility to reduce hours  instead of their workforce, work sharing programs prevent layoffs and  help employers save money on rehiring costs. Employees who participate  in work sharing keep their jobs and receive a portion of Unemployment  Insurance benefits to make up for lost wages. This prevents layoffs,  saves employers rehiring costs, and costs states only a fraction of  what it would if workers went on unemployment full-time.   Financing for work sharing programs was included in the CARES Act and  extended through March 14, 2021 in the most recent COVID-19 relief  legislation enacted in December. The legislation I am introducing today  would build upon what is currently in law, by enacting a five-year  extension of financing for permanent work sharing programs, and a two- year extension for temporary programs. This revised Layoff Prevention  Act will also double funding to support states that are implementing  work sharing programs, from $100 million, as provided in the CARES Act,  to $200 million.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of this bill-- which will continue to spur our recovery from the pandemic--by keeping  American workers on the job, saving taxpayers money, and providing  employers with a practical and cost-effective alternative to layoffs.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED:   S. 252. A bill to amend the VI of the Social Security Act to provide  additional funding for States, Tribal governments, and local  communities due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) public  health emergency, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance    Mr. President, in order to build on a key provision I  authored in the CARES Act, which provided states with $150 billion in  Coronavirus Relief Funds, I am reintroducing the State and Local  Emergency Stabilization Fund Act to help state and local governments  shoulder the costs of the coronavirus and its devastating impact on  lives, livelihoods, and the economy.   The State and Local Emergency Stabilization Fund Act has three  critical components: authorizing new funding, assuring flexibility in  spending the funds, and extending the time period for which the funding  can be spent.   Specifically, the bill would provide State and local governments an  additional $600 billion in funding, includes a protective $5 billion  small state minimum, treats the District of Columbia and the  Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as States, and reserves funds for  territories and Tribes. In addition, $59 billion would be allocated to  States based on their relative coronavirus infection rates, and $205  billion would be reserved exclusively for local governments. The bill  makes it crystal clear that Coronavirus Relief Funds are flexible and  may be used to maintain state and local services. And it gives State  and local governments until June 30, 2022 to spend the money in order  to ensure funding can be equitably allocated and disbursed to help  communities combat COVID-19 and recover.   According to a November 29, 2020 Wall Street Journal article, ``State  and local government spending on public services fell at a seasonally  adjusted annual rate of 3.7% in the third quarter from the second,  according to the Commerce Department. That followed a 6% decline in the  second quarter, the sharpest since 1952. By October, the sector had  roughly 1.2 million fewer jobs than a year earlier. It could take four  to eight years for the national economy to recover from the pandemic,  estimates Dan White, director of fiscal-policy research at Moody's  Analytics. State and local governments could take up to 10 or 15 years,  he said.''   Mr. President, we should all let that sink in. ``State and local  government could take up to 10 or 15 years'' to recover from the  pandemic. The scale and pace of this public health emergency and its  impact on our economy requires each of us to swiftly set aside ideology  and work urgently to address these generational challenges head on with  additional fiscal relief. We all have a common interest in ensuring  that state and local governments can continue to provide health care,  education, public safety, and other vital services, just when they are  needed most. Any economic recovery needs reliable state and local  governments that provide the business certainty that make our country  attractive to businesses and investors throughout the world.   Nobody is immune from this crisis. Congress should come together, do  the right thing, and provide states the resources they need to save  lives and livelihoods and get the economy working again. I urge each of  my colleagues to join me in working to enact this legislation so that  we can get more critical federal resources to our states and local  governments who are on the front lines of battling this public health  and economic emergency.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Schatz, Mr.          Durbin, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Tillis, Mr. Kaine,, Ms. Ernst, Mr.          Tester, and Ms. Murkowski):   S. 253. A bill to expand research on the cannabidiol and marihuana;  to the Committee on the Judiciary    Mr. President, along with Senators Brown, Leahy and many or  my colleagues, I am reintroducing legislation that would create a $75  biilion Homeowner Assistance Fund that builds on the success of the  Hardest Hit Fund at the Treasury Department that I championed in 2010.   The Hardest Hit Fund provided funds to 18 state-level Housing Finance  Agencies, directing targeted foreclosure prevention assistance to  households and neighborhoods in states like Rhode Island hit hard by  the economic and housing market downturn.   The Homeowner Assistance Fund expands this model to provide a  flexible source of Federal aid to all State-level Housing Finance  Agencies. This Federal funding could then be used to help struggling  households remain in their homes while they search for new employment  or wait to get back to work. Financial assistance could go towards  preventing eviction, mortgage delinquency, default, foreclosures, or  loss of utility services, such as water, gas, electricity, and the  Internet as well as paying property taxes.   One of the key lessons COVID-19 has taught us is that for many  families, their homes may be the single most effective and accessible  form of personal protective equipment. The last thing we should be  doing is making housing less stable at the worst possible time.  According to a January 2021 National Bureau of Economic Research  working paper, ``policies that limit evictions are found to reduce  COVID-19 infections by 3.8% and reduce deaths by 11%. Moratoria on  utility disconnections reduce COVID-19 infections by 4.4% and mortality  rates by 7.4%. Had such policies been in place across all counties  (i.e., adopted as Federal policy) from early March 2020 through the end  of November 2020, our estimated counterfactuals show that policies that  limit evictions could have reduced COVID-19 infections by 14.2% and  deaths by 40.7%. For moratoria on utility disconnections, COVID-19  infections rates could have been reduced by 8.7% and deaths by 14.8%.''  In short, keeping families housed saves lives, which is precisely the  goal of our Homeowner Assistance Fund legislation.   I thank the Independent Community Bankers of America; Credit Union  National Association; National Association of Realtors; National Low  Income Housing Coalition; National Council of State Housing Agencies;  Habitat for Humanity International; National Housing Conference;  National Community Reinvestment Coalition; National Association of  Affordable Housing Lenders; National Leased Housing Association;  Americans for Financial Reform; National Consumer Law Center, on behalf  of its low-income clients; Center for Responsible Lending; American  Public Gas Association; National Rural Electric Cooperative  Association; National Energy Assistance Directors' Association, Council  of State Community Development Agencies, Rhode Island Housing; and the  Rhode Island Association of Realtors.   I urge all of my colleagues to join in pressing for inclusion of the  Homeowner Assistance Fund in our continued response to the coronavirus  pandemic.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Cortez Masto, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr.          Merkley, Mr. Bennet, Ms. Duckworth, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr.          Menendez, Mr. Reed, Mr. Brown, Ms. Rosen, Ms. Smith, and Ms.          Klobuchar):   S. 263.
