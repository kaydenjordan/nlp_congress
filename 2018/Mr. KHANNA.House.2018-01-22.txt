 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, thousands marched in every city  across America for racial justice, gender equality, and a moral vision  of America. Today, we let them down.   It was not complicated what citizens wanted. They wanted a vote, a  guaranteed vote in this Chamber about whether we would keep our word to  the DREAMers, and we failed to deliver.   Now, I have no doubt that most Democrats, Senators and congressmen,  care about the DREAMers staying in this country, but citizens expect  more. They want us not just to look at generic poll numbers or  battleground districts. They want us to lead with our hearts because  they are leading with their hearts.   The question today, Mr. Speaker, is: When will the elected  representatives be worthy of the courage of our citizens and the  grassroots?                            ____________________
