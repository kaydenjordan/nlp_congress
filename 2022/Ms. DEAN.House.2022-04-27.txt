 Mr. Speaker, our Nation has lost a lifelong leader and  trailblazer--Madeleine Albright--a woman I had the chance to know and  to learn from, and a woman with whom I shared a first name. Madeleine  Albright was a woman of clarity, grace, intellect, and humor--a leader  throughout the globe.   She was an example to many women, like me, becoming our Nation's  first female Secretary of State and, at the time, the highest ranking  woman ever in our government. Years ago, in admiration, I adopted one  of Albright's subtle, yet powerful, diplomatic tools--wearing a brooch  each day to signify something about my work or my heart.   As a child, Secretary Albright and her family fled war-torn Eastern  Europe. Deeply inspired by her new country, she dedicated her life's  work to lifting up democracies at home and around the world and  strengthening NATO with the goal of preventing wars in Europe like the  one that had forced her family from their home. Her passion for peace  inspires my own, especially as I watch the devastating atrocities in  Ukraine.   Dedicated to democracies around the globe, she often recalled her  father's own worries that Americans took their own democracy for  granted. Madeleine Albright knew that democracies are fragile, yet  resilient, and that it matters what world we leave our grandchildren.   May her memory be a blessing and her legacy be a guide.                            ____________________
