 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dana Totman for  his 22 years of service at Avesta Housing and congratulate him on a  well-deserved retirement. Under his leadership, Avesta Housing became  northern New England's largest housing nonprofit and transformed the  lives of individuals and families across Maine. Dana has been a  tireless advocate for affordable housing and made it clear how  drastically it improves lives and strengthens communities.   While Dana cares about the bricks and mortar that become the homes of  many, he cares most about the people who get to call these places home.  It is these individuals who drive his passion. The Maine Affordable  Housing Coalition, created by Dana, exemplifies his vision by giving  those in need a voice and the ability to advocate for themselves.   During the 2009 recession, Dana found a creative way to increase the  supply of affordable homes through the development of a $50 million  bond proposal. Known as the Green Affordable Housing Bond, this allowed  low-income Mainers to obtain affordable, energy-efficient homes, and  created jobs in the construction, architectural, and engineering  sectors. Subsequently, when Maine seniors needed a voice for their  growing housing needs, Dana created and promoted the $15 million Maine  Affordable Housing Bond, the effort garnered support from 69 percent of  Maine voters--one of the largest margin wins of a State bond  initiative.   Throughout his career, Dana navigated through the many obstacles and  challenges Avesta Housing faced. His humility and quiet demeanor  brought people and organizations together to demonstrate how affordable  housing significantly strengthens communities' well-being. His ability  to work closely with neighbors, listen to concerns, and understand the  whole picture, furthered Avesta Housing's mission of giving everyone,  regardless of socioeconomic status, age, or race, a chance to have a  home.   Dana was raised on a Topsham dairy farm, and later lived in  Brunswick, where he and his wife raised their two sons and were members  of the school community as parents. Dana also volunteered to coach  soccer and baseball teams, imparting many life lessons to the kids. He  continues to mentor young people, inspiring future generations to  dedicate their lives to giving back to their communities.   Maine's business community has recognized Dana multiple times over  the years for his exceptional leadership and contributions to equitable  housing in Maine. It is a privilege to join with his colleagues,  friends, and the people of Maine in recognizing Dana for demonstrating  innovation, true excellence in his work, and unwavering compassion to  those seeking--and finding--a home.                            ____________________
