 Mr. Speaker, perhaps now more than ever, we need to  recognize the critical role a free press plays in our democracy and  those who play that role so well.   Today, I rise to honor the life and legacy of an award-winning  journalist and dedicated public servant, Elizabeth Brackett, who died  on June 17, following a tragic accident. Her death is already being  felt by her colleagues at WTTW, the entire Chicago journalism  community, and all of the Illinois residents who have relied on her  reporting for unparalleled insight into the pressing challenges that  confront our Nation and our world.   Working at four television stations spanning five decades, Elizabeth  was an accomplished journalist and news program host who asked public  officials questions that really matter.   In the past, people have asked if I am afraid of a journalist who  raises tough questions. The answer is no. I'm afraid of a journalist  who asks the wrong questions, who doesn't know what questions to ask.   Elizabeth was a journalist's journalist who knew not only what to  ask, but how and why. Her thoughtful, smart, and incredibly well- researched approach made us all better at our jobs.   After retiring from her full-time position at ``Chicago Tonight'' in  2014, Elizabeth continued to contribute to the network primarily on  environmental topics, such as the health of the lakes in which she  frequently swam.   In particular, I remember one of the most recent interviews in 2017  when she asked me about efforts to keep Asian carp out of the Great  Lakes. It was Elizabeth who asked me about the environmental impacts in  such detail and accuracy, providing viewers, listeners, and readers  alike with an in-depth understanding of the invasive species, a  critical issue for our Great Lakes.   ``Resourceful'' and ``passionate'' were two words often used to  describe her. Carol Marin, Elizabeth's colleague at ``Chicago  Tonight,'' said it best: ``Elizabeth was always going to be your  competitor. She was out there to get the story, get it first, and get  the story best. That is what made her so good at what she did.''   In addition to journalism, her ambition was, front and center, in her  unmistakable athleticism. She began competing in triathlons at the age  of 50 and became a national champion in her age group.   From beginning her broadcast career in 1977 as a researcher at WBBM- TV to becoming a weekend anchor and going on to win national Emmy and  Peabody awards, Elizabeth was an institution.   I extend my thoughts to her husband, Peter Martinez, and her entire  family, including 10 grandchildren.   She was a role model and a force for truth. We will all miss her  expertise and energy both in and out of the news studio.                            ____________________
