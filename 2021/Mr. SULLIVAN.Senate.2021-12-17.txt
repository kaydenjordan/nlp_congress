 Mr. President, I would like to recognize a member of my  staff, Erin Stuart, who left the office in July to attend law school at  Marquette University. This is an exciting time in Erin's life and all  of us with Team Sullivan want to thank her for her contributions to our  office, the State of Alaska, and the U.S. Senate.   Erin is a born-and-raised Alaskan who grew up fishing with her family  in our State's pristine waters. After graduating from South Anchorage  High School, Erin attended the University of Portland where she  explored her passions for government affairs and trade policy.   Erin's time on Capitol Hill began in the summer of 2018 when she was  an intern for my colleague, Congressman   Don Young. That following  summer, Erin joined my DC office where she impressed all of us with her  strong work ethic, eventually becoming a legislative correspondent for  healthcare issues.   We work tirelessly in my office to ensure that the needs of Alaskans  are best represented. I tell people who join my staff that it is not  easy work. Erin was always eager to learn and to give the job her all,  while also spending her evenings and weekends studying for the LSAT and  filling out law school applications.   We wish her the best as she begins this new chapter in her life.   While Erin is currently not on my staff, she is will always be a  member of Team Sullivan. Please join me in wishing Erin success in her  future. She is missed.                            ____________________
