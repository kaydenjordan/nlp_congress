 Madam Speaker, America is in the midst of a shocking  gun violence epidemic that should shock the conscience of everyone, and  has devastated children, families, and communities. We must address it  with the fierce urgency of now.   But there are some in this Chamber who would rather bury their heads  in the sand and act like everything is okay.   It is not okay that Black folks were gunned down in Buffalo, New  York, simply because of the color of their skin.   It is not okay that members of the Jewish community were gunned down  in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh simply because of their  religious beliefs.   It is not okay that children were gunned down and shredded in Uvalde,  Texas, by an 18-year old who should never have had access to a weapon  of war.   It is not okay that mass murder has become a way of life in the  United States of America. That is why we must pass comprehensive gun  violence prevention legislation, address this epidemic decisively, and  allow America to be the best version of itself.
