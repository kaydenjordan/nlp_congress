 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  this motion. I rise today as a new Member who ran for office on  cleaning up our system. And admittedly, I rise today as someone who has  voted for Republican MTRs in the past.   In fact, I was eager to hear how my colleagues and friends across the  aisle would propose a solution today for how they are going to finally  drain the swamp. I was eager to hear how they would protect and  enshrine the rights and freedoms and liberties that we all are endowed  in the Constitution.   But what they have given us today does nothing to drain the swamp,  nothing to uphold our freedoms. Only in Washington would we see a group  of people actively trying to sabotage anticorruption measures.   This is a political stunt meant to divide us, meant to sow hatred. It  is a game, nothing less. Nothing less.   This right here is why the American people hate politics. Honestly,  if this is your strategy to win future elections, we wish you Godspeed  because it will never work. It will never work because the question  before us today, and the thing that this joke of an MTR that is seeking  to distract us from is, whose side are you on?   Let's show the American people that this is the people's House, not  the House of corporate interests and lobbyists and dark money.   Again, I stand in opposition to this motion.
