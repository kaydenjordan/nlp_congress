 Mr. Speaker, I rise humbled by the opportunity  before this House today to help preserve the legacy of a true American  patriot and local hero in northeast Ohio, the late Lance Corporal  Andrew Nowacki.   Lance Corporal Nowacki was tragically killed in action on February  26, 2005, while protecting his fellow marines during his second tour of  duty in Iraq.   He was just 24 years old.   However, his dedication to protecting his community and serving his  country made him a hero long before he gave the ultimate sacrifice in  the name of freedom.   Andrew, known as Andy or Ace to those closest to him, graduated from  Brush High School in 1998 and signed up for the Marine Corps Reserves  shortly thereafter.   He later attended the Cleveland Heights Police Academy and joined the  Grand River Police Department in 2001.   Always looking to protect and serve others, Andy was a dedicated  member of the ready response team, the honor guard, and the bike  patrol.   Andy's commitment to community, dedication to service, and desire to  help others is something we should forever honor, and his sacrifice is  something we should never forget.   My bill, H.R. 3275, would rename the United States Post Office in  Grand River, Ohio, the Lance Corporal Andy `Ace' Nowacki Post Office,  ensuring he will forever be remembered by the community he cared so  deeply for and contributed so much to.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to help preserve Andy's legacy and  vote ``yes'' on H.R. 3275.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
