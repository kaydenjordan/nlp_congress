 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the late Colonel  Robert ``Bob'' Dingeman, a decorated veteran and beloved community  leader who dedicated his entire life to service.   Bob's commitment to service began when he was just a teenager. He was  living with his family in Hawaii and serving in the Reserve Officers'  Training Corps when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Bob helped to  get the women and children to safety before joining the defense of the  base, and the events of that day led Bob to a life of military service.   He graduated from West Point in 1945 and went on to serve in World  War II, the Korean war, and the Vietnam war. During his decades of  service, Bob earned a Silver Star, Soldier's Medal, Bronze Star, and  Purple Heart.   After retiring from the Army, Bob earned multiple master's degrees  and worked as a college professor at San Diego Miramar College,  teaching math, history, and political science.   Bob became a pillar of San Diego's Scripps Ranch community where he  and his wife, Gaye, and their children made their home.   Bob helped create the town's council, the Scripps Ranch Civic  Association; organized many annual traditions, including the Fourth of  July Parade; and established the community newsletter.   The Robert E. Dingeman Elementary School opened in 1995, so named by  the San Diego Unified School District to recognize Bob Dingeman's  accomplishments in the community. The school celebrates Bob Dingeman  Day every year on June 12, Bob's birthday.   Scripps Ranch and San Diego are better off for Bob's leadership and  his community involvement. His legacy of military and volunteer service  will continue to be an example for us all.   Please join me in honoring Bob Dingeman for his dedication to Scripps  Ranch and his service to the country.        Recognizing Marine Corps Air Station Miramar's Commitment to                             Alternative Energy     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Marine Corps Air  Station Miramar on receiving a 2019 Secretary of Defense Environmental  Award.   The award recognizes Marine Corps Air Station Miramar's commitment to  protecting the environment while supporting the mission of the  military.   The United States Department of Defense is the world's largest user  of fossil fuels, and when the price of those fuels spike, it harms our  mission. That is why the Marine Corps views energy security as national  security.   The marines at Miramar have led on energy storage research through a  partnership with the California Energy Commission's Electric Program  Investment Charge and deployed a methane-to-energy project from an  onsite landfill that generates half the base's energy.   MCAS Miramar's installation-wide microgrid delivers 100 percent  renewable energy to the base. Its distribution can provide reliable  energy to mission-critical facilities for 3 weeks if they are ever  disconnected from the grid.   This achievement has wide implications for the Marines, San Diego,  and the way we power our world. Energy innovation has always come  naturally to the military, and MCAS Miramar embodies San Diego's  forward-thinking approach and commitment to sustainability.   I thank Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and all marines stationed  there for their service to our Nation. I thank Marine Corps leadership  for their dedication to alternative energy.    Please join me in congratulating Marine Corps Air Station Miramar on  the 2019 Secretary of Defense Environmental Award.                Recognizing New Children's Museum of San Diego     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the New  Children's Museum of San Diego, winner of the 2019 National Medal for  Museum and Library Service. This award is the highest honor given to  museums that demonstrate extraordinary and innovative approaches to  community service.   The New Children's Museum, which will celebrate its 36th anniversary  this year, is a cornerstone of arts and culture for San Diego families.   The museum is certainly a model for engaging people of all  backgrounds with art. They collaborate with community centers, social  service organizations, and schools to spread art, creativity, and play  outside the museum.   The New Children's Museum employs a philosophy that enables children  to learn through play. Their philosophy is pervasive in their immersive  exhibits that allow children to climb, touch, build, and engage with  the art.   I brought my own children there to think, play, and create, like so  many families, when they were younger.   Today, the museum offers free and reduced admission for military  families, Head Start groups, homeless and foster children, migrant  families, and more.   This award is a testament to the New Children's Museum's service to  San Diegans.   Please join me in honoring the New Children's Museum.                            ____________________
