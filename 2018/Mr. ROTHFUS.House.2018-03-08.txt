 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Shimkus for leading and  his help with this important legislation.   This is going to be an interesting debate. This is a debate about one  size fits all coming out of Washington, D.C., and the failure of folks  in this town at regulatory agencies to not appreciate the nuance of  what is going on in the rest of the country.   I have been on these waste coal piles of western Pennsylvania. I have  seen streams that are dead. I have seen hillsides scarred. I have seen  restoration. I have seen streams come back to life. I have seen  hillsides come back to life.   This Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment, SENSE, Act,  makes sense for those who live outside the Capital Beltway.   The SENSE Act is a vitally important effort that I have championed in  various forms throughout my time in Congress. The bill recognizes the  huge success that the coal refuse-to-energy industry is making in  Pennsylvania, and especially my district, to make it a healthier and  cleaner place to live.    Without the SENSE Act, five coal refuse-to-energy facilities in  western Pennsylvania and West Virginia will close, and their  environmental remediation efforts will end.   Despite what the bill's opponents say, the SENSE Act is, first and  foremost, a pro-environment bill, but it is also a pro-jobs bill, a  pro-union jobs bill, because it is union workers who are going to be  thrown out of work when these plants close. And it is a pro-taxpayer  bill because the environment is being cleaned up without a contribution  from the taxpayers.   The coal industry has a long and storied history in Pennsylvania. Not  only has it been an important part of the economy for generations, but  Pennsylvania coal helped the U.S. and our allies win two world wars.   Historic mining activity, unfortunately, left behind large piles of  coal refuse. These piles consist of lower quality coal mixed with rock  and dirt.   For a long time, we did not have the technology to use this material,  so it accumulated in large piles outside of cities and towns, close to  schools, neighborhoods, and in fields across coal country. This has led  to many environmental problems that diminished the quality of life for  people in these areas surrounded by these piles. Vegetation and  wildlife have been harmed, the air has been polluted, and acid mine  drainage has impaired nearby rivers and streams.   I have seen these sites firsthand, as I said, and the environmental  danger they pose.   Coal refuse piles can catch fire. Think about that. They can catch  fire with no limitations at all. It is an unmitigated disaster when  these things catch fire--uncontrolled air pollution. Many are already  smoldering, giving off toxic emissions, again, without any controls  whatsoever.   Runoff from these sites literally turn rivers orange, leaving them  devoid of life.   The cost to clean up all of this is astronomical. Pennsylvania's  environmental regulator estimates that fixing abandoned mine lands  could cost over $16 billion, over $2 billion of which would be needed  for coal refuse piles alone.   We needed an innovative solution to this tough challenge, a  commonsense compromise. This was necessary to get the job done and to  protect the environment. That is where the coal refuse-to-energy  industry comes in.   Using advanced technology, this industry has been able to use  previously worthless material to generate electricity. This activity is  what powers remediation efforts and has successfully removed over 200  million tons of coal refuse, reclaiming polluted sites across  Pennsylvania and other historic coal regions.   Thanks to the hard work of the dedicated people in this industry-- again, many union workers in this industry--landscapes have been  restored, rivers and streams have been brought back to life, and many  towns have been relieved of hazardous waste coal piles.   Here is an example of what this industry has been able to do. Here  you have an abandoned waste coal pile, but through the restoration  efforts, the countryside has been reclaimed. This is a picture of  success done without taxpayer money, improving the environment.   I want to highlight again private sector leadership on this issue  that has saved taxpayers millions of dollars in cleanup costs; and if  the SENSE Act becomes law, taxpayers will continue to save millions.   I should also note that the waste-to-energy industry pays millions in  tax dollars, too, something that my colleagues should be mindful of,  because many of the plants in these areas are areas where there is  still a struggle economically. Multiple groups have previously endorsed  the SENSE Act, including Pennsylvania's abandoned mine reclamation  groups and clean water advocates.   Unfortunately, intensifying and, importantly, inflexible EPA  regulations threaten five plants in western Pennsylvania and West  Virginia. This would leave hundreds of millions of dollars of vital  cleanup unfinished, lead to job losses, and leave many localities  exposed to the harmful conditions waste coal piles pose.   Mr. Speaker, we are talking a handful--a handful--of plants.   The sky is falling. The catastrophic scenario the opponents of this  legislation are arguing about, they don't appreciate the nuance of what  we are trying to do here. The SENSE Act, as it has been amended,  addresses a significant challenge arising from the implementation of  the existing rules, including those under the Mercury and Air Toxic  Standards.   Importantly, these plants comply with mercury emission standards.  There is an issue with how they deal with HCL, hydrogen chloride, and  sulfur dioxide, SO2.   This is a targeted piece of legislation, a customization, as it were,  to recognize the important and vital work that this industry has been  doing. Contrary to what critics allege, the SENSE  [[Page H1483]]  Act simply provides operators with additional alternative MATS  compliance standards, but it is still strict and it is still  achievable.   Despite opponents' claims, this bill is not a sweetheart deal for the  coal refuse-to-energy industry. This bill only prevents a few plants  from being regulated out of existence. This industry represents a tiny  fraction of the energy industry, but it provides enormous environmental  benefits.   Again, this legislation brings a stark contrast to the difference  between elites in this town and what is out there in flyover country,  that you cannot even go in and see the specific issue and that you have  to apply this one size fits all because you are operating from some  ideological framework. It is really unfortunate, because it is the  environment that is going to hurt; it is jobs that are going to be  lost.   The industry works with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental  Protection to identify especially dangerous piles and prioritize  remediation.   Mr. Speaker, the amended version of this bill accurately reflects the  spirit of previous SENSE Act versions, and I thank my colleagues on the  Energy and Commerce Committee for their work on it.   It is my hope that we can continue to build support for this bill,  especially in the Senate, where Senators Toomey and Casey, Republican  and Democrat, have previously offered a bipartisan amendment relating  to it in the past. Despite that prior bipartisan Senate support,  previous efforts have failed to achieve the supermajority necessary to  pass, but I am hopeful that the SENSE Act can win enough support to  pass both Chambers.   What we are looking to achieve today is this: a narrow and limited  addition to existing rules for a very small but pro-environment  industry.   This should not be a controversial or partisan issue. We want to hold  this industry to high standards, but to standards they can actually  reach. But for the EPA emission extension that expires in 2019, current  regulations discount the environmental remediation benefits this  industry provides.                                time  0930    My bill will help keep the coal refuse industry in business so that  local communities, economies, and the environment will continue to reap  the benefits.   The people who live near coal refuse piles and all of the communities  downstream of these hazards expect us to find a solution. Many workers  at the endangered power plants, folks throughout the supply chain, and  their families, are counting on us to protect their livelihoods. We owe  it to them to pass the SENSE Act, including people like Bill Turner.   Bill is a shift supervisor at the Colver refuse facility in Cambria  County. He has worked at Colver for over two decades. He has also lived  close to coal refuse piles. Bill and his colleagues at Colver are proud  of the reclamation work they do. He has put three kids through college  thanks to his job. I know I have said this before, but his children  even played soccer on a field reclaimed from a coal refuse pile because  of this industry. Bill said it would be a travesty if the coal waste- to-energy industry disappeared.   Another industry worker is Dennis Simmers. He is an engineer at  Colver. For him, this issue is personal. He said three generations of  his family lived in the shadow of a large coal refuse pile.  Unfortunately, his relatives died without ever seeing this  environmental catastrophe corrected. He said: ``There is a real shot  now that I will see it in my lifetime.''   Finally, I would like to recognize Vince Brisini, who testified at  the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing last fall. Vince not only  worked for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, but  he also lives next to a waste coal pile. Like Bill and Dennis, he has  devoted so much of his time and energy, both professionally and  personally, to solving this problem.   Madam Speaker, we owe it to the environment to keep these five  endangered plants open. We owe it to people like Dennis and Bill and  Vince to see if we can solve the waste coal problem during this  generation. The SENSE Act will help ensure that that remains a  probability. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, pro- environment bill.    Madam Speaker, I would like to make a couple of points  here. Without this relief, the plants are going to close. This is not a  broad-based industry carve-out. This is for a subset of plants.   When you look at the economics of running a plant, you are looking at  income, you are looking at cost. The fact is, we are seeking a nuanced  approach to recognize the environmental benefit that these plants have  provided, the hundreds of jobs, family-sustaining jobs that are at  stake. It is just frustrating to hear my colleagues just insist on this  one-size-fits-all, seemingly we are incapable of appreciating a nuance.   We don't rail against regulation. We rail against overregulation.  Regulation is important. It is necessary. It should be responsible. It  should be prudent. It should meet a cost-benefit analysis.   I talked about right regulation, not deregulation; right regulation.  You pick the regulation to fit the circumstance that you are in.   A picture paints a thousand words. That paints a thousand words right  there, and the EPA has even recognized the benefit of this industry  here. A quote from the EPA: ``Coal refuse piles are an environmental  concern because of acid seepage and leachate production, spontaneous  combustion, and low soil fertility. Units that burn coal refuse provide  multimedia environmental benefits. . . . ''   Let me say that again. The EPA said: ``Units that burn coal refuse  provide multimedia environmental benefits by combining the production  of energy with the removal of coal refuse piles and by reclaiming land  for productive use. Consequently, because of the unique environmental  benefits that coal refuse-fired EGUs provide, these units warrant  special consideration. . . . ''   Let me say that again. The EPA said: ``These units warrant special  consideration,'' because of the unique environmental benefits they  provide.   That is what the SENSE Act is about.   Up in Cambria County, where they have a number of these piles, there  are streams that flow into the Conemaugh River, that flows into the  Kiskiminetas River, that flows into the Allegheny River, that flows  into the Ohio River. This industry is cleaning up those tributaries,  preventing acid seepage into the Conemaugh, into the Kiskiminetas, into  the Allegheny, and the Ohio.   This bill makes sense, and I would urge my colleagues to seriously  consider it because this is an area where people can come up out of  their trenches and find common ground, something that makes common  sense, reaches common sense. It is pro-environment. The sky is not  falling, as some of the opponents might say. And it saves jobs and  union jobs.    Madam Speaker, I want to talk about some burdens,  burdens like uncontrolled release of toxins into the air when these  piles catch fire, uncontrolled seepage into rivers.   This subset of plants, my colleague from Pennsylvania makes the point  about some of these plants are in compliance. There is such a thing as  economies of scale. And when any business is in operation, you are  looking at costs  [[Page H1485]]  and expenses. You are looking at revenue. And when the costs and  expenses exceed the revenue, you go out of business.   Unless we are able to do a customization for these handful of plants,  they will close. Hundreds of people will lose their jobs. The cleanup  they are doing will stop. While some other plants may continue to  operate and continue the good work, that is great, but it is going to  go at a slower pace. It is going to cost taxpayers more because less  will be cleaned up.   This industry, so far, has cleaned up 200 million tons of waste coal  in Pennsylvania, and that is just the start of the work that needs to  be done. My hope is that it is all going to be cleaned up in our  lifetimes.   So, no, this isn't forever. This isn't forever.   This, again, is taking a look at a situation we have in Pennsylvania,  that we want to recognize the good work that is going on there and,  again, when you look at the EPA under the Obama administration, talking  of the unique environmental benefits that these plants provide and that  they warrant special consideration.   Again, I just urge my colleagues to come up. Let's get out of our  trenches. Let's take a look, meeting, you know, in the middle here.  Support this legislation. Save these jobs. Save these union jobs. Let  these plants stay open, and let's continue to clean up western  Pennsylvania.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I wonder if my friend from Pennsylvania has really taken a look at  the legislation, because there are rules that apply. The entire bevy of  environmental rules apply to these plants, and the SENSE Act is going  to leave those in place, all the rules.   What the SENSE Act does is take a look at two factors--two factors-- hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide. That is it. And it says, if you  are in compliance with hydrogen chloride, you will be deemed to be in  compliance with sulfur dioxide, or, conversely, if you are in  compliance with sulfur dioxide, you will be deemed in compliance with  hydrogen chloride. Everything else is applicable. Everything else is  applicable.   This is why I talk about a customization for a small handful of the  plants. The group that represents these plants supports this  legislation. The workers in these plants support this legislation. The  people who live next to these coal piles support this legislation.   But to suggest that this legislation means no rules for these plants  is just not accurate. All the rules apply to these plants. We are  seeing a small tweak because, again, when you look at the economics of  running a business, running a plant, you are looking at cost; and if  you are going to impose the cost to put the additional mechanics within  the plant, it is not going to happen. Those plants are going to close.  That is what we are looking at.   So, again, I would appreciate if folks who take a look at this  legislation understand that these plants are still subject to strict  regulation both at the Federal and State level and that this is a minor  tweaking of one rule. While the EPA may have been discussing the  benefit of these plants in the context of another rule, the fact  remains the same: these units warrant special consideration. If it is  true under one rule, it is going to be true under all rules because of,  again, the unique environmental benefits that these plants provide.
