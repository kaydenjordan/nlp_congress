 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, two bedrock  principles of American jurisprudence are the presumption of innocence  and the right to have a trial by jury. I have one amendment that I  would ask unanimous consent be included in this bill. This amendment  would ensure that no American would ever be held indefinitely in prison  without having a trial by jury. I can't imagine why we can't have this.  One Republican Senator has been blocking this for 6 years.   I object to this unanimous consent request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we allow my  amendment to be heard and voted on in the upcoming bill.
