 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a few minutes this  afternoon during this Special Order just to go over some highlights of  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as we continue to see very robust economic  growth happening across the country, including in my district back in  western Pennsylvania.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is the culmination of years spent listening  to the stories of families back home who had nothing left over at the  end of the month, of families who were struggling to save for  retirement, pay off loans, and simply make ends meet. These stories are  not just unique to my district, but they are coming in from all across  America to the House of Representatives.   For too long, hardworking Americans toiled under a broken Tax Code  filled with loopholes and special interest carve-outs. For most of the  last decade, we had sluggish growth, stagnant wages, and limited  opportunity across the country, including parts of Pennsylvania. When  an economy is stagnant and not healthy, fewer job opportunities exist  and workers' hard-earned wages often do not keep up with expenses.   Since being elected in 2012, I told my constituents that it did not  have to be that way, that we could do better, that we deserve better.  That is why 6 months ago, my colleagues and I passed the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act, and the President signed it into law.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act puts hardworking Americans first by  allowing them to keep more of their paychecks, bringing businesses home  from overseas, and creating that healthier economy.   To help workers keep more of their wages, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  nearly doubles the standard deduction from $6,350 per individual to  $12,000, and from $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples, essentially  doubling the amount of income that will not be subject to Federal  income taxes.   It also expands the child tax credit to $2,000 to help parents with  the cost of raising kids, and adds a new credit to help provide care  for elderly family members and adults with disabilities.   With these changes, the zero tax bracket increases significantly.  Consequently, more Americans will be fully exempt from Federal income  taxes, and they can keep more of their hard-earned wages.   Additionally, before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the United States had  the highest business tax rates in the industrialized world.  Pennsylvania's combined Federal and State corporate tax rate stood at  nearly 45 percent.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is removing a choke hold on our economy,  decreasing for American corporations the tax rate from 35 percent to 21  percent. Consequently, the Pennsylvania combined rate now stands at 31  percent. This puts American companies in a better place, from a  competitive standpoint, than their Chinese and Mexican counterparts.   Think about that. Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, China was  treating its companies better, Mexico was treating its companies  better, with lower tax rates, and you saw investments going into those  countries. Now, with the United States having lower tax rates, it is  turning around.   This improvement, as well as other provisions such as the immediate  expensing of new equipment, is causing companies to bring cash back  from overseas and invest in America and hire workers and raise pay.   Under the new system, small business employers, known as pass-through  enterprise--your partnerships, your LLCs--will be able to deduct 20  percent of their qualified business income, and the remaining income  will be taxed at new and lower rates.   This translates into a significant tax cut for Main Street  businesses, freeing up resources that will allow them to innovate and  invest in their communities, hire workers, and increase wages.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also established a program that will ensure  that the benefits of our booming economy reach areas that have been  historically overlooked: the opportunity zone programs.   States are identifying areas that have struggled with high poverty  and sluggish economic growth. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provides tax  incentives to direct private investment into and reinvigorate these  communities. These communities have been starved of robust capital  investment for decades. That is about to change.   In my district in western Pennsylvania, Governor Wolf from  Pennsylvania has designated zones across the State. In western  Pennsylvania, in my district, we have tracts that have been designated  in Beaver Falls, Midland, Johnstown, and Aliquippa. These are strong  communities, Mr. Speaker, that once again can thrive thanks to the  attractive incentives offered in the opportunity zone investment.   This is how it is going to work.   People may have an asset they have been holding for a long time and  have a capital gain there. There is $6 trillion locked up in capital  gains across this country. If somebody wants to make an investment in a  community where there has not been an investment, they can sell that  asset, defer their capital gain, and invest in that fund. If they hold  that in the fund for 10 years, they can defer the tax for that 10  years, get a step up in basis, and here is where it is great: they will  not pay taxes on the appreciation of that investment in the opportunity  zone.   Think about that capital that can flow into those communities and  stay there and grow a business. That is private capital coming in,  which is different from a government grant that might go in.   You have individuals who are looking to make investments. They want  that investment to grow. They want that investment to do well. They  want that investment to prosper in these communities. This is good news  for those communities and good news for people who live there and can  get jobs as a result of the investments in these opportunity zones.    The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is not just about simplifying our Tax Code.  It is saving people money. It is about empowering people in  Pennsylvania and throughout our Nation with hope and opportunity to  better their lives for themselves, their families, and their  communities.   These reforms within the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are resulting in real  benefits that are being experienced across the Nation. Already, 90  percent of American workers are receiving higher take-home pay under  the new withholding tables. Four million workers have received bonuses,  raises, or expanded benefits, and over 1 million new jobs have been  created, including 160,000 manufacturing jobs.   For the first time in many years, there are more job openings than  job seekers. Last month, the unemployment rate was 4 percent, nearly  the lowest in decades, and the unemployment rates for African Americans  and Hispanics were at historic lows. Fifty-eight percent of small  business owners are confident about hiring new employees, and more  Americans are optimistic about their future.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is bringing workers who were pushed to the  sidelines during the previous years back into the labor force and  restoring hope to everyday Americans. In June, 600,000 people entered  the labor force, and 213,000 new jobs were added.   Businesses in my district are reinvesting in their employees,  communities, and operations through bonuses,  [[Page H6586]]  higher wages and salaries, and increased charitable giving.   In western Pennsylvania, PNC Bank and BNY Mellon have raised their  employees' minimum wages. Major companies, including UPS, FedEx, and  Home Depot, that employ thousands of western Pennsylvanians, are  providing bonuses and contributing more to their employees' retirement  plans.   In fact, the Hampton Township Home Depot plans to create its own  Success Sharing Program, in which hourly employees will be able to  divide an estimated $30,000 to $40,000 among themselves semiannually,  twice a year.   The Ellwood Group, a steel manufacturer, is planning a $60 million  addition to its New Castle plant and adding 25 new employees once it is  fully operational.   Some who opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts have touted these  meaningful benefits to U.S. workers as ``crumbs.'' They have said that  this law only helps the wealthy.   Let me ask this: Is the Pennsylvania Utilities Commission requiring  17 of its utility companies to give a monthly credit to their  customers, saving $320 million a year, crumbs?   Mr. Speaker, these aren't crumbs. These are seeds that are taking  root and growing opportunities, creating jobs and the economy for all  Americans to prosper.   Don't just take it from me. Take it from John in New Kensington, who  is seeing more money in his paycheck and received a $2,500 bonus.   Take it from Brian in Windber, who is receiving $500 more a month;  Michael in Aliquippa, who is bringing home an extra 4.5 percent in each  paycheck; Edward in Westmoreland County, who is receiving $128 more per  paycheck. That is more than $3,000 per year.   Take it from Flory in Westmoreland County, who said that, thanks to  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, her family will have more money to use  towards their son's postgraduate education; and Heidi from Allegheny  County, who wrote to tell me that ``every penny we aren't taxed can go  towards our other bills such as food, utilities, school loans, a  mortgage, and clothing for our children. We were barely scraping by  during the previous administration.''                                time  1315    The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is about empowering everyone, from the  single mom in Ambridge, Pennsylvania, looking to buy her first home to  the entrepreneur in Beaver Falls, working to achieve his or her  American Dream.   When our people can fully develop their God-given skills and talents  in a competitive economy without the government's excessive taxes and  regulations, not only will our citizens' lives improve, but our country  will grow stronger.
