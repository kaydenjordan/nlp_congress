 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in complete and  total support of President Trump.   The matter before the House today is based solely on a fundamental  hatred of our President. It is a sham, a witch hunt, and it is  tantamount to a coup against the duly-elected President of the United  States.   This is a sad day for our Nation when one political party, along with  their cohorts in the deep state and the mainstream media, try to hijack  our Constitution.   The Democrat majority has irresponsibly turned the impeachment  process into a political weapon, something that Republicans refused to  do when our base was calling for the impeachment of President Obama.   It is well past time for the House to move beyond this hoax and put  our Nation first. That is exactly what President Trump is doing. The  United States has record-low unemployment and historic performance in  the stock market. President Trump is rewriting failed trade deals of  the past to put America first. He is rebuilding our military, helped  create Space Force, and the list goes on.   I implore my colleagues to end this spectacle now.
