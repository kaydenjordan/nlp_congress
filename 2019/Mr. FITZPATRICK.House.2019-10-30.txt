 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Pennsbury  Athletic Association 12-and-under and 8-and-under baseball teams, who  were both honored for their championship-winning seasons.   The 8-and-under team had an undefeated regular season. They went on  to win the district, State, mid-Atlantic, and world series  championships. The team's final record was an impressive 38-1, which  included going undefeated during the Cal Ripken World Series.   The 12-and-under team had a great season as well, winning the annual  Keystone Cup State tournament. Winning is nothing new for this team. In  the last 4 years, they have won two State titles and four district  titles. They will be finishing the season with an amazing trip to  Cooperstown for the national tournament.   Mr. Speaker, the accomplishments of these teams show the importance  sports can play in our children's lives. Team sports teach the  importance of hard work, being part of a team, dedication, and  sportsmanship. All these skills help mold our children and will help  mold our children into the leaders of tomorrow.    I commend the accomplishments of these amazing kids and their  coaches.    Recognizing Bristol Township Police Officers CJ Winik and Kurt Leacock     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two police  officers from Bristol Township.   Officers CJ Winik and Kurt Leacock were promoted to the rank of  sergeant in front of family, friends, and colleagues. Both officers  serve on the Bucks County Homicide by Vehicle Task Force.   Sergeant Winik has been a part of the Bristol police force since  2006. He has worked as a field training officer, accident  reconstructionist, firearms instructor, community response unit  officer, and on the SWAT team. He will serve in the administrative  division, supervising professional standards, accreditation, and  training management.   Sergeant Leacock has been part of the department since 2007. He has  served as a field training officer, drug recognition expert, and on the  crisis intervention team. He will share duties with shift commander  Sergeant Tom Gaffney on patrol.   Mr. Speaker, the role both of these officers play in keeping our  community safe is admirable, and I want to wish the best to both of  these men in their new positions and thank them for all their service  to our community.             In Support of National Veterans Small Business Week     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support National  Veterans Small Business Week, which will take place from November 4  through November 8.   Our veterans are some of the most highly skilled workers in our  Nation. They are the product of rigorous training, an ironclad  commitment to teamwork, and the remarkable ability to succeed where  others might fail.   Veterans not only fight for and protect this country but are trained  with the skills and leadership qualities that are needed to own and  operate successful businesses.   Our veteran small business owners are job creators, entrepreneurs,  and heroes, and I am proud to recognize the important role that  veteran-owned small businesses play in our community, and we thank all  of them, from a grateful Congress, for their service.                            ____________________
