 Madam President, this explanation reflects the status of  negotiations and disposition of issues reached between the Senate  Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select  Committee on Intelligence for the Intelligence Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2022.    The explanation shall have the same effect with respect to the  implementation of this act as if it were a joint explanatory statement  of a conference committee.    I ask unanimous consent that the Joint Explanatory Statement for the  Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 be printed into the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  Joint Explanatory Statement--Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal                                 Year 2022         The following is the Joint Explanatory Statement (the       ``Explanatory Statement'') to the Intelligence Authorization       Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (``the Act''), which has been       included as Division X of the Consolidated Appropriations       Act, 2022. The Explanatory Statement reflects the result of       negotiations and disposition of issues reached between the       Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (``SSCI'') and the       House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (``HPSCI'')       (together, the ``Committees''). The Explanatory Statement       shall have the same effect with respect to the implementation       of the Act as if it were a joint explanatory statement of a       conference committee.        The Explanatory Statement comprises three parts: an       overview of the application of the annex to accompany this       statement; a statement on anomalous health incidents; and       unclassified congressional direction.         Part I: Application of the Classified Annex and Schedule of                               Authorizations         The classified nature of U.S. intelligence activities       prevents the Committees from publicly disclosing many details       concerning their final decisions regarding funding levels and       policy direction. Therefore, in addition to the Schedule of       Authorizations, a classified annex to the Act--referred to       here and within the annex itself as the ``Agreement''--has       been prepared to describe in detail the scope and intent of       the Committees' actions.        The Agreement supersedes the classified annexes that       accompanied H.R. 5412 and S. 2610; and reconciles differences       between the Committees, with respect to the National       Intelligence Program (NIP). The Agreement also makes       recommendations for the Military Intelligence Program (MIP)       and the Information Systems Security Program (ISSP). The       Agreement authorizes the Intelligence Community (IC) to       obligate and expend funds not altered or modified by the       classified Schedule of Authorizations as requested in the       President's budget, subject to modification under applicable       reprogramming procedures.        The classified Schedule of Authorizations is incorporated       into the bill pursuant to Section 102. It has the status of       law. The Agreement supplements and adds detail to clarify the       authorization levels found in the bill and the classified       Schedule of Authorizations.        The Committees view direction and recommendations, whether       contained in the Explanatory Statement or in the Agreement,       as requiring compliance by the Executive Branch.            Part II: Statement Regarding Anomalous Health Incident         From the time the Committees received the first ``Havana       Syndrome'' reports, the Committees have focused intently on       the anomalous health incidents (``AHIs'') that have afflicted       United States Government personnel, including many in the       Intelligence Community (IC) and other United States       Government personnel. Provisions of the Act reflect that       continuing, bicameral and bipartisan effort.        The Biden Administration also has pursued its own       initiatives. As directed by Congress, it earlier this year       appointed a senior official, within the National Security       Council, to oversee the government's response to AHIs.       Additionally, in recent months, a widely-discussed assessment       concluded that a majority of reported AHIs can be explained       by medical conditions or environmental or technical factors,       and that it is unlikely that a foreign actor--including       Russia--is engaged in a sustained, global campaign involving       hundreds of incidents without detection. But the assessment       left other cases unexplained, including a small subset that       the IC continues to scrutinize most closely.        Around the same time, an IC panel of experts determined       that certain AHIs cannot be explained by environmental or       medical conditions, but could be due to external stimuli.       While acknowledging important information gaps, the panel       further determined that pulsed electromagnetic energy--and,       in some cases, ultrasound--plausibly might explain AHIs' core       characteristics; and that psychosocial factors alone could       not account for those characteristics, though they might       cause some other incidents or contribute to long-term       symptoms.        These findings advance the United States' understanding of       AHIs. But these findings are also heavily qualified,       tentative, and based on a developing and incomplete body of       evidence and scientific and medical knowledge. Most       important, as the Committees wish to stress, these recent       developments do not justify shifting the Executive Branch's       AHI-related activities into a lower gear, or discrediting the       reports of AHI victims.        The core work on AHIs--to include examination of a       potential role by one or more foreign actors--must continue       apace. As with prior inquiries into complex and murky       intelligence problems, unraveling the AHI mystery fully may       take time. It might be years before the United States reaches       definitive conclusions about exactly who, or what, is behind       AHIs.        The Administration has acknowledged that a great deal       remains to be done. Indeed, much more evidence will have to       be gathered. Plausible theories regarding responsibility for       AHIs will have to be weighed against a record that will grow       and change over time, and potentially may have to be       revisited if circumstances warrant. And no plausible theory       should be ruled out or downplayed prematurely.        Success will depend on many factors. Among other things, it       will be important to have a well-resourced cadre of ``cross-      cleared'' individuals, at all relevant IC elements and other       Executive Branch organizations, who can readily review and       analyze all relevant intelligence and information, and       without hindrances. The Committees long have emphasized this,       with respect to AHi and many other priority intelligence       matters. However, the Executive Branch has yet to take all       necessary steps, to do away with excessive compartmentation       and unnecessary bureaucracy; and to ensure that, for AHi and       for other vital missions, the right people consistently and       easily can access necessary information. That will have to       change.        Treatment also must remain a matter of highest priority.       All AHi victims must be encouraged to file prompt reports of       their experiences, and without fear of being disbelieved or       dismissed. They and their families must receive the highest       quality medical and  [[Page S1149]]       other care and must receive that care immediately. Thus far,       some bureaucratic roadblocks to the provision of care have       been removed--but there is no excuse for any to remain. They       must be dismantled. And new ones must not be erected.        Above all, there can be no slowing down, in the       investigation into AHIs and in the treatment of AHI victims       and their families. To do so would risk signaling--to those       individuals, to the broader IC workforce, and to the wider       world--that, though it prioritized the issue most highly for       a discrete time, the United States is ``moving on'' from       AHIs.        That cannot be allowed to happen. And the Committees will       continue to conduct vigorous oversight, to prevent it from       happening.                Part III: Unclassified Congressional Direction         This Joint Explanatory Statement incorporates by reference,       and the Executive Branch shall comply with, all direction       contained in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence       Report to accompany the Intelligence Authorization Act for       Fiscal Year 2022 (S. Rept. 117-37) and in the House Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence Report to accompany the       Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (H. Rept.       117-156).        The Executive Branch is further directed as follows:      Assessment of Intelligence Community Counternarcotics           Capabilities        The Committees direct the Director of National       Intelligence, in consultation with such other Federal       Government entities as the Director determines appropriate,       to submit an assessment to the congressional intelligence       committees within 120 days of enactment of this Act, on the       status of the Intelligence Community's (1) counternarcotics       capabilities and resourcing with regard to intelligence       collection and analysis; (2) operational support to foreign       liaison partners; and (3) operational capacity to support the       counteractions mission of the Federal Government.

The report shall       be submitted in unclassified form but may include a       classified annex, as necessary.      Assessment and Report on Interagency Communication Relating           to Efforts to Address Anomalous Health Incidents        The Committees direct the Director of National Intelligence       to (1) conduct an assessment of how the various elements of       the Intelligence Community are coordinating or collaborating       with each other and with elements of the Federal Government       that are not part of the Intelligence Community in their       efforts to address anomalous health incidents, and (2) submit       a report to the congressional intelligence committees within       180 days of enactment of this Act on the findings of the       Director with respect to the assessment. The report submitted       pursuant to subsection shall be submitted in unclassified       form, but may include a classified annex.      Reporting on Occurrence of Anomalous Health Incidents        The Committees direct that, whenever the head of an element       of the Intelligence Community becomes aware of a report of an       anomalous health incident occurring among the employees or       contractors of the element, no later than 90 days after each       incident, the head of the element shall submit to the       congressional intelligence committees a brief report on the       reported incident. The Committees further direct that this       reporting requirement shall cease upon joint notice from the       congressional intelligence committees to the Director of       National Intelligence.

Cyber attacks and ransomware  attacks are a serious national security threat that have affected  everything from our energy sector to the Federal Government and  Americans' own sensitive information. The SolarWinds breach  demonstrated how broad the ripple effects of these attacks can be,  affecting hundreds or even thousands of entities connected to the  initial target. As cyber and ransomware attacks continue to increase,  the Federal Government must be able to quickly coordinate a response  and hold bad actors accountable.   Especially now, as the threat of Russian cyber attacks looms in light  of Putin's horrific invasion of Ukraine, we shouldn't be relying on  voluntary reporting to protect our crucial infrastructure. The Federal  Government needs to know when vital sectors of our economy are affected  by a breach so that the full resources of the Federal Government can be  mobilized to respond and mitigate their impacts.   This bipartisan bill will take significant steps to strengthen  cybersecurity protections, ensure that CISA is at the forefront of our  Nation's response to serious breaches, and most importantly, require  timely reporting of these attacks to the Federal Government so that we  can better prevent future incidents and hold attackers accountable.   The plain text of the statute makes Congress' intent clear: although  the reports themselves--and any ``communication[s], document[s],  material[s], or other record[s] created for the sole purpose of  preparing, drafting or submitting'' those reports--may not be received  in evidence, the FBI and other law enforcement entities nevertheless  may, as appropriate,  [[Page S1150]]  make use of reported information in their investigations of a cyber  incident. In other words, the FBI cannot attach the report filed with  CISA in a warrant application or submit it in evidence in a trial but,  if provided information from reports under the process outlined in the  statute, may as appropriate use information contained in the reports  and derived from them for a range of purposes, including getting a  warrant and prosecuting bad actors. Further, this statute also is not  intended to prohibit or discourage entities from reporting to CISA and  law enforcement concurrently.   The language of this bill makes clear that the information may be  used for cybersecurity or investigative purposes. Section 2245 clearly  states that reports submitted to CISA under this provision can be used  for ``the purpose of preventing, investigating, disrupting, or  prosecuting an offense arising out of a cyber incident reported  pursuant to [the bill's requirements or voluntary provisions].'' Nor  are facts developed during an FBI investigation of the relevant cyber  incident using other authorities, including similar facts that may also  have been disclosed to the Federal Government in the report to CISA,  ``communication[s], document[s], material[s], or other record[s]''  subject to the evidentiary restrictions in 2245(c)(3).   Such actions by the FBI to hold accountable, disrupt, or deter  perpetrators of cyber attacks are consistent with our goal of  encouraging entities to disclose cyber incidents to CISA, which will  share the information appropriately with other Federal agencies. As  stakeholders work through the rulemaking process, we look forward to  working with them to ensure that congressional intent is not  misinterpreted and that this legislation is implemented as intended.   This balance ensures both that entities are encouraged to and feel  protected in disclosing cyber incidents and that law enforcement  agencies may make full use of evidence, gathered through a variety of  means, needed to detect, disrupt, and deter perpetrators of attacks.                            ____________________
