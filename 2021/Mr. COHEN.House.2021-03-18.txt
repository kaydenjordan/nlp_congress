 Madam Speaker, when we came to Congress, my class of 2006  was offered the opportunity to go to Harvard University for a seminar.  We were told there that one of the greatest problems facing this  country was the lack of workers, that our birthrate was declining, and  that we need more people to come to this country and more workers to  supply our workforce and our economy. Those situations have not gotten  better.   These Dreamers are trained in America. They have been educated in  America. They are talented. They are smart. We are not only doing the  right thing by giving them this pathway to citizenship, but we are  doing the right thing for America because we need their talent to make  this country even greater.   That is why I support the Dreamers act.
