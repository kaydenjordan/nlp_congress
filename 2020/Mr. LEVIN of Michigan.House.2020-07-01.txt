 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the  coronavirus is winning. There are 2.5 million U.S. cases and more than  126,000 Americans dead. That is more than double the number of American  lives lost during the Korean war, tens of thousands more than the two- decade Vietnam war, and 10,000 more than World War I.   The United States has 4.25 percent of the world's population but 25  percent of the COVID-19 deaths. Tens of millions of Americans have lost  their jobs or faced pay cuts. And in the coming weeks, economic  lifelines passed by Congress that have cushioned the blows are going to  expire.   It does not have to be this way. Right now, as I speak, the Senate is  sitting on the HEROES Act, a bill that Majority Leader McConnell has  refused to consider for more than 45 days.   What could have been done in those 45 days?   Moody's Analytics said: ``If quickly passed into law, the HEROES Act  would provide a substantial boost to the economy during the second half  of this year, when the economy is most vulnerable to the pandemic and  at most risk of sliding back into recession. The legislation would also  return the economy to full employment much more quickly.''   Moody's also said: ``How well the economy does in the next several  years depends critically on what lawmakers decide to do in the next few  weeks.''   That was more than a week ago, yet the Senate still refuses to pass a  bill that puts money in the pockets of workers with a second round of  direct payments to families, a bill with new payroll protection  measures to keep 60 million workers connected with their jobs, a bill  that extends weekly $600 Federal unemployment benefits through next  January so families can pay their bills.   But HEROES isn't just a bill to provide relief from the pandemic; it  is a bill to end it. HEROES contains $75 billion for more COVID-19  testing and contact tracing and $500 million to help our workforce  system place new contact tracers, focusing specifically on Americans  who are out of work and drawing from the communities they will work in  with the diversity reflecting those unique communities and the language  competencies necessary to serve them.   This last part is so important and a core piece of my Coronavirus  Containment Corps Act, my bill with Senator Warren that is included in  the HEROES Act in substantial part.   Last week, Dr. Fauci said that U.S. contact tracing isn't going well.  Why? Well, Dr. Redfield, the CDC Director, says that we have 27,000 or  28,000 contact tracers when we need, in his own estimation, 100,000,  and when other experts believe we may need double that.  [[Page H2990]]    We have public health departments that are underfunded. We have  communities that, after decades of discrimination, are understandably  weary of trusting health authorities. The Coronavirus Containment Core  Act addresses every one of those issues. We have solutions ready. No  single one of the solutions is a cure-all, but, together, they can turn  the tide of this pandemic.   We as Members of this body are in a unique and privileged position to  develop solutions that channel the resources we need to implement those  solutions on a nationwide scale. To fail to do this is to accept the  status quo.   Let's make the HEROES Act law. There is not a minute to waste.                            ____________________
