 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the nearly 3,000 souls  that were taken from us much too soon on September 11, 16 years ago.   Like many others, the events of September 11, 2001, are forever  etched in my memory. On that day, I was in Raleigh, North Carolina,  serving in the State legislature, and recall an aide coming in to share  the news.   Naturally, when hearing about the first plane hitting the World Trade  Center, we all thought it was a terrible accident that had occurred. My  colleagues and I were in a state of shock and grief when we heard about  the second plane and the subsequent attacks that followed.   What I remember most is the feeling of abject horror and disbelief  that we experienced on that day. That horror is still felt by the  family members who were left behind, robbed of their loved ones who  were violently taken too soon.   I often think of the brave first responders who ran towards danger  with thought of little else other than to save their fellow Americans.   The terror attacks seemed surreal, yet the aftermath has a finality  which does not dissipate with time. As years passed, the shock of the  attack has diminished, but the memory of the feeling of hope that arose  from the acts of selfless Americans is stronger.   In my mind, one of the very worst events in human history became  overshadowed as the very best in us--as a people--was made evident  through countless acts of kindness and dignity. It is this dignity we  must hold on to in order to honor the fallen.   From the first responders, citizens, volunteers, and, finally, the  devoted souls on board Flight 93, I remember the moments in which the  very best parts of Americans shone brightest. These moments include  when our citizens were no longer categorized by their differences, but  were defined by their shared determination not only to survive, but  also to overcome an unthinkable tragedy.   If a student asks me about my memories of September 11, I always tell  them honestly of the horror I felt, and I tell them of the hope that  emerged as our people did their level best to turn evil into good.   While I will never forget September 11, 2001, and the lives that were  forever lost to us on that day, 16 years ago, I take some comfort in  knowing that a loving and never-changing God called them to Heaven to  live in His presence forever.   Now, more than ever before, we must recall the sacrifices made by so  many in the aftermath of September 11 and recall that freedom is never  truly freely given. It is earned. It is hard-fought for, and it is  something we must all work together to continue to achieve.   May God bless all of those who lost their lives on September 11,  those who were left behind, and those who continue to fight for our  freedom.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from the Education and  the Workforce Committee, Mr. Lewis, for offering this amendment.   At a time when U.S. job openings are at a record 6.2 million, America  faces a skills shortage. Employers all over the country tell us they  need more employees who are skilled.   I have said this before, and I will say it again for so long as I am  here: All education is career education.   I am a former TRIO director. I am not opposed to TRIO.   This is not an effort to diminish access to baccalaureate degrees,  but to give priority to programs that are helping Americans learn the  skills they need for good, high-paying jobs.   Research has shown that graduates with a technical or applied  sciences associate's degree outearn baccalaureate degree holders by  between $2,000 and $11,000.   Earlier this year, the House passed the Strengthening Career and  Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. That bill and this  amendment are important steps to make sure all Americans have access to  an education that helps them develop the skills they need to have a  successful life.   I am proud to support this amendment.
