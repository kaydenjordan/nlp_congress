 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 1.   I stand before you like everybody in this Chamber who is a father and  a grandfather, somebody who wants to leave this Earth better than we  found it.                                time  1430    Some in the past have argued that we must sacrifice affordable energy  and reliable energy so that we can be clean. We have seen Europe go  down this path. They pushed back on fracking, and they pushed back on  nuclear power. Today, they buy fracked fuel from an enemy.   We have been told that we must give up affordability and reliability  so that we can be clean. This is a false choice, and H.R. 1 is a path  to affordable, reliable, and clean energy.   Let's be honest. The U.S. energy sector is not the enemy. They are  the answer to our energy future.   I ask my colleagues, why do you hate fossil fuels?   Let's hate emissions. Let's hate the emissions and not the source.   This is why H.R. 1 is so important. It is an opportunity to  accomplish all three of these goals.   At its core, H.R. 1 is about responsibly building America's energy  infrastructure.   The rest of the world is dying for American energy. We can replace  dirty Russian, Venezuelan, and Iranian petroleum products. We can  reduce more emissions than any proposal on the left simply by using  U.S. energy products.   H.R. 1 pushes back on the narrative that has been spun about  Republicans not caring about the Earth. More importantly, without the  permitting reforms in H.R. 1, none of us can accomplish our climate or  energy goals.
