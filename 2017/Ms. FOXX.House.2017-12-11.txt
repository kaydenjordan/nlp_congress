 Mr. Speaker, as we approach Christmas, many of us consider  the season of giving and some also think of Christmas cookies. Equally,  when many consider giving back, or cookies, they think of the Girl  Scouts. However, Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that Girl Scouts  do more than sell cookies. They actively work to improve their  communities all year long.   Five Girl Scouts in Watauga County recently received the bronze and  silver awards for outstanding community service. A few troops earned  awards for redecorating a library reading cave to encourage classmates  to spend more time learning. Another Girl Scout taught a free dance  class so that children who couldn't afford lessons wouldn't miss out.  Last, one Girl Scout sought to help end hunger in Watauga County. She  wrote thank-you cards to sponsors that provided funds for healthy  Thanksgiving meals to feed the hungry.   These young women are a credit to their parents and to our  communities. I congratulate these young women on their well-earned  awards, and I look forward to their continued success.                            ____________________
