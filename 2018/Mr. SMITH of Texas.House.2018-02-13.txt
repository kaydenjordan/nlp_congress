 Mr. Speaker, Gallup recently polled Americans on  their perceptions of the news media. The poll revealed that 43 percent  of Americans have a negative view of the media, 10 percent more than  who have a positive view. Two-thirds said that the news media does not  do a good job of separating fact from fiction. More than half said they  couldn't think of one objective news source.   These are remarkable findings and yet unsurprising. The liberal news  media has abandoned objective, fact-based reporting and is, instead,  pushing a liberal agenda. Their partisan-driven news only tells one  side of the story: their side. The liberal media has made it their  mission to attack the President and Republicans on a daily basis at the  expense of the facts.   Americans know it when they see it. This is a liberal, partisan  agenda masquerading as journalism. Until the news returns to objective  reporting, Americans will continue to view them negatively.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank  the gentleman from Kansas, Dr. Roger Marshall, the vice chairman of the  Subcommittee on Research and Technology, for yielding me time on his  bill, H.R. 4675, the Low-Dose Radiation Research Act of 2018.   H.R. 4675, cosponsored by Representative Dan Lipinski, Energy  Subcommittee Chairman Randy Weber, and Dr. Neal Dunn, authorizes a  revitalized low-dose radiation research program within the Biological  and Environmental Research program of the Department of Energy. This  basic research is part of the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee's continued effort to ensure America remains a leader in  foundational science and innovation.   The DOE low-dose radiation basic research program will analyze and  seek to determine any health impacts of low levels of radiation,  providing critical knowledge to our Nation's researchers, industry,  healthcare community, and military as they handle nuclear material,  maintain the Nation's nuclear weapons program, provide medical  treatment, and dispose of nuclear waste.   Low-dose radiation research can benefit regulatory agencies that set  nuclear safety standards for the public. This will enable Federal  emergency response agencies to more accurately set areas of evacuation  for radiological incidents.   The research is also of particular importance to physicians, who rely  on a thorough knowledge of radiation health risks to determine when and  how to use lifesaving diagnostics to detect and deter and treat cancer  in patients.   I thank Vice Chairman Marshall for his initiative in developing and  managing this important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to  support this bipartisan bill.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I continue to  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. Hultgren) for yielding me time on his bill, H.R. 4377, the  Accelerating American Leadership in Science Act.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation, cosponsored by Representative Bill  Foster, Energy Subcommittee Chairman Randy Weber, Energy Subcommittee  Vice Chairman Steve Knight, and Representative Dan Lipinski,  authorizes funding from within the DOE's Office of Science's existing  budget to complete construction of three science infrastructure  projects.    The bill authorizes upgrades to the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne  National Lab and the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National  Laboratory.   It also funds the construction of the Long-Baseline Neutrino  Facility, which will be the premier international facility in high- energy physics.   The Advanced Photon Source is one of the most advanced radiation  research facilities in the world. It produces ultrabright, high-energy  X-ray beams that allow scientists to study the structure and behavior  of materials, which enables the development of new technologies and  pharmaceuticals.   The upgrade authorized at Argonne in the Hultgren bill will use new  technology to increase the brightness of photon beams, allowing  researchers to observe materials at extremely small scales.   The Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory is a  one-of-a-kind neutron scattering facility that provides the most  intense pulsed neutron beams in the world for scientific research and  industrial development.   This source of brighter, more intense neutrons enables scientists to  make sensitive measurements in complex environments with higher  resolution and speed than any existing neutron facility.   H.R. 4377 authorizes a power upgrade and a second target station to  build on the success of the Spallation Neutron Source. The proton power  upgrade will double the energy of the beam. The second target station  will double the number of beam lines at the facility, significantly  expanding the number of instrument stations and opportunities for  cutting-edge neutron scattering research at Oak Ridge.   Combined, the authorized enhancements to the Advanced Photon Source  and Spallation Neutron Source will allow these research tools to reach  [[Page H1094]]  their full potential and provide for world-leading Basic Energy  Sciences programs here in the U.S.   Representative Hultgren's bill also authorizes the Long-Baseline  Neutrino Facility at Fermilab, a national accelerator lab. The LBNF  will consist of the world's highest intensity neutrino beam and a suite  of cryogenic near detectors to run the Deep Underground Neutrino  Experiment. This experiment will measure the neutrino beam generated at  LBNF on innovative, far detectors located 800 miles away at the Sanford  Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Hultgren for his initiative in  developing this legislation. His longstanding support of basic research  and investments in these best-in-the-world science facilities is well  known. H.R. 4377 is a commonsense bill that maintains American  leadership in discovery science.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank the  gentleman from Texas, the chairman of the Energy Subcommittee,  Representative Randy Weber, for yielding me time on his bill, which is  H.R. 4378, the Nuclear Energy Research Infrastructure Act.   H.R. 4378, cosponsored by full committee Ranking Member Eddie Bernice  Johnson, Energy Subcommittee Vice Chairman Steve Knight, Representative  Dan Lipinski, and Representative Randy Hultgren, authorizes funds  within the DOE Nuclear Energy budget to construct their versatile  neutron source, a DOE fast neutron user facility that will facilitate  the development of the next generation of nuclear reactors by the  private sector.   This legislation builds on and implements Chairman Weber's Nuclear  Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, which passed the House three times  with bipartisan support in the last Congress.   Advanced nuclear reactor technology provides the best opportunity to  make reliable, emission-free electricity available throughout the  industrial and developing world. This user facility will ensure that  U.S. companies develop critical advanced reactor technology here in the  United States.   Today, the only source of fast neutrons available for civilian  research is in Russia, making it impossible for American entrepreneurs  to conduct the testing and validation needed to deploy commercial  advanced reactors.   America must also maintain our edge in nuclear science in order to  influence global nonproliferation standards. The user facility  authorized in this legislation will ensure the next generation of  nuclear technology is safely developed here at home. This allows  America to export nuclear technology which helps prevent civilian  nuclear energy technology from being misused for weapons development  overseas.   I want to thank this bill's cosponsors, Chairman Weber and Ranking  Member Johnson, for their longstanding support of nuclear energy  innovation and commitment to ensure that we have the best nuclear  research facilities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It is  a bipartisan piece of legislation.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas, the  Energy Subcommittee chairman, for those nice comments and for yielding  me time on this bill.   H.R. 4376, the Department of Energy Research Infrastructure Act, is  an important piece of legislation introduced by Congressman Steve  Knight from California.   The Department of Energy is the leading sponsor of basic research in  the physical sciences, and DOE national labs host over 30,000  researchers each year. To maintain America's global leadership in  scientific discovery, we must ensure our user facilities are the best  in the world.   This bill is also cosponsored by Representative Dan Lipinski, Energy  Subcommittee Chairman Randy Weber, and Representative Randy Hultgren,  and it authorizes funding from within the DOE Office of Science's  existing budget to complete construction of three science  infrastructure projects.   The bill provides for upgrades to the Advanced Light Source at  Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and to the Linac Coherent Light Source  at the National Accelerator Laboratory at Stanford University.   The Knight bill also authorizes and directs the construction of the  Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State University through  the DOE nuclear physics program.   All together, the enhanced capabilities made possible by this bill  provide significant breakthroughs in discovery science and maintain  America's high-tech leadership.   I thank the Energy Subcommittee chairman and the gentleman from  California (Mr. Knight) for their initiatives in developing and  managing this legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to support the  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman  from California, a member of the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee, for yielding me time on this particular piece of  legislation.   I do support H.R. 3397, the Building Blocks of STEM Act, introduced  by Representative Jacky Rosen and Representative Steve Knight, the  Energy Subcommittee vice chairman.   The bill will help boost our ability to get young people interested  in STEM subjects. America lags behind many other nations when it comes  to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. American students  are ranked 19th in science and 31st in math out of 35 industrialized  nations, the bottom half in both. This is not the educational record of  a country that wants to compete globally.   We must encourage our Nation's youth to study science and engineering  so they will want to pursue these careers.   More graduates with STEM degrees means more advanced technologies and  a more robust economy. A well-educated and trained STEM workforce  promotes our future economic prosperity.   These graduates have the potential to develop technologies that could  save thousands of lives, jump-start a new industry, or even discover  new worlds.   H.R. 3397 directs the National Science Foundation to more equitably  allocate funding for research in studies that focus on early childhood.  Investing in young students seeks to lay the groundwork to interest  them in STEM in their formative years.   The bill also directs the National Science Foundation to develop  scalable models to increase young girls' participation in computer  science. Despite representing nearly half of the college-educated and  total U.S. workforce, women account for less than 25 percent of  America's STEM workforce.   In the last Congress, my bill, the STEM Education Act of 2015, was  signed into law. That bipartisan legislation expanded the Federal  definition of STEM to include computer science. H.R. 3397 continues the  bipartisan commitment of the House Science, Space, and Technology  Committee to promote computer science as a part of STEM by adding  computer science to the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program.    I thank Representative Jacky Rosen and Representative Steve Knight  for working together on this bill. I also thank the chairwoman of the  Research and Technology Subcommittee, Mrs. Comstock, for her work to  improve the underlying legislation by offering the Supporting Girls in  STEM Education and Computer Science amendment.   Including today's five research bills, 20 of the 22 bills the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee has brought to the House floor  this Congress have been bipartisan pieces of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these five bipartisan  bills.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as  she may consume to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Rosen).
