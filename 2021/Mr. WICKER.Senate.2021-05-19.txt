 Mr. President, the 21st century will be shaped by the  outcome of the strategic competition between the United States and  China. Like our Nation's previous contest with the Soviet Union, the  outcome of this great contest will help determine the world that our  children and our grandchildren live in.   There are only two real possibilities: Either the United States will  remain the preeminent global superpower or we will be replaced by  China. This truth is recognized on both sides of the aisle in this  body. The contest between our two countries will involve every aspect  of national life--including military might, diplomatic skill, economic  strength, and the deepest values that shape our societies.   The scope and complexity of this challenge calls for bold action, and  that is what the Endless Frontier Act is about. This week the Senate  has an opportunity to come together on a bipartisan basis and move  forward on legislation, now known as the United States Innovation and  Competition Act. This will make our Nation more economically  competitive, improve protections for U.S. intellectual property and  research, and keep us a step ahead of China in this area of high-stakes  competition.   This bill does so by increasing research at the National Science  Foundation and dramatically increasing R&D at a new National Science  Foundation directorate. Other Agencies in the Federal Government will  also see dramatic increases in the important research that they  perform.   The Endless Frontier Act, as reported by the Commerce Committee, is a  major part of this comprehensive legislative effort. Other committees  have also been important partners in this legislation. In particular, I  congratulate Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member Risch of the Foreign  Relations Committee for producing the Strategic Competition Act, which  was reported out of their committee on a 21-to-1 vote.   I also commend Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman  Peters and Ranking Member Portman; Banking Committee Chairman Brown and  Ranking Member Toomey; Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee  Chair Murray and Ranking Member Burr; and Judiciary Chair Durbin and  Ranking Member Grassley for their importan contributions to the  substitute product.    I will focus my remarks on the Commerce Committee's contributions to  the Endless Frontier Act. Last week, the Commerce Committee held a  markup to consider this legislation. We considered hundreds of  amendments and adopted over 100 of them into the reported bill,  including over 20 bipartisan, separately introduced bills. The markup  at times was challenging, but in the end the bill passed the committee  on a bipartisan 24-to-4 vote.   The Endless Frontier Act will enhance U.S. science and technology  leadership through key investments in R&D, regional economic  development, and manufacturing.   The bill will accomplish these goals in the following ways: First, it  will preserve the core basic research mission of the National Science  Foundation. The NSF is the world's gold standard for funding basic  research, a sector that fuels new waves of innovation across our  society. Basic research answers the fundamental questions of scientific  inquiry needed to develop major innovations. The internet, GPS, cell  phones, and many other breakthrough technologies have their origins in  National Science Foundation-funded research. The Endless Frontier Act  will authorize funding increases in NSF's core science portfolio to  support the most promising research proposals. That is the first thing.   Secondly, this bill will establish a new Directorate of Technology  and Innovation at the NSF to drive faster innovation in key technology  focus areas, such as artificial intelligence, or AI, and robotics. We  included strong coordination measures to ensure that programs at the  new Technology Directorate do not duplicate R&D programs of other  Federal Agencies, such as the Department of Energy. These provisions  are designed to ensure the wise  [[Page S2755]]  expenditure of taxpayer dollars by preventing bureaucratic turf wars,  which can slow down innovation.   Third, this legislation will protect intellectual property and  research from foreign governments--most notably, China. The Endless  Frontier Act will establish a research security office at the NSF and  create a clearinghouse to share information about security risks. It  also puts forward policies to protect controlled information, including  a plan for background checks on researchers.   In addition, it will take critical steps to guard against Chinese  intellectual property theft by prohibiting NSF funds from going to  researchers who are part of a Chinese talent program or an institution  with formal ties to a Confucius Institute. This is a new and important  step.   Fourth, this bill will reduce the geographic concentration of R&D in  a handful of States and universities. Put simply, this bill will be a  game changer for the R&D geographic diversity that many of us have  sought for years, if not decades. America can maintain our leadership  over China only with a sustained effort that is national in scope. We  should tap into the wide-ranging talents, expertise, and capabilities  of Americans across this land, including Nevada and Mississippi.   The Endless Frontier Act will help address these long-standing  disparities by increasing funding for the Established Program to  Stimulate Competitive Research, which we have all come to know as  EPSCoR. Participation in EPSCoR helps institutions in many States and  Territories improve their research capacities and, therefore, compete  more effectively for Federal R&D funding. The legislation also invests  in minority serving institutions and builds up research capacity in  emerging institutions, which have traditionally received a relatively  small share of Federal research dollars.   No. 5, this bill will boost regional economic development through the  Regional Technology Hub Program.   No. 6, it will support manufacturing programs, in part, by  quadrupling the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program, which  already exists.   No. 7, it will help America win the ``New Space Race'' against China  by including the NASA Authorization Act, which the Senate passed  unanimously last year. The NASA bill allows Congress to set priorities  and guardrails for the space Agency's exploration and research  programs.   No. 8, this bill will authorize a number of telecommunication  programs to improve our telecom workforce and help get all Americans  connected to high-speed and reliable broadband.   This bill also includes several bills that I have championed,  including the Rural STEM Education Act, the Advanced Technological  Manufacturing Act, the Improving Minority Participation and Careers in  Telecommunications Act, and the Telecommunications Supply Chain  Diversity Promotion Act--significant legislation and a mouthful, too.   Overall, this is a strong bill, but it can be made better. As I  mentioned at the Commerce Committee's markup last week, although the  bill reported out of the committee makes important changes to the  underlying bill, I regret the rushed process that was followed.   The underlying bill was introduced on April 20, just under a month  ago. Only yesterday, Senate Majority Leader Schumer laid down a 1,400- page substitute that not only includes the Endless Frontier Act, but  major legislation from the Foreign Relations, Homeland Security,  Banking, HELP, and Judiciary Committees. Now known as the U.S.  Innovation and Competition Act--USICA, I suppose--this legislation will  make significant changes to our innovation ecosystem and the missions  of our Federal Agencies.   A bill of this magnitude would normally take a year to write and  involve soliciting input from Members and stakeholders across our  country to craft a consensus package. Clearly, the Senate should  consider this bill with an open amendment process.   Prematurely shutting down debate on amendments without this open  process would send a false signal to China and the American people that  we are divided in an area where, actually, we are united and together.   And then, when all is said and done, the effort will have to be paid  for and will be subject to appropriations.   I hope the majority's determination to rush this legislation through  the Senate is not designed to use a partisan reconciliation bill to  appropriate funding for these important initiatives. Science has always  been debated in a bipartisan way in this body. Leaving one party on the  sidelines in the appropriation process, which I hope will not happen,  would have a detrimental consequences for the long-term stability of  this legislation.   So on the whole, I am positive and optimistic about this bill and  about the process that will get us to the end of both parties' desire.   I thank my colleague, Senator Cantwell, for her work as chair of the  Commerce Committee to get this bill on the floor today, and I look  forward to working with her to improve the bill in the next step in the  process--an open amendment process                            ____________________     Madam President, my friend from Ohio is correct. In many  respects, it ought to feel like morning again in America. After all,  COVID-19 is finally on the retreat. The vaccines have been a roaring  success because of Operation Warp Speed. One hundred and twenty-four  million Americans are now fully immunized, and another 30 million are  halfway there. With the exception of a few holdout States, the mask  mandates are gone, thank goodness. By all measures, our economy should  be firing on all cylinders, but America now has a workforce problem.  People are not heading back to work.   In February, the Congressional Budget Office predicted our economy  would return to its prepandemic size by the middle of the year without  receiving any new stimulus from Congress. Regrettably, Democrats in  this Chamber brushed off that optimism from the CBO. They decided to  pass more stimulus, to the tune of $1.9 trillion.   This time, the money was excessive. It was poorly targeted and passed  without bipartisan consensus. Three months later, the results are  unflattering for my Democratic friends. Last month, our economy  produced a paltry 266,000 jobs when experts had predicted over 1  million jobs--this at a time when our economy has a record 8 million  jobs available, jobs that need to be filled.   Small businesses are desperate to hire. Restaurants, for instance,  are having trouble finding people to become waiters and chefs. The  National Restaurant Association reports that, in January, 8 percent of  restaurant operators said finding and keeping workers was their No. 1  concern. That number doubled in February. It doubled again in March and  then again in April. According to the latest survey, 57 percent of  restaurant operators now say that finding and keeping employees is  their biggest problem. The same problem exists across multiple  sectors--hotels, construction, lawn care, welding, tech. The list goes  on.   Americans would be streaming back into the workforce if not for the  counterproductive policies passed by the majority. Government is now  paying millions of able-bodied Americans to stay home, to stay home  when they could be back on the job. Expanded unemployment benefits have  become a hindrance to our recovery rather than a help, just as many of  us had warned.   March 2020 was a unique moment of emergency that called for urgent  financial relief for the American people. This body passed it on a  sweeping bipartisan basis. But it is now May of 2021. The hour of  emergency has passed. Americans need policies to help them reenter the  workforce.   Fortunately, millions of Americans have Governors who are pushing  back against Washington's pay-to-stay-at-home policies. Governor Tate  Reeves, in my State of Mississippi, is one example. I commend Governor  Reeves for opting out of the expanded Federal unemployment funds in  order to help our State embark on a full recovery. Nearly half of all  Governors now share the same mind and are saying no to those  unnecessary funds.   Madam President, the American people elected a 50-50 Senate and a  narrowly divided House. They do not want drastic changes or dramatic  growth of government. They simply want to put this pandemic behind them  and get back to providing for their families.    Americans need government to get out of the way, and Republicans  stand with the American people and on the side of a full recovery.   I yield the floor.    Reserving the right to object--and I shall certainly not  object--I simply want to say that this is the beginning of what I hope  is an open amendment process, and I want to thank the chair of the  Commerce Committee for working with us to get these first two amendment  votes scheduled this afternoon. And I certainly withdraw my  reservation.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
