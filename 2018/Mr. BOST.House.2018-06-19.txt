 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome Dr. Ron Bracy as our  guest chaplain.   Dr. Bracy has served our Nation in uniform and through his faith. He  entered the Air Force Academy after high school and served in the U.S.  Air Force for 42 years.   Dr. Bracy is a veteran of the Vietnam war, where he flew 183 combat  missions and was on duty in the Pentagon during the 9/11 terrorist  attack.   He is a retired minister and author of ``Walk On: From the Valley of  Despair to the Mountaintop of Praise.''   He has taught at all levels of education, and currently teaches at  the Geneva Classical Christian School in Texas.   Dr. Bracy was my family pastor for many years. He and his wife,  Judith, are truly loved.   We are incredibly blessed to have Dr. Bracy here with us today.                            ____________________
