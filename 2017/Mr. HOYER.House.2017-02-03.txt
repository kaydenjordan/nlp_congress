 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy), the majority leader and my friend, for the purposes of  inquiring of the schedule for the week to come.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        February 3, 2017, on page H958, the following appeared:  Mr.  Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCARTHY),  the majority leader and my friend, for the purposes of inquiring  of the schedule for the week to come.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the schedule of  regulations to come. I am sure we will have some discussions about that  next week. In fact, we are going to have some discussions about all of  these regulations which we believe reduce the protections, according to  the American people, by a number of the regulations that are sought to  be repealed.   However, first, Mr. Speaker, let me note that, first of all, we have  another Ben in Maryland. He is the senior Senator, a former colleague  of ours, Ben Cardin. He had a TV ad which ended with ``My Friend,  Ben.''   I want to say hi to my friend Ben, who has--indeed, as all of you  know, I think the staff that serve with us make such an extraordinarily  positive difference, and they sometimes--or most of the time--rise  above what might be the partisan confrontation that Members have and  continue to try to reach consensus so that this institution will run  positively and well for the American people. Ben Howard has been one of  those people.   I know that Shuwanza Goff, who sits next to me and is my floor  director, has worked very positively with Ben through the years and  appreciates very much his working with us. Kelly also falls into that  category.   But Ben, we are going to miss you. I am sure that wherever you go,  you are going to advantage the enterprise that you associate with.  Olney, Maryland, is one of our thriving communities in Maryland. We are  always proud of our Marylanders, and they always do a good job.   So I will say to him, Godspeed. I don't want to wish Penn State a lot  of success, but, nevertheless, I do want to wish you a lot of success,  Ben. Thank you very much for your service.   Now let me move on to, perhaps, some subjects that we might not have  as much agreement on as we do have on Ben Howard and his quality and  the service he has given this institution.   One of the first acts of Congress, of course, as you know, Mr.  Leader, which was the plan, was to begin the reconciliation process to  repeal the Affordable Care Act. The budget resolution set a deadline of  January 27 for committees to report legislation repealing the law. It  is now the 3rd of February, and after voting 65 times to repeal the  ACA, House and Senate Republicans, Mr. Speaker, do not have, as far as  I know, and don't appear to have, a replacement and are, as I read in  the papers, Mr. Speaker, divided on the path forward.   Repealing the ACA without replacing it immediately will not only  cause 30 million Americans to lose their coverage, but it would  increase the cost for tens of millions more and would, I suggest,  disadvantage everybody who has insurance, and clearly those who do not  and would not have access.   Mark Meadows, who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, said: ``We need to  slow down the process so we can understand a little bit more the  specifics and the timetable of replacement votes and reconciliation  instructions. . . .''   That was in Politico on January 9 of this year.   Senator Bob Corker, in the Senate, said: ``There's more and more  concerns about not doing'' repeal and replace ``simultaneously. You  would think after 6 years, we would have a pretty good sense of what we  would like to do.''   We have not seen a repeal and replace bill. The President said it  ought to be done contemporaneously. Bob Corker and others have said it  ought to be done contemporaneously. We haven't seen it. So my question,  Mr. Majority Leader, is: Does the gentleman expect that if repeal does  move forward, that a replacement bill would be considered  simultaneously?   I yield to my friend.    I can clarify that for the gentleman.    I thank the gentleman.   We are not in agreement, Mr. Speaker. What we will be doing would be  180 degrees different. We would not be pretending that we are going to  repeal an Affordable Care Act that has been a success.   We do not agree, Mr. Speaker, that having 30 million Americans  insured that were not insured before the Affordable Care Act is a  failure. We do not agree that people with preexisting conditions who  can now get insurance is a failure. We do not agree that people who are  26 or younger being on their family's policy when they don't have a job  or alternative insurance is a failure. We do not agree that Americans  having the security that their insurance will not be canceled because  [[Page H960]]  they reached an annual limit is a failure. We do not agree that  Americans having no lifetime limit so that if they have a catastrophic  illness they will still have coverage--that is not a failure.   What is a failure is to have pretended for the last 6 years that they  wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and have no replacement as of  this time. That was a failure.   The President says, Mr. Speaker, that his plan is going to make sure  that everybody is insured, comprehensive coverage, and that costs will  come down. He, of course, Mr. Speaker, has now offered a bill to effect  that objective. We would welcome such a bill so that we can consider  it.   No, Mr. Speaker, had the 3 million additional people who voted for  Hillary Clinton more so than voted for Donald Trump prevailed--the  Electoral College prevailed, but the majority of the American people  that voted, the plurality, voted for policies to keep the Affordable  Care Act as Mrs. Clinton said she would do if she were elected.   So, Mr. Speaker, the majority leader is in deep error on we would be  having the same debate. But he is right; we had an outcome of a party  and a President who said they were going to repeal the Affordable Care  Act.   GOP Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers stated: ``Let me be  clear: no one who has coverage because of ObamaCare today will lose  that coverage.''   The majority leader said something about the President saying, if you  like your policy, you can keep it. In fact, the President was  substantially right on that. Yes. Were there minimum coverages so that  people weren't scammed by insurance companies saying you got insurance,  but, oh, by the way, we don't cover that, by the way, we don't cover  that? Have you seen those ads about, I bought a new car and I had a  wreck a day later and, guess what, the insurance company wants to give  me 80 percent, 90 percent, 70 percent less? That is what the insurance  companies were doing. People thought they had insurance for something,  and they didn't have it.   So Cathy McMorris Rodgers says you are not going to lose anything.  Well, I don't know. If it was so bad, why don't you repeal it? Why  don't you offer a bill to repeal it and to undermine all those factors  of the Affordable Care Act that are now available to the Americans that  I suggested?   President Trump--I said this, but I want to repeat it--said last  month that Republicans were nearing completion of an ACA replacement  that would provide insurance for everybody. Bring it on. Bring it on.  Insurance for everybody. Let's see it.   He went on to say his plan would have lower numbers, much lower  deductibles. God bless him. Bring it on. Let us see it. Let's vote on  it. It is not on the floor, and I am not sure when it will be on the  floor, but perhaps the majority leader could tell us.   My question to you is: When do you expect such a bill consistent with  the President's representation to the American people of everybody  having insurance and at lower cost and lower deductibles? When do we  expect a bill like that on the floor?   I yield to the majority leader.    I thank the majority leader for his comments.   I don't think he wants me to delve very deeply into why we do not  have a Secretary of Health and Human Services. It is because the  Republicans have not produced nor has the nominee produced full  disclosure, as the gentleman knows, of his financial dealings with  respect to legislation that he introduced and supported. They want full  information so that they can make a considered judgment. I won't go  further into that deep well, however.   I will say to the gentleman that you don't need a Secretary to bring  legislation to the floor, and this is not an issue that is new this  year or that is as a result of the November election of last year. It  is, frankly, after 65 votes on this floor, to repeal the Affordable  Care Act without having an alternative.   I will tell my friend, the majority leader, with great respect, you  have had 6 years. You can catalog all of the things that you think are  bad. Obviously, you don't mention any of the things that are good  except so many in your caucus--perhaps the overwhelming majority of the  caucus--say we are going to keep preexisting conditions, and we are  going to keep 26. Of course, we are not going to eliminate annual  limits, because that will hurt people and force them into bankruptcy. I  don't hear that discussion going on. But the fact of the matter is, Mr.  Leader, you cannot get away from the fact that 6 years have gone by  since we adopted the Affordable Care Act--6 years of complaining about  how awful it is.   By the way, as the gentleman knows, the majority of people now have  made it very clear they do not want to repeal the Affordable Care Act  unless they see a replacement on the table that they can consider and  look to for alternatives. And that, as you know, Mr. Leader, is the  first time in the 6 years because people said, ``yes, we don't like the  Affordable Care Act'' in a vacuum, but now, when it really may be  repealed, they are looking at it much more closely, and they don't know  what is going to replace it, and they are concerned.   I have, I will tell you, family after family after family--I had  somebody come up to me in the grocery store two nights ago, at Harris  Teeter--with tears in his eyes--who said: Don't let them repeal the  Affordable Care Act. I have a son who has a dire illness; and but for  the fact of the Affordable Care Act, he would not be covered, and we  couldn't keep him alive--with tears in his eyes.   So, when I hear you cataloging some of the things, those cases aren't  mentioned. The 30 million aren't mentioned. The preexisting condition  isn't mentioned.   I will say to my friend that you don't need a Secretary of Health and  Human Services to bring a bill forward.    Going to go to another subject, Mr. Leader, obviously, we  are very concerned about the Affordable Care Act, but we are also very  concerned--as we talked about executive  [[Page H961]]  orders on this refugee ban that were issued, according to almost  everybody, without much consultation with anybody other than within the  White House--of an order banning Muslim refugees from coming into this  country even after very strong vetting.   I know that the position is, oh, this is not a ban. The complication  you have to that representation is the President keeps mentioning it as  a ban, as he said he was going to do in the election, and he referred  to it as a ban just a few days ago. But I would point out to you, Mr.  Leader--and I am sure you know this--not a single terrorist act--not  one--has been perpetrated by a refugee coming into this country from  any one of the seven nations mentioned in the ban. We believe this is  not only contrary to the Constitution but that it is contrary to our  principles.   Let me make it clear, Mr. Leader, so that there is no confusion:  nobody on this side of the aisle doesn't want to make America's borders  secure, America's land and assets safe, and the American people safe.  Every one of us on this side of the aisle wants to make sure that that  happens, and we certainly want to make sure that the vetting is  appropriate. As the majority leader knows, the vetting today is a very  long and very careful process. We believe this ban alienates our allies  and emboldens terrorists who are now saying: See, this really is a war  on Islam.    That will not be consistent with the safety of our men and women whom  we have at the point of the spear and will not be consistent to the  safety and security of our allies in the Middle East.   Senators McCain and Graham have said exactly that.   They pointed out:   ``Our government has a responsibility to defend our borders, but we  must do so in a way that makes us safer and upholds all that is decent  and exceptional about our nation.'' This is John McCain and Lindsey  Graham. ``It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the  nation that President Trump's executive order was not properly  vetted.'' Senator Graham and Senator McCain, chairman of the Armed  Services Committee and the gentleman from South Carolina.   They go on:   ``We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into  effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State,  Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security. Such a hasty process risks  harmful results.'' This continues to be a quote by Senator McCain and  Senator Graham. ``Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become  a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.'' Senator McCain  knows something about increased risk.   He went on to say, along with Senator Graham:   ``This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America  does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this  executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve  our security.'' They said that on the 29th of January, just 4 days ago.   At least four times this week, Mr. Leader, we asked for the  consideration of H.R. 724, which rescinds and defunds the refugee ban.  The Speaker said, when he took office initially--and he repeated this  year--that we were going to have an open, transparent process and that  we would consider the important issues of the day on this floor, with  an opportunity for every Member of this House to offer alternatives.   I know the committee would not report it out, but this is a critical  issue to our country, to our safety, and to our values; and I ask the  gentleman:   Is there a possibility that you would bring to the floor next week or  the week thereafter--preferably next week--H.R. 724 so that the Members  of this House--the people's Representatives--could speak to this  critically important issue consistent with the observations of Senator  McCain and Senator Graham?   I yield to my friend.    I think that is an excellent quote, which I still agree  with.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask the gentleman from California to do  something?   The advice that the gentleman gives to his children about taking a  breath, perhaps before they tweet----    That is good advice as well.   Would you give that advice to the President of the United States and  tell him to take a breath before he makes policy or before he offends  our allies or before he creates great fear in those who hear what he  has to say off the cuff?   Yes, I understand that rhetoric counts. You might talk to him about  that as well. He is the one that calls this a ban. I know that  everybody else is trying to clean it up, and I hope that  [[Page H962]]  is the case. In fact, I have seen the head of Homeland Security,  Secretary Kelly, trying to clean it up.   It is a darn shame that it wasn't cleaned up before. It was a darned  shame that the time was not taken to do an order that would make sure  that vetting was appropriate, as my quote and our legislation that you  talked about urged.   It is good advice to your children and good advice to this President:  Take a breath. Just don't, as immediately it comes to mind, tweet it  and have the impact not known to you, your staff, or to the country.   Almost invariably, we have seen this has a negative effect.   I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comment. I  think we have demonstrated over the years that we ascribe to that  concept.   My point to you is, in the first 10 or 12 days of this  administration, that concept has been put at great risk. I think the  gentleman's advice is good, and we have pursued that.   I simply urge the gentleman from California to suggest to the  President of the United States that he adopt that concept as well.   I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
