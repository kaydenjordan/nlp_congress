 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. On July  8, there was a terrible car crash in Sherman Township in my district  that involved two of my constituents, Vincent Joseph Bechard and Peter  Kreiner.   Sadly, this tragedy took the life of 67-year-old Vincent from  Marlette. Vincent is survived by his children and several  grandchildren. This horrific accident has also put 62-year-old Peter  Kreiner, also from Marlette, in the hospital in critical condition.   Both men have championed the right to life and been decades-long  devotees to our country, our communities, and its founding ideals.  Their impact on their community will be felt long after this terrible  tragedy.   My prayers go out to the families of Vincent and Peter, and I am  asking my colleagues in this Chamber to please pray for Mr. Bechard's  family and for the speedy and full recovery of Peter Kreiner.                            ____________________
