 Mr. Speaker, when the sun barely peeks over the  sky, millions of women and children across the developing world wake up  and make their daily, dangerous walk in search of the necessity of  life: water.   They walk for miles in water-scarce regions to a well or polluted  river for water. During these long walks, they are often put at risk of  sexual abuse and assault. Also, bad guys control the wells and abuse  women in return for the sometimes polluted water.   The time-consuming search for water results in rape, pregnancy, child  kidnapping, and high educational dropout rates. Access to water,  sanitation, and hygiene prevents disease. It also improves the safety  and security of women and children across the entire world.   It is encouraging to see our Nation and Congress recognizing water as  the global security crisis that it is and the need to build capacity to  clean water. With our God-given resources, we have it within our power  and our duty to help others access clean water--the key to life.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
