 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 59 years ago tomorrow--in other words,  Friday--Ronald Reagan delivered his iconic ``A Time for Choosing''  speech. In this speech, the future President laid out, in very stark  terms, the challenges that Americans faced as a nation, all due to a  bloated Federal Government that threatened America's prosperity and  individual freedoms.   Well, America is once again at a time for choosing, and much like in  Reagan's time, the issues confronting us cross party lines. This would  be a good time for me to say that we have a partial step in this  direction because of the Biden-McCarthy agreement in June not to shut  down the government because the government couldn't issue debt.    So here we are again. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and  others have warned policymakers for decades that, absent changes, the  retirement of the baby boom generation would result in an explosion of  debt and deficit.   Yet we in the Congress have turned a blind eye as the country walked  headlong towards a fiscal cliff. For 40 years, our public debt averaged  around 35 percent of our economy. But over the past 15 years, that debt  has grown by leaps and bounds.   First came the 2008 financial crisis, which led to a $6 trillion leap  in public debt in just 4 years after 2008. This amounted to a doubling  of the national debt as a share of the economy, rising from 35  percent--where it was for about 40 years--to over 70 percent of GDP.   Then, we all know what the pandemic has done to the public debt. The  pandemic hits, and public debt went upwards by $7.5 trillion over 3  years. As a result, public debt soared to roughly equal to our Nation's  entire annual economic output--or what you have economists tell you:  That is about 100 percent of GDP.   Now that brings us to where we are today and to take Ronald Reagan's  advice very seriously: a nation drowning in a sea of red ink with no  life preserver or a rescue boat in sight.   What is more, debt continues to rain down upon us at a record clip.  The fiscal year 2023 deficit checked in at 2 trillion once you adjust  for the Supreme Court striking down the Biden student loan bailout.   Measured as a share of GDP the 2023 deficit was larger than in all  but 5 years since 1945.   Our historic deficit was fueled, in part, by rising interest payments  on the debt, which alone cost $711 billion. The cost to service our  debt is expected to consume an increasingly larger share of the Federal  budget. While we argue about what we should or shouldn't spend  taxpayers' money on, interest on the debt is crowding out our  priorities and shrinking our options going forward. And this all  automatically happens because you pay the interest on the national debt  or you default; and we don't want to do that. And that is what the  Biden-McCarthy agreement of June kept from happening.  [[Page S5200]]    Going back to June, the CBO projected that servicing our debt over  the next 10 years would cost 10.4 trillion; however, that projection  was made before rates on treasury bonds used to finance our debt surged  to a 16-year high. The rate on a 10-year treasury bond is now a full  percentage point higher than what CBO assumed this spring. All of that  adding to our deficit problems. But these higher than expected  borrowing costs persist. It will be trillions more spent simply  servicing that debt.   What is more, we haven't yet hit the precipice of the fiscal cliff  that CBO and other nonpartisan experts have been warning will result  due to the aging population. And, of course, that involves Social  Security and Medicare. And the trustees of these two programs say the  trust funds for both programs will be insolvent within the next 10  years. Moreover, CBO projects that spending for major health programs  will skyrocket from 32 percent of Federal revenue this day to 45  percent of revenue at midcentury.   We can no longer afford to kick the can down the road. We must put an  end to governing crisis to crisis and get back to the fundamentals of  government. And the fundamentals of government for Social Security and  Medicare should cause us to look at the success that Reagan and then- Democratic speaker Tip O'Neill of the House of Representatives said: We  can't let Social Security go bankrupt. And they fixed it to this very  day by tough decisions that we ought to be making today to fix it for  the next 50 years like they did. And I will bet maybe they, at that  time, thought maybe they were only fixing it for 10 or 20 years. But  that is from 1983 till now. Social Security is supposed to run out of  resources, reserves by, I think, 2033.   So what I am saying is it means actually managing the government  instead of doing it from crisis to crisis and to do it by not chasing  an elusive partisan ideal. That will require implementing honest budget  and appropriations practices that will enable us to begin to chip away  at this daunting debt.   According to the well-regarded Penn Wharton Budget Model, the United  States has about 20 years to take corrective action to avoid fiscal  disaster. I almost hate to say 20 years--but Penn Wharton is  respected--because that means that maybe we won't take the necessary  action in the near term. And it is always easier to solve these  problems yesterday than it is tomorrow. The longer we wait to take  these actions, then, obviously, I am saying the more painful those  actions will be.   In Penn Wharton's estimation, if we put off corrective action until  the fiscal crisis is at our doorstep, no amount of future tax hikes or  spending cuts will enable us to avoid defaulting on our debt.   When I just said--as I did--until a fiscal crisis is upon our  doorstep, Iowans at my 99-county meetings that I hold every year would  say that we are already at that point. And when you talk about maybe it  can be done or not done, then you can imagine the cynical people of  Iowa--just like the cynical people of the United States as a whole--are  even going to have less confidence in our government institutions.   Now, we all know there is plenty of blame to go around for how we got  into our current fiscal situation, but no amount of finger-pointing-- political or otherwise--will change where we find ourselves today. We  must now make a choice. We can either continue down the path to fiscal  ruin, or we can begin to rein in a bloated Federal Government in  pursuit of a more prosperous tomorrow.   Well, remember what I said about Ronald Reagan 59 years ago tomorrow,  also in the words of Ronald Reagan:         You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve       for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth or       we will sentence them to take the last step into a thousand       years of darkness.    We see on television a lot of times people saying how God-awful this  country is. And yet on that same television day, you can see 10,000  people crossing the border to come to our country. For those people  that live in America and have lived here all their life and find that  America is not such a great place, they ought to wonder why people all  over the world want to come to America.   Or sometimes I tell people at citizenship ceremonies in the  courthouses of Iowa when I am able to go there, I say to this group-- many of them have come from autocracies to America where they have less  freedom than they have in America today--and I say to those people, I  hope when you hear somebody that was born in America bellyaching about  the God-awful wrongs we have in this country, I hope you will remind  them as a person born in another country how great this country is  because people that were born here lose sight of how great America is.   So getting back to this fiscal issue I have been talking about,  whether Ronald Reagan says it or I say it or each of my 99 colleagues  say it--because I think, to some extent, we are all on the same page-- maybe not how to solve the problem, but that there is a problem--then I  say, like Reagan said: The choice is clear. It is time we do what our  constituents sent us here to do. And that basically means to lead--to  lead us out of this fiscal crisis.   I yield the floor.
