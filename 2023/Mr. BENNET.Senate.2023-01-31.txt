 Mr. President, I rise to honor the life and career  of my dear friend Scott LaBarre on the sad occasion of his death after  a battle with cancer. Scott passed away surrounded by his family on  Saturday, December 10, 2022.   From his days as a college student until a few months before his  death, Scott, who went blind as a youth, fought tirelessly for the  rights of blind people and other people with disabilities.   Born and raised in Minnesota, Scott attended the Colorado Center for  the Blind, a world-renowned rehabilitation training program for blind  people, and ultimately established his law practice and his family in  the Denver area.   His legal work focused in the areas of employment law, disability  rights, and international copyright policy. He held several leadership  positions within the American Bar Association and the National  Federation of the Blind--NFB--most recently as NFB's general counsel.   He served as chair of the board of the Colorado Center for the Blind,  led the National Association of Blind Lawyers, and helped establish and  guide the Jacobus tenBroek Law Symposium, the premier conference for  practitioners and students of disability law.   His impact will continue to ripple across the world because of his  leadership in securing the Marrakesh Treaty, an international agreement  permitting the cross-border sharing of books in Braille and other  accessible formats, which was ratified by this body.   Scott conducted all of his work with confidence, humor, and a joyful  spirit. Going forward, I will miss his presence in the halls of the  Senate when the National Federation of the Blind visits Washington each  year, as well as my many other interactions with him.   I am sure that many of you also encountered Scott, and I know you  will join me in lifting up his wife Anahit and their children, Alex and  Carter, as they cope with this devastating loss.  [[Page S166]]    I take comfort in the knowledge that Scott leaves a legacy  encompassing not only his many accomplishments, but his impact on the  hundreds of blind people whom he personally mentored and the millions  who will benefit from his efforts for generations to come.                            ____________________
