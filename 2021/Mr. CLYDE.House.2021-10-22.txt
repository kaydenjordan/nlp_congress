 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express, once again, my  sincere dismay that Democrats continue to ignore the wishes of the  American people by removing the Hyde amendment and other life-affirming  protections for the unborn from their bills, including their Big  Government, socialist tax-and-spend reconciliation bill.   My constituents are righteously angry that Democrats in control of  this body time and time again choose to violate the sanctity of life.  Moreover, they are furious at the thought of their tax dollars being  used to violently end the lives of millions of unborn babies, millions  of precious heartbeats in the womb.   Madam Speaker, you and I both know full well that the Hyde amendment  has saved lives. This is not just an opinion but a proven fact that  simply cannot be ignored.   I will always stand in support of the Hyde amendment and  unapologetically fight for the sanctity of life. I urge my Democrat  colleagues to abandon their political charade and restore the Hyde  amendment in the bipartisan way it has been supported for almost 45  years.   Again, I urge you to restore the Hyde amendment.                            ____________________
