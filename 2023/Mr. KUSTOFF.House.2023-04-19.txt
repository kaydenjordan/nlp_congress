 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  organizing tonight when we can speak directly to the American people.   Monday marked 100 days of the new Republican majority here in the  United States House of Representatives.   Since then, we have been committed and worked hard to fulfill our  commitment to America. That is our promise; to build an economy that is  strong, a Nation that is safe, a future that is built upon freedom, and  a government that is accountable to the American people.   Our very first vote here in the majority was to defund President  Biden's army of 87,000 new IRS agents that were to target families and  small businesses with more burdensome audits.   We passed the Parents Bill of Rights. Now, House Republicans know how  important it is to have a say in their children's future, and the  Parents Bill of Rights ensures that their important voice is heard.   The Parents Bill of Rights does five things: First, the right for  parents to know what is being taught in schools and to see reading  material. Secondly, the right to be heard. Third, the parents' rights  to see schools' budgets and schools' spending. Fourth, the right to  protect their child's privacy. Fifth, the right for parents to be  updated on any violent activity at school.   I was proud and am proud to cosponsor this legislation that puts  power back in the hands of parents certainly across our country and  also empowers them with the information that they need to ensure that  their children receive the best education possible.   In addition, for people following at home, we passed a bill, the bill  number is H.R. 1, the title of the bill is the Lower Energy Costs Act.   H.R. 1, what it does is it unleashes American energy. It lowers  energy costs for families across my district in West Tennessee and  across the Nation.                                time  1845    President Biden's war on American energy, frankly, has made us more  reliant on foreign energy sources. Americans know that because they  have been paying the price for this in higher gas prices, higher  utility bills, higher energy prices, in general.   H.R. 1 will unleash American energy and lower costs.   It does five things: It increases domestic energy production.   It reforms the permitting process for all industries. That is the  second thing.   The third thing, it reverses anti-energy policies advanced by  President Biden's administration.   Fourth, it streamlines energy infrastructure and exports.   Fifth, it boosts the production and processing of critical minerals.  I think that is so important.  [[Page H1884]]    That is H.R. 1. Obviously, it is one of the most important pieces of  legislation that will pass here in the United States House of  Representatives.   We as House Republicans have also been doing our part to talk  directly with Americans, in part by taking our committee hearings  outside of Washington, D.C. We are talking directly to people across  the country by having committee hearings outside of Washington, D.C.,  in the heartland of the country.   I am honored to be on the House Committee on Ways and Means. Under  the chairmanship of Jason Smith who chairs the House Committee on Ways  and Means, we have had field hearings in West Virginia and in Oklahoma.  By taking these committee hearings to places like West Virginia and  Oklahoma, we have been talking--but more importantly, listening--in our  committees to people who may not be able to travel to Washington, D.C.,  who could testify directly to our committee and to the other  committees.   By doing that, again, listening to issues that are important to the  House Ways and Means Committee, and certainly to the other committees,  as well, we really appreciate their valuable input.   In addition to all this, other things that House Republicans have  done, we have reopened the people's House. It is great to walk around  the House Chamber, to walk around the Halls of Congress and see people,  see our constituents, see school groups.   Here in the House of Representatives under the Republican majority in  these 100 days, we have worked to protect the sanctity of life.   We have worked to counter the Chinese Communist Party and their  influence.   We have worked to counter the Biden administration for their  weaponization of the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, frankly, we are just getting started. We have got a lot  of work cut out for us, but we are up to the challenge. We are working  hard for the American people. The Republican majority is committed to  delivering results for the American people each and every day in this  body.   Like you, I appreciate the honor to serve, and I appreciate  Congressman Johnson for organizing tonight's Special Order so that  Members like me and other Members in the Republican House majority can  talk to the people, can talk about the accomplishments and also the  important issues that our Nation faces.
