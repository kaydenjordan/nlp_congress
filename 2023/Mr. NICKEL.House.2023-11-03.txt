 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I cast a ``no'' vote for a highly  partisan supplemental appropriations bill providing security aid to  Israel.   Let me be clear: I stand with Israel. Israel isn't just any ally. It  is a cornerstone of democracy in one of the most volatile regions in  the world. Security  [[Page H5383]]  assistance should never be tethered to a hyperpartisan, domestic  financial concession.   The offset in this bill, slashing IRS staff, actually adds to the  deficit and would allow billionaires to get away with cheating on their  taxes.   In matters of foreign policy, especially with crucial allies like  Israel, we must rise above partisan politics.   When a bipartisan supplemental appropriations bill containing aid for  Israel comes back from the Senate without poison pills, I will  wholeheartedly support it. That is the clear path forward here and the  best way to support our friend and ally, Israel.                            ____________________
