 Mr. President, today I recognize Sandra Carawan,  the Gilchrist County teacher of the year from Bell Elementary School in  Bell, FL.   Sandra is dedicated to her students, working closely with them each  day to help solve their problems. Her colleagues describe her as a  tremendous asset and someone who will help in any way she can, whether  as a teacher or with administrative duties. She was named Bell  Elementary School's teacher of the year in addition to receiving the  award for the district.   A fifth grade exceptional student education teacher, Sandra acts as  the lead teacher for her grade level. She also serves as Bell  Elementary School advisory chair, safety patrol sponsor, district 21st  century evaluator/coordinator, a positive behavior support team member,  and a data evaluator for the entire Gilchrist County School District.  She graduated from Saint Leo University, earning her bachelor's degree  in Elementary Education in 1999 and her master of education degree in  2007.   I convey my best wishes to Sandra for her dedication to her students  and school. I look forward to hearing of this continued  success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Lilly Chappell,  the Bradford County teacher of the year from Southside Elementary  School in Starke, FL.  Lilly has enjoyed spreading her passion for learning to others  throughout her whole life. She has spent 11 years with the Southside  Parent Teacher Organization, helping to build a playground and sound  system for students, directing musicals with more than 250 students,  and making herself available for a variety of other extracurricular  events throughout the school year.   Lilly has taught in Bradford County for 20 years, beginning as a  writing coach.

I look forward to hearing of her continued  good work in the coming years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Nicole Kenngott, the  Pinellas County teacher of the year from Plumb Elementary School in  Clearwater, FL.  [[Page S1934]]    Nicole specializes in deaf studies and special-needs education. She  uses innovative, research-based teaching methods to educate her  students. She designs lesson plans to promote continuous learning in a  teaching environment meant to encourage and inspire her students.   Nicole works with students to identify their fears in order to foster  a better growth mindset and develop an enthusiasm for learning. Last  year, 60 percent of her students earned a level three or higher on the  State English test, compared to 51 percent in Pinellas County schools.   Nicole earned her master's degree from Dowling College and has taught  at Plumb Elementary School for 3 years. She follows a teaching style  based on a growth mindset and Conversation, Help, Activity, Movement,  Participation, and Success or CHAMPS. She also uses the strategies of  Advanced Via Individual Determination teaching and restorative  practices.   I express my sincere gratitude to Nicole for her commitment to  helping her students succeed in school. I look forward to learning of  her continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Melissa Pappas, the  Orange County teacher of the year from Brookshire Elementary School in  Winter Park, FL.   Melissa is a K-5 intensive autism teacher that works with children  with severe behavioral functional and academic needs. She is motivated  by her passion for her students and is responsible for one of only five  intensive units districtwide, serving students with severe behavioral,  functional, and academic needs. She believes teaching is not only a  profession that teaches all other professions, but the one with the  power to shape the future for all types of learners.   In the past year, she launched a schoolwide initiative during Autism  Awareness Month to educate members of the school community to promote  acceptance, love, and understanding of those with autism and special  needs. As a result of the initiative, many students performed random  acts of kindness and engaged students with exceptionalities.   I extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to Melissa for her devotion  to helping her students succeed in life. I look forward to learning of  her continued success in the coming years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Laura Wykoff, the  Alachua County teacher of the year from Fort Clarke Middle School in  Gainesville, FL.   Laura keeps letters from her students to remind her of the importance  of her job. After receiving this award, she shared many of these  letters with those in attendance at the award ceremony. The letters  consist of humorous ones on learning about integers, algebra, and other  math subjects to serious ones about how, if it was not for Laura, they  would not have been successful in school. She considers these examples  as an important reason for why she does her job.   Laura considers teaching her students and realizing that they  understand something and that makes a student feel good about  themselves as the best part of the job. At the award ceremony, one of  her former students credited Laura with his success and noted that she  has always been there for him.   Laura has taught for more than 10 years and is currently a seventh  and eighth grade mathematics teacher at Fort Clarke Middle School,  where she has been since 2015. Her family consists of a long line of  academics, and Laura believes teaching is in their blood.   I offer my sincere thanks and gratitude to Laura for her dedication  to her students throughout her career. I look forward to hearing of her  continued success in the years ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small  business that exemplifies the unique American entrepreneurial spirit.  It is my privilege to honor a Florida small business that not only  produces an amazing product, but also tirelessly serves their  community. Today, I recognize Southern Craft Creamery, of Marianna, FL,  as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Founded in 2012, Southern Craft Creamery is owned and operated by  Dale and Cindy Eade, with the help of their children. After selling  their handcrafted ice cream wholesale for 6 years, the Eade family  opened its first brick-and-mortar location last February.   Southern Craft Creamery is a true family-run business. While Dale and  Cindy's daughter, Megan Austin, along with her husband Brad, currently  manage Cindale Farms, a local dairy farm where Southern Craft Creamery  sources its milk, Lauren and Zach O'Bryan, Dale and Cindy's daughter  and son-in-law, initially launched the ice cream brand. Having been  involved in the Florida dairy business since 1980, it is no surprise  that the Eade family's ice cream is crafted to showcase the quality  milk they produce and the delicious southern ingredients they grew up  with.   Today, Southern Craft Creamery sells a wide variety of signature ice  cream flavors including tupelo honey, salty caramel, and candied bacon,  as well as seasonal flavors such as raspberry basil, bourbon butter  pecan, and blackberry buttermilk.   Southern Craft Creamery has been repeatedly recognized for these  delicious flavors, being named the overall food winner in the 2013 Made  in the South Awards by ``Garden & Gun'' magazine and by ``Southern  Living'' magazine in the Best Sweets category for the magazine's 2015  food awards.   Southern Craft Creamery creates these remarkable ice cream flavors by  sourcing many of their ingredients from other local, family-owned small  businesses. Working with local farmers and producers has allowed  Southern Craft Creamery to give back to their community while also  receiving the freshest and most flavorful ingredients available. They  also work with regional, family-owned retailers to sell their ice cream  throughout Florida.   Southern Craft Creamery and the Eade family seek to give back to  their community in any way possible. After Hurricane Michael devastated  their community, they gathered supplies for victims, opened their doors  to allow residents to cool off, and offered free coffee and ice cream  to first responders. Prior to December 2018, Southern Craft donated all  of their tips to Partners for Pets, a nonprofit animal shelter in  Marianna. Since December 2018, however, all of their tips have been  donated to Friends of the Florida Caverns State Park in an effort to  assist in replanting trees and repair damages caused by Hurricane  Michael.   The Eade family's work to grow Southern Craft Creamery, support local  farmers, and aid members of their community is an excellent example of  civic dedication. Companies like Southern Craft Creamery are the  heartbeat of local, small-town communities across Florida. I would like  to congratulate Southern Craft Creamery on their 1-year anniversary of  opening their storefront and for being named the Senate Small Business  of the Week. I wish them good luck and look forward to watching their  continued growth and success.                            ____________________
