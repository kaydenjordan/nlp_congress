 Mr. President, today I rise to join my friends in  celebrating Earth Day. Senator Gaylord Nelson began the tradition in  1970, making today the 51st celebration of Earth Day. While it is  always important to set aside a day to pause and reflect on our  relationship with the natural world, I consider this Earth Day one of  the most important yet. As we begin to emerge from the chaos of the  COVID-19 pandemic and reset our new ``business as usual,'' we are  stepping into a new world, ripe with opportunity for progress on  climate change with a more meaningful understanding of what it means to  live in a global community. Our Nation and planet are at a crossroads  in determining the future of our climate. With a new administration  that understands the threat of climate change and the role of the  United States as a global leader, we are at the precipice of bold  action.   The scientific consensus is that climate change will have devastating  and far-reaching impacts on the environment, public health, and  national security, and we must mitigate and adapt. In 2018, the United  Nations U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC found that  if a concerted multilateral effort is not made to keep global  temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit by  2100, we will cross a tipping point and cause the worst damage by  climate change. The scientific community has been sounding the alarm  for years, which too many of our colleagues have chosen to ignore.   The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the challenges and  opportunities of our increasingly globalized world. More than ever, we  are understanding how decisions governments, corporations, and  individuals make have real-world impacts and consequences. Actions that  affect our climate are no different. An understanding of our impact in  determining our collective future will only help us in our pursuit of a  healthier planet.   Fortunately, our communities have proven resilient and adaptable.  Over the past year. Americans have been burdened with collective grief,  fear, and uncertainty. Through it all, our Nation has demonstrated a  grit and ingenuity unlike anything we have seen in generations. We saw  parents step up as teachers, corporations pivot their business models  to keep people safe, and an entire population of office workers  transition to working from home. In terms of action on climate change,  this flexibility proves that a departure from the status quo is not as  unrealistic as we may have thought previously. In fact, a change from  ``business as usual'' can have unforeseen benefits for our quality of  life and our planet.   Equipped with the lessoned learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, I am  more confident than ever that our Nation in ready to commit to action  on climate change in earnest. Additionally, the Biden administration is  already pursuing an aggressive climate agenda by reversing President  Trump's shortsighted decisions and doubling down on President Obama's  environmental regulations. The Build Back Better agenda recognizes both  the need to mitigate emissions and prepare for the impacts of climate  change that are already harming our communities. A great and overdue  need to update our Nation's infrastructure provides an opportunity to  address some of our society's most insidious sources of pollution.   Emissions from passenger and freight transport makes up the largest  proportion of our Nation's total greenhouse gas emissions--nearly 30  percent. The Federal Government can and must work quickly to address  climate change through transportation and infrastructure policy. As  chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee of the  Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I am committed to  ensuring that any legislation the committee considers addresses  greenhouse gas emissions reductions in a meaningful way. In 2019, the  Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works unanimously reported  an innovative surface transportation reauthorization that indicates a  genuine bipartisan interest in action on climate change. I am confident  the newest iteration of this bill will be even more ambitious.   The imperative to address climate change through transportation and  infrastructure is particularly important to Maryland, a highly  developed, low-lying coastal State with aging public works systems,  which makes it particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate  change. My constituents and future generations have a right to good air  quality, water quality, and the resilience of infrastructure assets  like  [[Page S2163]]  roads, bridges, and storm and wastewater systems.   In recent years, Marylanders have seen firsthand the effects of  climate change in my State. Intense rainstorms have caused  unprecedented flood damage to homes and businesses in Prince George's  County, Southwest Baltimore, Ellicott City, and Hagerstown. The cost of  rebuilding our infrastructure after these storms is significant. Unless  we change the way we think about infrastructure in the future, taxpayer  investments will be washed away with the next big storm. I requested a  Government Accountability Office GAO report on the Federal Government's  fiscal exposure to the effects of climate change. GAO found that in  2018, 14 separate natural and weather disasters occurred, costing the  Federal Government a total of $91 billion. Unsurprisingly, GAO  determined that this amount will rise as climate change causes more  frequent and more severe weather events. Inaction on this issue amounts  to a gross negligence by Congress in our management of taxpayers'  funds. I consider it my duty to ensure that the Federal Government  takes full advantage of the opportunity before us to make long-sighted  upgrades to our systems.   In addition to building back physical infrastructure better, the  Nation is in the process of rebuilding its reputation on the  international stage as a leader on climate change. By rejoining the  Paris Agreement, the United States is signaling its commitment to the  global community. As I speak, the President is hosting the Leaders  Summit on Climate, where world leaders will outline how their countries  will commit to their own ambitious goals. The United States is  committing to a bold 2030 emissions target as its new nationally  determined contribution under the Paris Agreement. This summit  represents the formal return of the United States to its leadership  position and an opportunity to regain the trust from our international  partners that President Trump decimated.   When President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris  Agreement, I helped to maintain relationships with our partner-members  by introducing a bipartisan resolution that expressed support for the  Paris Agreement and assuring the international community that, despite  President Trump's abdication of his duties, leaders on climate change  in the U.S. Senate remained. I previously led the U.S. congressional  delegation to the conference where the Paris Agreement was adopted and  will continue to position our Nation as a strong partner in the  international fight against warming global temperatures.   Domestically. this Earth Day, I will recommit to my long-term  endeavor to preserve and restore the Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay  is the lifeblood of the State of Maryland, and the communities that  depend on it are seeing their livelihood threatened as the climate  changes. Saltwater intrusion on agricultural lands and fragile  fisheries make it harder for Maryland farmers and fishers to earn a  living. In some cases, Marylanders are seeing their communities  disappear before their eyes from the dual threat of sea level rise and  subsidence. A healthy Chesapeake Bay watershed is essential to a  thriving economy. Additionally, the Chesapeake Bay's wetlands are  Maryland's best defense against climate change-induced flooding, as  they act as natural buffers to storm surge during severe weather.   The good news is that action on climate change, through international  commitments, domestic infrastructure improvements, and restoring  regional natural resources like the Chesapeake Bay, will stimulate our  economy. Stewardship of our environmental can and should go hand in  hand with economic development. Our Nation will be grappling with the  economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic for years to come, and bold  Federal action is a time-tested practice for economic recovery. A truly  bold investment in action on climate change will pay dividends for  generations to come, but it must meet the size and urgency of the  challenge before us.   I am certain that our Nation can honor our planet and our future  generations with urgent, thoughtful decision-making. Earth Day is one  of the most celebrated secular holidays in the world and for good  reason. We are all stewards of our planet and now more than ever  understand that we are on a journey together. I will embrace this Earth  Day and the opportunities for progress that lie ahead. I hope my Senate  colleagues and all Americans will join me honoring our planet through  diligent work, today and every day.                            ____________________
