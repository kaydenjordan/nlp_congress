 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, though troubled and saddened by the  recent attacks on law enforcement officials, I believe that H.R. 115,  the Thin Blue Line Act, is counterproductive to ensuring public safety  and only serves to exacerbate concerns with the unfair and unjust death  penalty.   H.R. 115 expands the list of statutory aggravating factors in Federal  death penalty cases to also include killing or targeting a law  enforcement officer, firefighter, or other first responder.   Aggravating factors are specific factors that judges and juries  consider in determining whether a sentence of death is justified for  the underlying offense. Passage of this bill would add a 17th statutory  aggravating factor for Federal death penalty eligible offenses.   H.R. 115 has been rushed to the House floor, without a single hearing  and without the opportunity to consider amendments directly relevant to  whether our system of imposing the death penalty is fair, just, and  reliable. Like most of my colleagues, I support measures that would  actually protect our first responders, brave men and women who risk  their lives every day to protect us.   Unfortunately, H.R. 115 not only fails to do this but would also  exacerbate problems with the Federal death penalty.   First, H.R. 115 duplicates Federal and State laws that enhance  sentences of persons convicted of crimes of violence against law  enforcement. The very law the bill seeks to amend, 18 U.S.C. section  3592, already states that a crime against a high public official,  including a judge, a law enforcement officer, or an employee of a  United States penal or correctional institution, is an aggravating  factor that may be considered in determining whether a death sentence  should be imposed.   Other Federal laws also impose a life sentence or death on persons  convicted of killing State and local law enforcement officers, or other  employees assisting with Federal investigations, as well as officers of  the United States courts.   Secondly, H.R. 115 does not address documented and systemic  unfairness and racial unfairness in the disposition of the death  penalty. Any legislation dealing with the Federal death penalty must  also address numerous concerns related to racial disparity in  application of capital punishment, the lack of qualified counsel and  sufficient resources to represent those facing the death penalty, and  faulty forensic ``science'' testimony ordered in support of convictions  in death penalty cases.   The Federal death penalty, in particular, is rife with troubling  evidence of racial disparity. For example, 36 of the 61 people  currently on Federal death row are African American, Latino, Asian, or  Native American.   If you break this down by Federal circuit, the results are even more  disturbing. For example, 15 of 18 men who have received a Federal death  sentence in the Fifth Circuit--Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi--in  the modern era have been people of color.   Third, civil rights and civil liberties organizations oppose H.R.  115. Organizations committed to the protection of civil rights and  civil liberties, including the NAACP, ACLU, and the LCCR, have noted  that the Thin Blue Line Act ``is an unnecessary and misguided attempt  to politicize the unfortunate deaths of law enforcement officers and  could ultimately exacerbate existing tension between law enforcement  and the communities they served.''                                time  1500    And finally, H.R. 115 will not deter violence against police  officers. By adding a 17th aggravating factor to the Federal death  penalty statute, this legislation ignores scientific research regarding  the ineffectiveness of capital punishment as a deterrent to crime.   It is important to note that the National Research Council of the  National Academies has concluded that the studies claiming that the  death penalty has a deterrent effect on murder rates are  ``fundamentally flawed'' and should not be the basis of sound public  policy.   Accordingly, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield an additional 1  minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter addressed to Mr.  Goodlatte and myself, and I want to read the first paragraph of it.   ``Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers:   ``We are current and former law enforcement leaders and officers from  jurisdictions across the country. We ask you to oppose H.R. 115, the  Thin Blue Line Act. We do so because we believe this bill will do  little to protect the lives of police and first responders and will  drive away resources proven to be effective at protecting law  enforcement and preventing and solving crime.''                                                     April 26, 2017.      Re Law Enforcement Opposition to H.R. 115.       Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.      Hon. John Conyers, Jr.,      Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers: We are       current and former law enforcement leaders and officers from       jurisdictions across the country. We ask you to oppose H.R.       115, the Thin Blue Line Act. We  [[Page H4340]]       do so because we believe this bill will do little to protect       the lives of police and first responders and will drive away       resources proven to be effective at protecting law       enforcement and preventing and solving crime.        We are all too familiar with the risks that local, state,       and federal law enforcement and first responders take each       day to prevent, investigate, and prosecute crime. In fact;       some of us have served alongside colleagues who were killed       in the line of duty. We understand the impulse to threaten       those who have murdered our fellow officers with the death       penalty, and some of us have experienced that desire       directly.        But we also know that the death penalty, as it currently       operates, is poor public policy. It is ineffective,       expensive, and can make irrevocable mistakes. It is also used       disparately and often on vulnerable populations, which       undermines our ability to create effective and trusted       relationships with those in the community on whose support       our success depends. That is why, while some of us may       philosophically support the death penalty, we all oppose its       expansion in practice--even under the auspices of supporting       law enforcement.        Each of us understands that it takes many and varied       resources to keep our communities safe. We need strong       partnerships with local government and the communities we       serve. We need well-functioning and modern systems to       collect, store and process police activities, crime data, and       evidence. We need equipment to protect and assist officers as       they perform their duties. One tool virtually never seen on       our list of needs is the death penalty.        In short, we believe H.R. 115 is an unnecessary expansion       of an already flawed and ineffective policy. We encourage you       to oppose this bill and instead support measures that promote       the overall health, safety, and welfare of law enforcement       and the communities we have been sworn to protect.

Mr. Speaker, I would like all of my colleagues to  recognize that, during our observation of National Police Week, we are  reminded again of the importance of ensuring that law enforcement  officers are safe so they can carry out their duties effectively.   These kinds of ``enhancement'' bills like H.R. 115 do nothing to  invest in officer wellness or to address the everyday challenges faced  by police officers or first responders. Moreover, they are redundant,  especially because there are laws that protect police officers and  first responders from violence in all 50 States.   Rather than advancing a bill that amounts to an empty gesture, that  is damaging, at best, this Congress should focus on real reform  measures that will protect law enforcement, first responders, and their  communities. Providing duplicative protections to law enforcement  simply cannot counterbalance the impact of fundamentally flawed death  penalty legislation.   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
