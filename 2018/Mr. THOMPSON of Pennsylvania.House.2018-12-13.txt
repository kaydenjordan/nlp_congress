 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of  the 382nd birthday of the National Guard.   A component of the United States Army, the National Guard is  primarily composed of citizen-soldiers who hold down full-time,  civilian jobs or attend school. They serve their community and their  country.   Each U.S. State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto  Rico, and the territories of Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands maintain  both an Army National Guard and an Air National Guard.   On December 13, 1636, the Massachusetts General Court issued an order  requiring all able-bodied men between 16 and 60 years old to create a  standing army for protection. With that order, what we now know as  America's National Guard was born. The idea was simple: establish an  army of citizen-soldiers who could be called upon to fight when needed.   Mr. Speaker, I commend all those who join the ranks of the esteemed  National Guard. They answer the call of duty to protect their community  and their country. We are grateful for their service and proud of their  commitment.   Happy 382nd birthday to the National Guard.                            ____________________
