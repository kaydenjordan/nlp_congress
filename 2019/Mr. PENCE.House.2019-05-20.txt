 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the centennial  anniversary of a company whose name is synonymous with my hometown of  Columbus, Indiana. One hundred years ago, Cummins Engine Company was  incorporated, charting a course that would change the world and serve  to make Indiana a manufacturing powerhouse.   Today, with nearly 60,000 employees worldwide, Cummins remains a  global power leader. From engines to power systems, components, and  advanced technologies, the power of Cummins will continue to drive our  State, our Nation, and indeed, the world.   In fact, this year has brought record sales to Cummins, proving that  after one century, the best is still to come.   On behalf of the people of Indiana's Sixth Congressional District, I  congratulate Cummins, its incredible leadership, and its devoted  employees on 100 years of improving lives by powering a more prosperous  world.                            ____________________
