 Mr. Speaker, House Republicans are fulfilling our  commitment to our country's veterans by fully funding veterans'  healthcare programs, veterans' benefits, and Veterans Affairs programs  in the fiscal year 2024 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and  Related Agencies appropriations bill.   Not only are we fulfilling our promise to those veterans who have  served our country, but we are taking our efforts up a notch to go  above and beyond what the VA is already doing by increasing funding for  the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical and Prosthetic Research  Program.   I am a proud supporter of this program, and I requested that the  Appropriations Committee fully fund this program to the level included  in the bill, which is $938 million. That is a $22 million or 2.5  percent increase as compared to fiscal year 2023 and is in line with  the President's budgetary request.   The VA's Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Service is the largest and most  comprehensive provider of prosthetic devices and sensory aids in the  world. This funding will go a long way in making sure the VA has the  necessary funds to research ways to restore veterans' abilities to  function within their families, communities, and workplaces.   This increased funding will also help the researchers within the VA  research program recover from slowed research because of the COVID-19  pandemic. Sustained and predictable funding growth for VA research is  imperative to help ensure the best return on spending to improve the  health of veterans and all Americans.   Although the VA's Medical and Prosthetic Research Program is  specifically dedicated to improving the health and well-being of those  who have served the United States in uniformed services, it has had a  tremendous impact on the care of all Americans.   The research conducted within this program has led the way in many  different healthcare fields, including the treatment of digestive  diseases. There is no better way to utilize our tax dollars than by  contributing to a cause that will help restore veterans' functionality  and also lead to advancements in medical care for all Americans.   Additionally, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which has  direct ties to my district and constituents, has a proud, longstanding,  and multifaceted partnership with the Veterans Administration in  Nashville and the mid-South across clinical care, medical training, and  research activities. They are proud to join me in supporting increased  funding for this medical research program within the VA healthcare  system.   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is that medical research at the VA not  only helps those that have put it all on the line in service to this  country--some sacrificing pieces of their body that they will never get  back--it helps all Americans, as I have already mentioned. This is a  great use of taxpayer funds, and I couldn't be prouder to support this  initiative to fund this program at the level I have already mentioned.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members on both sides of the aisle to  support this provision in the fiscal year 2024 Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies appropriations bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this week, House Republicans are continuing to  deliver on our commitment to America--a Nation that is safe--by  providing the Department of Defense with the facilities it needs to  protect us from foreign adversaries.   One of the bills we will consider is the fiscal year 2024 Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies appropriations  bill that funds the Department of Defense facilities and veterans'  healthcare programs.   We don't stop there. This bill prohibits the use of funds to promote  or advance the destructive critical race theory and prohibits the Biden  administration's executive orders on diversity, equity, and inclusion.   There is more work to be done to get our military back to the world's  elite fighting force focused on combating adversaries. By taking these  small steps to eliminate fraud, waste, abuse, and unnecessary programs,  we are taking the right first steps.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, for the first time in my entire tenure in  Congress, the U.S. House of Representatives will be considering two  appropriations bills this week that cut wasteful spending. Before the  fact-checkers come after me, I will go ahead and say that I am sure it  has been done before, but not in my time in Congress, which up until  this year has been done under Democrat majority control.   Here are just a few of the wasteful Washington programs House  Republicans are aiming to cut in the appropriations process this week.  In the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  appropriations bill for fiscal year 2024, House Republicans prohibit  using funds to promote or advance critical race theory. No taxpayer  dollars should have ever been spent on this harmful, divisive and anti- American theory.   The bill prohibits the Biden administration from implementing,  administering, or enforcing any of President Biden's executive orders  on diversity, equity, and inclusion. The executive branch should be  focused on hiring our country's best and brightest, not on checking a  certain box.   The bill even rescinds billions in funds, like $1 billion for rural  clean energy programs created in the Inflation Reduction Act on Green  New Deal climate initiatives.   Not only are these bills cutting wasteful Washington spending, but  they are also advancing many conservative principles Tennesseans can be  proud to support, such as: ending mail-order chemical abortion,  directing the USDA Secretary to take action to prohibit the purchase of  agricultural land by those associated with China, Russia, North Korea,  or Iran, or even prohibiting funds for the Wuhan Institute of Virology.   Mr. Speaker, all in all, I believe these are good provisions in these  two bills. House Republicans are doing the good work on behalf of the  American people to responsibly fund the Federal Government, cut  wasteful spending, and return the focus of our government back  [[Page H4018]]  to where priorities should lie and not the woke initiatives of Green  New Deal Democrats.
