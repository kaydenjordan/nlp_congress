 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Indiana for  yielding, and I appreciate this opportunity to speak for life.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today because there are actually elected leaders  in this country, in the United States of America, who believe a baby  can be left  [[Page H1564]]  to die after having been born alive. How is this even a debate in the  United States of America?   When did murder become a partisan issue?   Some on the other side of the aisle call this ``parental choice'' and  ``healthcare.''   But, Mr. Speaker, I tell you that infanticide is murder, not  healthcare. And abortion is not the answer to a pre-born child's  physical or mental disability.   But don't just take it from me. Listen to the words of Mr. Frank  Stephens, who was actually born with Down syndrome and leads a  remarkable life, a life worth living.   He had this to say about abortion: ``On abortion, I don't want to  make it illegal. I want to make it unthinkable. Politicians change  laws. I want to change people's hearts.''   Mr. Speaker, I want to partner with Frank Stephens because I believe  that we can do both, making late-term abortion unthinkable, and  illegal.
