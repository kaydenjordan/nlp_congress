 Mr. Speaker, I rise to address two topics today:  workforce development and President Biden's historic remarks in  Vilnius, Lithuania, yesterday.   First, on the labor shortage across our country, job openings remain  near record highs. I hear repeatedly from businessowners in my district  of unprecedented hiring challenges, a sentiment further backed by  recent data. The latest numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  indicate there are one-and-one-half job openings for every person  looking for one in Ohio, and the same is true nationally.   Due to legislation largely Democrats in Congress have passed, robust  job creation is a fantastic achievement. However, if our country wants  to achieve a steady growth economy, pay down our debt, and curb  inflation for everyday, hardworking Americans, we must do more to  address worker shortages.   Let's focus on key sectors: manufacturing, healthcare, hospitality,  business services, the tech industry, culinary arts, and other sectors  that are experiencing significant hiring challenges. Local communities  must focus on additional education and training, especially for the  hardest hit sectors that are recovering from the pandemic.    During the pandemic, many experienced workers over the age of 55  retired early, causing large employment gaps. Less experienced workers  simply do not have the necessary skills to fill these open positions.   These are jobs that pay a living wage, carry benefits, and help  families and communities prosper. However, the skills gap hits hardest  younger workers and midcareer workers looking for new jobs.   Local community job training programs must bolster skills  advancement, focusing on these newer entrants and forging more  partnerships between industry and local community high schools,  colleges, universities, and labor unions.   By accelerating workforce training locally, our Nation can increase  the availability of specialized skills for workers so people can  advance in the marketplace. A better life awaits them and their  families, ensures the health of our economy, and increases America's  global competitiveness.   Democrats passed the American Rescue Plan Act without any Republican  votes or support. As a result, the Federal Economic Development  Administration's Good Jobs Challenge program helps to fund workforce  development training across our country.   The Ohio Manufacturers' Association and the Northwest Ohio  Manufacturing Alliance both have received funding through the American  Rescue Plan to expand manufacturing workforce training throughout Ohio.   Manufacturing has always been a central spine and backbone of Ohio's  middle class. In addition, I have introduced the Office of  Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation Policy Act to improve workforce  development and job creation in the manufacturing sector.   Mr. Speaker, please let me thank my bipartisan colleagues for  recognizing the need for investment in manufacturing workforce  development. Our bill focuses on lifting up America's workers while  strengthening our economy by forging public-private partnerships  critical to meeting demands for a capably trained workforce.   Quickly, the second issue, Mr. Speaker, I wish to briefly address is  President Biden's historic speech in Vilnius, Lithuania, yesterday.   Standing with leaders of our fellow democratic nations bonded in  mutual self-defense, he clearly celebrated the expansion of NATO as  Finland and Sweden joined the longstanding, hard-fought alliance among  30 free nations. We now stand as part of a NATO alliance that is 32  members strong and comprises 15 percent of our globe's population, and  the members live in freedom.   Delivering his address inside a nation that heroically threw off the  yoke of Russian oppression at tremendous cost, the moving ceremony  represents a pivotal moment in liberty's advance in world history. We  witnessed freedom-loving nations again pledge their consequential,  shared commitment to mutual self-defense and support for our ally,  Ukraine.   While Democrats are working hard domestically on rebuilding the  economy, lowering inflation, and solving problems at home, President  Biden's leadership ensures that our defense alliances abroad are  strengthened.   Let us continue to work together to deliver real results for the  American people here at home and strengthen liberty's alliances  globally.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, the millions of Americans whose families sent  loved ones over to the European theater during World War II so liberty  could be bequeathed to us understand what an enemy really is and what  sacrifice is required.   The Ukrainians are fighting their own war against Russia's invasion.  History is clear, however, on what horrors transpire when national  leaders appease a virulent enemy of liberty. Appeasement is read as  cowardice, acquiescence, weakness, and, even worse, succor to the  enemy.   Give no succor nor encouragement to liberty's enemies. We need to  defend freedom. Freedom means never surrendering, never acquiescing,  never failing liberty.   I ask my colleagues to join me in full support of Ukraine and to  defeat any amendments on this floor that in any way would inhibit  victory for Ukraine.
