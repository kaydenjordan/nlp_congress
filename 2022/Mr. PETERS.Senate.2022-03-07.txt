 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak  5 minutes prior to the commencement of the vote.    Madam President, in just a few moments, this body will  take an important vote to continue moving forward on the bipartisan  Postal Service Reform Act. These vital reforms will help set the Postal  Service on a more stable financial footing so that this trusted public  service can continue delivering to every single community in the United  States.   Millions--millions--of Americans are counting on the Postal Service  to deliver essential mail, including medications, important financial  documents, and other critical supplies. We have all seen firsthand how  veterans and seniors, small businesses, rural residents, and others who  rely on the Postal Service face serious hardships when the Postal  Service is focused on cutting costs by making changes to delivery  service.   This bill will help address the most significant financial burdens on  the Postal Service by reversing an unnecessary requirement to prefund  every cent of healthcare benefits that every postal employee will  eventually use in retirement no matter how far off that retirement may  be. By eliminating this aggressive prefunding requirement--I may add,  something that no other business in America is forced to do--along with  integrating postal retirees' healthcare into Medicare, like so many  other private employers, this bipartisan, commonsense legislation will  save the Postal Service more than $49 billion over the next 10 years.   The bill also requires the Postal Service to deliver 6 days a week  and improves transparency and accountability for Americans by requiring  the Postal Service to publicly post weekly performance data on its  website.   This legislation has been 15 years in the making, and tonight, we  will get one step closer to making it a reality.   I am grateful to my colleagues who have shown strong, bipartisan  support for this legislation, including my colead, Ranking Member  Portman from Ohio, and the 28 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle  who have worked with us to make this a reality. Our cosponsors have  played an important role in helping to build additional support for  this critical bill.   Certainly, there is still more work to do to ensure even greater  long-term success for the Postal Service and its customers, but  tonight--tonight--the Senate will take a substantial step to continue  advancing this incredibly important bill.   I urge my colleagues to join me in taking this meaningful action to  protect the future of the Postal Service and the essential services  that it provides to our communities all across our country.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion
