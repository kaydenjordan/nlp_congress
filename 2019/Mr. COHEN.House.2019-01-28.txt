 Mr. Speaker, today the House of Representatives has a  Member in great distress, and it causes all of us who are aware of  that--and I think most of us are--sorrow.   Representative Walter Jones is the Congressman from the Third  Congressional District of North Carolina. He is a man of courage, a man  who speaks truth to power, and has been a Member of this body since  1995.   Representative Jones has a condition that has caused him to go into  hospice care. He likely will not be joining us on this floor. But he is  a man who I have had the great privilege of knowing, because he is a  good human being and an honorable man, who made a mistake in a vote for  the Iraq war and after he realized that that was a mistake, having  voted for that war, he voted against war and conflicts ever after, and  wrote  [[Page H1235]]  personal notes to the families of the victims of military deaths.   He supported veterans. He supported our country. He was a man of  conscience. He still is. Our thoughts are with him, and I thank him for  his service and his friendship.   Mr. Speaker, I say to my friend: Fair winds and following seas.                            ____________________
