 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the bill before us.   The debate, America, is very simple. I am a proud Republican, and I  stand with the private market. I stand with you, as the people.   My Democratic colleagues, they offer you a vision of healthcare  defined and controlled by the government. If you believe the government  can do a better job with your healthcare, then so be it, vote with the  Democratic colleagues. But if you believe in entrepreneurs, if you  believe in innovators, then vote with the Republican ideas that lead to  more innovation.   The bill before us today, we had a conversation with the Health and  Human Services Secretary in the Committee on Ways and Means and with  the Congressional Budget Office independently confirming that there  will be dozens fewer innovations when it comes to treatments and cures  for Americans with the passage of this bill.   That is what you are doing--eyes wide open--and we are not going to  let you get away with it.   Madam Speaker, when you vote for this bill, you are dooming millions  of Americans to not have a cure for the disease. Vote for the  bipartisan bill, H.R. 19, Lower Costs, More Cures. That is the bill  that will get through the system.
