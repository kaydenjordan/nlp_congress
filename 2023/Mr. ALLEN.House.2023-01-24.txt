 Mr. Speaker, God created all children with unique skills  and talents. We should encourage flexibility in learning to allow each  student's gifts to flourish so they can live the American Dream.   On this National School Choice Week, we must empower America's  families to have a voice, enabling them to choose a learning  environment that is just right for their children, one that will both  challenge that student and encourage them to develop their God-given  talents.   Sadly, our schoolchildren are facing years' worth of learning and  development loss, which is why education freedom today is so important.   According to polling done by the American Federation for Children, 72  percent of voters polled support school choice, highlighting broad  bipartisan support on this issue. A ZIP code should never determine a  child's future.   As a member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, I am  committed to advancing the cause of school choice this Congress. I call  on my colleagues on both sides to join me and to do the same.                            ____________________
