 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor and congratulate a  great Memphian and friend, Rabbi Micah Greenstein, who is celebrating  30 years of service and commitment to Temple Israel in Memphis and the  entire Jewish community.   Rabbi Greenstein is the eighth senior rabbi at Temple Israel, a  synagogue founded in the 1850s. He has served as senior rabbi for over  20 years and is now celebrating his 30th anniversary at Temple Israel.   In 1991, after completing his undergraduate and graduate degrees at  Cornell University, Harvard, and the Hebrew Union College-Jewish  Institute of Religion, Rabbi Greenstein came to Memphis, a place he and  his family have called home for more than 30 years.   Over the years, Rabbi Greenstein has served as two-time president of  the Memphis Ministers Association, was the first rabbi to speak at the  Washington National Cathedral on a major state day and has been named  by Newsweek magazine as one of the top American rabbis in 2012 and  2013.   Rabbi Greenstein has been honored with the Memphis City Council  Humanitarian Award and the Memphis Theological Seminary's President's  Humanitarian Award. As clearly demonstrated, Rabbi Greenstein has  worked throughout his career to make his community, his home in  Memphis, and his country a better place.   Mr. Speaker, when you speak with members of Temple Israel, they will  tell you how extraordinary the congregation is, and that is due to the  rabbi's dedication, his charisma, and his passion. I talked to Laurie  Meskin, the current president of Temple Israel. She stated: ``Rabbi  Greenstein has made our synagogue, Temple Israel, what it is today. He  is truly gifted at mobilizing people from near and afar, is a great  communicator and orator, and believes in a vibrant Jewish future for  all of us in Memphis.''   From my good friend and former Temple Israel president, Billy Orgel:  ``Many families at Temple Israel are very intertwined with the  Greenstein family, as everyone knows each other in Memphis. Our kids  know each other very well and are all the same age. Rabbi Micah is a  good friend who is there in sickness and in health.''   He continues: ``He is not just our rabbi, but to many in the Memphis  community, no matter their religious background, he is a close friend  as well. He is their rabbi too.''    Rabbi Greenstein has forged bonds with numerous other religious  leaders in Memphis and throughout the country. For example, he led  Memphis' first interfaith religious leaders mission to Israel years  ago.   Another friend of mine, Mark Halperin, also another former Temple  Israel president, said: ``Ultimately, the unique thing about Rabbi  Micah is that he is the whole community's rabbi. Temple Israel is a  special place, but it makes it more special to have someone like Rabbi  Micah there with us.''   In a 1999 profile of the rabbi in Memphis Magazine, the article cited  a then young college-age Micah Greenstein finishing at Harvard's JFK  School of Government and deciding to switch studies from what he said  was public service to Jewish service. The rabbi went on to say: ``I'm  doing exactly what I think God intended for me to do, to touch people's  lives in a Jewish way, to make the world more human, and to bring  people together to share their differences.''   Roberta and I congratulate Rabbi Micah, his loving wife, Sheril; and  their three children, Cara, Jake, and Julia, on this incredible 30-year  milestone.   We say mazel tov.                            ____________________
