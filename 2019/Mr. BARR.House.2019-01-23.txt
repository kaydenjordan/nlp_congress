 Article II, Section 1:   ``The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United  States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four  Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term,  be elected, as follows   ``Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof  may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators  and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress:  but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office or Trust  or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.   ``The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by  Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant  of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a List of all  the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List  they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the  Government of the United States, directed to the President of the  Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the  Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the  Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of  Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole  Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have  such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then the House of  Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of them for  President; and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest  on the List the said House shall in like Manner chuse the President.''
