 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself and Senators Risch, Hawley, and Moran.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question is from Senators Barrasso, Risch, Hawley, and Moran for  counsel to the President:         Can the Senate convict a sitting U.S. President of       obstruction of Congress for exercising the President's       constitutional authorities or rights?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, thank you for  the question.   I think the short answer is, constitutionally, no, the Senate may not  convict the President for exercising his constitutional authorities.   The theory that the House managers have presented--I think Professor  Turley, in testifying before the House, made it very clear--is itself  an abuse of power by Congress and is dangerous for the structure of our  government because the fundamental proposition at the heart of the  obstruction of Congress charge that the House managers have brought is  that the House can simply demand information.   If the executive branch resists, even if it provides lawful  rationales--perhaps ones that the House managers disagree with but that  are consistent with longstanding precedents and principles applied by  the executive branch--and if the House managers disagree with them,  they jump immediately to impeaching the President. That is dangerous  for our structure of government. We are talking about principles here-- one based on simply the failure of the House to proceed lawfully.   We have heard a lot about the President is not above the law, but as  Professor Dershowitz pointed out, the House of Representatives is not  above the law. It has to turn square corners. It has to proceed by the  proper methods to issue subpoenas to the executive branch.   So, if the House has an issue about subpoenas and if the House  attempts to subpoena a senior adviser to the President and the  President asserts the immunity of the senior adviser--a doctrine that  has been asserted by virtually every President since President Nixon  and goes back earlier than that--then there is a confrontation between  the branches. That doesn't suggest an impeachable offense. What it  suggests--what it shows--is a separation of powers in operation. That  friction between the branches is part of the constitutional design.   It was Justice Louis Brandeis who explained that the separation of  powers was enshrined in the Constitution not because it was the most  efficient way to have government, but because the friction that it  caused and the interaction between the branches was part of a way of  guaranteeing liberty by ensuring that no one branch could aggrandize  power to itself.   What the House managers are suggesting here is directly antithetical  to that fundamental principle. What they are suggesting is, once they  decide they want to pursue impeachment and when they make demands for  information to the Executive, the Executive has no defenses. It can  have no constitutional authorities or prerogatives to raise in response  to those subpoenas. It has to just turn over everything or it is an  impeachable offense. What that would lead to, as Professor Turley  explained, is transforming our system of government by elevating the  House and making it, really, a parliamentary system.    As Professor Dershowitz was explaining, in the parliamentary system,  the Prime Minister can simply be removed by a vote of no confidence,  but if you make it so easy to impeach the President--all the House has  to do is demand some information, goad a response from a President that  this is contrary to the principles that all Presidents before me have  asserted, and I am going to stick by the executive branch's  prerogatives--then the House can say: Well, that is it. You will be  impeached.   If the votes are there to remove the President, you make the  President dependent on the legislature, and that is what Gouverneur  Morris warned against specifically during the Constitutional  Convention. He warned the Framers, when we make a method for making the  President amenable to justice, we should make sure that we do not make  him dependent on the legislature.   It was the parliamentary system's making it easy to remove the Chief  Executive that the Framers wanted to reject, and this theory of  obstruction of Congress would create exactly that system of easy  removal, effectively a parliamentary system of a vote of no confidence.  That is not the structure of the government that the Framers enshrined  in the Constitution for us.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Connecticut.
