 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I wish to recognize Alexander Hug, an  exceptional international civil servant who has played a crucial role  in ensuring that the world knows the truth about Russia's aggression  against Ukraine. This Kremlin-directed war, now entering its 5th year,  is responsible for more than 10,300 fatalities and over 24,000  injuries, including as many as 9,000 civilians. It has affected 4.4  million in eastern Ukraine and displaced some 1.8 million people.   Mr. Hug, a Swiss national, completed his tour of duty as Principal  Deputy Chief Monitor of the OSCE's Special Monitoring Mission in  Ukraine on October 31. He had served in this position since 2014 and  oversaw the mission as it grew from approximately 100 monitors to more  than 700.   This unarmed civilian mission provides clear, unbiased official  reporting from the war zone on ceasefire violations and the human costs  of the conflict. It does this despite continuous threats and deliberate  attempts to undermine and sabotage its work. The mission's reporting is  a crucial counterpoint to the barrage of Kremlin propaganda that seeks  to obfuscate the true nature and scale of Russia's role as a direct  participant and the aggressor in the war.   The mission has not only kept the world informed about the true  nature of the war in eastern Ukraine; under Hug's leadership, it has  also helped mitigate the humanitarian catastrophe that the war has  caused. In particular, the negotiation of localized ceasefires has  allowed for the delivery of humanitarian aid and repairs to be made to  critical infrastructure.  [[Page S7182]]    Mr. Hug has also been a compelling advocate for basic steps toward  peace, such as the withdrawal of heavy weapons and the granting of  unfettered access to the monitoring mission across the entirety of  Ukraine's sovereign territory.   Mr. Hug's candor and clarity were on full display when he briefed a  congressional audience at a Helsinki Commission briefing on November  30, 2017. He movingly paid witness to the human costs of the conflict  and left no doubt about the sources behind the flagrant and daily  ceasefire violations that continue to fuel the fighting.   Mr. Hug's sterling reputation as a courageous, tough, and principled  diplomat is well-earned. He has personally faced significant physical  risk in service of the mission's mandate, including direct threats  against his convoy by Russia-led forces and being caught in the  crossfire between combatants. In July 2014, undeterred by an uncertain  security situation, Mr. Hug engaged personally and to great effect at  the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in eastern Ukraine.   The dangers faced by Mr. Hug and the monitors he led were made all  too clear on April 23, 2017. On that tragic day, Joseph Stone, an  American citizen, was killed when his armored vehicle hit a landmine in  territory controlled by Russia-led forces.   Alexander Hug's leadership in this challenging position, which kept  him away from his family far longer than anticipated, has been  exemplary. As chairman of the U.S. Helsinki Commission, I thank him for  his contribution to this crucial mission and for all those who have  served to advance its work, including Joseph Stone. Their selfless  dedication continues to make an inestimable contribution to the cause  of peace and security in the world.                            ____________________
