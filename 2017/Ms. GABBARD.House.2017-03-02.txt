 Mr. Speaker, as we kick off Women's History Month, I  want to recognize Women Helping Women, celebrating 40 years of service  to the people in my district of Maui County.   Since its founding in 1977, Women Helping Women has been an  indispensable source of strength and support for survivors of domestic  violence in Maui County, many of whom have fled courageously away from  life-threatening situations with nothing more than the clothes on their  backs, a few dollars in their pockets, and the desire to live without  fear. Many of these women flee with young children and have no one to  turn to and nowhere to go.   Each year, this organization serves more than 1,500 women, men, and  children on the Islands of Maui and Lanai through a variety of  programs, projects, and activities focused on direct intervention,  shelter, advocacy, education, empowerment, and prevention.   Mahalo to Women Helping Women, and congratulations on reaching this  40th anniversary year.                            ____________________
