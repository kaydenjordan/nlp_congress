 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment, not  because my colleague from Wisconsin is completely wrong about the need  for WHO accountability. The facts he stated are facts that are  troubling. But the bill that is on the floor is a bill to repeal the  Iraq war authorizations of 1991 and 2002. The bill has nothing to do  with global health or the WHO.   The Senate has not repealed a war authorization since 1971--52 years.  This is a historic debate.   When we authorized the wars in Iraq, the Gulf war and the invasion of  2003, we did it in authorizations that didn't include extraneous  amendments. The Senate deemed these important enough that other  matters, even if they were important, were not added onto the  declarations of war.   I strongly believe we should take up this repeal, keep it limited  precisely to the question on the floor--should we repeal the Iraq war  authorizations--and not add in extraneous matter, even if that matter  has some merit.   And for that reason, I would ask my colleagues to vote against the  amendment.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I  support the notion of dialogue, of course, with our strategic partners  and allies, but the purpose of this AUMF repeal is for Congress to  reclaim war powers and not outsource them to the Executive but also not  outsource them to other nations.   When we passed the Iraq war authorization in 2002, there was no  requirement that it only went into effect if we  [[Page S982]]  then went out and had dialogue with other nations. Why would we declare  war unilaterally but then say the only way to repeal it is following  dialogue with other nations?   Our allies and partners are very aware of this bill. It has been on  the floor for 2 years. There have been floor debates about it in the  House. There have been two separate markups in the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee. They are very aware of it.   All of us meet with Ambassadors. All of us meet with  Parliamentarians. If nations in the region felt that there was any  danger to this, they would have let us know. I will conclude and just  say that the American Legion also strongly opposes this amendment. I  would ask my colleagues to oppose it as well.                           Vote on Amendment No. 30     Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The bill that is on the floor is the effort to repeal authorizations  for war against Iraq that were passed by this body in 1991 and 2002.  These are not Iran authorizations. Iran and Iraq are not the same  nation. The wars against Iraq are over, and we need to repeal these.   This morning, in the Armed Services Committee, we heard from General  Austin. He talked about his visit to Iraq. He was there when we were  fighting against them as an adversary. Now they are a strategic partner  in the region against nonstate terrorists and against Iranian  aggression. They are an ally and a partner.   Senator Cruz's amendment does restate article II powers in part of  the findings in a way that I don't find objectionable; but then in  another part of the amendment, it goes on to authorize affirmative  military action by the United States against the nation of Iran.   Iran is a bad actor and is getting worse--I don't disagree with  that--but if what we need is a debate about a war authorization with  Iran, we shouldn't do it on the basis of a 1-minute amendment offered  on the floor of the Senate. That is how we got into this problem in the  first place. The Iraq authorization in 2002 was considered in the  Senate for 1 day, with no committee proceeding. There were five  amendments in 1 day, and we went into a war that most would agree was  one of the worst blunders strategically that this body has made. Let's  not rush into a war authorization with Iran. If there needs to be  military authorities to take offensive action against Iran, let's, at  least, give it the dignity of a debate--a full debate--and not a 1- minute amendment vote.   Finally, this amendment is opposed by groups all over the political  spectrum, from Concerned Veterans for America to the Friends Committee  on National Legislation to the American Legion, because they don't  think we should be rushing into war. Iran and its challenging activity  and aggression warrant some significant attention, not a 1-minute  amendment vote on a bill that it is not related to.   I urge opposition to the amendment.    Mr. President, I respect my Armed Services colleague from  Alaska, but I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Iraq is not Iran. The bill that is on the floor is to repeal war  authorizations voted on by this body against Iraq in 1991 and 2002.  Iraq is not Iran.   The President of the United States has sent two messages to this body  saying that the repeal of the Iraq war authorizations are necessary  because Iraq is now a partner of the United States and that the repeal  will neither jeopardize any current military operation, make the United  States less safe, or take options away from the President to defend  against Iranian aggression.   The certification has been given by the President. This is a bill  that would ask one of his subordinates, who has been available to talk  to any of us by phone in the 2 weeks this bill has been on the table-- it would basically say: OK, Mr. President, you said this, but we want  to hear from one of your subordinates.   Avril Haines has been available to talk to any Member of this Senate  in the 2 weeks this bill has been on the floor. The President has  indicated this would not jeopardize our ability to defend against the  activities of Iran-backed militias. We should not conflate Iraq, now a  partner of the United States, with Iran, an adversary of the United  States.   I urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. President, I don't have an objection to the notion  that the funds we are spending together in Ukraine should have careful  analysis. We know from past experience, if there is not that careful  analysis done, there could be problems. This is not the bill to do it.   When we do war authorizations, we don't put other amendments on, no  matter how good they might be, if they are extraneous to the war  authorization. The 1991 and 2002 war authorizations did not include  additional items, no matter how meritorious they might have been.   So while this idea is an idea that I think people can gravitate  toward, I think this is the wrong bill, the wrong vehicle, to insert  something about Ukraine into this repeal of the Iraq war  authorizations.   We have not done a repeal for 52 years. The authorizations themselves  were clean authorizations.   I would urge a ``no'' vote so that the repeal, when we vote on it  tomorrow, will be a clean repeal. I would urge my colleagues to vote  no.
