 Mr. Speaker, it is always an honor for me to  stand here in the well of the House to know that I am one of less than  450 people in the world who have been accorded the preeminent privilege  of standing in the well of the Congress of the United States of  America.                                time  1045    It is an honor to stand here at this podium with a rostrum behind me  with the word ``Justice'' etched in it. Right behind me, ``Justice'' is  etched into the rostrum. You can't see it at home because it is low,  and it is beneath the view of the camera.   Today, I want to talk about justice, Mr. Speaker. I want to talk  about justice and the Justice Department. I do this, Mr. Speaker,  because we have a President-elect who has said he will be a law and  order President. I want to make a distinction between law and order and  justice, and I want to attribute this to the Justice Department versus  a law and order department.   Mr. Speaker, you can have law and order in a dungeon, but you won't  have justice. There is law and order in North Korea, but you don't have  justice. Justice, Mr. Speaker, is what this Department is all about. It  is not the law and order department. One of the best ways to explain it  is to harken back to something that was called to our attention  yesterday at the hearing for the nominee to become the head of the  Justice Department.   When the Honorable John Lewis spoke, he went back to 1965, and the  crossing of the Edmund Pettus Bridge. On that day, George Wallace--one  of the great segregationists of his time and, perhaps, the greatest  segregationist of his time--had made it perspicuously clear to his  troops that, if you maintain order, there will be law to protect you.  As a result, those troops beat the marches all the way back to the  church where they started. They were peaceful protesters. The Honorable  John Lewis said he thought he might die. That is what law and order  meant to a good many people in the South.   Law and order without justice is what took place on that day; but  thank God there was a judge, the Honorable Frank M. Johnson. The  Honorable Frank M. Johnson issued the order to allow those marches to  move from Selma to Montgomery, and he did it notwithstanding his  classmate George Wallace having said that they were banned from doing  it. This was justice, not law and order alone. This is our fear--that  the Justice Department will go back to the hands of someone who may  consider it a law and order department and a department in which there  is a belief that you can do anything to maintain the order and that  there will be law to support your actions and activities.   Mr. Speaker, we must protect the notion of justice for all people in  this country. This is why I was there yesterday to lend my support to  Senator Booker when he spoke about justice and when he indicated that  he could not support the nominee. I was honored to be there, seated  right near the Honorable John Lewis when he said he could not support  the nominee. I was also honored to be there with the head of the  Congressional Black Caucus, Cedric Richmond, when he indicated: If this  nominee is a civil rights advocate, why is the civil rights community  so opposed to him? I think those were some very sage comments.   I must tell you that we in this country have come too far to allow  the Justice Department to become the law and order department.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk  as the designee of the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters).    Mr. Chairman, I think it appropriate to point  out what the style of this bill is, what the words on the actual bill  say. There seems to be some confusion with my colleagues on the other  side as to whether or not this is a mom-and-pop bill.   The bill itself says, ``A bill to improve the consideration by the  Securities and Exchange Commission of the cost and benefits of its  regulations and orders.''   The Securities and Exchange Commission deals with Wall Street, deals  with megabusinesses. This is not about a mom-and-pop store. This is not  about the small business in the neighborhood. This is about  megabusinesses desiring to have access to markets without the  regulations necessary to protect investors.   This bill, if it passes, will place the SEC in a mission impossible  position because it will be impossible for the SEC to do what it needs  to do to promote regulations that will prevent fraud. Either litigation  will stop them or they won't be able to define and quantify the  benefits associated with regulation that can prevent fraud.   A good example has been presented, but some things bear repeating. If  we had produced regulations that would have prevented Bernie Madoff  from robbing the country of $64 billion, we wouldn't have known it, we  couldn't quantify it, because it wasn't knowable.   This bill puts the SEC in a position of having to do that which is  not knowable because it would prevent fraud.                                time  1530    Now, having said this, the Waters amendment will at least allow us to  curtail some of the conflicts of interest that can take place by  persons who will come from some entity that works with persons on Wall  Street or when they leave, go to an entity that works with Wall Street.  Our regulators ought not be able to take their rules and regulations to  companies and businesses that will impact Wall Street after they leave  or impact their businesses once they are on Wall Street.   This amendment that the Honorable Maxine Waters has presented would  cause the SEC to identify, analyze, and address potential conflicts of  interest in its proposed rules, and it would go on to make sure that  persons who work for the SEC do not create conflicts of interest.   We live in a world where it is not enough for things to be right;  they must also look right. It doesn't look right for these Wall Street  types, the persons from Goldman Sachs and related industries who will  come to Wall Street, take jobs, and promote rules that benefit their  former employers, nor does it look right for them to produce rules that  will benefit employers that they will go to when they leave Wall  Street.   That is what this amendment will prevent. It is simple. It is not  complicated, and it deals with conflicts of interest. I think this  amendment ought to be supported.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have  remaining?    Mr. Chairman, let me say this in my 1 minute.  It appears that the other side believes that nothing is better because  that is what this bill would cause the SEC to produce--nothing. It  would stagnate the SEC. It would place the SEC in litigation. It would  literally decimate the SEC because you cannot quantify bills or  regulations that will prevent fraud. You can't quantify it. I have  given you the example.   I know the public is listening. You need to weigh in on this, members  of the public, because this is not about mom-and-pops. It is about  megacorporations. This piece of legislation that Ms. Waters offers at  least  [[Page H439]]  will deal with conflicts of interest beyond the person who happens to  work with the SEC, which is what has been addressed. It will deal with  conflicts of interest as they relate to the businesses that they will  go to or the businesses that they have left.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would exclude from  this bill regulations that would promote financial stability and  prevent or reduce systemic risk. I have indicated previously that we  are concerned about the bill's unintended consequence--I don't think  that my colleagues are doing this with malice aforethought--the  unintended consequence of stagnating the SEC to the point that it  cannot produce regulations that will prevent fraud. Nowhere in the bill  does it exempt regulation that will prevent fraud.   I believe that this will help us because the bill needs to allow the  SEC the ability to move at the speed of innovation. These products are  coming on the market. The best way for the SEC to be able to react to  them efficaciously would be for the SEC to have rulemaking authority at  the same speed of the innovation.   I hope that we won't allow the SEC to be bogged down with a cost- benefit  [[Page H440]]  analysis that is impossible to produce and that, when produced, will  produce litigation. Again, I think this is a reasoned, thoughtful  amendment. I trust that it will be adopted.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Chairman, I would remind my friend across  the aisle that the Volcker rule does deal with systemic risk. I would  remind him that the SEC does play a role in regulating systemic risk.   Having said that, let's just talk again. And I would engage in a  colloquy with you and use my time. Explain to me how you would quantify  a regulation designed to prevent fraud such as the fraud perpetrated by  Madoff.   How would you quantify it in dollars and cents? Because that is what  you are all about, dollars and cents. How do you quantify that?    I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.    Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, it does have  to do--you are trying to divert us from the actual problem, which is  regulations that can prevent fraud.   How do you propose to quantify in dollars and cents regulations that  will prevent fraud when the fraud that can be perpetrated is not  knowable?   I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.    Reclaiming my time, there is no way for anyone  to have known.    I reclaim my time. There is no way for anyone  to have known what Bernie Madoff was going to do. It was not knowable.  You are imposing a mission impossible upon the SEC.   There is a real question that has to be answered today, Mr. Chair, or  at some point in the future: Does Congress regulate Wall Street or does  Wall Street regulate Congress?   Now, this is a serious question because that is what this kind of  regulation gives us the image of being a part of.   Wall Street wants this. This benefits Wall Street. It doesn't benefit  mom and pops. It doesn't benefit Main Street. It benefits  megacorporations. And you can couch the language in any clever way that  you want.   In the final analysis, this is all about megacorporations being able  to do things that would prevent--that would not be in the best interest  of investors. Investors who are listening to this. You ought to be  concerned. This impacts you. If this legislation passes, your  opportunity to participate in Wall Street with regulations that are  going to prevent fraud from being perpetrated upon you--similar to what  Madoff perpetrated--will not be possible.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in closing, let me simply say  this: People who are viewing this at home should become very much  concerned about the direction that we are headed in. This is a new  Congress and here we are currently trying to emasculate the SEC by  putting it in a position such that it cannot produce rules to  protecting investors; by requiring it to know the unknowable; to know  that a rule that you are putting in place to prevent fraud has a  quantifiable dollar amount that you can produce so that you can measure  that against the cost of producing the rule.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment that I propose would benefit the SEC and  investors.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
