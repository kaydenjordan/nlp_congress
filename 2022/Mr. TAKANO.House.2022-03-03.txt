 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and  I am pleased to support this amendment by the gentlewoman and  Congressman Rouzer.   It will require DOD to submit to Congress a report on sources of PFAS  on military installations other than aqueous film-forming foam and  providing recommendations regarding whether to expand registry  eligibility to individuals exposed to PFAS from other sources.   The PFAS data gathered by this amendment will be a tremendous value  as VA, DOD, and other agencies across our Federal Government continue  their research related to this important matter.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes''.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the amendment  introduced by Representatives Ruiz, Ryan, and Gonzalez-Colon.   Madam Speaker, I want to take my 30 seconds to just say how much this  bill, the Honoring our PACT Act, rests on the work, passion, and energy  of the gentleman from the neighboring district in Riverside County,  which we both have the honor to represent.   Dr. Ruiz has brought his tremendous knowledge as a doctor, somebody  with three medically-related degrees from Harvard University--the first  Latino to do so. I can't say enough about the work that he has done to  make this possible, and we all are grateful.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of Congressman Ryan's  bipartisan amendment.   Let me just say that the PACT Act is something that this Congress  must do, and the Republican substitute is simply what we, this  Congress, can get away with. We cannot simply rest on what we can get  away with.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
