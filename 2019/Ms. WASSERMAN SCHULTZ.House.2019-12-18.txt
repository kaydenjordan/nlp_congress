 Madam Speaker, throughout this process, I  listened, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform,  to career diplomats testify in depositions and found myself  contemplating the gravity of this decision.   One of my daughters asked then how I would make my decision about  impeachment. I told her that, when her future children learn about  President Trump's impeachment, they may ask: ``Mommy, what did Grandma  do?'' I want my daughter to be able to tell her children Grandma did  the right thing because, in America, no one is above the law.   With his conduct around Ukraine, President Trump corruptly abused his  power for his own interests, at direct odds with our national welfare  and our Constitution. This President put his interests before those of  this Nation. Left unchecked, he would do it again and has said so.   The actions and ongoing schemes that led us to this moment are severe  threats to our national security and democracy that we cannot defend or  dismiss.   With history watching, I must fulfill my constitutional duty and vote  to impeach this President. His corrupt conduct and assault on our  Constitution leave no other choice.
