 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Captain Stephen Grace, a  young, beloved father, husband, son, brother, and U.S. airman who died  unexpectedly before his time.   Stephen grew up in my hometown of Cincinnati. From an early age, he  dreamed of being an Air Force pilot. He had a competitive spirit, a  calling to service, and a love for life. It all came too easily for  Stephen.   He excelled in the swimming pool, a gifted swimmer who emphasized  self-improvement and self-accountability. He helped lead my alma mater,  St. Xavier High School, to the high school State swimming titles.   St. Xavier has a motto: ``Be Men for Others.'' Stephen lived that  motto in his time with us, and it was no surprise to those who knew him  when he was accepted and attended the U.S. Air Force Academy in  Colorado.   He went on to pilot the F-16 and recently became an F-35 instructor,  a remarkable feat that stands as a testament to his leadership and his  ability.   Stephen Grace represented everything you want an American to be:  hardworking and selfless. Stephen was well-loved and looked up to. He  lived his dream. He served his country. He embodied a higher ideal, one  of service above self.   While he is gone far too soon, few can claim the extraordinary legacy  he leaves behind for all of us. We pray for the family of Captain  Stephen Grace; for his daughter, Georgia; his wife, Kelsey; for his  parents, Robert and Christina; and for his sisters, Shannon and  Kathleen.   Stephen, a grateful Nation salutes you.                            ____________________
