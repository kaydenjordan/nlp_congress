 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 8351, the Formula Act.   I thank my friend from Nebraska, Mr. Adrian Smith, and Mr. Blumenauer  for their leadership on this bill.   With families facing record-high inflation, with record-high food and  gas prices, the last thing that parents need to worry about is being  able to find formula, much less being able then to afford it.   H.R. 8351 ensures that families are not covering the cost of  additional taxes on formula imported into the United States, and I am  pleased with the relief that this bill will provide.   But, unfortunately, as has been the mantra of this administration,  this crisis exemplifies just another self-inflicted wound that has been  the point of the Biden administration. The administration knew about  the impending shortage and failed to act to avert the crisis.   The incompetence of this administration has real world effects. We  are talking about something that is basic sustenance for infants in  this country. They need this, and this bill will help bring  affordability to parents for their children.   Madam Speaker, I thank, again, my colleagues and encourage their  support of this legislation.
