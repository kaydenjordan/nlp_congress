 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 382, which would  abruptly and irresponsibly end the COVID-19 public health emergency  virtually overnight. It would require this action immediately without  providing patients, hospitals, providers, and States sufficient notice  to safely unwind numerous authorities, programs, and flexibilities that  have been essential to protecting Americans throughout the pandemic.   Last night, the Biden administration announced that the COVID-19  public health emergency is planned to be ended on May 11, 2023. This  timeline provides healthcare providers and patients with the certainty  and predictability needed to responsibly wind down the COVID-19  response programs.   As a result of these successful programs, as well as the historic  investments made by Congress, millions of Americans have received free  vaccines and tests, safe access to their doctors through telehealth  appointments, and continuous healthcare coverage through programs such  as Medicaid and CHIP.                                time  1415    Unfortunately, Republicans are needlessly rushing forward today with  a reckless plan that would jeopardize the health of millions of  Americans by immediately ceasing these important response programs  without advanced preparations.   Mr. Speaker, a pandemic of this magnitude cannot be unwound  overnight. We cannot flip a switch and make COVID-19 end with the snap  of a finger. If H.R. 382 becomes law, it would have disastrous  consequences. It would disrupt insurance coverage for millions of  vulnerable Americans by allowing States to immediately start kicking  vulnerable Americans off their healthcare coverage without any  protections. This is deeply irresponsible and dangerous.   Americans would also immediately begin paying out of pocket for the  COVID-19 testing, and hospitals would see an immediate payment cut of  20 percent for Medicare patients with COVID-19. In addition, important  waivers and flexibilities, including certain telemedicine flexibilities  that providers and patients have relied on for the duration of the  COVID-19 pandemic, would be terminated immediately, as well.   This legislation would also result in the elimination of vital tools  for tracking COVID-19 outbreaks in nursing homes and other residential  facilities.   It also impacts our veterans, ending VA clinicians' ability to  prescribe controlled substances via telehealth. This would severely  impact many veterans' access to medications that they need to manage  chronic pain, complex mental health conditions, and substance use  disorder. The legislation also threatens the progress the VA has made  in ending veterans' homelessness.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, it would abruptly end flexibilities for the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, that would impact  many Americans struggling to put food on their tables, particularly for  those having trouble finding work and low-income college students.   The Republicans began their House majority with chaos and confusion  earlier this month, and this bill continues that chaos and confusion,  but this time it will hurt millions of Americans directly, and that is  simply not right.   Responsibly transitioning to the post-emergency future requires  careful planning and coordination with public health officials and  policymakers. I applaud the Biden administration for properly guiding  the Nation to a safe transition as we unwind these programs without  endangering access to care and treatment for Americans.   Unfortunately, Republicans are rushing to recklessly and dangerously  eliminate all these protections immediately and without warning. I just  think it is the height of irresponsibility. For that reason, I strongly  urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Ms. Sheila Jackson Lee, my colleague, for  everything that she just said.   I remember so many times during the first year of the COVID pandemic  when she was calling me and trying to get testing sites, trying to make  sure that a lot of her constituents were tested and had received the  vaccine.   It is very easy for our colleagues on the other side now to say,  well, this is over. It is time to move on. But the bottom line is that  we never know for sure exactly what is going to manifest itself. Even  when the President said yesterday that he is planning on ending this  public health emergency on May 11, notice he said ``plan'' because we  are not sure that that is possible.   In any case, it makes no sense to just say that we are going to do  this immediately upon enactment of this bill--which is not going to be  enacted, but nonetheless--because we need to do a lot of preparation  and planning. We did some of that even in the omnibus that passed at  the end of the last session with continuous eligibility for Medicaid,  for example.   My understanding is the way this bill is worded, that would end if  this passed immediately, as well.   Mr. Speaker, so our point is that this is a pandemic that we just  have to be very careful about what we do. We have to do adequate  preparation.   The President has said May 11 is the likely date. That is fine. But  it has to be based on science. We shouldn't be  [[Page H536]]  getting up here and say, ``end it immediately.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on both  sides?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Moskowitz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I listened to my colleague from Kentucky, but as much as I respect  him, I totally disagree with what he has been saying here.   Under the public law right now, the emergency--when it starts, when  it ends--is done by the administration. Specifically, the Secretary of  Health and Human Services, I guess, recommends to the President. There  is a reason for that, and that is because he gets all this information  from various sources about the science, about when we should be doing  this.   I disagree to say that we, as the Congress, should be the ones that  make that determination either to begin or end.   In addition to that, the gentleman from Kentucky mentioned in  response to one of my Democratic colleagues the provision that we  passed in the last Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act to negotiate  prices for prescription drugs under Medicare. The fact of the matter is  that wasn't a cut to Medicare. That was a way of trying to make drug  prices more affordable for our seniors.   To suggest that somehow that is a cut I don't think is accurate. I  mean, this is a major savings to seniors out of pocket once this  program goes into effect.   By way of background, again, some of my Democratic colleagues have  stressed that we hear constantly from the other side of the aisle this  idea that the Republicans are going to refuse to raise the debt ceiling  unless they can cut Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid and other  vital programs. They seem so determined to cut Americans' healthcare  that they are willing to recklessly risk defaulting on the national  debt and wreaking havoc on the economy.    Again, it is the same thing here. What we are saying is if you cut  off this public health emergency earlier than what the President is  suggesting, under this bill, you end a lot of programs that are very  important: continuous eligibility for Medicaid, a 20 percent cut in  hospital payments, free testing, free vaccines.   I mean, all this ends, and it makes no sense, in my opinion. We  should be trying to do what we can to help American families and make  the right decisions based on the science.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say this in closing. We do have one more  speaker, though.   I think that this legislation that is before us today is totally  unnecessary and creates all kinds of problems. In other words, the  President has indicated his plan is to end the emergency on, I believe  he said, May 12. We estimated it would probably end sometime in April  of this year when we were working on the omnibus at the end of last  year. We put in the omnibus a lot of protections and guardrails for  when the public health emergency would end, but there is still more  that needs to be done.   My concern is that the way this bill is written, it basically  eliminates a lot of those guardrails, a lot of those protections, like  the continuous eligibility for Medicaid.   At the same time, it doesn't allow, because it says immediately upon  enactment, us to wind this down in an effective way so that we don't  have problems like the 20 percent cut for hospitals, eliminating  continuous eligibility, free testing, free vaccines.   There are so many things here that the public relies on--I didn't  even mention the veterans, the nursing homes, the SNAP program--that,  to me, it is reckless to say we are just going to end it immediately.   Let's shelve this legislation. I suggest a ``no'' vote. Let the  President and this administration wind this process down in an  effective way to protect Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Takano), who is the ranking member on the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to this bill. As Mr.  Takano said, so many things will immediately end needlessly from this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 497, a bill I  consider reckless that endangers the health and well-being of  Americans. With this legislation, House Republicans are putting  politics over science. The legislation would eliminate the COVID-19  vaccine requirement for healthcare workers. It ignores the fact that  vaccination of healthcare workers saves lives and protects the most  vulnerable.   The bill has had no hearings, no markups, no opportunity to examine  its impact on our healthcare system. It is what we call regular order.  But I am not saying that it should have had hearings or markups in  committee just for regular order. I believe that if Republicans had  taken the time to solicit input on this bill, they would have heard  from healthcare leaders that H.R. 497 will jeopardize the health and  safety of providers, patients, and their families. That is why we have  committee hearings. That is why we have committee markups, to hear and  get input from our constituents.   COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and they have been  essential to saving lives, rebuilding our economy, and protecting the  health of our communities. More than 668 million  [[Page H541]]  COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered here in the United  States, which has resulted in 120 million fewer COVID-19 infections,  18.5 million fewer hospitalizations, and 3.2 million lives saved.   These vaccines are especially vital to protecting the most vulnerable  in our community, including seniors, people with disabilities, and  people living in nursing homes. The public health data clearly shows  that increased vaccination in nursing homes has prevented additional  hospitalizations and saved lives. New deaths among nursing home  residents decreased by 83 percent once vaccination efforts began.   We also know that vaccination of healthcare providers has protected  our healthcare workforce and saved lives by ensuring that patients can  receive safe, essential, and timely care. Prior to the availability of  COVID-19 vaccines, healthcare providers were at higher risk of becoming  infected with COVID-19, endangering themselves and their families while  leaving patients without access to care when they needed it most. That  is why more than 50 healthcare organizations representing doctors,  nurses, and hospitals, agree that requiring COVID-19 vaccination of  healthcare workers saves lives and improves health outcomes.   My colleague from Indiana mentioned the U.S. Supreme Court. They  actually upheld the vaccine mandate for healthcare workers.   Mr. Speaker, vaccines mandates are also not new. Healthcare workers  are often required to receive vaccinations for a variety of infectious  diseases. Many States have requirements that healthcare workers be  vaccinated against communicable diseases like hepatitis, flu, and  measles, mumps, or rubella.   Why wouldn't we want the same requirements to prevent the continued  spread of COVID-19, especially amongst our most vulnerable?   Again, in response to my colleague from Indiana, the healthcare  workforce has grown since the vaccine requirement, with more healthcare  providers and staff employed, for example, on December 10, 2022, than  prior to when the COVID-19 vaccine requirement went into effect. As of  December 2022, employment in the healthcare sector was 1.2 percent  higher than the previous peak of February 2020.   Data shows requiring COVID-19 vaccination of healthcare workers did  not contribute to worsening of staffing shortages in nursing homes.  Nursing homes who were experiencing staffing shortages prior to COVID- 19 had staffing levels remain stable after the COVID-19 vaccine  requirement went into effect.   But I have to say, I was most disappointed yesterday. Yesterday, I  was at the Rules Committee, last evening, where some of my Republican  colleagues chose to ignore the broad-based scientific and medical  consensus that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective at reducing  deaths and hospitalizations. Instead, some of my Republican colleagues  chose to spend their time entertaining fringe theories about vaccine  side effects and propagating vaccine myths, despite the fact that  millions of Americans have received the COVID-19 vaccine safely and  with no effect on their health.   It is just truly disappointing to me that this is what we have come  to in the United States Congress. The last thing that I want on either  side of this aisle is for any of us to make statements on this floor-- and I know you are not saying that, my colleague from Indiana--but I am  just so afraid that so much of this rhetoric, particularly last night  in the Rules Committee, is giving the impression to the public that  they shouldn't take the vaccine. If you listened to the Rules Committee  last night and the Republican comments, you would have assumed that;  you would suggest that. I think it is very dangerous. People should be  taking the vaccine.   Finally, this legislation, I want to say, is also a distraction from  Republicans' true agenda on healthcare, which they are continuing to  work on behind closed doors, and that is to cut healthcare and  retirement for millions of Americans. Republicans have repeatedly  pledged that they will refuse to raise the debt limit unless they can  cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other vital programs. They  are so determined to cut Americans' healthcare that they are willing to  recklessly risk defaulting on the national debt and wreaking havoc on  the economy in order to do so.    If successful, their actions will result in millions of Americans  losing benefits and lifesaving protections, including seniors, children  with complex medical needs, people with disabilities, and pregnant and  postpartum women. This is unconscionable.   I want to underscore that Democrats will not fall for this  manufactured crisis, and we will not, under any circumstances, agree to  cut these vital programs.   I hope I am wrong. I hope I won't see the other side moving toward  these types of cuts. They are unacceptable to us.   I would just say, Democrats are committed to putting families first.  We will continue to follow the science to fight COVID-19. We will build  on the success of the most productive Democratic Congress in modern  history and fight to ensure that Americans have access to affordable  and quality healthcare, further lower healthcare, and prescription drug  costs, and support our healthcare workforce.   This legislation is dangerous, and I strongly urge my colleagues to  oppose it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), who is the  [[Page H542]]  Ranking Member of our Subcommittee on Innovation, Data, and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor), who is the ranking member of our Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr.  Robert Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to correct certain things that are being said on  the other side of the aisle.   First of all, the fact of the matter is that the healthcare workforce  has grown since the vaccine requirement. There are more healthcare  workers now than there were before.   The other thing I keep hearing from my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle is that the COVID-19 vaccines do not help prevent  infection from the disease. That is factually incorrect. Although  breakthrough infections do occur, especially with more transmissible  variants of the disease, COVID-19 vaccines still help in preventing  infection and reduce transmission.   In fact, according to a study released just this month, it is  confirmed that vaccinated individuals were likely to be less infectious  than unvaccinated individuals, and the likelihood of transmission fell  by 11 percent for each dose of the vaccine.   Moreover, we know that vaccination and continued upkeep with boosters  continues to protect the public from infection. According to CDC, the  most recent COVID-19 boosters cut the likelihood of infection by more  than one-half in those who have gotten them.   As I hope none of us will dispute, even when there is breakthrough  infection, vaccines are safe, effective, and dramatically reduce the  length of illness. That matters for healthcare workers because we still  have thousands of people hospitalized every day with COVID-19, cancer,  and other grave illnesses, and without COVID-19 vaccines, we would have  fewer people there to take care of them.   COVID-19 vaccines reduce infections, and they save lives. We can't  let disinformation dictate our policy choices in this debate. We have  to refer to the science.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Jacobs).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, I know that the previous speaker is a physician, and I respect  her, but I have to continue to point out that this idea that vaccines  don't help prevent infection from the disease is factually incorrect.   I mentioned before various studies, and I include in the Record a  study by Berkeley Lovelace, Jr., that shows that the vaccine does cut  the infection risk.                       [From NBC News, Jan. 25, 2023]   Updated Covid Boosters Cut the Infection Risk From XBB.1.5 Subvariant                         by Nearly Half, CDC Finds                         (By Berkeley Lovelace Jr.)         The updated Covid boosters reduce the risk of Covid       infection from the predominant omicron subvariant by nearly       half, according to early data published Wednesday by the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.        In adults up to age 49, the latest boosters from Pfizer-      BioNTech and Moderna were 48% effective against symptomatic       infection from the XBB.1.5 subvariant, the new report said.       As of Jan. 21, that subvariant accounted for about 1 in 2 new       cases in the U.S.        Protection was lower in older groups: The boosters were 40%       effective in adults ages 50 to 64 and 43% effective in people       65 and older.        The findings are ``quite reassuring,'' Dr. Brendan Jackson,       the head of the CDC's Covid response, said on a call with       reporters Wednesday. ``These updated vaccines are protecting       people against the latest Covid-19 variants.''        The Covid boosters were modified in the summer to target       the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants, in addition to the       original strain of the coronavirus first identified in Wuhan,       China, in 2019.        BA.5 was the dominant variant in the U.S. in the fall, but       now accounts for only 2% of new cases.        As of last Wednesday, only about 15% of people in the U.S.       had received an updated booster, according to CDC data.        ``With this data, we see there is a benefit that might       convince some people to sign up and get a bivalent booster,''       said Dr. Peter Hotez, the co-director of the Center for       Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital and the dean       of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor       College of Medicine in Houston.        The CDC report is based on test results from more than       29,100 adults with Covid symptoms who were tested at       pharmacies nationwide from Dec. 1 through Jan. 13.        People who were vaccinated but had not received the updated       booster were compared to those who got the updated booster in       the previous two to three months. Those who hadn't received       the updated booster had their last vaccine dose about 13       months ago, Ruth Link-Gelles, who heads the CDC's vaccine       effectiveness program, said on the call.        The protection provided by the booster is on par with       what's typically seen with the flu vaccine. Flu vaccine       effectiveness varies  [[Page H546]]       from season to season, but the shots reduce the risk of the       flu by 40% to 60%, according to the CDC.        Dr. Greg Poland, the director of the Mayo Clinic Vaccine       Research Group in Rochester, Minnesota, cautioned that the       CDC's estimate on the updated boosters may be an       overestimate.        People who got the updated boosters are probably ``much       more likely to wear masks indoors or restrain their travel or       not go to indoor restaurants,'' he said.        He also pointed out that the CDC data doesn't capture       people who were vaccinated with the updated booster but were       asymptomatic, or people who were sick enough that they went       to the hospital.        Hotez said that while the CDC's findings appear promising,       he'd like to see data on how well the boosters perform       against symptomatic infections after five or six months.        He said he'd also like to see more data on how well the       updated boosters work against hospitalization.        Jackson, of the CDC, said on the call that the agency is       releasing data later Wednesday that found the updated       boosters reduced the risk of death from Covid by nearly       thirteenfold, compared to people who are unvaccinated.        The data, he said, also found that people who got the       updated booster had more than twofold lower rates of death       from Covid compared to vaccinated people who did not get it.        The CDC's report comes a day before a meeting of the Food       and Drug Administration's advisory committee that will       discuss simplifying the Covid vaccination schedule.        In a document posted online Monday, the FDA proposed using       the bivalent formula in all Covid vaccines moving forward,       not just for booster shots.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from the  University of California San Francisco regarding COVID-19 vaccines  reducing transmission.      [From the University of California San Francisco, Jan. 2, 2023]     Covid-19 Vaccines, Prior Infection Reduce Transmission of Omicron                            (By Laura Kurtzman)         Vaccination and boosting, especially when recent, helped to       limit the spread of COVID-19 in California prisons during the       first Omicron wave, according to an analysis by researchers       at UC San Francisco that examined transmission between people       living in the same cell.        The study demonstrates the benefits of vaccination and       boosting, even in settings where many people are still       getting infected, in reducing transmission. And it shows the       cumulative effects from boosting and the additional       protection that vaccination gives to those who were       previously infected. The likelihood of transmission fell by       11% for each additional dose.        vaccines reduce risk of serious illness from omicron infection         In dense populations such as prisons, vaccines were shown       to significantly reduce the risk of hospitalization and death       from Omicron infections.        Of over 20,000 confirmed Omicron infections in California       prisons, there were 31 hospitalizations and no deaths       attributed to COVID-19 infection.        Vaccinated residents with breakthrough infections were       significantly less likely to transmit them: 28% versus 36%       for those who were unvaccinated.        ``A lot of the benefits of vaccines to reduce       infectiousness were from people who had received boosters and       people who had been recently vaccinated,'' said Nathan Lo,       M.D., Ph.D, a faculty research fellow in the Division of HIV,       Infectious Diseases and Global Medicine at UCSF and the       senior author of the study, published Jan. 2, 2022, in Nature       Medicine. ``Our findings are particularly relevant to       improving health for the incarcerated population.''        The researchers analyzed deidentified data collected by the       California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation       (CDCR). This included COVID-19 test results, vaccine status       and housing locations for 111,687 residents, 97% of whom were       male, between Dec. 15, 2021, and May 20, 2022.        Breakthrough infections were common, despite the residents'       relatively high vaccination rate of 81% with the primary       vaccine series. But the rate of serious illness was low. In       just over five months, there were 22,334 confirmed SARS-CoV-2       Omicron infections, 31 hospitalizations and no COVID-19       deaths.        Vaccinated residents with breakthrough infections were       significantly less likely to transmit them: 28% versus 36%       for those who were unvaccinated. But the likelihood of       transmission grew by 6% for every five weeks that passed       since someone's last vaccine shot.        Natural immunity from a prior infection also had a       protective effect, and the risk of transmitting the virus was       23% for someone with a reinfection compared to 33% for       someone who had never been infected:        ``A lot of the benefits of vaccines to reduce       infectiousness were from people who had received boosters and       people who had been recently vaccinated.''--Nathan Lo, M.D.,       Ph.D        Those with hybrid immunity, from both infection and       vaccination, were 40% less likely to transmit the virus. Half       of that protection came from the immunity that one acquires       from fighting an infection and the other half came from being       vaccinated.        The researchers said they were gratified to see that       vaccination confers addition protection even for those who       had already been infected, but they were surprised by how       much the infection continued to spread, despite the       residents' relatively high vaccination rates.        ``Regardless of the benefits you see in vaccination and       prior infection, there is still a high amount of transmission       in this study,'' said Sophia Tan, a researcher in Lo's lab       and the study's first author. ``We hope these findings can       support ongoing efforts to protect this vulnerable       population.''        This includes making efforts to keep residents current with       boosters and increasing the vaccination rate of the prison       staff, only 73 percent of whom had received the primary       series at the time of the study.        The general rate of boosting could also be improved       significantly. At the time of the study, just 59% of       residents and 41% of staff had received all the doses       recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention (CDC), based on their age and health status.        ``Within the two months following vaccination, people are       the least infectious, which indicates that boosters and large       timed vaccination campaigns may have a role to reduce       transmission in surges,'' Lo said. ``New ideas are needed       since the risk of infection in this vulnerable population       remains so great.''     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time because I believe the other side has more speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, one of the things that hasn't come up, and it didn't  come up in Rules last night as well, we have exemptions for this  mandate for people who have serious religious convictions or medical  reasons to grant an exemption. No one has mentioned that, but I think  it is important that that exists.   The mandate exists, but at the same time, if people have serious  religious reservations or they have medical conditions that would  result in having an exemption, those do exist. I think everyone should  understand that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman has additional speakers, I  continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I stress again that for people who have serious religious  reservations, for people who have medical conditions, they can get  exemptions from the mandate.   In addition to that, I know that the previous gentleman on the  Republican side talked about risks and side effects. The FDA and CDC  have been transparent that there are rare side effects that may happen  to some individuals when they take the vaccines, but they and  independent health experts all agree that the benefits of being  vaccinated far outweigh the risks of any side effects.   Arguments from the other side of the aisle insinuating an inflated  risk of side effects also ignore the risks associated with contracting  COVID-19 as an unvaccinated individual. COVID-19 is a dangerous disease  that has killed over a million of our fellow Americans, and the  vaccines are safe and effective. They are strongly protective against  severe illness and death.   Mr. Speaker, I am very concerned that some Members use their  opportunity to speak on the floor--and I am not saying that the people  who spoke here have, but last night I certainly heard it in the Rules  Committee--to fan the flames of misinformation when describing the  risks of side effects when the risks of being unvaccinated are so  grave.   I just think that this is dangerous and opposed by virtually every  public health and medical organization. They are saying that they  recommend the vaccine. Again, there may be some rare side effects.  There may be some people that, you know, would seek to have exemptions.  Let's try to understand that this is often a difficult situation, but  the bottom line is that vaccines have saved millions of lives, and we  can't give the impression that that is not the case.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I am just so concerned that we are seeing another  example here on the floor today of what I call Republican extremism.  Republicans are keeping up their commitment to extremism, in my  opinion, by attempting to eliminate the COVID-19 vaccine requirement  for healthcare workers.   Mr. Speaker, this is really dangerous legislation that is going to  strain our healthcare system, exacerbate existing staffing shortages,  and further limit American families' access to healthcare.   With H.R. 497, the Republicans are really putting politics over  science. Democrats are committed to putting families first, where we  can continue to follow the science to fight COVID-19. We are going to  build on the success. We had a lot of success in the previous Congress  in so many things to make sure that Americans have access to affordable  and quality healthcare, to further lower healthcare costs and  prescription drug costs, and to support our healthcare workforce.   Everything that we do here should be designed to not only prevent  infection but prepare for future types of pandemics. I am just so  concerned because I listened last night at Rules and here on the floor,  and I just think that the impression is being given somehow that maybe  people shouldn't take vaccines or that there are risks to vaccines  that, in my opinion, are being stated that are way out of proportion or  that somehow there is significant evidence out there that it doesn't  matter if you get vaccinated or not because that is not going to cause  more infection.   The bottom line is that this mandate was put in place for healthcare  workers because the agencies involved that studied the science at the  Federal level believed that it was going to be a good thing for the  healthcare workers themselves, that they wouldn't get ill and die, that  it would help in preventing the spread of COVID-19, and that it would  give people a sense of security knowing that the people that are  helping them when they are sick have also been vaccinated.                                time  1615    I just don't understand why all of a sudden now the Republicans say:  Well, that is not really accurate. Let all the healthcare workers do  whatever they want.   It makes no sense. I just think it is politically motivated, if you  will, because they have certain people, I guess, their base voters, who  are anti-vaccination. But you can't be anti-vaccination if you look at  the science and what has been done with these vaccinations that saved  so many lives, to make it so that now the situation with COVID-19 is  much better than it has been in the last few years, which is why the  President is saying that he can lift the healthcare emergency.   We have made a lot of progress. We have made a lot of progress  because we have based our actions on science. To suggest today that we  should eliminate this mandate, I think is very dangerous.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose it, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   This is a 5-minute vote.
