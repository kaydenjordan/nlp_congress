 Mr. Speaker, I rise in robust support of the Freedom to  Vote: John R. Lewis Act. I believe this is the most important vote any  of us will ever vote upon. This is the bill that saves our democracy.   The most fundamental idea of our exceptional Nation is that people  have the right to choose their leaders.   And we have made slow progress over the centuries. African Americans,  Native Americans, women, 18-year-olds. This bill finally establishes  the basic fundamental voting rights for all Americans.   With this act we stand against efforts to manipulate voting rules in  favor of the few and take our essential democratic privilege away from  all Americans.   NASA has inspired humanity for centuries, and now a small NASA bill  becomes the vehicle to save our democracy.                                time  1000
