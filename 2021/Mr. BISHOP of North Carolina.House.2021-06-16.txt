 Mr. Speaker, I chose this photo--I  could have picked a formal team photo--because I thought this captured  the joy of the moment I am bringing to the Nation's attention.   Today, I rise to honor the Wingate University Bulldogs and Coach Jeff  Gregory for a spectacular victory in the Division II College World  Series. When Bulldogs fans filled the bleachers at the USA Baseball  National Training Complex in Cary last Saturday, they witnessed  history. Playing in their first ever College World Series final, the  Wingate Bulldogs defeated Central Missouri, the number two ranked team  in the Nation, 5-3.   In reaching the championship, Wingate joined the ranks of only two  other North Carolina Division II schools, and despite losing their  opening game, the Bulldogs won four straight to become the first team  in 16 years to overcome an opening round loss to win it all.   Bulldogs, through your tenacity and persistence, you have won an  incredible victory. I am proud today and always to represent Wingate  University.   Congratulations, Bulldogs.                            ____________________
