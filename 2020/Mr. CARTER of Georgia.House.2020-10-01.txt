 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 20-year  veteran harbor pilot Jonathan ``J.T.'' Tennant of Brunswick, Georgia,  who played a pivotal role in ensuring the safety of all crew members  aboard the Golden Ray carrier when it shipwrecked over a year ago on  September 8, 2019.   If you visit St. Simons Island in Georgia's First Congressional  District, it is hard to miss the Golden Ray, which is a 656-foot-long  car carrier that remains capsized in the St. Simons Sound.   As the investigation into the incident by the U.S. Coast Guard and  the National Transportation Safety Board continues, we have been able  to gain valuable insight from crew members and others involved.   Although he had steered a city-block-sized cargo ship from the  Brunswick River to the St. Simons Sound several thousand times, nothing  could have prepared J.T. for what happened the morning of September 8.   The Golden Ray was sailing normally, but the rudder and the propeller  came up out of the water to where J.T. had no operational control of  the vessel, and it started capsizing rapidly.   He endured flames melting the steel and smoke emanating from airboxes  the entire length of the ship.   As testament to his extensive experience piloting more than 5,000  ships in and out of the Port of Brunswick, J.T. drove the Golden Ray as  far up on the Sound as possible that day to ensure all 23 mariners  aboard were safe and rescued.   When you see the giant cargo ship in the Sound and realize there was  no loss of life, it is nothing short of a miracle and a testament to  the hardworking crew, including J.T.   Although it is an unfortunate situation, I am thankful for the  courage and determination J.T. and the entire crew displayed that day.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call  up H.R. 8265 to extend the Paycheck Protection Program to keep millions  of employees on the payroll of America's small businesses.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for allowing me the time to speak  on an issue that is important to my district and something I want other  parts of the country to benefit from as well.   As you can see, Mr. Speaker, I know a thing or two about fishing. In  fact, Mr. Speaker, it has been said that fish tremble at the mention of  my name. Mr. Speaker, it has been said that, if you put me in water, I  will catch fish.   This is a red snapper. This is a red snapper. It was not caught on  the Gulf Coast; it was caught on the Atlantic Coast. You see, Mr.  Speaker, I represent the best district in the Nation, the entire coast  of Georgia, and this was caught off the coast of Georgia.   But in our district fishing, is not just a hobby, it is a way of  life. In fact, it is an essential part of coastal economies. That is  why it is critical that we maintain and manage our fisheries in a  sustainable way.   This bill that we are discussing today, the DESCEND Act, would help  do just that by expanding mandatory use of descending devices in the  Gulf of Mexico when fishing for popular reef fish. We use these devices  on the Atlantic Coast now. In fact, I have used them before when I have  fished.   Reef fish, like red snapper that you see here, are very popular fish  to fish for, but they are mostly caught, as was pointed out earlier,  near the bottom of the ocean, and often they must be released because  they are out of season or because of size restrictions.   Unfortunately, though, when they are reeled to the surface, as  Representative Graves so accurately described, when they are reeled to  the surface, the decreased water pressure on the fish's internal organs  allow for gases to expands faster than their bodies can compensate.  This makes it nearly impossible for the fish to return to the bottom,  where their organs can function normally, resulting in the death of the  fish that are caught and released.   Descending devices like was shown earlier by Representative Graves  fix this issue by releasing the fish into depths sufficient enough for  the fish to be able to recover from these damaging effects. This is an  effective conservation practice supported by fishermen and regulators  alike, and it has been successful in places like my district along the  coast of Georgia in the south Atlantic and the West Coast.   I support this effort to bring this to the Gulf Coast, and I urge my  colleagues to as well. It is a simple and effective approach to improve  the survival of fish that are caught and released that will help  maintain healthy populations going forward.   Mr. Speaker, we want to help our partners in the Gulf Coast so that  perhaps, possibly, they could catch a fish this big, and certainly that  is the intent, and this will certainly help them.
