 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw the Chamber's attention  to legislation I introduced yesterday. I was honored to introduce  legislation which would initiate the process to bring innovative mass  transit options to the south side.   It was an important first step to bringing the economic power of  transit-oriented development to often neglected areas within the metro  Atlanta region without displacement of longtime residents, the John  Lewis TOD Loop. The report will be required to be produced to the  Congress within 1 year.   In addition to the study, this legislation launches the first  transformative transit project. This project will spark improvement and  bring economic justice to established neighborhoods and businesses in  the areas where Representative John Lewis lived for decades.   Innovative mass transit options in the corridor will link Oakland  City and Fort McPherson to Greenbriar Mall and a future senior citizen- focused transit and mixed-use center named in honor of Representative  John Lewis.   Such forward progress will improve the lives of residents while  reducing our CO2 emissions, helping to heal a warming  planet.   This project is yet another step toward revitalizing parts of Atlanta  yet  [[Page H7263]]  to realize their full potential. Once the overall program is  established, it has the potential to spur $5 billion in economic  development across thousands of acres in low- to middle-income  communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Congress to pass this legislation, launch this  study, and bring this transit corridor one step closer to reality.                Celebrating the Lives of Four Great Georgians     Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the lives of four great  Georgians important to Georgia's Fifth Congressional District and to  greater metro Atlanta who have recently passed away.   Mrs. Celestine Bray Bottoms was a pillar of the greater Atlanta  community. As a longtime educator with the Atlanta Public Schools  system, Mrs. Bottoms touched the lives of thousands of students,  parents, and fellow educators throughout Atlanta.   Celestine Bray Bottoms was a graduate of Atlanta's illustrious HBCU  Spelman College, was the mother of Derrick and Darian Bottoms, the  mother-in-law to Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a beloved  grandmother, a community activist, and a friend to many.   Today, District Five honors the life of Mrs. Celestine Bray Bottoms.   Mr. Speaker, Joseph Arrington, Sr., was a third-generation native of  Atlanta, a graduate of the historic Booker T. Washington High School,  and a graduate of Atlanta's Morehouse College.   Attorney Arrington obtained his law degree from North Carolina  Central University and a master's degree in public health from the  University of Pittsburgh.   A member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity and president of Morehouse  College National Alumni Association, Joseph Arrington, Sr., will  forever be remembered as a man of honor.   Mr. Speaker, Dr. Jane Smith was a beloved third-generation Atlantan.  She attended Charles Harper High School in Atlanta, Georgia, where she  held the distinction as the school's very first homecoming queen.   Dr. Smith's commitment to bettering the lives of fellow Atlantans was  unmatched.   Dr. Jane Smith and the Smith and Browning families are some of the  original native families that have strengthened and elevated Black  communities in greater metro Atlanta and beyond.   An unmatched beauty on the inside and out, Dr. Smith will never be  forgotten.   Mr. Speaker, last and certainly not least, we remember Dilcie Sledge  Ragsdale, who passed away 1 week ago today.   Ms. Dilcie hailed from Chattanooga, Tennessee, and was a graduate of  Spelman and Atlanta University.   As a lifelong educator, she dedicated her life to teaching and  enriching the lives of others. She lived a full life. She was a  gardener, an enthusiastic cook, and a proud member of Delta Sigma Theta  Sorority, Incorporated.   She is survived by her children, Valerie and Renard.   I know I speak for the Fifth District of Georgia when I say she will  be dearly missed.   May the memories of all these departed souls be a blessing.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today mindful that I only have a few  moments to address this body from the podium.   As we turn our attention next week to Christmas, many of us are  sending  [[Page H7275]]  and awaiting cards and packages. Let us not forget the postal workers  who deliver more than 155 billion pieces of mail per year, which this  year included our ballots in an election that saw the largest turnout  in 100 years. For their work and commitment this holiday season and  every holiday season, and for their extraordinary service to our  country during the pandemic, I support overtime pay for these important  civil servants.   Another institution very old in our Republic, while not as old as the  Postal Service, is Morris Brown College. Let us resolve to support  Morris Brown College and contribute to the revitalization of the  Atlanta University Center.   As we seek to revitalize Morris Brown College, let us also consider  ways to renew our urban centers. A way to do that is urban farming. It  can deliver produce at a lower cost, leaving families to spend on other  costs of living, like housing. It can also be good for the environment,  as it can reduce CO2 emissions attendant with transporting  food from faraway farms to urban centers.   While we do this and we emerge from this pandemic, we must lift as we  rise. That is why we must ensure minority- and women-owned businesses  see increased participation in our society.   One of the items I will include in the Record is a news story about  27 former African-American franchisees who are suing McDonald's, a  legendary business, for discrimination against its own franchisees.  27 More Black Ex-Franchisees Join Racial Discrimination Lawsuit Against                                 McDonald's                  Total number of plaintiffs approaching 80         Miami, Nov. 18, 2020--Twenty-seven new plaintiffs, all       former Black McDonald's franchisees, joined an ongoing       federal lawsuit against the fast-food chain claiming the       company engaged in systemic discrimination and denied them       the same opportunities as White franchisees.        The new amended complaint now has 77 named plaintiffs in       the lawsuit originally filed by 52 Black former franchisees       on Sept. 1, 2020.        The claims now include nearly 300 stores with compensatory       damages that average between $4 million and $5 million per       store, exclusive of punitive damages.        The plaintiffs allege McDonald's sold itself as a recruiter       and developer of Black talent, profited from its Black       consumer base and maintained a two-tier system that       pigeonholed unsuspecting Black owners and assigned them       horrible locations guaranteed to fail.        This suit comes on the heels of a federal class action       lawsuit filed October 29 by current Black franchisees.        ``McDonald's is now fighting a four-front legal war. They       are being sued by current and former Black operators, Black       employees and senior executives,'' said James L. Ferraro, the       lead attorney for both the current and former franchisee       lawsuits. ``As the pool of plaintiffs grow, there will be       more pressure on the company to dispense with the public       relations ploys and focus on how it can help its Black       employees and franchisees.''        At the same time there are calls for state pension funds to       drop McDonald's stock. States like New York, California, Ohio       and Florida have massive investments in McDonald's. In       Tennessee, Rep. Joe Towns has requested Treasurer David H.       Lillard to divest the state's holdings and reallocate the       money toward companies ``practicing good corporate       citizenship.''        Ferraro said all these challenges are coming together       because the company has turned a blind eye to obvious racial       problems while promoting its public image.        McDonald's once boasted a high of 377 Black franchisees in       1998. That number now stands at 186 even though McDonald's       has increased its stores from 15,086 to 36,059. The cash flow       gap for Black franchisees more than tripled from 2010 to       2019, per National Black McDonald's Operators Association       (``NBMOA'') data.        Plaintiffs' average annual sales of $2 million was more       than $700,000 under McDonald's national average of $2.7       million between 2011 and 2016 and $900,000 under the national       average of $2.9 million in 2019.        The lawsuit claims McDonald's was ruthless in steering       Black operators toward the oldest, most decrepit stores in       the toughest neighborhoods routinely rejected by Whites       franchisees. This severely limited opportunities for       expansion and growth, and far too often set in place a chain       of events--low cash flow, decreased equity, debt and       bankruptcy--that led to financial ruin.        The plaintiffs argue McDonald's violated federal civil       rights laws by:        Excluding Black franchisees from the same growth       opportunities found at safer, higher-volume, lower-cost       stores offered to Whites.        Retaliating against Black franchisees for rejecting strong-      arm offers to continue operations in crime-ridden       neighborhoods.        Denying Black franchisees meaningful assistance during       financial hardships while White franchisees were routinely       given such support.        Failing to provide any legitimate business reasons for       repeated denials of franchise opportunities over many years.        Unfairly grading the operations of Black restaurants, which       resulted in poor internal reviews, effectively pushing Black       franchisees out of the McDonald's system by denying them the       eligibility for growth and favorable franchise terms.        Providing misleading projections which induced Black       franchisees to purchase undesirable franchises.        The amended complaint was filed with the U.S. District       Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division.     We must ensure that all in this Nation have the promise of  the American Dream free from discrimination.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today mindful that I only have a few moments to  address this body from the podium so I ask unanimous consent to place  extended remarks and materials into the record on all these topics but  I would like to briefly alert to this body the areas of concern that I  seek placed into the Record.   The first concerns housing. In Atlanta, we have a tremendous  opportunity to expedite the redevelopment of vacant public housing  sites including: Bowen Hornes, Bankhead Court, Hollywood court, Harris  Hornes, Thomasville, and Jonesboro North and South. And I hope the days  ahead achieve that end.   All of these sites have the potential to not only incorporate  affordable housing, but the addition of grocery stores in food  desserts; healthcare facilities, improved access to public  transportation; job and commercial centers, quality schools and parks  and greenspace.   And as we turn our attention next week to Christmas, many of us are  sending and awaiting cards and packages. Let us not forget the Postal  workers who deliver more than 155 billion pieces of mail per year,  which this year included our ballots in an election that saw the  largest turnout in 100 years. For their work and commitment this season  and every holiday season, and for their extraordinary service to our  country during a pandemic, I support overtime pay for these important  civil servants.   And another institution very old in our Republic, while not as old as  the Postal Service, is Morris Brown College. Let us resolve to support  Morris Brown College and contribute to the revitalization of the  Atlanta University Center.   As we seek to revitalize Morris Brown College, let us also consider  ways to renew our urban centers. A way to do that is urban farming.   It can deliver produce at a lower cost, leaving families to spend on  other costs of living, like housing.   It can also be good for the environment, as it can reduce CO2  emissions attendant with transporting food from faraway farms to urban  centers.   As we improve our nation's housing, and find ways to revitalize our  colleges and seek new ways to grow our food, let us not forget our  past. That is why it is important for this Chamber to try to preserve  our past. This includes the task of establishing the former  headquarters of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, where Dr.  King did his work, alongside Congressman Lewis, as national historic  sites.   And, while we do this, and we emerge from this pandemic, we must lift  as we rise. That is why we must ensure minority and women owned  businesses see increased rates in our society.   One of the items I will be placing in the record is a news story  about 27 former African American franchisees who are suing McDonalds, a  legendary business, for discrimination against its own franchisees. We  must ensure that all in this nation have the promise of the American  dream, free from discrimination.   We must also ensure that legacy banks and black-owned banks are  sources of capital to support financing of projects for minority  communities.   And, finally, during my time in here in Capitol Hill, I have  introduced many pieces of legislation designed at making our criminal  justice system fairer. But during this pandemic, we must also not  forget about our brothers and sisters that are incarcerated. A study I  will place in the record, from The Marshall Project, makes clear that  incarcerated individuals are 4 times more likely to contract COVID-19.  As society begins the long process of distributing and administering  the vaccine, we must not forget them. They are no less worthy or  deserving of medical care and should protected, for we are all God's  children.                            ____________________
