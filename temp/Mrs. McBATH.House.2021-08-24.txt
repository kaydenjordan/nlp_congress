 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4, the John R.  Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   During the Civil Rights Movement, I was a child in the stroller at  the March on Washington. And my father, who was the president of the  Illinois branch of the NAACP for over 20 years, he raised me to always  fight for what is right and what is just; to stand up for those who  don't always have a voice.   John Lewis embodied the spirit of justice, and he inspired so many to  fight for voting rights. John did say, ``Freedom is not a state, it is  an act.'' Freedom is the continuous action we all must take, and each  generation must do its part to create an even more fair and more just  society.   Today, we do our part. We stand up for the right to vote; freedoms  this Nation was founded upon and freedoms which must long endure.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in the act of  fighting for freedom, fighting for democracy, and supporting the John  R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support for the  Advancement Act.              [From the New Democrat Coalition, Aug. 23, 2021]                   New Democrat Coalition Endorses H.R. 4         The New Democrat Coalition (NDC) announced its endorsement       of H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.       The bill, introduced by NDC Member Terri Sewell (AL-07),       seeks to address the most egregious forms of recent voter       suppression by restoring the protections of the 1965 Voting       Rights Act and determining which states and localities with a       recent history of voting rights violations must pre-clear       election changes with the U.S. Department of Justice.        ``Our responsibility as members of Congress is to ensure       that the American people have trust in our democratic process       and equitable access to the ballot box,'' said New Democrat       Coalition Chair Suzan DelBene. ``Congresswoman Sewell is       continuing Congressman John Lewis' legacy by reintroducing       this crucial legislation all to keep our elections fair and       open. The Coalition endorsed this bill because the right to       vote is the most sacred and fundamental right our nation       offers. We urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to       join us in passing this historic piece of legislation.''        I'm so proud that the John R. Lewis Voting Rights       Advancement Act has earned the endorsement of the New       Democrat Coalition,'' said New Democrat Member Rep. Terri       Sewell. ``The right to vote is the most sacred and       fundamental right we enjoy as American citizens and one that       the Foot Soldiers fought, bled, and died for in my hometown       of Selma, Alabama. Today, old battles have become new again       as we face the most pernicious assault on the right to vote       in generations. By restoring federal oversight and preventing       states with a recent history of voter discrimination from       restricting the right to vote, this bill keeps the promise of       our democracy alive for all Americans and advances the legacy       of those brave Foot Soldiers like John Lewis who dedicated       their lives to preserving the sacred right to vote.        The Coalition has long been an advocate for promoting       voting rights and protecting American elections and endorsed       H.R. 4 last Congress. Earlier this year, the Coalition also       endorsed H.R. 1. the For the People Act, earlier this year.       With the endorsement and expected House action on H.R. 4, the       Coalition remains committed to advancing voting and campaign       reform legislation through the Senate and to the President as       soon as possible.                                   ____                                                      Sierra Club,                                                   August, 24, 2021.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the Sierra Club's 4       million members and volunteers, we are writing to urge a YES       vote on the rule for the upcoming budget resolution and H.R.       4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, and the       Senate Amendment to H.R. 3684.        Vote yes on the Rule containing S. Con 14/H.R. 3684 and       H.R. 4.        The vote on this rule will deem the budget resolution that       would initiate the reconciliation process to tackle the       ongoing climate crisis, one of our nation's greatest threats.        Today's vote comes just days after the Intergovernmental       Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that the changing       climate and extreme weather events we're already experiencing       will continue to rapidly worsen. For many states this       includes sea level rise, coastal flooding, more frequent       storms, and extreme weather conditions, all of which threaten       infrastructure and the abundant natural resources critical       for the local economy. The growing local impacts of climate       change are clear, but so too is the fact that  [[Page H4406]]       climate inaction will have severe costs for the nation's       economy.        The Sierra Club strongly urges you to consider the enormous       significance of this moment and, VOTE YES on the budget       resolution, so we can begin the necessary process through       budget Reconciliation to address the climate crisis.        Vote yes on H.R. 4 The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement       Act.        In addition to addressing our nation's climate crisis, it       is imperative that we also protect our nation's democracy.       The same communities most vulnerable to climate impacts are       those disproportionately impacted and have been harmed by the       dilution of the Voting Rights Act by the Supreme Court in       2013 and 2021.        Since then we have seen a rise in discriminatory voter       laws, from cuts to early voting days to restrictive voter       identification requirements. The John Lewis Voting Rights       Advancement Act would restore preclearance coverage for       state, localities, and political subdivisions with a history       of voter discrimination, and would increase transparency and       public awareness for changes to voting and polling practices       that can be confusing and deter American voters.        For these reasons we urge a yes vote on the rule for the       budget resolution, and for democracy and the John Lewis       Voting Rights Advancement Act.            Sincerely,                                                           Dan Chu,                                        Acting Executive Director.                                                              AFT,       August 23, 2021.                                   ____       U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.7 million members       of the American Federation of Teachers, I strongly urge you       to support the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (H.R.       4). The need to strengthen and re-establish the protections       of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the crowning achievement of       the civil rights movement, is more pressing now than ever       before.        The late Rep. John Lewis once said, ``The vote is precious.       It is almost sacred. It is the most powerful non-violent tool       we have in our democracy.'' The bedrock of American democracy       is participation at the ballot box for all, no matter their       religion, their race, their income, their gender, their age,       where they come from, what state they reside in or their ZIP       code. Everything relies on voting rights, from the ability of       local communities to run their schools and manage local       services to the peaceful transfer of presidential power.        In the wake of two U.S. Supreme Court decisions--Shelby       County v. Holder and Brnovich v. Democratic National       Committee that gutted the Voting Rights Act, states have       considered and enacted a rush of new laws making the right to       vote harder to exercise, especially for communities of color.       According to the Brennan Center for Justice, more than 400       voter suppression bills have been taken up by state       legislatures since January of this year, and 18 states have       already enacted 30 laws restricting the right to vote. Recent       voter suppression measures embrace a variety of tactics       including reducing early voting, eliminating polling places,       giving local judges the ability to overturn elections, and       making it a crime to deliver water or food to voters standing       in line. While companion legislation with comprehensive       national voting standards and reforms, such as the For the       People Act, is needed to address the state laws already       enacted, passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act       is essential to prevent new state voter suppression measures       from being enacted.        The latest actions of state legislatures show that the       protections of the Voting Rights Act are still woefully       needed. They prove that the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth       Bader Ginsburg was right in her Shelby County dissent when       she wrote that to use the success of the Voting Rights Act as       proof that it is unneeded is as wise as not using an umbrella       in a storm because you don't feel the rain. Most of the       states that have recently enacted, or are currently debating,       laws restricting the right to vote have a history of having       their efforts blocked when the Voting Rights Act's       preclearance requirements were in full effect. H.R. 4 would       establish new preclearance formulas that would prevent states       with a history of voter discrimination from enacting new laws       that would suppress the vote. It would also ensure that last-      minute voting changes do not adversely affect voters by       requiring officials to publicly announce all voting changes       at least 180 days before an election, and it would expand the       government's authority to send federal observers to any       jurisdiction where there may be a substantial risk of       discrimination at the polls on Election Day or during an       early voting period.        John Lewis reminded us, ``Each of us has a moral obligation       to stand up, speak up and speak out. When you see something       that is not right, you must say something. You must do       something.'' This is your chance.        We urge you to defend voting rights throughout the country       by supporting the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act       and renewing the fight for the comprehensive voting rights       legislation that must accompany it.        Thank you for considering our views on this critical       legislation.            Sincerely,                                                  Randi Weingarten,      President.                                   ____                                                             SEIU,                                                    August 20, 2021.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 2 million members of       the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), I write in       support of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)       as well as the Federal Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Resolution,       and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Taken       together, these critical bills will help strengthen our       democracy and deliver on the full promise of President       Biden's Build Back Better agenda.        After years of inaction, the IIJA advances important       programs in public transportation, clean water, broadband and       climate resilience. These public investments would give our       communities a much-needed boost and help support safer       roadways and schools, cleaner water, and more available and       affordable Internet. But much more has to be done to build       our country back better and ensure that workers have unions       and a voice in their own futures.        By advancing the infrastructure bill along with the Build       Back Better reconciliation package, with its commitments to       living-wage care jobs with the opportunity to join together       in a union--a path to citizenship and climate justice,       Congress can take bold measures needed to meet essential       workers' demands for common-sense and transformative policy       solutions.        The budget resolution is the key to creating the pathway we       need for both the IIJA and the reconciliation bill. We call       on you to act immediately to pass the FY 2022 budget       resolution to move forward on President Biden's Build Back       Better full vision. In addition, we strongly urge you to       support the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. This       crucial legislation will help protect our democracy against       the widespread attacks on our freedom to vote that are being       mounted across our country--so that we all have an equal say       in our future and our rights are protected.        For these reasons, we urge you to support the IIJA, the       FY2022 budget resolution, and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights       Advancement Act. We will add votes on each of these bills to       our legislative scorecard for the 117th Congress.            Sincerely,                                                    Mary Kay Henry,      International President.                                   ____                                                           LIUNA!,                                                    August 23, 2021.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 500,000 members of       the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA), I       want to express our strong support for H.R. 4, the John R.       Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021.        Since the 2013 Supreme Court Shelby County v. Holder       decision, which challenged portions of the Voting Rights Act       of 1965, many states have enacted laws that restrict access       to the polls by shortening early voting hours, enacting       strict voter ID requirements, and decreasing the number of       polling locations. These changes to the law disproportionally       effect minority and disenfranchised communities. Just last       month, in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, the       Supreme Court decided that rules that impacted different       populations unequally were not unfair. This decision opened       the door even more broadly to different forms of voter       suppression.        H.R. 4 is critically needed to help to reverse the negative       effects of these restrictive state laws by requiring states       and localities with a history of voting rights violations to       pre-clear any changes to election laws with the Department of       Justice. This important legislation will ensure that       elections across this country remain fair and will restore       the portions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that recent       Supreme Court decisions have eliminated. In addition, this       legislation will ensure that multilingual voting materials       are more widely available and that polling places do not       disproportionally serve privileged communities over       communities of color.        For decades LIUNA has stood side by side with civil rights       activists, including the late Congressman John Lewis, as they       marched and took to the streets to fight for the critical       issue of voting rights--one of the cornerstones of our       democracy. LIUNA will continue to speak out against       discriminatory laws and practices that attempt to       disenfranchise voters. Ensuring all Americans have equal       access to their constitutionally enshrined right to vote is a       top priority.        LIUNA supports H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights       Advancement Act of 2021, which passed the U.S. House of       Representatives with a bipartisan vote in the last Congress       and urges you to vote for this much-needed legislation.        With kind regards, I am            Sincerely yours,                                                  Terry O'Sullivan,      General President.                                   ____                                   National Education Association,                                                    August 23, 2021.      Hon. Terri A. Sewell,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Sewell: On behalf of the 3 million       members of the National Education Association who work in       14,000 communities across the nation, we urge you to vote YES       on the John Lewis Voting  [[Page H4407]]       Rights Advancement Act of 2021 (H.R. 4) because it will       protect our most fundamental right as citizens and safeguard       the integrity of our democracy. Votes on this issue may be       included in NEA's Report Card for the 117th Congress.        NEA members help prepare students for the privileges and       responsibilities of citizenship. They want students to       understand how our government works and their role in making       it work--especially through voting. Yet, accessing the vote       has become more difficult in recent years, particularly for       African Americans and other people of color, people with       disabilities, students, and senior citizens. In fact, from       January through mid-July of this year, nearly 400 bills were       introduced in 49 states that would make voting more       difficult, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. At       least 18 of those states have enacted 30 new laws that       restrict our freedom to vote.        The U.S. Supreme Court in the 2013 Shelby v. Holder       decision invalidated a crucial provision in the Voting Rights       Act of 1965 (VRA) that prevented states with a history of       discriminating against voters from changing their voting laws       and practices without preclearance by federal officials. This       federal review was an important feature of the Voting Rights       Act; doing away with it has virtually annulled the federal       oversight that was--and remains--crucial to ensuring that       millions of people have equal access to the ballot box. Since       the Shelby decision, several states have changed their voting       practices in ways that have created barriers for people of       color, low-income people, transgender people, college       students, the elderly, and those with disabilities.        Furthermore, just last month, the Supreme Court ruled in       Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee that two       discriminatory Arizona voting laws did not violate Section 2       of the Voting Rights Act. In its opinion in Brnovich, the       Court disregards the congressional purpose of Section 2,       which is to provide a powerful means to combat race       discrimination in voting and representation. The decision       relies on a limited interpretation of the Voting Rights Act       that will make it more difficult to challenge discriminatory       voting laws. This decision underscores the need for Congress       to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to       restore the legislative purpose of Section 2.        The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act fills a       distinct and critical role in protecting the freedom to vote       and ensuring elections are safe and accessible by reversing       these dangerous, undemocratic trends by taking several steps       that include:        Updating the criteria used for identifying states and       political subdivisions required to obtain federal review and       approval of voting changes to ensure those changes do not       infringe upon the freedom to vote for people of color;        Requiring that every state and locality nationwide that is       sufficiently diverse obtain federal review before enacting       specific types of voting changes that are known to be       discriminatory in their use to silence the growing political       power of voters of color;        Requiring all states and localities to publicly disclose,       180 days before an election, all voting changes, such as       reductions in language assistance and changes in requirements       to vote or register;        Authorizing the Attorney General to send federal observers       to any jurisdiction where there is a substantial risk of       racial discrimination at the polls;        Addressing the Brnovich decision by clarifying factors that       voters of color can use to prove a vote dilution or vote       denial claim under Section 2 of the VRA and restoring voters'       full ability to challenge racial discrimination in voting in       court;        Allowing the Department of Justice and voters of color to       challenge changes in a voting rule that would make voters of       color worse off in terms of their voting rights than the       status quo;        Expanding authority for courts to ``bail-in'' jurisdictions       to the preclearance process and updating the ability of       jurisdictions to ``bail-out'' of the preclearance process       once they demonstrate a record of not harming voters of       color; and        Providing voters with additional protection by easing the       standard for when courts can temporarily block certain types       of voting changes while the change is under review in court.       This is important because once a voter is discriminated       against in an election, it cannot be undone.        NEA members live, work, and vote in every precinct, county,       and congressional district in the United States. They take       their obligation to vote seriously, viewing it as essential       to protecting the opportunities that they believe all       students should have. Educators teach students that voting is       a responsibility of citizenship, a privilege people have died       to protect, and a right we must dedicate ourselves to       upholding. We urge you to vote YES on the John Lewis Voting       Rights Advancement Act so that all may participate in the       electoral process and have a voice in our democracy.            Sincerely,                                                      Marc Egan,                                   Director of Government Relations,      National Education Association.                                   ____                                                             AARP,                                                    August 24, 2021.      Hon. Terri Sewell,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Sewell: AARP, on behalf of our nearly       38 million members and all older Americans, is proud to       support H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement       Act of 2021. The right to vote is the most fundamental of all       political rights, and all Americans must be able to exercise       their vote freely, easily, and safely.        The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) has been our nation's       preeminent law protecting the voting rights of all Americans.       But recent Supreme Court decisions have weakened several       provisions of the law. H.R. 4 would help restore the law and       ensure the protections contained in the 14th and 15th       Amendments to the Constitution are enforced, by:        Creating a new coverage formula for all states and       political subdivisions that takes into consideration repeated       voting rights violations in the preceding 25 years;        Establishing a process for reviewing voting changes,       focusing on measures that have historically been used to       discriminate, including voter ID laws, the reduction of       multilingual voting materials, changes to voting districts,       and reductions in the number of polling locations;        Increasing transparency through public notice when voting       changes are made; Expanding voting accessibility for Native       American and Alaska Native voters; Allowing the Attorney       General authority to request federal observers where there is       a threat of racial discrimination in voting;        Allowing a federal court to order states or jurisdictions       to be covered for results-based violations,        Clarifying that a voting change or practice is       discriminatory even if other forms of voting are available to       a protected class and;        Directing the Judicial Branch to discount a state or       locality's claims of fraud as a reason to pass harmful voting       laws if no evidence is presented of such fraud.        AARP looks forward to working with Congress and the       Administration to ensure every citizen's right to vote.            Sincerely,      Nancy A. LeaMond,        Executive Vice President and Chief Advocacy & Engagement       Officer.                                   ____                                             American Public Health,                                                     Association,                                                    August 23, 2021.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Public       Health Association, a diverse community of public health       professionals that champions the health of all people and       communities, I write in strong support of H.R. 4, the John R.       Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021.        Over the past decade, U.S. Supreme Court decisions such as       Shelby County v. Holder and Brnovich v. Democratic National       Committee have unfortunately eroded key protections provided       by the Voting Rights Act that protect against racial       discrimination in the voting process, giving many states the       ability to suppress and discriminate against voters. This       year alone, state lawmakers have introduced 400 bills and       enacted 30 laws restricting access to voting in 48 states.       The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021 would       restore VRA protections by establishing a federal review       process of changes to state voting laws. Potentially       discriminatory changes would be paused until federal review       is completed, and changes found to be discriminatory would be       blocked entirely. Furthermore, strict oversight would be       applied to states with histories of voter discrimination and       policy changes known to be used to discriminate against       voters of color.        Decades ago, the Institute of Medicine established in a       report that voting is a public health issue because it helps       shape ``the conditions in which people can be healthy.'' The       ballot box is where community members can come together to       decide on key issues that shape our response to today's       public health emergencies: police brutality, gun violence,       climate change and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We commend       Congresswoman Terri Sewell and the other sponsors for       introducing this landmark legislation and the House for       bringing it up for a vote. I write in strong support of H.R.       4 and urge you to vote yes on the bill. The provisions in       this bill would support the advancement of racial and health       equity, a key APHA priority and a crucial step toward       achieving the healthiest nation in one generation.            Sincerely,                                           Georges C. Benjamin, MD,                                                Executive Director.
