 Mr. President, I want to begin my remarks this morning by  first expressing my profound gratitude to the people of South Dakota  for once again trusting me to serve as their Senator. I am deeply  grateful to live in South Dakota and to represent the Rushmore State.   There are a lot of things that make our State special, like its  incredible natural beauty, a legacy of military service, or the fact  that our State is a great place to raise a family. But what really  makes our State tick, what really makes it special, is our people. And  it is the honor of my life to represent South Dakotans in the U.S.  Senate.   Growing up in Murdo, SD--population 456--I learned the character of  South Dakotans, the work ethic, the love of country and commitment to  freedom, coupled with a belief in personal responsibility and the sense  of responsibility to the broader community.   Life in rural South Dakota can be tough, but growing up we knew that  we were not on our own. In Murdo, we knew that if a roof collapsed  under the weight of snow or a windstorm came through and wiped out a  barn or we lost a friend or a family member, the whole community would  rally around to help.   The values I learned growing up in South Dakota helped shape my  political philosophy and are values that I strive to reflect every day  here in the Senate. And as I continue my work here in Washington, my  top priority will always be doing everything that I can to make life  better for South Dakota families.   Our country is facing some big challenges: a security crisis at our  southern border, a growing energy problem, a serious crime problem, and  the worst inflation prices in decades.   I talked to a lot of South Dakotans as I traveled around the State  this fall, and over and over I heard about the toll inflation is taking  on family budgets and on the livelihood of farmers and ranchers in our  State.   Since President Biden took office, the price of groceries has  increased 18 percent. Electricity bills have increased by 22 percent.  Utility gas bills have increased by 46 percent. Rent prices are up. Car  prices are up. The price of car maintenance is up. Farmers and ranchers  are facing higher feed costs, higher fertilizer costs, higher fuel  costs. Gas prices have increased by $1.37 per gallon since President  Biden took office. And the price increase for diesel, which powers so  much farm and ranch equipment, has been even worse.   All told, inflation is currently costing the average household a  staggering $753 a month--$753 each month. Americans can't afford that.  It is no wonder that inflation topped the list of issues that Americans  were concerned about when they went to the polls or that 76 percent of  voters rated the economy negatively.   Regardless of who is in charge over the next 2 years, Congress needs  to spend its time focused on real solutions to our inflation crisis and  the other challenges facing our country.   I want to congratulate our new Republican Senators, and I look  forward to the ideas that they will bring to the table and working with  them to implement solutions to make life better for American workers  and American families.   It has been a challenging few years for the American people. And  there are some very serious issues facing our Nation. But I have faith  in the future. Every Congress represents a new start, a chance to chart  a fresh vision for our country. And I believe that with the right  policies, we can get America thriving again. I am ready to get to work.   I yield the floor   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
