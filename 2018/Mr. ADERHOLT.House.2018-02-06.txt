 Mr. Speaker, today, as the House takes up the fifth  continuing resolution for FY18, it seems all too appropriate to quote  President Reagan where he says: ``Here we go again.''   I rise here on the floor of the House this afternoon to urge my  colleagues to support the CR, which, of course, runs through March 23.   As the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations' Subcommittee on  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies, our Nation's farmers and ranchers will find it hard  to access credit during the upcoming planting season. And those  recovering from disastrous weather events will not be able to access  essential programs in order to help them if we do not finalize a full- year funding agreement right away.   These are just a couple of examples of the hardships that are faced  by our citizens here in the U.S. that depend on this legislation.   As I say, this is the fifth CR for this fiscal year. My colleagues on  the other side of the aisle must come to the table willing to negotiate  on these budget caps.   As Members know, the House has passed each of the 12 appropriations  bills. We have done our job. Of course, the other body continues to be  the weakest link in all this, as it needs to seriously reform their  process in order to do the work of the people.   Finally, I appreciate that this bill includes full-year funding for  the Department of Defense. To quote President Reagan once again: ``We  have no choice but to maintain ready defense forces that are second to  none. Yes, the cost is high, but the price of neglect would be  infinitely higher.''
