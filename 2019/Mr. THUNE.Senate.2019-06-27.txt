 Mr. President, if I might, let me describe where things  are in the state of play with respect to the supplemental  appropriations bill that deals with the border.   I know the situation at our border has been at a crisis point for  weeks now. Our agencies are stretched to the breaking point, struggling  to care for the overwhelming flow of migrants; yet we have House  Democrats continuing to play politics with the border funding bill.   Again, to describe the state of play, we had a request from the  President 7 weeks ago for $4.5 billion to address this humanitarian  crisis we are having at our southern border, and the Democrats didn't  act on it. They described it as a manufactured crisis. When I say the  Democrats, I am talking about the House Democrats, which is where most  spending bills originate.   After the House failed to act and failed to respond to the  President's request for emergency funding, the Senate decided to act.  So the Senate Appropriations Committee took up and passed a bipartisan  bill out of the Appropriations Committee by a vote of 30 to 1--not a  vote that you see all that often around here these days.   So that bill was reported out to the floor. In the meantime, the  House Democrats decided that maybe it wasn't, after all, a manufactured  crisis and perhaps they needed to act. So  [[Page S4597]]  they picked up a bill--a partisan bill--and passed it out of the House  of Representatives on a party-line basis, after which the Senate voted  on its bill, the bill I mentioned that was reported out of the  Appropriations Committee by a vote of 30 to 1, and it came to the floor  where it passed yesterday by a vote of 84 to 8--84 to 8 in the U.S.  Senate.   Well, just to demonstrate that the bipartisan bill passed by the  Senate is the vehicle that should move forward and should go to the  President for his signature, the President had indicated he would veto  the House-passed bill, but we took it up. We took up the House-passed  bill yesterday on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We had a vote on it. It  got 37 votes here on the floor of the Senate--not nearly enough,  obviously, to pass the Senate. Of course, it was going to meet a  certain veto by the President even if it had.    That being said, there were 37 votes for the House-passed partisan  bill that came out of the House of Representatives. Here on the floor  of the Senate, there were 84 votes for the bipartisan bill produced by  the Senate Appropriations Committee.   Where we are right now is that was sent back to the House. The House,  frankly, should just take up that bill and pass it. We know for certain  the President would sign it. Again, I think it demonstrates a body of  work that reflects the will of both sides, Republicans and Democrats-- certainly in the Senate--to get a vote of 30 to 1 out of the  Appropriations Committee or 84 to 8 on the floor of the Senate. You had  to have a high level of bipartisan cooperation.   That bill to address the humanitarian crisis at our border is  awaiting action by the House of Representatives. All they have to do is  simply pick it up and pass it and send it to the President, where it  will be signed into law, and we will get much needed resources and much  needed manpower to the southern border, where they desperately need it.  I hope that will be the case.   We are being told that the House is now considering sending yet  another partisan bill over here to the Senate. The only thing I can  tell you is, if you want to get legislation signed into law by the  President of the United States that actually does deliver and put the  much needed assistance on the ground that is desperately needed on the  southern border, the only surefire way to do that right now is for the  House to pick up the Senate-passed bill, which passed here with 84  votes, pass it, and send it to the President, where it will be signed  into law, and that $4.5 billion will be on its way to the border to  assist with all the needs down there that are currently being unmet. I  hope that can happen yet today.   That is the state of play with respect to the supplemental  appropriations bill.                               Democratic Party    Mr. President, I think 2019 is going to go down in history for the  Democratic Party. It has been a notable year.   While the Democratic Party has obviously always been left of center,  I never expected to see the Democratic Party running so far to the left  of the American people or wholeheartedly embracing socialism and a  government takeover of a large part of the economy.   The socialist fantasies are rapidly piling up: a government takeover  of healthcare, a government takeover of the energy sector, government- funded college, a government writeoff of all student loan debts,  guaranteed income, government-guaranteed housing, and on and on. So  what is wrong with that? After all, those proposals sound really nice-- free healthcare, free college, the government guaranteeing you an  income. Here is the problem: Providing all that stuff is going to cost  a lot of money, an almost inconceivable amount of money. Somebody is  going to have to pay. You might say that obviously the government is  going to pay, but the government has to get its money from somewhere.  Here is the catch: The government gets its money from the taxpayers.   Can't we just take that money from rich taxpayers? If you talk to  some of the socialist Democrats offering these proposals, they will  talk about making the rich pay. The rich are their favorite funding  mechanism. Want free college? We just get the rich to pay for it. Want  free healthcare? We can just get the rich to pay for it. There is just  one big problem with that: There aren't enough rich people in America  to even come close to paying for Democrats' socialist fantasies. Deep  down, Democrats know it, which is why they tend to get very foggy when  pressed on the details of how they are going to pay for some of their  plans.   Take the junior Senator from Vermont's proposal of a government  takeover of America's health insurance, the so-called Medicare for All  plan. A conservative estimate puts the cost of that plan at $32  trillion over 10 years. The current cost is likely much higher since  the Senator from Vermont's most recent plan for government-run  healthcare also includes long-term care, which we all know is an  incredibly expensive benefit.   The Senator from Vermont did release a list of proposed tax hikes to  pay for his proposal. The only problem is, the tax hikes wouldn't come  close to covering the estimated cost of his original Medicare for All  plan, much less the cost of his new expanded Medicare fantasy.   Of course, as staggering as the costs of Medicare for All would be-- more money than the Federal Government spent in the last 8 years  combined on everything--they pale in comparison to the cost of the so- called Green New Deal. An initial estimate found that the Green New  Deal would cost somewhere between $51 trillion and $93 trillion over 10  years--$93 trillion. That is more money than the 2017 gross domestic  product for the entire world. That is right. You could take the entire  economic output of every country in the world in 2017, and it still  might not pay for the Democrats' socialist fantasy. Once you realize  that, it is pretty obvious that the Green New Deal is not a plan that  could be paid for by taxing the rich.    How about taxing every household making more than $200,000 a year at  a 100-percent rate for 10 years? That wouldn't even get you close to  $93 trillion. How about taxing every household making more than  $100,000 at a 100-percent rate for 10 years? That wouldn't get you  anywhere close to $93 trillion. Like Medicare for All, the Green New  Deal would be paid for on the backs of working families.   I have talked a lot about the money aspect of Democrats' socialist  proposals, and that is one of the major problems with these proposals-- they sound nice until you realize that actually nothing is really free.  Working Americans are still going to be paying for the cost of all  those programs through new and much higher taxes.   But that is far from the only problem with some of the Democrats'  socialist fantasies. Leaving aside the fact that the Federal Government  is not exactly known for its efficiency or bringing programs in on time  and on budget, there is the tremendous cost Americans will pay in the  loss of their freedom, the loss of their autonomy. Americans are used  to choices and being able to make their own decisions. It is part of  our heritage. Those are freedoms we cherish. That is not the way things  work under socialism.   Nowhere is this more obvious than with Medicare for All. Medicare for  All doesn't give Americans health insurance options; it takes them  away. Are you part of the majority of Americans who are happy with  their current healthcare? Too bad. Medicare for All eliminates all  private insurance plans and replaces them with a single, government- run, one-size-fits-all plan. Under Medicare for All, private health  insurance plans as we know them would actually be illegal. If you are  not happy with the government-run plan, too bad; you won't have any  other choices.   The treatment options would also be limited by what the government  decides. If the government doesn't want to pay for a particular cancer  treatment, for example, as has happened in other countries with  socialized medicine, you will be out of luck.   Then, of course, there are the long wait times that are the hallmark  of socialized medicine. Imagine having to wait months for diagnostic  imagining or needed surgery or having to stand by while your spouse or  child is forced to wait months for care. That is the kind of thing  Americans would have to look forward to under Medicare for All.  [[Page S4598]]    Margaret Thatcher once said that the problem with socialism is that  eventually you run out of other people's money. Once Democrats have  taken every dollar they can from the rich to pay for their socialist  fantasies, they will come after the paychecks of ordinary Americans,  who will face higher and higher taxes for fewer and fewer benefits and  greatly reduced choices. Democrats' socialist dreams would quickly trap  the American people in a nightmare.   I yield the floor.
