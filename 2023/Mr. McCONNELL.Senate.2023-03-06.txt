 Madam President, this past weekend, the people of  Kentucky endured significant severe weather. The storms that ripped  through the Commonwealth on Friday caused mass power outages, localized  flooding, and high winds that reached up to 75 miles an hour. At least  one tornado was recorded in west Kentucky.   Sadly, the storms have taken the lives of five Kentuckians. Elaine  and I send our deepest condolences to the families who are grieving  their lost loved ones. My office has been in close contact with  Governor Beshear's team and local officials across the State. Emergency  response efforts are working overtime to ensure those impacted have the  resources to make a rapid recovery.   At peak, there were more than half a million households without  power. I am grateful to the linemen and chainsaw teams that have  tirelessly worked around the clock to restore power throughout the  State. A number of school districts remain closed today as power  restoration efforts continue.   So thank you to all the first responders who have graciously deployed  without hesitation. The generosity and resilience on display in the on- the-ground operations have been truly inspiring. Throughout the  Commonwealth, Kentuckians are rolling up their sleeves to help where  they can, whether it is assisting clean-up efforts with chainsaws in  hand or opening their homes to those in need. Kentuckians have both big  hearts and hard knuckles, and together, we will get through.   My prayers are with all the storm victims and their families, and I  stand ready to assist with our swift recovery in the days ahead.
