 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair and  all of those who opened up their thoughts to this very important  process. I participated through the Progressive Caucus, and I am very  grateful for the work that included all Members.   I believe in democracy; I believe in the rights of the minority; but  I want to applaud this rules package in particular because, as a member  of the Committee on the Judiciary, I think extremely important is the  language to protect whistleblowers.   The responsibility of Congress is oversight, and even though this was  not in the congressional wheelhouse, it was shameful what happened to  Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, a United States Army leader, if you will,  who thought it was his patriotic duty simply to tell the truth.   What happened to him as a whistleblower in the executive? He was  fired.   What happened to his brother, twin brother? No longer there. No one  protected them.   I want to applaud a Committee on Rules package that protects but, as  well, a Committee on Rules package that also deals with diversity,  gender, and puts America's business first.   Vote for this package.
