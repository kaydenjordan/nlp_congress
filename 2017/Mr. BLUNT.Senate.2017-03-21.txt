 Mr. President, I am here today to discuss the nomination  of Neil Gorsuch to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. So far this year,  we have heard that it is too early to do everything, that the process  of putting the President's Cabinet in place, which took longer than any  administration since George Washington and is still not completed, was  somehow too early. We heard that every single nominee was being handled  too quickly, even though every previous President since the first  President has managed to have a Cabinet confirmed by the Senate quicker  than this one.   Clearly the process going on right now--hours of questioning  beginning today for Judge Gorsuch, who has a 10-year record as an  appeals judge on the Tenth Circuit, where all of the other judges in  the district courts under the Tenth Circuit's jurisdiction see their  cases go to be appealed.   The Supreme Court is ``distinctly American in concept and function,''  according to Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, and there is, frankly,  nothing quite like it in any other constitutional government. It is a  Court that was supposed to be part of this very unique at the time idea  of a government that was so finely balanced that it would run itself, a  machine that was so finely balanced that it didn't take a King, it  didn't take the intervention of somebody to decide who would be the one  person who would run the country.   The Supreme Court--the only Court mentioned in the Constitution--is a  uniquely American court. In the history of the country, only 112 people  have had the honor to serve on the Supreme Court. On the last day of  January, President Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch of the U.S. Court  of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to be one of those unique individuals  who get to serve on this Court, to be an Associate Justice on the U.S.  Supreme Court.   Since his nomination, he has visited individually with a significant  majority of Members of the Senate. I think he has had 70 visits with  Members of the Senate in their offices. Many of my colleagues on the  other side--several of whom I will mention in a minute--voted for Judge  Gorsuch to have the job he currently has. Many of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle left their meetings with Judge Gorsuch  impressed by his character, by his intellect. Here is what just a  couple of our colleagues on the other side said:   ``He did a very good job in the meeting with me. He presents himself  very well.''   Another one of our colleagues said: ``He's a very caring person, and  he's obviously legally very smart. . . . I think we are dealing with  someone who is impressive.''   Another one of our colleagues said they ``had a thorough conversation  about the importance of the rule of law and of a judiciary that is  independent of the executive and legislative branches of government.''   As more Senators had a chance to meet Judge Gorsuch, they came to see  him as an independent-minded judge who has a deep appreciation for the  law and a real understanding of what a judge should do.   It was mentioned earlier that the judge should be required to talk  about how he would rule on individual cases. Of course not. In fact,  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is on the Court now, was very strident before  the committee in pointing out that it would be wrong for a judge to  explain how they would judge an individual case. She said that if a  judge did that, a judge would actually have to recuse themselves, in  her opinion, from the case, and others on the Court today have all said  similar things when asked the kinds of questions that the minority  leader just said that Judge Gorsuch would have to answer if he was  going to be confirmed to the Court. If that was the test, there would  be nobody on the Court today, and if that was the test, none of the 112  people who have served on the Court  [[Page S1861]]  would have, in all likelihood, passed that test.   When I had a chance to visit with Judge Gorsuch, it was clear that he  understood the proper role of a judge. The role of a judge--the job is  to adhere to the Constitution, to apply the rule of law, and not to  legislate from the bench.   When he was nominated by President Trump, Judge Gorsuch said:         It is for Congress and not the courts to write new laws. It       is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the       people's representatives. A judge who likes every outcome he       reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he       prefers, rather than those the law demands.    What does that mean? How would a person reach a conclusion they  didn't like and that is what makes them a good judge? Well, a good  judge reads the law, reads the Constitution, and applies the law. A  good judge doesn't try to determine what the Constitution and the law  should say but only has the job of determining what the Constitution  and the law do say.   Justice Scalia--the vacancy Judge Gorsuch will fill--according to  Justice Scalia, setting aside personal views is ``one of the primary  qualifications for a judge''--not determining what you would like to  happen but determining what the law and the Constitution say has to  happen. I think Judge Gorsuch understands that.   He comes to the Court very well prepared. He is a graduate of  Columbia University, Harvard Law School, and Oxford University. His  academic credentials are unrivalled in preparation for this job. He  served his country admirably as a Supreme Court Justice clerk for  Justice Byron White, who was appointed to the Court by President  Kennedy and confirmed by the Senate, and Justice Anthony Kennedy, who  was appointed to the Court by President Reagan. Judge Gorsuch served as  the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General, and then in 2006,  President George W. Bush nominated him to serve on the Tenth Circuit  Court of Appeals. The Senate confirmed his nomination unanimously by a  voice vote. There are 12 Democrats currently serving in the Senate who  were then in office and supported Judge Gorsuch's nomination 10 years  ago to the job he has today.   In the decade Judge Gorsuch has served as a circuit court judge,  reviewing the work of other Federal judges on appeal, he has  demonstrated the integrity, professional qualifications, and judicial  temperament to serve on the Nation's highest Court.   Judge Gorsuch said recently that judges are not politicians in robes.  It is not the job of a judge to determine what the law is or should be;  it is the job of a judge to determine what the law is. The job of a  judge is to determine what the Framers intended the Constitution to  say.   Judge Gorsuch received high praise from legal experts across party  lines. He has gotten the highest level of recommendation from the  American Bar Association, unanimously rating him as ``well qualified,''  its highest rating. He is respected by people who know him in his  community. He has really dedicated himself to a lifetime of service  that prepares him for this job.   The Supreme Court is one of the foundational institutions of our  country. It is designed to protect our democracy and is designed to  really understand and apply the Constitution and the law so that the  rule of law is uniquely dependable in the United States of America.   If you are a citizen and you read the law and you understand what the  law says, that should get you a long way toward success before the  courts and ensures that in this country, the rule of law matters. The  ultimate determiner of what the law says is the Supreme Court.   I think Judge Gorsuch will serve well and I hope long on the Court. I  believe that in the next couple of weeks, he will join the Justices,  one of whom he clerked for. If that happens, he will be the first  person in the history of the country to be sitting as an Associate  Justice with another Associate Justice who decades earlier he was the  law clerk for when he and Associate Justice Kennedy had an opportunity  to serve together.   With that, I notice my colleague from Iowa is here, and I yield the  floor.
