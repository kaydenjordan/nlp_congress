 Mr. Speaker, Senator John McCain was an  extraordinarily brave and noble man--a hero a dedicated husband,  father, fighter pilot, and an amazing lawmaker. He endured and overcame  unspeakable horrors as a POW, and as a lawmaker never ceased working  for members of our armed forces and veterans. And on matters of  principle and conviction, Senator McCain was fiercely independent,  always willing--even eager--to bend into the wind and not with it.   John McCain and I were colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs  Committee when he was in the House. In fact we sat next to each other,  and so I got to know him, and valued his intelligence and expertise.  Then-Congressman McCain and I were very much in sync on supporting the  administration's vigorous opposition to communism, rebuilding of the  U.S. military, and its robust internationalism, as well as the re- emergence of a principled commitment to human rights and defense of  democracy as core principles of U.S. foreign policy.   He vigorously defended the downtrodden, the underdog, the forgotten  and disenfranchised, including the unborn. Already in these years on  our committee, his willingness to do the right thing regardless of  partisanship was a blessing to this country.   My wife Marie and I will always cherish and deeply respect the  incomparable Senator John McCain. Marie joined me and thousands of  others at the National Cathedral last Saturday to say goodbye to this  great patriot and American hero. All the tributes were extraordinarily  moving, including those by Meghan McCain, and Presidents Bush and  Obama.   Our nation is deeply grateful for the sacrifice and service of John  McCain., and our hearts and prayers are with Cindy, and with his entire  family.                            ____________________
