 Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee report (H. Rept. 115- 711) to accompany House Resolution 918 included an incorrect amendment  description of amendment No. 14 offered by Representative Nolan of  Minnesota.  [[Page H4791]]    The correct amendment description should read:   Expresses the sense of Congress that the construction of a new lock  at the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, is vital to our  national economy, national security, and national need for new critical  infrastructure.    Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee report (H. Rept. 115- 711) to accompany House Resolution 918 should have included in its  waiver of all points of order against amendments to H.R. 8 a disclosure  of following violation:   Clause 9 of rule XXI, which requires a list of all earmarks, limited  tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits contained in an amendment to a  bill or joint resolution to be offered at the outset of its  consideration for amendment by a member of a committee of initial  referral as designated in a report of the Committee on Rules to  accompany a resolution, or a certification that the amendment does not  contain any of those items. While a statement has not yet been printed  in the Congressional Record for amendment No. 1 offered by Rep.  Shuster, it is important to note that Rep. Shuster filed the required  earmark statement on June 6, 2018, prior to floor consideration of the  bill and amendment.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 918 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the concurrent       resolution (H. Con. Res. 63) supporting efforts to enact a       bold jobs and infrastructure package that benefits all       Americans, not just billionaires. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the concurrent resolution are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the concurrent resolution       and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure. After general debate the       concurrent resolution shall be considered for amendment under       the five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions       in the concurrent resolution are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the concurrent resolution for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the concurrent resolution to       the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       concurrent resolution and preamble thereto to adoption       without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with       or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises       and reports that it has come to no resolution on the       concurrent resolution, then on the next legislative day the       House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the       concurrent resolution.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Con. Res 63.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois said: ``The       previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New       York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to       him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.
