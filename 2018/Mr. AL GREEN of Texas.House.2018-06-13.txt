 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand in the well  of the House, I am proud to be an American, and I am proud to say that  today I rise because I believe that separating children from their  parents because they are fleeing violence is antithetical to American  values.   Mr. Speaker, I rise because I do not believe that this is consistent  with the golden rule and that this is not doing unto others as we would  have them do unto us if we were similarly situated.   I rise because I believe that this is not what the good Samaritan  would do. The Good Samaritan not only provided immediate aid and  comfort, but also took the person who had been harmed to a place where  that person could receive additional aid and comfort and went so far as  to say: I am leaving this amount with you. If this is not enough, I  will come back, and I will give you more.   This is antithetical to our values. Separating children from their  parents, be it mother or father, is still a separation of a child from  the person whom the child has grown to believe will be there to protect  him or her.   This is antithetical to what we believe in. It is antithetical to the  notion that we are our brother's keeper, that we look out for others;  that there is but one race, and it is the human race; and that all of  God's creation was meant to live in harmony as it relates to humans.   Mr. Speaker, this is not being one's brother's keeper. You cannot be  your brother's keeper without keeping your brother. We have become a  country who would like to see those who are in harm's way helped--but  by someone else. If you are fleeing violence in Syria, let's make sure  that someone else can help you.   Mr. Jose Escobar, my constituent, was fleeing violence. He was  brought up from El Salvador by his mother, trying to save her son, and  now he has found himself separated from his wife and his two children  with $20 in his pocket and sent back to El Salvador. I went there to  see him. I know of what I speak.   Mr. Speaker, this is antithetical to our values, and it is  detrimental to our existence as a great nation. It is time for us to  take a stand and demand that this administration that can find reason  to criticize football players, that can find reason to say there were  some fine people among those in Charlottesville, and that can find  reason to call women names, it is time for this administration and this  President to end this antithetical policy as it relates to American  values.   I proudly stand here as a proud American.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, June 13, 2018, I  missed the following votes:   1.
