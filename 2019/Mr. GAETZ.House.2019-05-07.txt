 Mr. Speaker, after meeting with President Trump yesterday  regarding the ongoing crisis in Venezuela, I rise to praise the Trump  administration for its mindful and strategic response to conditions in  that country.   All options must be on the table, including military force.   My constituents would likely be among the first in that fight. I am  incredibly proud of them. If asked, they will successfully execute any  mission that they are called to do.   Policymakers have an obligation not to send any of America's sons and  daughters into any ill-advised conflict. The Trump administration  clearly understands the risks associated with military intervention in  Venezuela at this time. They include a few things.   First, if the United States military were to have troops on the  ground in Venezuela today, it is very likely that the Maduro regime  would scapegoat their own failures.   The people of Venezuela voted their way into socialism, and now it  appears they have to fight their way out of it. While this should be a  lesson to us all, military intervention should not be presented as an  opportunity for the Maduro regime to explain away why people in  Venezuela have no medicine, have no food, are starving, and at times  see their own countrymen turning tanks and weapons against them.   Those failures belong to the Maduro regime. Those failures belong to  the socialist dictatorship.   Were we to intervene in an unwise way, potentially, that would create  confusion about the conditions that led to these terrible  circumstances.   Second, if the United States military were to intervene at this time,  it is my concern that it would allow the Maduro regime to externalize  their conflict.   It is no surprise to any in this Chamber or many in the Trump  administration that there remains some latent resentment within pockets  of Latin America regarding U.S. intervention, regime change, and  nation-building.   At a time when we are seeing democratic successes and governments  stood up that are beginning to provide for their citizens, it would be  deeply unwise to stoke any anti-American resentment with ill-advised  conflict.   Right now, Maduro functionally lacks material support from the  forward-thinking countries in the Western Hemisphere, and we would not  want to create any opportunity for there to be a call to the new  Bolivarian alliance.   Ultimately, that is what a lot of these transnational criminal  organizations want in Venezuela. They want to erode nation-states and  borders. They want to end nationalism in our hemisphere so that they  have a more permissive environment for their illicit activities.   Third, the Trump administration clearly understands that, if the  United States were deemed to be too involved in the popular uprising in  Venezuela, Maduro would potentially have the opportunity to deny the  organic desires of Venezuelans to fight for their own freedom.   The reason people are rising up in Venezuela right now is not a  consequence of the United States Government. It is a consequence of the  failures of their own government and their passionate desire for  freedom, one that we should stand with the people of Venezuela to  execute.   Despite these conditions and despite the challenges, I remain hopeful  that there is a brighter future for Venezuela. As we meet and gather  now, Juan Guaido is able to go about the country freely. Despite not  having a military, despite not having staff, he is able to rally  thousands of his fellow countrymen in public squares and make the  argument for freedom.    Meanwhile, the coward Maduro remains huddled up in a military base,  unable to move around and unsure who will turn on him next.   If the last quarter century has taught our country anything about the  nature of freedom, it is that freedom has to be fought for hardest by  those who yearn to live it. Freedom cannot be the gift that America  gives other countries, purchased solely with the currency of the blood  of U.S. servicemembers.   People have to fight for freedom and earn it. They have to die for  it. They have to bury their relatives over it. Then they have to love  it and care for it so much that they will never let another strongman  take it away from them and so that they will never fall victim to the  passions that led Venezuela down this dark path to socialism,  dictatorship, starvation, and desperation.   We stand with the people of Venezuela, and they must stand now to  fight for a better future for their country.                            ____________________
