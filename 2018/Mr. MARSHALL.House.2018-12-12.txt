 Mr. Speaker, today we will vote on the farm bill, and I  can't help but be reminded of the more than 1,100 attendees at the farm  bill listening sessions we held across the country. What an honor it  was to take the comments, the feedback, and the suggestions they had  and work to address those concerns.   Those 1,100 attendees represented the full spectrum of American  agriculture. From citrus producers in Florida to wheat farmers in  Kansas, we saw and heard amazing stories of the grit and determination  of the people who wake up every morning, pull their boots on, and work  to feed, clothe, and fuel this world.   As we vote today, I salute and honor each of them and their families.  Mr. Speaker, Kansans sent me to Congress to get a farm bill done, and I  am honored to be here today and to say that we delivered for Kansas.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for giving me an  opportunity to speak today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the work of the House and  Senate Agriculture Committees. This afternoon, we will be considering  the conference report of the 2018 farm bill. I am proud to have had the  chance to work alongside two of my great mentors, Senator Pat Roberts  and my House colleague, Chairman Mike Conaway, on this bill.   While the national media might not spend much time reporting on this  one, I want to take a moment and recognize both the importance of this  bill and the work done by the farmers and ranchers it protects.   Mr. Speaker, Kansans sent us to Congress to get a farm bill done, and  I am honored to be here today to say we delivered for Kansans.   I can't hold a townhall or listening session in my district without  hearing about the importance of this bill. Our farmers need certainty  and a responsible safety net that can protect them from the whims of  nature and markets that are far out of control.   Crop prices have dropped 50 percent since the last farm bill, and  that impact is showing up in the bottom lines of producers across the  country. In Kansas, farm bankruptcies are up six times in just 3 years.  I am not here to fear-monger but to share the seriousness of the state  of the agriculture economy.   Mr. Speaker, as I vote here today, I will be thinking of and honoring  my parents and grandparents, knowing this legislation well preserved  the rural way of life from which I was raised and the work ethic that  was taught to me on those family farms.
