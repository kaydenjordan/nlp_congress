 Madam Speaker, I seek recognition for a question  of personal privilege.    Madam Speaker, I would also like to thank many of  my colleagues for the opportunity to not only speak today but for the  many Members from both sides of the aisle who have reached out to me in  support following an incident earlier this week.   About 2 days ago, I was walking up the steps of the Capitol when  Representative Yoho suddenly turned a corner, and he was accompanied by  Representative Roger Williams, and accosted me on the steps right here  in front of our Nation's Capitol.   I was minding my own business, walking up the steps, and  Representative Yoho put his finger in my face. He called me disgusting;  he called me crazy; he called me out of my mind; and he called me  dangerous.   And then he took a few more steps, and after I had recognized his  comments as rude, he walked away, and said: I'm rude? You are calling  me rude?  [[Page H3703]]    I took a few steps ahead, and I walked inside and cast my vote  because my constituents send me here each and every day to fight for  them and to make sure that they are able to keep a roof over their  head, that they are able to feed their families, and that they are able  to carry their lives with dignity.   I walked back out, and there were reporters in the front of the  Capitol. And in front of reporters, Representative Yoho called me, and  I quote, ``a fucking bitch.''   These are the words that Representative Yoho levied against a  Congresswoman, a Congresswoman that not only represents New York's 14th  Congressional District but every Congresswoman and every woman in this  country because all of us have had to deal with this in some form, some  way, some shape, at some point in our lives.   And I want to be clear that Representative Yoho's comments were not  deeply hurtful or piercing to me because I have worked a working-class  job; I have waited tables in restaurants; I have ridden the subway; I  have walked the streets in New York City, and this kind of language is  not new.   I have encountered words uttered by Mr. Yoho and men uttering the  same words as Mr. Yoho while I was being harassed in restaurants. I  have tossed men out of bars that have used language like Mr. Yoho's,  and I have encountered this type of harassment riding the subway in New  York City.   This is not new, and that is the problem.   Mr. Yoho was not alone. He was walking shoulder-to-shoulder with  Representative Roger Williams.                                time  1030    And that is when we start to see that this issue is not about one  incident. It is cultural. It is a culture of lack of impunity, of  accepting of violence and violent language against women and an entire  structure of power that supports that.   Because not only have I been spoken to disrespectfully, particularly  by Members of the Republican Party and elected officials in the  Republican Party--not just here, but the President of the United States  last year told me to ``go home'' to another country, was the  implication, that I don't even belong in America. The Governor of  Florida, Governor DeSantis, before I even was sworn in, called me a  ``whatever that is.''   Dehumanizing language is not new, and what we are seeing is that  incidents like these are happening in a pattern. This is a pattern of  an attitude towards women and dehumanization of others.   So while I was not deeply hurt or offended by little comments that  are made, when I was reflecting on this, I honestly thought that I was  just going to pack it up and go home. It is just another day, right?   But then, yesterday, Representative Yoho decided to come to the floor  of the House of Representatives and make excuses for his behavior, and  that I could not let go. I could not allow my nieces, I could not allow  the little girls that I go home to, I could not allow victims of verbal  abuse and worse to see that, to see that excuse and to see our Congress  accept it as legitimate and accept it as an apology and to accept  silence as a form of acceptance. I could not allow that to stand, which  is why I am rising today to raise this point of personal privilege.   And I do not need Representative Yoho to apologize to me. Clearly, he  does not want to. Clearly, when given the opportunity, he will not. And  I will not stay up late at night waiting for an apology from a man who  has no remorse over calling women and using abusive language towards  women. But what I do have issue with is using women, our wives and  daughters, as shields and excuses for poor behavior.   Mr. Yoho mentioned that he has a wife and two daughters. I am 2 years  younger than Mr. Yoho's youngest daughter. I am someone's daughter,  too.   My father, thankfully, is not alive to see how Mr. Yoho treated his  daughter. My mother got to see Mr. Yoho's disrespect on the floor of  this House towards me on television. And I am here because I have to  show my parents that I am their daughter and that they did not raise me  to accept abuse from men.   Now, what I am here to say is that this harm that Mr. Yoho tried to  levy against me was not just an incident directed at me, but when you  do that to any woman, what Mr. Yoho did was give permission to other  men to do that to their daughters.   In using that language in front of the press, he gave permission to  use that language against his wife, his daughters, women in his  community, and I am here to stand up to say that is not acceptable.   I do not care what your views are. It does not matter how much I  disagree or how much it incenses me or how much I feel that people are  dehumanizing others, I will not do that myself. I will not allow people  to change and create hatred in our hearts.   And so what I believe is that having a daughter does not make a man  decent. Having a wife does not make a decent man. Treating people with  dignity and respect makes a decent man. And when a decent man messes  up, as we all are bound to do, he tries his best and does apologize-- not to save face, not to win a vote. He apologizes genuinely to repair  and acknowledge the harm done so that we can all move on.   Lastly, what I want to express to Mr. Yoho is gratitude. I want to  thank him for showing the world that you can be a powerful man and  accost women. You can have daughters and accost women without remorse.  You can be married and accost women. You can take photos and project an  image to the world of being a family man and accost women without  remorse and with a sense of impunity.   It happens every day in this country. It happened here on the steps  of our Nation's Capitol. It happens when individuals who hold the  highest office in this land admit to hurting women and using this  language against all of us.   Once again, I thank my colleagues for joining us today.   Madam Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Jayapal for  giving context of how these words and this language have always been  levied towards the ascent of women and women who are ascending in  power.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Velazquez), another phenomenal leader from my own home State.    Madam Speaker, I would take a moment to thank  Representative Velazquez for her precedent and her leadership as well.  Before I was a young Puerto Rican woman upending an incumbent,  Velazquez was as well.   Every single one of us, as women, have to stand on the shoulders and  the efforts made by other women who had to fight--fight hatred, fight  patriarchy, fight hateful men--in order to simply exist in bodies like  this.   So, Madam Speaker, I also thank not only Representative Velazquez,  but Representative Lawrence, who is a leader in the Women's Caucus,  ensuring that others and other women who will walk through these doors  not just today but in generations to come, continue to be protected and  amplified.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  Lawrence).    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Michigan  (Representative Lawrence) for her comments.   As I had indicated earlier, having a daughter does not make a decent  man, having a wife does not make a decent man, but treating people with  dignity and respect makes a decent man. I am incredibly thankful to  have the honor and privilege to serve with decent men in this body each  and every day.   Madam Speaker, it is an honor and I am thankful to serve with  Representative Al Green, who is a sterling example of such a decent  man.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Green for  his comments. His words brought tears to my eyes.   I think that the relationship particularly between fathers and  daughters is a very sacred one, and it is a very special one. But I  also know, if my father were publicly using that language to another  woman, particularly my age, but any woman, I would tell him that he  needed to apologize and that his behavior was reprehensible and  embarrassing.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Speier).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), who is also the co-chair of the Congressional  Progressive Caucus and another wonderful champion for all people.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Pocan for  his brilliance.   Madam Speaker, I think the gentleman brings up such an excellent  point, something we had all seen, that what we are seeing here is a  resounding rejection of abuse and accosting of women.   But why is this only happening from one party?                                time  1100    This should not be a partisan issue. Yet, when Mr. Yoho walked down  those steps and accosted me, and used these words, he was next to a  Republican colleague, and that Republican colleague did nothing. Not  only did that colleague do nothing, he pretended he didn't even hear  it, when he had, in fact, jumped in. So not only did a person do it,  but a bystander did nothing.   And I have yet to hear from the leader of the Republican Party  personally. I have yet to have gotten a call from Representative  McCarthy addressing his Member's behavior. I have yet to see Republican  colleagues standing up for their daughters and saying that this  behavior was unacceptable.   So, in the resounding standing and loud calls for justice, equally  loud is the silence and the pin drop from the Republican Party about  this type of misconduct.   No matter because, with that, we have an incredible champion for  women, for men, for gender nonconforming people, and for justice, and I  am proud to call her my sister.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.  Pressley).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Madam Speaker, once again, I am so thankful to all  of our colleagues who are coming and standing up today, again, not just  for one incident, but for all of us in this country.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), our majority leader, who has stood up for every  Member in this body, and for decency across parties.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New  Jersey (Ms. Sherrill).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Lee not just  for her comments but for her leadership.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Omar),  who is another incredible, resilient, and passionate leader.    Madam Speaker, I thank so many Members who have  shown up today in support. Although not everyone has been able to  [[Page H3708]]  speak, Representatives Castro, DeLauro, and Barragan have also risen,  along with many, many others, and I appreciate everyone's presence.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.  Clark).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________
