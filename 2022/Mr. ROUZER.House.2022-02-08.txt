 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Melissa Murphy,  my chief of staff, who recently moved on to a great opportunity working  for Duke Energy of South Carolina.   After a decade and a half of service here in our Nation's capital,  Melissa decided it was time to leave her work here in the U.S. House  and head back home. Melissa started her career on Capitol Hill working  for her home State of South Carolina in Congressman   Joe Wilson's  office. There, she worked her way up to deputy chief of staff before  joining my team when I was elected to Congress in 2014. As my first  hire and chief of staff, she helped me assemble an outstanding team,  and she helped me build a culture for an office that has accomplished  much.   Melissa has always been a trusted advisor and a great friend to many.  Throughout her career on Capitol Hill, she served as a mentor and  friend to many staffers far beyond my office. She is always there for  her colleagues or anyone else searching for advice or assistance.   As every Member of Congress knows, nothing would get done in this  place without the dedicated service of our staff who are always working  behind the scenes. Melissa's advice, experience, and hard work have all  played a large role in helping me to represent the 7th Congressional  District in North Carolina to the very best of my ability.   I congratulate and thank Melissa for her many years of congressional  service and for leading our team during my first three-and-a-half  terms. May God always bless her path.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I had not originally planned to speak on this bill,  but I think there are several things that need to be underscored. And  before I get into those, let me say we have all had our moments with  the Postal Service; I certainly have. But this is one agency that is  specifically prescribed by the Constitution. Major reforms are always  hard, and when we have the opportunity to make these reforms, we need  to take that opportunity.   Part of the reason why I am so strongly in support of this bill is my  friend Louis DeJoy, who is the Postmaster General. There is no one more  capable and qualified to serve in that capacity. This is a gentleman  who is one in a million.   Now is the best time to get these reforms passed and get them  implemented. If we don't do it now, it may never happen.
