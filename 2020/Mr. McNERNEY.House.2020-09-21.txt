 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2661) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to designate 9- 8-8 as the universal telephone number for the purpose of the national  suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system operating  through the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and through the  Veterans Crisis Line, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2661         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Suicide Hotline       Designation Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) According to the American Foundation for Suicide       Prevention, on average, there are 129 suicides per day in the       United States.        (2) To prevent future suicides, it is critical to       transition the cumbersome, existing 10-digit National Suicide       Hotline to a universal, easy-to-remember, 3-digit phone       number and connect people in crisis with life-saving       resources.        (3) It is essential that people in the United States have       access to a 3-digit national suicide hotline across all       geographic locations.        (4) The designated suicide hotline number will need to be       both familiar and recognizable to all people in the United       States.       SEC. 3.

SEC. 6. REPORT ON CERTAIN TRAINING PROGRAMS.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) youth who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or       queer (referred to in this section as ``LGBTQ'') are more       than 4 times more likely to contemplate suicide than their       peers, with 1 in 5 LGBTQ youth and more than 1 in 3       transgender youth reporting attempting suicide;        (2) American Indian and Alaska Natives have the highest       rate of suicide of any racial or ethnic group in the United       States with a suicide rate over 3.5 times higher than the       racial or ethnic group with the lowest rate, with the suicide       rate increasing, since 1999, by 139 percent for American       Indian women and 71 percent for men;        (3) between 2001 and 2015, the suicide death rate in rural       counties in the United States was 17.32 per 100,000       individuals, which is significantly greater than the national       average, and the data shows that between that same time       period, suicide rates increased for all age groups across all       counties in the United States, with the highest rates and the       greatest increases being in more rural counties; and        (4) the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services       Administration must be equipped to provide specialized       resources to these and other high-risk populations.        (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Assistant Secretary for Mental       Health and Substance Use shall submit to the Committee on       Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the       Senate, and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House       of Representatives a report that--        (1) details a strategy, to be developed in consultation       with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the       National Institute of Mental Health, and organizations       capable of providing nationwide suicide prevention and crisis       services for LGBTQ youth, minorities, rural individuals, or       other high-risk populations, for the Substance Abuse and       Mental Health Services Administration to offer, support, or       provide technical assistance to training programs for       National Suicide Prevention Lifeline counselors to increase       competency in serving high-risk populations; and        (2) includes recommendations regarding--        (A) the facilitation of access to services that are       provided to specially trained staff and partner organizations       for LGBTQ youth, minorities, rural individuals, and other       high-risk populations; and        (B) a strategy for optimally implementing an Integrated       Voice Response, or other equally effective mechanism, to       allow National Suicide Prevention Lifeline callers who are       LGBTQ youth, minorities, rural individuals, or members of       other high-risk populations to access specialized services.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 2661.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, last Congress, the House took up the National Suicide  Hotline Improvement Act, which directed the FCC to study and consider  whether it is technically feasible to establish a three-digit number  for calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.   I am proud that today, during Suicide Prevention Month, the House is  taking up the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act to expand our  previous efforts. The legislation before us directs the FCC to  designate ``988'' as the number for accessing the lifeline. The FCC, in  response to our previous legislation, is already taking steps to  accomplish this, but the legislation goes further.  [[Page H4610]]    Critically, this measure paves the way to create a sustainable  funding stream for our suicide prevention call-takers, something that  we desperately need. These seemingly small changes will make finding  help immensely easier for Americans who are experiencing suicide or  mental health crises.   The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is accessible today  by calling 1-800-273-TALK, received more than 2.2 million calls in  2018. As hard as it is to believe, that figure is expected to go up  when 988 is fully implemented and becomes accessible to the public. But  designating a short three-digit code that is easier to remember than a  cumbersome 1-800 number is supposed to reach more people. That is the  point. But that is also why it is so important that the lifeline be  able to fund its operations.   Because of this legislation, it is likely that the lifeline will  receive more calls and save more lives than it does today. Luckily, the  lifeline has a proven track record, successfully deescalating almost 98  percent of interactions with callers experiencing suicidal or mental  health crises.   We have no reason to expect different outcomes when the number  changes to 988 because the bill ensures that the lifeline network call  centers will have the resources necessary to handle the increase in  volume that they are anticipating. It is undeniably one of the most  effective tools at our disposal to address the crisis of suicide in  America.   An analysis of 1,500 calls from just over 1,400 individuals showed  that callers who utilized the lifeline's assistance were significantly  more likely to feel less depressed, less suicidal, less overwhelmed,  and more hopeful by the end of the call. It is clear that people who  can access help when they need it have better outcomes than those who  can't.   That is why our immediate goal with this legislation is to reach the  people who need help but aren't getting it, and there are far too many  folks who fit that description. More than 47,000 Americans died by  suicide, and more than 1.4 million Americans attempted suicide in 2017.  In 2018, 48,000 Americans died by suicide. Sadly, the numbers are even  worse for certain at-risk populations.   More than 6,000 veterans died by suicide each year from 2008 to 2017.  Young LGBTQ adults are four times more likely to contemplate suicide  than their heterosexual peers, and 39 percent of LGBTQ youths reported  seriously considering suicide in the past 12 months.   Mr. Speaker, that is why this bill ensures that the lifeline and the  good people on the other end of the call have the tools and resources  they need to reach people who need it the most.   Mr. Speaker, the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act is a  necessary step to reducing suicide in the United States and will  ultimately save lives. I thank Representatives Moulton and Stewart for  drafting this measure and the Senate for introducing a companion bill.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank the chairs and ranking members of the  Communications and Technology Subcommittee and the full Committee on  Energy and Commerce for their bipartisan work to bring this measure to  the floor. I look forward to the legislation passing the House today  and its signature by the President.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Stewart) for his leadership on this issue. It is an issue that can  affect families and tear them apart, and I appreciate the work.  [[Page H4611]]    The National Suicide Hotline Designation Act is a necessary step in  reducing suicide in the United States and will ultimately save lives.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5918.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 5918.   In times of crisis, Americans rely on communications systems to stay  informed, check on loved ones, and access emergency assistance. As the  agency in charge of overseeing our Nation's communications systems, it  is the responsibility of the FCC, the Federal Communications  Commission, to ensure that Americans stay connected when it matters  most and that the communications providers are prepared for whatever  disasters may come their way.   Keeping networks online through the course of a hurricane or a  wildfire is a difficult task, but the fact of the matter is network  outages occur far too frequently. That reality is due in large part to  climate change. According to the National Climate Assessment, the  recent trends of increasingly severe storms and disasters are only  expected to continue.   While we are not here asking the FCC or even the communications  providers to solve the problem of climate change, we do expect them, as  stewards of our communications systems and networks, to adapt with the  times. To make progress in this regard we need to start with data.   The Disaster Information Reporting System, or DIRS, was launched by  the FCC in 2007 so that communications providers could report the  status of communications systems during disasters. In some cases, DIRS  is activated in advance of a potential storm or as a precautionary  measure.   In more extreme cases, DIRS is activated in the lead-up to a disaster  and stays active for days on end. That is because a network can go on  and offline even after a storm's end. It is usually a sign that the  event is so severe that it knocks out commercial power, takes down  lines and poles, or some combination of the two.   Those are the storms that are expected to continue and grow with each  year, and that is why this bill comes at a crucial time. Under this  bill, the FCC would be required to conduct a deep and thorough analysis  of any disaster or event for which DIRS is activated by the FCC and  stays active for a minimum of 7 days.   First, the FCC would be required to issue a preliminary report within  6 weeks after the date DIRS is deactivated. This report would include  detailed information about the number of outages, whether  communications infrastructure was affected, and how many 911 centers  were affected by service outages.   This bill would then require the FCC to hold a field hearing no later  than 8 months after the Commission deactivates DIRS. By requiring the  FCC to get out of Washington and see and hear real stories on the  ground, the FCC will get an opportunity to examine these events, the  outages they cause, and how we can prevent them from happening in the  future.   Last week, the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology held a  productive and informative FCC oversight hearing. At the hearing,  Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel stressed to the committee that we need  to update our playbook for communications in disasters. She is right,  and this bill is how we move forward to get that goal.   We rely on our devices, and we count on having a signal or connection  in our time of need. In fact, right now in California, folks are using  their devices to track fast-moving wildfires, ready to drop everything  and evacuate if there is an unexpected shift in the fire's path.   In our world today, connectivity is not a luxury; it is essential to  ensuring our collective safety. Often it can make a difference between  life and death.   I commend Representative Doris Matsui for her leadership on this  bill, especially as her constituents and mine all across California  continue to grapple with these fires.   I also want to thank Ranking Member Walden and subcommittee Ranking  Member Latta for working with us to move this bill through the Energy  and Commerce Committee on a bipartisan basis. And, of course, I would  like to thank Communications and Technology Subcommittee Chairman  Mike  Doyle and full committee Chairman Frank Pallone for their leadership in  getting us all there.   This is a good bill that will help us make our communications systems  more resilient in the future. I look forward to its consideration by  the Senate and the President.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as California has grappled with  devastating wildfires, we must do everything possible to help them stay  connected during these events, when connectivity can mean the  difference between life and death.   H.R. 5918 is a critical part of this effort. I urge my colleagues to  support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5567) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require the  Federal Communications Commission to consider market entry barriers for  socially disadvantaged individuals in the communications marketplace  report under section 13 of such Act.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5567         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Measuring the Economics       Driving Investments and Access for Diversity Act of 2020'' or       the ``MEDIA Diversity Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. CONSIDERING MARKET ENTRY BARRIERS FOR SOCIALLY                     DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS.         Section 13(d) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C.       163(d)) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(4) Considering socially disadvantaged individuals.--In       assessing the state of competition under subsection (b)(1)       and regulatory barriers under subsection (b)(3), the       Commission, with the input of the Office of Communications       Business Opportunities of the Commission, shall consider       market entry barriers for socially disadvantaged individuals       in the communications marketplace in accordance with the       national policy under section 257(b).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5567.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5567, the Measuring the  Economics Driving Investments and Access for Diversity Act of 2020, or,  simply, the MEDIA Diversity Act of 2020.   This bill promotes much-needed diversity in the communications  marketplace, and I commend Representatives Veasey and Long and their  staffs for all their efforts towards this bipartisan bill.   I also, of course, want to thank Communications and Technology  Subcommittee Chairman  Mike Doyle, full committee Chairman Pallone,  Ranking Member Walden, and Ranking Member Latta for their work in  bringing this bipartisan legislation to the floor.   This bill requires the FCC to consider, with the input of its Office  of Communications Business Opportunities, market entry barriers for  socially disadvantaged individuals in the communications marketplace.   When Representatives Long and Veasey first introduced this bill in  January of this year, it was, of course, a different time. The murder  of George Floyd has since led to protests across the country,  highlighting decades of racial inequalities.   Those inequalities exist in our communications marketplace. For  example, the owners of broadcast and cable media outlets do not reflect  our diverse population. These media outlets can influence people's  opinions and perceptions through educational, political, entertainment,  and news programming.   Diversity in ownership of media outlets helps to ensure that  programming offers different perspectives and that viewers have access  to programming that is relevant to them.   Experts have also found that ownership diversity can provide  financial and competitive benefits. But in a concentrated  communications marketplace, barriers for entry still exist, and the  Federal Communications Commission is already tasked with studying what  those barriers are. This bill simply asks the FCC to also consider  market entry barriers for socially disadvantaged individuals.   Creating ownership parity to reflect the country's diversity is a  worthy goal, and this bipartisan effort is just a small step that can  have a genuine impact in identifying market entry barriers.   To be clear, there is so much more that we need to do, and the Energy  and Commerce Committee, 2 weeks ago, reported out two additional bills  that also take important steps to diversify our media market, one of  which my Republican colleagues unfortunately objected to.   I would call on my Republican colleagues to support those measures as  well when they come to the floor. This is no time to say that our work  is done. We must recognize that Americans need transformative change to  meet this moment.   While incremental steps are crucial, we must do more. These  additional measures that were just reported by the committee, like this  one, are modest changes that will help begin the task of comprehensive  reform.   I am proud of the good work done by the members of the committee, and  I am proud of this bill. I hope we can come together as a committee and  as a Congress and do the additional work that is needed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the MEDIA  Diversity Act of 2020, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5567 promotes much needed diversity  in the communications marketplace. As the Member who represents the  most racially and ethnically diverse city in the country, Stockton,  California, I want to make sure that the owners of broadcast and cable  media outlets reflect our diverse population. H.R. 5567 is a step  toward achieving that goal.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 451) to repeal the section of the Middle Class Tax Relief  and Job Creation Act of 2012 that requires the Federal Communications  Commission to reallocate and auction the T-Band spectrum, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 451         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Don't Break Up the T-Band       Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. REPEAL OF REQUIREMENT TO REALLOCATE AND AUCTION T-                    BAND SPECTRUM.         (a) Repeal.--Section 6103 of the Middle Class Tax Relief       and Job Creation Act of 2012 (47 U.S.C. 1413) is repealed.

Such       interagency strike force shall be known as the ``Ending 9-1-1       Fee Diversion Now Strike Force'' (in this section referred to       as the ``Strike Force'').        (2) Duties.--In carrying out the study under paragraph (1),       the Strike Force shall--        (A) determine the effectiveness of any Federal laws,       including regulations, policies, and practices, or budgetary       or jurisdictional constraints regarding how the Federal       Government can most expeditiously end diversion by a State or       taxing jurisdiction of 9-1-1 fees or charges;  [[Page H4615]]         (B) consider whether criminal penalties would further       prevent diversion by a State or taxing jurisdiction of 9-1-1       fees or charges; and        (C) determine the impacts of diversion by a State or taxing       jurisdiction of 9-1-1 fees or charges.

(d) Failure to Comply.--Notwithstanding any other provision       of law, any State or taxing jurisdiction identified by the       Commission in the report required under section 6(f)(2) of       the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 (47       U.S.C. 615a-1(f)(2)) as engaging in diversion of 9-1-1 fees       or charges shall be ineligible to participate or send a       representative to serve on any committee, panel, or council       established under section 6205(a) of the Middle Class Tax       Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (47 U.S.C. 1425(a)) or       any advisory committee established by the Commission.       SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.         Nothing in this Act, the Wireless Communications and Public       Safety Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-81), or the Communications       Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) shall be construed to       prevent a State or taxing jurisdiction from requiring an       annual audit of the books and records of a provider of 9-1-1       services concerning the collection and remittance of a 9-1-1       fee or charge.       SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) 9-1-1 fee or charge.--The term ``9-1-1 fee or charge''       has the meaning given such term in subparagraph (D) of       paragraph (3) of section 6(f) of the Wireless Communications       and Public Safety Act of 1999, as added by this Act.        (2) 9-1-1 services.--The term ``9-1-1 services'' has the       meaning given such term in section 158(e) of the National       Telecommunications and Information Administration       Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 942(e)).        (3) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Federal       Communications Commission.        (4) Diversion.--The term ``diversion'' means, with respect       to a 9-1-1 fee or charge, the obligation or expenditure of       such fee or charge for a purpose or function other than the       purposes and functions designated in the final rules issued       under paragraph (3) of section 6(f) of the Wireless       Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999, as added by       this Act, as purposes and functions for which the obligation       or expenditure of such a fee or charge is acceptable.        (5) State or taxing jurisdiction.--The term ``State or       taxing jurisdiction'' has the meaning given such term in       subparagraph (D) of paragraph (3) of section 6(f) of the       Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999, as       added by this Act.       SEC. 7. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 451.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 451.   I am pleased that we are finally here on the floor considering this  legislation to protect the public safety spectrum.   Since the 1970s, a band of spectrum known as the ``T-Band'' has been  utilized by local and regional public safety officials, fire companies,  and first responders. The T-Band is an indispensable radio channel that  creates the backbone of the public safety communications systems in 11  major metro areas across the United States.   Yet, the T-Band is at risk because of a provision of the law that  jeopardizes public safety and first responders' ability to continue  operations in that band.   Unless Congress acts, the Federal Communications Commission is  required by law to clear out the current T-Band users, relocate them to  a different channel, and prepare the T-Band for commercial auction.  This would be a mistake for a number of reasons.   For starters, the cost of relocating every public safety T-Band user  to a different band is roughly $5 billion to $6 billion, according to  the Government Accountability Office.   That figure is hard to justify, especially when we consider that,  under the current law, the cost of relocating all those incumbent users  are supposed to be covered by the proceeds from auctioning off the T- Band for commercial use.   The problem there is, even the most generous estimates put the  potential T-Band auction proceeds at only $1 billion to $2 billion.  Relative to other auctions, that is not very much. There is not a lot  of demand for this kind of spectrum in the market, which means  taxpayers would be on the hook for the other $4 billion, roughly.   But make no mistake, we have heard loud and clear that the T-Band is  perfect for public safety and first responder communications. Put  simply, the T-Band is what our public safety personnel are used to,  they don't want to lose it, and letting them continue operating in that  band saves the taxpayers up to $4 billion.   With this bill, we are showing first responders and public safety  personnel operating in the T-Band, who every day serve and protect more  than 90 million Americans collectively, that we have their backs.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Engel, the bill's  sponsor, for his years of leadership and persistence on this issue. I  also want to thank Ranking Member Walden for working with us to get  this bill to the floor today and appreciate his work to curb the  diversion of 911 fees by States.   This is a commonsense bill that helps public safety personnel across  the country, and it will ultimately save the taxpayers money in the  long run. I am glad to see this legislation move out of the House today  on a bipartisan basis and look forward to its consideration by the  Senate and the President.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the minority manager, Mr. Gianforte, for  his work this afternoon in managing the floor.   The T-Band is what our first responders and public safety personnel  are used to. They don't want to lose it. And letting them continue in  that band saves the taxpayers up to $4 billion. That is why we must  pass H.R. 451.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
