 Madam Speaker, imagine at the age of 3  being taking out of the arms of your dying father by terrorists, and  having a birthday, turning 4 years old as a hostage.   Indeed, this was the case for Abigail Edan, who was taken at the  hands of Hamas terrorists.   The story doesn't stop here. Not only did they kill her father, but  they also killed her mother.   Abigail, I remind you, Madam Speaker, is an American citizen. Her  young life has been forever scarred by this unspeakable tragedy.   At the calls for the release of hostages, Abigail's return brings us  relief, but also highlights the urgent need for Hamas terrorists to  free all citizens still held captive immediately. As Abigail returns to  her brother and sister, it is time for all hostages to embrace their  loved ones.                            ____________________
