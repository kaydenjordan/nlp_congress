 Mr. Speaker, Speaker Pelosi reinstated the  mask mandate following the ever-changing CDC guidelines. She is even  threatening to arrest staff who refuse to be obedient.   The Democrats are using fear and mandates to continue the crisis  mode. But the real crisis has yet to hit: depression, alcohol and drug  abuse, suicide, supply chain issues, halted production, economic  collapse, and worse, the damage to our children's hearts and minds from  being out of their school and activities.   For the Speaker of the House, these mandates are all about politics  and not science. That is why when she thought no one was watching, she  went to a closed hair salon to get her hair done without wearing a  mask. She got caught and then blamed the hair salon owner.   The rules only apply to we the people. They never apply to those who  are in power.   Americans are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves. The  Democrats in this House, and the rest of the Federal Government, do not  know better than you, and they never have. Since when did the Federal  Government become your doctor?                            ____________________
