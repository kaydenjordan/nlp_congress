 Mr. Speaker, first, let me say thank you to the chair of  the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman   Steven Horsford, for  shaping our message tonight and reminding us so eloquently of what our  role is to be here as a Member of Congress, as a member of the  Congressional Black Caucus, representing some 80 million Americans and  some 18 million Black Americans.   To our Special Order hour chairs, the gentleman from Illinois and the  gentlewoman from Florida, thank you for your leadership role. Thank you  for your opening remarks reminding us that words matter, reminding us  that as leaders, we are elected to represent diverse bodies across this  wonderful America that we live in. Thank you to my classmate,  Congressman   Donald Payne, for giving us a history, for setting the  record straight.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today because we want America to know how  important our work is. We want them to know when we say we are woke, we  are proud. We are speaking to constituents across America.   Somehow, my colleagues have started with that, turning that into a  negative. Well, we are very clear that we are very woke. We are woke  about what is needed to all constituents, and we are fighting for  everyone, but, yes, we clearly stand up and represent Black America.   I rise today to join my colleagues in shedding light on the deeply  derogatory term that has perpetuated the pain and suffering endured by  Black Americans throughout history; the term that was used by a Member  of this Chamber just a few days ago--colored people.   It was equally as disturbing, Mr. Speaker, that he made reference to  DE&I as lowering standards, getting less than. Well, today I rise as a  strong supporter of DE&I.   Through the bold leadership of then Chairwoman Maxine Waters, chair  of the prestigious Financial Services Committee, I was appointed by her  as the first-ever D&I chair of the Subcommittee on Diversity and  Inclusion under the powerful Financial Services Committee.   Now, I mention this for a reason, Mr. Speaker. We brought in the  largest financial institutions in this Nation, CEOs of companies like  J.P. Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and the  list goes on and on.   Each one of those CEOs under oath testified that they were committed  to DE&I because it was a good business thing, and it would make a  difference in this country.   They hired DE&I corporate executives across America not because it  was lowering standards, not because they were employing people who were  less than, but because they had an understanding in this America that  we live in that that makes us more united, and it helps us avoid the  culture wars that I am sadly seeing on this floor.   Today, Mr. Speaker, I stand here as a Black woman, proud to serve all  of my constituents, but, today, it is very personal and somewhat  emotional for me  [[Page H3635]]  because I am standing here in the same spot that I stood in last week  where I am now reminded that I was faced to deal with in 2023 what I  heard on this floor.   On this floor, Mr. Speaker, the people's House, I am forced to deal  with what for centuries Black Americans have been subjected to:  systemic oppression, denied human rights, and treated as lesser human  beings, simply because of the color of their skin.   Phrases like this have no place on the House floor in Congress or  anywhere else. This term, more commonly used in the Jim Crow years, is  a phrase that is deeply offensive and considered as a slur to delineate  Black Americans as less than, and it carries the historical burden of  pain and violent discrimination, widespread inequality, and  segregation.   Mr. Speaker, as I come to a close, let me just share with you that we  live in a world where the United States of America is a superpower on  the global stage because of our rich diversity, something that is to be  celebrated, not used as a tool to shame not only us but those  servicemen who signed up to put their life on the line for this  country.                                time  2015    I am sitting here and thinking what John Lewis would say because so  many of my Republican colleagues proudly quote him: See something, say  something. I am feeling like what Shirley Chisholm must have thought  when she was the only female to be one of the founders of the  Congressional Black Caucus and to stand on this House floor as a Black  woman having to deal with the things that we are having to deal with  now.   Certainly, I could go on and on and do a roll call of many other  Black Americans, White Americans, and Brown Americans who have stood on  this floor defending this House.   This word should not be allowed to be used as a tool to shame or  admonish those who are systemically marginalized or oppressed.   I know well the consequences that have come as a result of systemic  discrimination, whether by policy or by everyday hate speech. Each of  us, Mr. Speaker, in this body is responsible for challenging and  dismantling systems of discrimination that have perpetuated throughout  our society.   I am going to offer a resolve. We have heard our chairperson say no  apologies, seen a few statements on social media, but since the Speaker  of the House issued a statement that there was no place for this, the  leader of the House supported that the words be taken down, there is an  issue that can help me with resolve.   You see, several of us, as Democrats and members of the Congressional  Black Caucus, have a piece of legislation that says Black history is  American history. If we really believe in bipartisanship, if  Representative Crane, as he said, wanted to amend his words because he  did not mean that, and somewhere on social media he invoked God and  what this was causing him with his team, then let's have all of our  Members recognize that there are so many things that Black Americans  did because Black history is American history.   If we had the time, I could rattle off a list of things that we are  allowed to do because a Black person invented it or a Black person  designed it. If we really meant to say ``people of color,'' then let me  say people of color have led and continue to lead this Nation.   A Black man served as President of these United States. A Black woman  serves as Vice President of these United States. Right here in the spot  that you are standing, Mr. Speaker, a Black man, for the first time in  the history of this country, became sworn in by this body as the  minority leader in this House and held that most sacred gavel to put in  the hands of the Speaker.   As I end, I will use my voice and my platform to make the world a  better place for my children--for all the children and grandchildren-- and my grandchildren, so Spencer and Leah will know that they, too,  will be valued as strong Black Americans. I charge all of my colleagues  to do the same.
