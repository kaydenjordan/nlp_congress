 Mr. President, I spoke to Senator McCain this morning  and let him know the Senate continues to send its thoughts to him. Our  friend from Arizona is a pretty tough guy, as we all know. He will be  back with us soon. We will continue to offer him best wishes for a  speedy recovery in the meantime, and we will continue to keep Cindy,  their family, his staff, and the people of Arizona in our thoughts.                            ____________________     We will also continue to work on items before the  Senate. As we all know, the nomination before the Senate today is of  particular concern to Senator McCain. Just a few days ago, as chairman  of the Armed Services Committee, he came to the floor to underline the  importance of confirming the nominee before us. Here is what he said.   ``In order to rebuild the military,'' he said, ``the Pentagon needs  to ramp up readiness programs and embark on an ambitious plan for  modernization to make sure our servicemembers are given the training,  resources, and capabilities they need. To do that, the Department of  Defense must have senior leadership.''   For instance--this is Senator McCain last week--the nominee before  us, Patrick Shanahan, who has been nominated to be Secretary Mattis's  Deputy at the Department of Defense.   ``The position of Deputy Secretary of [Defense],'' Chairman McCain  continued, ``is one of the most critical positions in our government.  It is essentially the chief operating officer of the largest, most  complex organization in the world--the Department that is entrusted  with ensuring our national security.''   Yet, as Senator McCain noted, the position is now vacant. Friday was  the last day of work for the previous Deputy Secretary of Defense, and  Democrats, who do not oppose Shanahan's confirmation on the merits, are  throwing up procedural hurdles that guarantee this critical national  security position will remain vacant for a while longer. Why? To change  an outcome? No, not to change an outcome. As I said, many Democrats  actually support Shanahan's nomination. He commands the bipartisan  support of the Armed Services Committee, which reported his nomination  out on a voice vote--a voice vote--and he has earned praise from across  the aisle. As one Democratic Senator put it, ``[Patrick Shanahan's]  entire career has been about solving problems no one else can solve,  and these skills would be invaluable at DOD.'' Well, she is certainly  right. Then why is her party playing games with the nomination?   These are the same games we have seen before. Take the Ambassador to  China. Democrats voted with us to confirm him 82 to 12. Yet they still  forced the Senate to waste days on useless procedural votes getting  there. Take the Ambassador to Japan we considered last week. Democrats  voted with Republicans to confirm him 86 to 12. Yet they still forced  unnecessary procedural hurdles all along the way. Perhaps the most  egregious example of this was the noncontroversial judicial nominee  from Idaho we considered just last week. Like the nominee before us,  the committee of jurisdiction reported out his nomination on a voice  vote. Yet, also like the nominee before us, Democrats threw up  unnecessary procedural hurdles on his nomination. When we took the vote  to end debate on the judicial nominee from Idaho, they all joined with  us--every single one of them--to say that debate on his nomination was  not necessary and then insisted on 2 more days of ``nondebate'' before  voting with us to confirm him 100 to 0.   So it doesn't really matter whether the nominee has been nominated to  serve in the judiciary or work as an Ambassador or serve in the  Treasury Department or head an intelligence agency or sit on the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Democrats have  [[Page S4010]]  shown time and time again they are willing to force needless procedural  votes on nominees they actually support in order to waste the Senate's  time--and presumably with the simultaneous goal of impeding the  President's ability to make almost any appointments at all. If this  trend continues, it will take us more than 11 years to confirm the  remaining Presidential appointments. Let me repeat that. More than 11  years. A Presidential term lasts 4 years.   The level of obstruction exhibited by Senate Democrats on these  nominees is simply breathtaking. It is often leaving key Departments  without the senior leadership needed to guide our country through the  various challenges we face. It needs to stop.   The Senate needs to confirm Mr. Shanahan quickly, and we need to do  that for the sake of our national security. And our colleagues need to  stop this immediately, for the sake of the country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, ObamaCare has been hurting the people  we represent for many years now. That is why the Senate has been  working hard to move beyond its failures. Costs were supposed to go  down under ObamaCare, but they skyrocketed. Premiums have already  increased by an average of more than 100 percent on the Federal  exchange. Next year, they could rise by as much as 50 percent or more  in States as diverse as Georgia, New Mexico, and Maryland.   Look, we need to tackle this problem. The revised discussion draft we  released last week contains many different reforms designed to make  insurance more affordable and more flexible so it is something  Americans actually want to buy. It gives Americans more choices for  managing their care. It also takes aim at ObamaCare's taxes that target  the middle class and drive up premiums--taxes on everything from health  insurance to over-the-counter medication.   Choice was supposed to go up under ObamaCare, but of course it  plummeted. Americans living in 70 percent of counties have little to no  options for ObamaCare insurance today. Next year, nearly 40 percent  fewer insurers have filed to offer plans. Many Americans face the real  possibility of having no options at all and could find themselves  trapped, forced by law to purchase ObamaCare insurance but left by  ObamaCare without any means to do so.   We need to tackle this problem. The revised discussion draft is  designed to stabilize the collapsing insurance markets and encourage  more insurers to participate. It will transfer many healthcare  decisions away from Washington bureaucrats and politicians and put them  back with Americans and their doctors. It will also give Americans the  freedom to decide their own healthcare, allowing them to purchase the  insurance they actually want, rather than just forcing Americans to buy  what ObamaCare is selling.   There are other healthcare problems that need to be tackled as well.  We need to strengthen Medicaid, for instance, so it can deliver better  care at a better cost today and remain available to future generations  tomorrow.   Our legislation contains important reforms to move our country  forward in all of these areas. These are the kinds of reforms Americans  deserve--not the status quo of ObamaCare, not a multibillion-dollar  bandaid, not a piling on of even more ObamaCare, but real, patient- centered reforms that can finally move us beyond the pain of this law.  The only way we will get there is with continued hard work. That is  just what we intend to do.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 170, John Kenneth Bush.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 100, David Bernhardt.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum  calls with respect to the cloture motions be waived.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12 noon  on Tuesday, July 18, there be 15 minutes of postcloture debate, equally  divided in the usual form, on the Shanahan nomination; that following  the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the  nomination; and that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate immediately  resume consideration of the Bush nomination.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today I wish to remember David Duff, a  well-respected coal operator from Perry County, KY. David passed away  on July 3 in Snowmass, CO, at the age of 67. He will be remembered by  many for his kindness and generosity, especially toward the elderly,  children, and our Nation's veterans.   David owned Pine Branch Coal Company, employing hundreds of miners in  eastern Kentucky and serving as a leader in the industry. He was dearly  loved by many in his community, as was shown by the many signs posted  along the road leading to his home in the days after his passing.   Elaine and I send our condolences to David's wife, Susan, their  children Lori and Ryan, their grandchildren, and all of their family  and friends. We hope that their memories of David will help them  through this time of grief.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate my friend  Chip Hutcheson, publisher of the Times Leader in Princeton, KY, on his  retirement after more than four decades in the newspaper business.  Throughout Chip's long career, he was the quintessential community  journalist who saw, as one colleague noted, ``the newspaper as both a  champion for and a guardian of the community.'' When he retired at the  end of June, Chip was named the recipient of the National Newspaper  Association's James O. Amos Award. He was only the second Kentuckian to  ever win what is known as one of the two ``highest and most  distinguished tributes in community journalism.''   Chip's relationship with the Princeton-based paper began at only 10  months old when his parents purchased the then-Princeton Leader and  began to instill in him a love of the trade. Beginning at the age of 8,  Chip spent time at the paper, watching his parents work. In junior  high, Chip joined the team to proofread a section of the paper before  it was sent to the printer. Later, he proudly wrote that, ``Newspaper  ink runs in my veins.'' During high school and college, Chip honed his  skills writing for local and campus papers. After graduation, he  entered the U.S. Army and served in Vietnam. When he returned, Chip  went back to his trade and began a decades-long career of journalistic  excellence.   Chip became the publisher of the Princeton Leader upon his parents'  retirement in 1976. As local papers merged, Chip became the publisher  of the Times Leader in 1992, continuing his family legacy. Chip  admitted that his columns may have been a little ``old school,'' but he  proudly followed the tradition set by his father and his other role  models of local community journalism. He used his writings to give  readers an inside look into the lives of his family and community.   Although his efforts were always dedicated to readers in western  Kentucky, Chip was recognized across the Commonwealth and the Nation  for his outstanding work. He served on the board of directors of the  Kentucky Press Association, including 1 year as its president in 2010.  The Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame inducted Chip into its elite ranks  in 2012, in recognition of his distinguished career of leadership and  service. More recently, Chip served as president of the National  Newspaper Association.   Chip has also been a great advocate for families seeking to adopt  children internationally. With his wife, Karen, and grandchildren,  Lemlem and Kashiku, Chip came to my office several years ago asking for  relief from the many regulatory burdens in the  [[Page S4021]]  adoption process. I was thankful to know of the Hutcheson family's  story. By working with my colleagues in the Senate, we passed the  bipartisan Accuracy for Adoptees Act, which was then signed into law.  Thanks in large part to the efforts of Chip and Karen, more families  across the country are able to more easily navigate the rewarding yet  often difficult process of bringing a child into a loving home through  adoption.   Chip's unwavering dedication to his work and his community left a  mark on the readers of Caldwell County. His writings not only brought  the news, but he also served as a voice for people in his community by  expressing the beauty and joy of western Kentucky life. After decades  of hard work, Chip has earned his retirement. Along with his readers, I  will miss his observations about life and current events. I would like  to join with the Princeton community and all of the supporters of the  Times Leader who congratulate Chip on his retirement and wish his  family many relaxing and enjoyable years together. Further, I would  like to ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in commemorating  Chip Hutcheson on a distinguished career in community journalism.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  July 18; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that following leader  remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Shanahan nomination; finally, that the Senate  recess following resumption of the Bush nomination until 2:15 p.m. to  allow for the weekly conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:06 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, July 18, 2017, at 10 a.m.
