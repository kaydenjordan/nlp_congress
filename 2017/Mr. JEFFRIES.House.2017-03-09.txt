 Mr. Speaker, this is day 49 of the Trump  administration, which has been characterized by chaos, crisis, and  confusion. Donald Trump promised to bring the jobs back, but the jobs  bill must be in the witness protection program because, for the life of  me, I can't find it.   Instead, we get TrumpCare, a bill that would destroy health care in  America as we know it. TrumpCare will increase premiums on the American  people. TrumpCare will increase copays on the American people.  TrumpCare will increase deductibles on the American people. TrumpCare  will increase the cost of prescription drugs on the American people.  TrumpCare will reduce coverage for the American people. TrumpCare will  be a disaster. And that is why House Democrats are going to do  everything in our power to stop this reckless version of health care  for America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from  Maryland for yielding.       It was all a dream,      I used to read Word Up! magazine.      Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine,      Hangin' pictures on my wall,      Every Saturday Rap Attack,      Mr. Magic, Marley Marl.    Those were the words of the late great Notorious B.I.G., Biggie  Smalls, Frank White, the King of New York. He died 20 years ago today  in a tragedy that occurred in Los Angeles, but his words live on  forever.   I have got the privilege of representing the district where Biggie  Smalls was raised. We know he went from negative to positive and  emerged as one of the world's most important hip-hop stars. His rags- to-riches life story is the classic embodiment of the American Dream.   Biggie Smalls is gone, but he will never be forgotten. Rest in peace,  Notorious B.I.G.   Where Brooklyn at?                                time  1945
