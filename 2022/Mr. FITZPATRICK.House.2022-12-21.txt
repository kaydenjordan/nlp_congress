 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, in 1894, the United States founded an organization that  has since grown into the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee. The  U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee is tasked with organizing the  participation of U.S. athletes in international amateur athletic  events.   In 1950, Congress granted the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee a  Federal charter under title 36 of the U.S. Code. As a congressionally  chartered organization, it takes an act of Congress to make changes to  the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee's charter.   This bill would amend the bylaws for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic  Committee and national governing bodies to require those entities to  provide equal pay for male and female athletes who represent the U.S.  in international amateur athletic events. This would include equal  compensation, wages, benefits, medical care, travel arrangements, and  reimbursement for expenses.   S. 2333 also requires a committee of national governing bodies to  report annually to Congress on compliance with treating athletes  equally.   We are simply asking for support for the bill and hope that the vote  will be taken in a timely fashion.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   S. 5168 makes a narrow and positive change to U.S. immigration law to  ensure that alien lighterers have access to visas that allow them to do  their jobs on ships in U.S. waters.   Lightering is an offshore ship-to-ship transfer of oil from one oil  tanker that is too big to travel into a U.S. port to a ship that is  small enough to enter the port. According to the oil industry,  lightering is used for over 50 percent of the crude oil imports into  the United States.   In order to get the ships in U.S. waters, alien lighterers must  currently obtain a C-1/D visa, which is a combination of a transit visa  and a crewmember visa.   The C visa, or transit visa, allows the lighterer to enter the U.S.  to board the ship on which he or she will be working. The D visa allows  the lighterer to work as an alien crewman.   While the maximum period of stay allowed under the D visa is 29 days,  the work of the lightering crews normally lasts anywhere from 3 to 6  months.   As a workaround to the 29-day limit, once lighterers are present at  the U.S. port of entry, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP,  officers parole them into the United States for a 180-day period.   Recognizing the importance of the lightering industry and its crews  to oil supply chain security, CBP has granted lighterers this parole  under both Democrat and Republican administrations.   Unfortunately, such a situation is not what was contemplated when  Congress created the parole authority. Statute requires that parole be  used only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or  significant public benefit.   The Trump administration aimed to rein in executive abuse of the  parole authority. In doing so, it initially curtailed the use of parole  for lighterers but soon after returned to allowing the practice.   S. 5168 recognizes the importance of the lightering industry to the  security of the oil supply chain. The bill creates a narrowly tailored  subcategory of C and D visas for aliens performing ``ship-to-ship  liquid cargo transfer operations to or from another vessel engaged in  foreign trade.''                                time  1430    It is very specific to lighterers and allows them to remain in the  United States for up to 180 days.   Mr. Speaker, I support this narrow change that will help ensure the  security of our oil supply chain at a time when the Biden  administration refuses to allow domestic industries producing energy  here at home.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
