 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Marine Corps Corporal  Hunter Lopez, my constituent, who was killed in action on August 26,  2021, while serving our Nation in Afghanistan.   Today, I humbly rise to honor his memory in the hope that Americans  across the country and future generations will come to know his story.   Corporal Lopez was a selfless young man with an infectious smile who  truly lived his life with a larger purpose in mind. That purpose was  serving our country and contributing to something greater than himself.   He was born in Palm Springs, California, on January 15, 1999. Growing  up in Indio, he possessed a passion for service from a young age. His  parents, Herman and Alicia, both public servants with the Riverside  County Sheriff's Department, instilled in him the courage, kindness,  and resolve that led him to join the Marine Corps.   Corporal Lopez was a history buff, an ambitious student, and an avid  Star Wars fan with an affinity for quizzing his friends and family on  the movie series' trivia.   He was also incredibly thoughtful. He was the kind of person who  would take the time, while serving overseas, to write letters to his  grandparents in their native Spanish, despite not being fluent himself,  just because he knew they would appreciate it.   Corporal Lopez always strived for excellence, and his determination  to succeed motivated his friends and those around him to reach their  full potential.   After graduating from La Quinta High School and achieving the rank of  captain as an Explorer Scout with the Riverside County Sheriff's  Department, Corporal Lopez joined the Marine Corps, where he served for  4 years.   His first 3 years were with the Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team  Company A, 5th Platoon, before he joined the 2nd Battalion 1st Marine  Division, Golf Company, 1st Platoon, 3rd Squad.   It was with the 2nd Battalion that Corporal Lopez served in Operation  Allies Refuge, contributing to the largest airlift in history and  aiding the evacuation of over 120,000 of our fellow Americans, allies,  and Afghan partners, a truly heroic and historic effort.   On August 26, 2021, Corporal Lopez was stationed at the airport in  Kabul. That day, under the blazing sun, Corporal Lopez and his fellow  marines worked tirelessly to evacuate the thousands of women, children,  and families who came to the airport desperately seeking safety,  protection, and refuge.   Striving to bring calm to a panicked crowd, Corporal Lopez put the  safety of others above his own. As the crowd grew more intense,  Corporal Lopez and his fellow marine, Sergeant David Traylor, spotted  two young girls, trapped under the weight of a fleeing crowd, about to  be crushed.   The two marines successfully pulled the children to safety, saving  their lives. They gave each other a fist bump, a very small celebration  for an incredible task that they had just achieved. And then the  explosion happened.   That day, Corporal Lopez gave his life to save the lives of others. I  can't think of anything--anything--more noble than that.   Corporal Lopez saved two lives at the Kabul airport, and because of  him, two children now have a future and the promise of a new life, many  others reached safety, and many others have a reason to hope.   We lost Corporal Lopez and 12 other servicemembers on August 26. Each  and every day since then, the Lopez family and the families of all our  Nation's fallen heroes continue to feel their loss. They feel the loss  of a loved one who made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation, and they  feel the loss of a hero who died serving a purpose larger than  themselves.   To the Lopez family, parents, Herman and Alicia; sister, Trinity; and  brother, Owen: You are in our constant prayers, and our entire Nation  grieves your loss, stands with you, and supports you.   We will continue to tell the story of Hunter's remarkable service,  compassion, strength, and valor so that his legacy will live on for  generations to come.                            ____________________
