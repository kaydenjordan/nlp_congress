 Mr. President, I rise to talk about recent  developments in Israel. Israel is America's ally and partner in  intelligence and defense. Our Nation's relationship with Israel is  built upon shared democratic values that have united our countries  throughout the last 75 years.   The decision this week of the Netanyahu government in Israel to  suspend the proposed judicial legislation opens the door for Israelis  to find a path forward. For Israel to remain a bedrock for democracies  globally, it must have an independent judiciary, support for the rule  of law, and a system of proper checks and balances.                            ____________________
