 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate excellence in athletics  for a special group of Hoosiers.   This past weekend, the Southwood volleyball team out of Wabash,  Indiana, won the 1A State championship for the very first time in  program history.   Southwood had made it to the final round twice back in 2009 and 2014,  only to fall just short, but the third time proved to be the charm for  the Knights. To capture their first State title, Southwood first had to  go through reigning Class 1A State runners-up and top-ranked Tecumseh.  It wasn't easy.   The Knights found themselves in an early hole to the Braves after  dropping the first set 25-15, but the Knights never wavered or lost  faith, winning the next three straight sets en route to victory.   In their exhilarating win, the Knights were led by Junior, Grace  Drake, whose triple-double performance proved to be a difference maker.   Congratulations to longtime head coach Tom Finicle and all the  Knights on bringing home the hardware.   Thank you for making your parents, peers, and entire Wabash community  so very proud.   Mr. Speaker, may God bless the Southwood volleyball team, and may God  bless America.                            ____________________
