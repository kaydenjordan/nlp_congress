 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate  my good friend and mentor, Dr. O'Dell Owens, on his retirement. As an  obstetrician, Dr. Owens brought countless young Americans into the  world.   Dr. Owens served as chairman of the board at the University of  Cincinnati. He was president of Cincinnati State University. He was the  medical director of the Cincinnati Health Department, and he served as  Hamilton County Coroner; all before spending 5 years as president and  CEO of Interact for Health in Cincinnati.   Through his everyday example, he has lived his motto to ``help people  help themselves.''   Dr. Owens' life is one devoted to a career of helping people who need  it most. He often reflects on his dad's advice that ``tomorrow is not  promised;'' therefore, it is necessary to make a difference today.   Dr. Owens, you have made a difference in so many lives, mine  included. Dr. Owens, again, congratulations on your well-deserved  retirement. Yet, I look forward to seeing what you may do next.                            ____________________
