 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my outrage toward  the latest travel ban proposed by the Trump administration again late  on September 24. The administration issued a proclamation with new  discriminatory travel restrictions on eight countries.   Let me be clear: no matter how many times this administration tries  to repackage it and sell it, a Muslim ban is a Muslim ban. It remains  hateful, discriminatory, and goes against our American values. We won't  be fooled by the inclusion of North Korea and Venezuela.   This Muslim and refugee ban continues to be part of a dangerous and  immoral agenda against a religion, people of color, and immigrants.   This administration and this ban is fanning the flames of fear and  anger against groups of Americans and immigrants, with policies that  clearly undermine the Constitution that I love and our American  principles.   Dressed up or dressed down, this ban must not stand.   We must address terrorism, and it is not restricted to the Muslim  population. We must address it here on the ground in homegrown  terrorism as well.                            ____________________
