 Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak in support  of very important new legislation, the Freedom to Vote Act, that I  introduced yesterday with the members of the Voting Rights Working  Group assembled by Leader Schumer, which includes Senator Manchin;  Senator Merkley, who is here with us today on the floor and who has  been such a leader on voting issues, including the For the People Act;  Senator Padilla; and Senators King, Kaine, Tester, and Warnock.   The freedom to vote is fundamental to all of our freedoms. Following  the 2020 elections in which more Americans voted than ever before, in  the middle of a public health crisis, we have seen unprecedented  attacks on our democracy in States across the country. These attacks  demand an immediate Federal response.   The Freedom to Vote Act will set basic national standards to make  sure all Americans can cast their ballots in the way that works best  for them, regardless of what ZIP Code they live in.   I want to thank Senator Schumer for his leadership in pulling  together our working group that got this legislation across the finish  line and, as I mentioned, Senators Merkley and Manchin for their work  on this crucial bill.   It has been over 8 months since that violent mob of insurrectionists  stormed through this very spot and desecrated our Capitol, the temple  of our democracy. They opened the desks in this Chamber. They got up  and sat at that desk where you are sitting now, Mr. President. It was  an attack on our Republic.   And as I said from the inaugural stage just 2 weeks later under that  beautiful blue sky, at the very place where you could still see the  spray paint at the bottom of the columns and the makeshift windows  behind us, ``This is the day our democracy picks itself up, brushes off  the dust, and does what America always does: goes forward as a nation,  under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.''   We took back our democracy that day with Democrats, Republicans, and  Independents all sitting at that platform, seeing a new President and  Vice President be inaugurated. We took back our democracy that day, and  we will take it back this day with this new bill, with the support of  78 percent of Americans who favor 2 weeks of early voting, a very  important provision in this bill, and 83 percent of voters who support  public disclosures of all contributions. We will take it back again  from those who are trying to take away people's constitutional right to  vote.   With over 400 bills introduced in nearly every State to limit the  freedom to vote, we can't simply sit back and watch our democracy be  threatened again. Whether it is threatened with bear spray and crowbars  and axes or long lines or the elimination of ballot boxes or the secret  money, it is still under siege. When we are faced with a coordinated  effort across the country to limit the freedom to vote, we must stand  up and do what is right.   Sometimes people say: What is going on? It worked so well during the  pandemic, during a public health crisis. More people voted than ever  before.   Well, that is because they voted by mail. That is because some  States, both blue States and red States, changed their laws to make it  easier to vote, while still protecting the sanctity of the vote.   So why is this happening? Well, I think our colleague Senator Rev.  Raphael Warnock put it best when he said: ``Some people don't want some  people to vote.'' We will not stand for that because that is not how a  democracy works.   Leader Schumer has said he will bring this new bill to a vote as soon  as next week because we know our democracy cannot wait. This bill  builds on the framework put forward by Senator Manchin in June and  includes many of the key reforms in the For the People Act,  guaranteeing all Americans, as I noted, access to at least 15 days of  early voting, including weekends.    Look at what just happened in Georgia. We just had a field hearing  down there with the Rules Committee. In Georgia, all of a sudden they  passed a law that says, yeah, you can vote on weekends early on, but  when it counts in a runoff period, in those last 28 days, you can't  vote on weekends anymore. That is only done for one reason: to make it  harder for people to vote. That is why this bill is so important.   What else does it do? It ensures that all voters can cast a mail-in  ballot and makes it easier to register to vote. That is pretty  important as we see Republican, Democrat, and Independent voters all  across this country wanting to be able to cast mail-in ballots. It is  the safest way for so many of them to vote, even today.   Some States even required them to get a notary signature in the  middle of a pandemic, through a glass window, when they were in the  hospital. You wonder why we want to have some Federal minimum standards  in place.   What else? Increased transparency through the DISCLOSE Act. I already  noted that over 80 percent of people in this country want to see that,  whether they are Democrats, Republicans, or Independents. It would  require super-PACs and issue advocacy groups to disclose donors who  contribute more than $10,000 and stop the use of transfers between  organizations to cloak the identity, to hide the identity of the source  of those contributions.   It would counter partisan interference in election administration and  protect election officials because not only do we need to make sure  people can vote, we need to make sure their vote is counted.   It would prevent voter purges by requiring States to use objective  and reliable evidence to remove voters and prohibit the targeting of  voters solely because they haven't voted recently, while giving  election administrators flexibility to remove voters based on State  records.   As Stacey Abrams has said, if you don't go to a meeting for a while,  do you lose your right to assemble? No, you don't. If you don't go to a  church or a synagogue or a mosque for a while, do you lose your right  to exercise your right to religion? No, you don't. You shouldn't lose  your right to vote.   It would also prohibit partisan gerrymandering, this bill will, so  that voters choose their elected officials, not the other way around.   Now, my home State of Minnesota is a great example of how this can  all work. When you make it easier for people to vote, they will vote. I  never see this as a partisan issue.  [[Page S6520]]    In election after election, our State leads the Nation in voter  turnout because we have things like, now, no-excuse voting by mail or  46 days of early voting. Our bill doesn't go that far because we are  setting minimum standards, but that is what we have in our State--and  same-day voter registration.   And what has happened as a result? High voter turnout every time.  Whom have we elected? Well, we have elected Democratic Governors like  our Governor, Tim Walz; we have elected Republican Governors like Tim  Pawlenty; and we have elected Independents like Jesse Ventura. But what  have I noticed? People feel like they are part of the democracy because  we make it easier for them to vote.   These policies that ensure Minnesotans continue to hold the coveted  title of first in voter turnout--very close to the Presiding Officer's  State of Colorado--are overseen by our secretary of state, Steve Simon,  who continues to push for improvements in our elections.   The freedom to vote is fundamental to all our freedoms. Protecting it  has not always been easy. Throughout our country's 245-year history, we  have had to course correct and take action to ensure that our democracy  for the people, by the people actually lives up to its ideals.   Voting is how Americans control their government and hold elected  officials accountable. It was the founding principle of our country,  and it has stood the test of wars, economic strife, and a global  pandemic. But as we have seen in States like Georgia, Florida, Iowa,  Montana, and most recently Texas, we are up against a coordinated  attack aimed at limiting the freedom to vote. This demands a Federal  response.   And the Constitution could not be clearer. It says right there that  Congress can make or alter laws regarding Federal elections.   Just last week, legislation in Texas was signed into law that makes  it harder to vote, and many States already are underway drawing new  congressional maps. Without this bill, there will be nothing to limit  many States from drawing gerrymandered maps that will distort the  voices of Americans not just for 1 year but for the next decade.   The urgency for a Federal response is why, as chairwoman of the  Senate Rules Committee, I have worked to ensure that voting rights are  a priority. It is why one of our first hearings this year was on the  For the People Act and why--and I see Reverend Warnock here--we took  the Rules Committee on the road to Georgia in its first field hearing  in 20 years.   And just last month, Senator Baldwin and I held a roundtable  discussion in Wisconsin on what has been happening in that State and  what would have been put into law, including only having one ballot  dropoff box in the entire city of Milwaukee if the Governor hadn't  stood in and vetoed it.   And we are not done yet because these discussions with voters are the  most pressing testament that the threat to the freedom to vote is very  real and affecting people of all walks of life across the country. We  can't sit back idly and watch our democracy be threatened. As President  Biden said in Philadelphia, the fight to protect the right to vote is  the ``test of our time.''   Americans have fought and died to protect this freedom, and 56 years  after the Voting Rights Act was passed by this Chamber and signed into  law, we are still continuing this fight.   We have asked our colleagues from the other side of the aisle to join  us on this bill. We have made many, many, many changes to this  legislation in response to concerns they have raised, in response to  concerns Senator Manchin raised, in response to concerns that  secretaries of state have made across the country. We have adapted this  bill to make it much easier to implement in rural areas, in small  towns.   We are proud of this legislation. Yet what do we hear from the other  side of the aisle? Well, over the last few months, one of their  refrains which I find so amusing is they say this will somehow result  in chaos. Truly?   Chaos is a 5-hour wait to vote in the Sun in Georgia without food or  water. Chaos is purging eligible voters from voter rolls and  prohibiting mail-in ballot drop boxes and having only one in the  entirety of Harris County in Texas for 5 million people. Chaos is  voters in Wisconsin waiting in line to vote for hours in the rain,  wearing homemade face masks and plastic garbage bags. That angry mob on  January 6 that came right into this Chamber, that was chaos.   You want to stop the chaos: Federal minimum voting standards. Telling  extremists they can't spend millions on sham audits, that stops the  chaos. Getting dark money out of our politics, that stops the chaos.  And making sure that people have a voice by ending partisan  gerrymandering, that stops the chaos.   So, once again, I urge my Republican colleagues to recognize the work  being done in many of their own States to restrict the freedom of  Americans to exercise their sacred right to vote. Our Nation was  founded on the ideals of democracy, and as we have seen for ourselves  in this very building, we cannot afford to take it for granted.   We have so much work to do. Voting rights reform, this bill,  guaranteeing the freedom to vote, is about the salvation of our very  democracy. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting the Freedom to  Vote Act.   Mr. President, I see my colleagues. Senator Merkley, such a great  leader on the For the People bill, and Senator Warnock, such a great  leader, new in the Senate but already establishing himself across the  country and in Georgia as a leader on voting rights, are both here.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank my colleagues: Senator Padilla,  with your great experience as secretary of state and how that has  assisted us in coming together on this bill; Senator Warnock, with the  passion and firsthand experience you have in Georgia; Senator Kaine,  for an extraordinary speech, wherein we all had to step back and think  about our job description: to protect and defend the Constitution. It  is not just ours on this side of the aisle; it is also our colleagues'  on the other side of the aisle.   We have this special obligation to protect this democracy and to  cherish it and to pass it on to the next generation. The way you do  that fundamentally is by guaranteeing Americans the freedom to vote.  That is all this bill is about--putting in place minimum national  standards that we see in so many of our States but that, sadly, right  now, are threatened in a number of those States for no other reason  except--to quote Reverend Warnock--that some people don't want some  people to vote. Our democracy is too important to let that happen.   With that, we are going to end our segment here, and we will be back  to discuss this bill more next week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.

Res. 365, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10:15 a.m.,  Thursday, September 16, for a pro forma session with no business  conducted; further, that when the Senate adjourns on Thursday, it stand  adjourned until 3 p.m. on Monday, September 20, 2021; that following  the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal  of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business be  closed; and that upon the conclusion of morning business, the Senate  proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the Strickland  nomination.
