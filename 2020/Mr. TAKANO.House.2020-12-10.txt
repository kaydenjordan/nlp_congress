 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to demand that my Republican  colleagues put aside partisan politics and provide relief to the  millions of Americans whose lives have been upended by the COVID-19  pandemic.   Our country is facing the worst economic crisis since the Great  Depression, yet the Federal Government has failed to aid the families  struggling to keep food on the table, the small businesses shutting  their doors and laying off employees during the holiday season, and  State and local governments trying to keep communities afloat.   It has been 9 long months since we passed meaningful legislation to  support our fellow Americans. This is a dangerously long time, and the  pandemic has only gotten worse.   It is our responsibility to meet the scale and scope of this pandemic  and get people the help they have been desperately waiting for. We must  work together and finally pass a relief bill immediately. Families  cannot afford to wait another day.                            ____________________
