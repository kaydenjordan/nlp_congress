 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of someone who  meant a great deal to my community. An architect, artist,  preservationist, and advocate for equality, Tim Hare made an indelible  mark on the people of Easton, whose historic downtown he was  instrumental in saving from demolition.   Passing through Easton by chance in the 1970s, Tim was so taken by  the character of the city that when he learned of plans to demolish and  evict the citizens of the historic district as part of a wave of so- called urban renewal initiatives, he attended a city council meeting to  demand answers. When that didn't work, he decided to go to Washington  to file an injunction against the Federal Government's plans.   Because of Tim's efforts, homes across the historic district were  saved, and local businesses like the Quadrant Book Mart & Coffee House  are still around today.   Tim's legacy also endures in the struggle for LGBTQ equality, to  which he devoted himself alongside his beloved husband, Earl, and the  many generations he mentored and inspired.   To Earl, and all those who knew and loved Tim, know that I and our  entire community will work to carry forward his example.                            ____________________
