 Mr. President, Oregonians love and cherish their wild  rivers, and I am pleased we were able to protect many of these Oregon  treasures in the Oregon Wildlands Act, which Congress included as part  of the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation  Act. The act adds 255 miles of new Wild and Scenic Rivers in Oregon.   Some, but not all, of these new or expanded wild and scenic rivers  designated under the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and  Recreation Act were evaluated by the Bureau of Land Management for  their potential inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers  System. These evaluations in many cases identified the rivers'  ``outstandingly remarkable values,'' ORVs, consistent with agency  regulations and guidance. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act specifies that  wild  [[Page S5441]]  and scenic rivers are managed to ``protect and enhance the values,'' 16  USC 1281(a), for which the wild and scenic river was established.   The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act generally defines ``outstandingly  remarkable values'' as ``scenic, recreational, geologic, fish and  wildlife, historic, cultural, or other similar values.'' The Federal  land management agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management,  which is administering most of the new and expanded wild and scenic  rivers in the Oregon Wildlands Act, has defined ``other'' values as,  but not limited to, ``ecological, biological or botanical,  paleontological, hydrological, traditional cultural uses, water  quality, and scientific values.''   Some of the new and expanded wild and scenic rivers in Oregon  Wildlands Act were never evaluated by the agency. Therefore, as part of  the fact-gathering by my staff based on State and Federal agency data  and research and public input during the development of the  legislation, ORVs were determined for the new and expanded wild and  scenic rivers. The table I am including with my statement lists both  the general and specific ORVs identified during consideration of the  legislation. It is to protect and enhance these values for which I, as  the chief sponsor of the Oregon Wilderness Act, included the various  wild and scenic rivers in the legislation that Congress ultimately  included in the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and  Recreation Act. This table includes both the outstandingly remarkable  values that BLM found for the stream segments, as well as additional  values.   The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act  reflects the Nation's commitment to protect America's rivers, streams,  and special places. I am pleased the legislation permanently protects  from damming, diversion, and mining over 255 miles of Oregon's pristine  rivers and streams as part of the nation's Wild and Scenic Rivers  system.   I ask unanimous consent that the table be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                              General Outstandingly            Wild & Scenic River                  Remarkable Value        Specific Outstandingly Remarkable Value ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Elk River Additions:     Rock Creek..........................
