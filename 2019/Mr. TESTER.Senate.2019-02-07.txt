 Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life  of a Montanan who dedicated his career to working on behalf of Native  Americans across the Nation.   John Bushman was born in Montana and grew up in Wolf Point on the  Fort Peck Reservation, before moving to San Francisco and eventually  Washington, DC, where he entered into public service, first working for  the Department of the Interior before serving as chief counsel for the  Committee on Indian Affairs.   I'm honored to serve on that Committee, which works hard every day to  ensure our government upholds its treaty and trust responsibilities to  Indian Country.   A member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, John worked for  Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota on issues relevant to Native  Americans across the country. He eventually served as the Tribal  Director for the Department of Health and Human Services.   His service didn't end in retirement; John continued to make a  difference for others by volunteering often, including with the Salute  Military Golf Association, which teaches wounded veterans how to play  golf.   I stand to honor John's memory, and in the hope that others may be  inspired by his legacy of service.                            ____________________
