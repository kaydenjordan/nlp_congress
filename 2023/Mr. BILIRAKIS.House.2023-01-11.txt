 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. It  sounds really good to call him Mr. Chairman. He is going to do a great  job for us and the American people, more importantly.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 26, the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   Since my first year in office, I have shown a strong commitment to  promoting a culture of life. The bill before  [[Page H182]]  us requires practitioners who are present for an attempted abortion,  resulting in a live birth, to exercise the same degree of care that  would be offered to any other child born of that gestational age. After  those efforts, the healthcare workers must admit the child to a  hospital.   This bill also gives mothers a civil cause of action and protection  from any prosecution, recognizing that women are the second victims of  abortion and attempted abortions.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this important  piece of legislation because, surely, we can all agree that a child  born alive has a right to live.
