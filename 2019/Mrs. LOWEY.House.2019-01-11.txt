 Madam Speaker, the Trump shutdown is now in its 21st day.  It is outrageous that more than 800,000 Federal employees are going  without pay, many of them while they are still working, and the  American people are being denied vital services, all because of  President Trump's demands for a wasteful border wall.   The bill before us today would reopen the Environmental Protection  Agency, Department of the Interior, and other critical agencies, such  as the Indian Health Service and the Chemical Safety and Hazard  Investigation Board.   The Trump shutdown has suspended cleanups of hazardous materials and  delayed lifesaving rulemaking to keep toxic chemicals like methylene  chloride out of American homes.   The Trump shutdown threatens the enduring natural beauty and  conservation efforts of our national parks as trash piles up and the  safety of visitors is in question.   Public health and safety should not be political bargaining chips.   House Democrats have passed bills to open the government, but the  President and the Senate Republicans continue to obstruct and delay  instead of working with us to get the people's business done.   The solution to this crisis is simple: pass the bills where we can  agree and extend funding for Homeland Security for a month to allow  time for negotiation on border security and immigration policy.   Madam Speaker, I hope that my colleagues across the Capitol come to  their senses and stop this ridiculous Trump shutdown.
