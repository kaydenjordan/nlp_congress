Mr. Speaker, there are a number of bills here that pertain to the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs' jurisdiction. I support a number of  those bills--maybe not a couple of them. I certainly appreciate that we  are having them down here.   As many people know, the House Freedom Caucus and a number of my  other colleagues have simply been raising the issue that we should  debate, amend on different issues. We should have a different  conversation about how the floor operates so we continue to require  roll call votes on a number of bills that might otherwise pass by  voice. But in doing so, it is not a statement necessarily always on the  content of the legislation in question. We will be making some roll  call votes here this afternoon, but I just wanted to make sure, as a  member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I make clear my support  for a number of these measures, which will obviously be clear in the  roll call vote later.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
