 Mr. Speaker, 75 years ago today, Allied armies liberated  the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz. Unfortunately, more than 6  million of God's children perished before that happened. This can never  be forgotten.   I agree with General Eisenhower's comments at the time: Educate  people on the atrocities committed so they don't happen again.   That is why I am proud to have cosponsored the Never Again Education  Act. The bill authorizes Federal funds to be used to teach about the  Holocaust. Ensuring that citizens know the uncensored truth of history  will help punctuate the message that anti-Semitism is abhorrent and  will not be tolerated.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative Carolyn Maloney  from New York, who took the lead on initiating this bill.   Finally, to the families of the victims so tragically lost: They will  never be forgotten.                            ____________________
