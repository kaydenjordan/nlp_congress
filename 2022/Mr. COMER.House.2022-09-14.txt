 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I will admit the Whistleblower Protection Improvement Act  has a great name because Congress cares about protecting  whistleblowers. As the ranking member of the Oversight Committee, I  appreciate and value whistleblowers' service and sacrifice to make  government better.   In fact, ensuring whistleblowers have protections against abuse or  retaliation is a bipartisan issue here in Congress. That probably  explains why there are already so many protections that whistleblowers  have access to in statutes, regulations, executive orders, and agency  policies. There is the Whistleblower Protection Act, the Intelligence  Community Whistleblower Protection Act, the Whistleblower Protection  Enhancement Act, the very catchy Notification and Federal Employee  Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act.   Congress has consistently sought to protect people working in the  Federal Government who report waste, fraud, and abuse--and for good  reason. Whistleblowers are often the only means of knowing what is  happening in an agency, and that is especially important under the  Biden administration when the Democrats in Congress have refused to  conduct any meaningful or serious oversight.   But how many more whistleblower laws do we need with so many already  on the books?   Further, Republicans oppose this bill because it is a step too far. A  simple version of this bill would have just applied the existing  whistleblower protections to the few corners of the Federal Government  that aren't already covered by the law. However, H.R. 2988 goes much  further by making it nearly impossible--and only after a long,  expensive process--to address performance or employment issues in  anyone claiming to be a whistleblower, even if the person is not really  a whistleblower but just bad at his or her job.   In the real world, if you are undermining your boss, participating in  misconduct, or just lazy, your employer has options to hold you  accountable. In the Federal Government, if you claim you are a  whistleblower, you can be as terrible as you want and almost any  attempt to remove you from your station is characterized as  retaliation.   There is a difference between retaliation and plain repercussions,  but this bill would make them the same. It would prohibit opening an  investigation into someone who claims to be a whistleblower, even if  there is good reason to investigate the employee's conduct.   Under this bill, it would be nearly impossible to reveal the identity  of a whistleblower in order to evaluate the validity of his or her  claims.   In large part, this bill is just an excuse to further idolize the  people who pushed the sham impeachment against former President Trump.  The actions of President Trump were, of course, vindicated by the  Senate.   Entrenching Federal Government employees by enacting laws like H.R.  2988 is, in large part, why President Trump got elected in the first  place: to drain the swamp. Democrats may be wise to remember this  concern of the American people and stop working to further entrench the  executive branch bureaucracy.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, whistleblowers in the Federal Government are  covered by some of the most comprehensive protections for employees in  the country.   Whistleblowers serve a valuable role in our government, especially in  an administration like the Biden administration, which is subject to  almost no oversight by Congress.   But giving this bill a great title, Whistleblower Protection  Improvement Act, does not and should not provide cover for the actual  requirements and consequences of this bill. Bill titles don't govern  our government, but the substance within them does.   The Whistleblower Protection Improvement Act is a step too far and  would help further entrench Federal Government employees in their jobs.   Mr. Chair, I oppose H.R. 2988, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise to oppose the amendments en bloc. I rise  in opposition to the en bloc package of amendments offered by  Chairwoman Maloney.   This package contains an amendment offered by Representative  Auchincloss, which would require the Government Accountability Office  to conduct a study of whistleblower complaints ruled on by the Merit  Systems Protection Board and make recommendations about the  whistleblower review process.   The problem with this amendment is that the MSPB's Office of General  Counsel already performs the oversight functions for the MSPB under the  Inspector General Act of 1978. This office is capable of doing the work  the amendment would task to the GAO.   Reviewing the MSPB determinations and monitoring the Federal courts  is not a smart use of the GAO's limited resources. The GAO needs to  remain focused on pending statutorily mandated work.   I also oppose the amendment offered by Representative Jackson Lee,  which is trying to help inspectors general offices receive anonymous  whistleblower information, but it actually makes it far more difficult.   This amendment won't allow IG offices to use any telephone or  computer systems to receive the anonymous whistleblower information.  Instead, they will have to rely on receiving such sensitive information  by mail, which is obviously problematic, including complicating an IG's  ability to evaluate the validity and authenticity of these tips and  complaints.   I also oppose the amendment offered by Representative Porter, which  attempts to create another unnecessary reporting requirement for the  inspectors general to report to Congress on the timeliness of resolving  whistleblower retaliation complaints.   The problem is that IG offices are already required to include this  information in their semiannual report to Congress, provided every 6  months. This includes information on what, if any, consequences have  been imposed to hold the official who engaged in retaliation  accountable. This amendment's duplicative reporting requirement only  wastes more time that an IG should be spending on investigating waste,  fraud, and abuse.   Finally, I oppose the amendment offered by Representative Spanberger,  which would prohibit the suspension, revocation, denial, or other  determination relating to a security clearance of a whistleblower. This  complete prohibition could put national security at risk.   For example, an employee working to undermine a national security  policy or program could claim that he or she is a whistleblower and  continue to have access to sensitive information, even while the agency  evaluated the merits of the whistleblower's accusation.   There are approved procedures for whistleblowing in the intelligence  community, but this amendment would prohibit revoking a security  clearance, even if the so-called whistleblower ignores those  procedures. This is an unacceptable risk to our Nation. Those holding  security clearances have assumed a special level of public trust, and  with that comes special expectations.   Mr. Chair, I oppose these amendments, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   Let me conclude by saying this: We have countless rules on the books  pertaining to whistleblower protection. We have good whistleblower  rules. I can assure my friends on the other side of the aisle, we have  plenty of whistleblowers coming forward now with issues, and they are  going to be protected. The rules on the books will protect those  whistleblowers.   What my friends on the other side of the aisle are trying to do, I  fear, is create a situation where any poor-performing employee who is  receiving  [[Page H7833]]  poor reviews from their agency can claim to be a whistleblower, and  therefore, they will be on the Federal payroll for the rest of their  career. Then they can retire and draw a pension for the rest of their  life.   This is unacceptable in the private sector. We care about  whistleblowers. We welcome whistleblowers to come to the House  Committee on Oversight and Reform to speak to the Republican minority  members. They are and they will be protected because we have good  whistleblower laws on the books.   These proposed amendments make our good whistleblower laws worse, and  we need to oppose them.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today, Americans continue to face several crises created by the Biden  administration: Sky-high inflation, painfully high gas prices, and  supply chain shortages.   President Biden's border crisis is allowing waves of illegal  immigrants and fentanyl shipments to flood across our southern border.   Our children are suffering from historic learning losses and a mental  health crisis because this administration allowed radical teachers  unions to keep schools closed.   Yet what are Democrats prioritizing today instead of these crises  impacting Americans' everyday lives? The Democrats' Ensuring a Fair and  Accurate Census Act.   This bill has nothing to do with the American people's priorities. In  fact, it will do nothing to make the Census more fair and accurate.  Instead, it places a great deal of power in the hands of unelected  bureaucrats and hamstrings future Presidents.   During the prior Census, the President sought to include in the  Census a question simply asking respondents whether they were American  citizens. The Supreme Court found this was constitutional but that the  Census Bureau had gone about it improperly.   This bill would prevent the inclusion of such a question in the  future, a question key to upholding the principle of one citizen, one  vote.   Now, under the Biden administration, there are questions about  whether the Department of Commerce delivered accurate apportionment  results derived from the Census. Those results were critical because  they determined the apportionment of this body's 435 congressional  districts among the several States. We still don't know for sure  whether the apportionment results were fair and accurate.   But this bill does nothing to fix that problem or any of the other  real problems associated with the 2020 Census. Indeed, it will make it  easier for future Census results to drive the apportionment of  congressional districts unfairly to favor blue, Democrat-leaning States  over red, Republican-leaning States.   Why is that?   Because the bill weakens the accountability of the Census Bureau to  the President and the Secretary of Commerce, committing by statute all  operational, statistical, and technical decisions about the Census to  the Census Bureau's Director.   The bill makes it harder to overrule the Director even when the  President, the Secretary, or Congress are concerned, the Director's  decisions will yield an unfair or inaccurate Census.   Making matters worse, the bill allows only an unaccountable career  employee to serve as acting director when no Senate-confirmed director  is in place.   Finally, the bill severely constrains the ability of future Censuses  to include important new questions, such as the citizenship question,  which a majority of Americans want asked on the Census.   But it is precisely the counting of actual citizens that ensures  Census results will produce congressional districts fairly,  representing all citizens in Congress.   During the Oversight and Reform Committee's consideration of this  bill, Republicans offered amendments that would have cured these  problems. These amendments would have made sure Census Bureau officials  remained accountable to the voters through the President. They would  have made sure a question on citizenship would have been included in  future Censuses, guaranteeing a fair basis for the apportionment of  congressional districts.   But were Democrats concerned then about ensuring a fair and accurate  Census by supporting these amendments? No. Democrats voted them down on  a party-line vote.   Mr. Chairman, the American people deserve better from this  legislative body. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the U.S. House of Representatives should focus on  helping the American people survive economic turmoil and defending our  borders and national security.   I urge House Democrats to get back to what the American people  elected us to do: Conduct oversight over the Federal Government and the  Biden administration, which is on a path to destroy America.   We need to hold hearings, conduct oversight, and pass legislation  addressing the crises affecting America today. That is our  constitutional responsibility. But instead, we are spending valuable  resources and time on divisive political messaging bills.   I am just amazed that the Democrats advocate for legislation on the  House floor pertaining to the Census, which would ask a question about  your sexual preference, but they want to pass legislation to oppose  asking the question whether you are a legal citizen or not. That is  just another example of tone-deaf leadership. That is not what the  American people want.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose H.R. 8326, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise to oppose the amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the en bloc package of  amendments offered by Chairwoman Maloney.   Specifically, I am opposed to the amendments offered by  Representative Jackson Lee and Representative Case and will address  them each.   First, Ms. Jackson Lee's amendment requires the Deputy Director of  the Census to appoint a new employee within the Census Bureau whose  sole responsibility is to, ``optimize racial and ethnic equity in the  decennial Census population.''   The core mission of the Census Bureau, as it already stands, is to  conduct an accurate count of all people residing in the United States  on Census day when the decennial Census is being conducted.   This is the mission for every employee who works on the Census. This  new position is completely unnecessary and redundant of the Census  Bureau's preexisting mission to count everyone in the United States  regardless of their race or ethnicity.   Because this amendment appears to be an attempt to inject identity  politics into the Census Bureau's work, and because it would duplicate  efforts already underway at the Census Bureau, I must oppose.                                time  1715    I turn to Representative Case's amendment, which requires the Census  Bureau to create and submit yet another report to Congress, but it  fails to require the Census Bureau to actually do anything substantive  to improve.   The Census Bureau already conducts extensive engagement campaigns  with local jurisdictions to ensure an accurate count of all people  during the decennial Census. This report would require the Census  Bureau to outline additional processes for engaging with local  jurisdictions.   The amendment would also require that the Census Bureau report to  Congress on progress in implementing open GAO recommendations, but it  does not outline any deadlines for implementing those open  recommendations.   Finally, the amendment contains an open-ended invitation for the  Census Bureau to ask for ``additional resources.'' This is Washington  speak to throw even more taxpayer money at the Census Bureau in the  near future.   I fear this amendment will merely waste precious Census Bureau time  and resources with an additional report with the sole purpose of  justifying future taxpayer expenditures.   Therefore, I must oppose both of these amendments.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment offered by the  Government Operations Subcommittee ranking member, my colleague, Jody  Hice.   I support this sensible amendment, which will preserve vital  accountability mechanisms for the Director of the Census Bureau. The  bill attempts to insulate the Census Bureau Director and empower an  unaccountable career Deputy Director. We should not be tying the hands  of a future President to properly exercise executive oversight over the  management of the Census Bureau.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support the commonsense  Hice amendment.
