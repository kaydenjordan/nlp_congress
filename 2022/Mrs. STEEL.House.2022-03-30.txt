 Madam Speaker, passing the Don Young Coast Guard  Authorization Act of 2022 was an important step in addressing the  ongoing economic crisis facing our country.   This legislation includes my bipartisan proposal to establish a task  force to address the ongoing port backlog at the Ports of Long Beach  and Los Angeles.   These ports move 40 percent of all shipping containers entering the  U.S. and are major ports of entry for California's oil supply.   The combination of the ports' backlog, inflation, and the  administration's crippling energy policies are making everything  unaffordable for Californians, especially gas.   We must address the supply chain crisis, unleash domestic energy  production, and stop the reckless government spending driving  inflation.   I urge the Senate to pass this bill immediately so we can tackle this  crisis and help California families.                            ____________________
