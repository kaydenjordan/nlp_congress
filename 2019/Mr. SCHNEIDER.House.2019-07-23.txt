 Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise today in support of H.  Res. 246, of which I am the sponsor.   This resolution does four things.   First, it affirms the vital relationship between the United States  and Israel, our most important ally in a complicated region of the  world.   Second, it reiterates our unbreakable commitment to Israel's  security.   Third, it restates Congress' strong, bipartisan support for a  negotiated two-state solution.    Lastly, it makes clear that Congress opposes the global Boycott,  Divestment, and Sanctions, or BDS, movement that seeks to delegitimize  Israel; opposes a two-state solution; and pushes the cause of peace for  both Israelis and Palestinians further out of reach.   It has been our country's long-held policy that the best path to  ensuring Israel's long-term security as a democratic and Jewish state,  and realizing the Palestinian people's aspirations for a state of their  own, is through a negotiated two-state solution.   The global BDS movement, on the other hand, denies the Jewish  people's connection to the land of Israel; refuses to accept the basic  idea of a Jewish state; and seeks to delegitimize Israel in  international forums, on college campuses, and in global commerce.   But don't take my word for it. The founder of the global BDS  movement, Omar Barghouti, has said as much: ``We oppose a Jewish state  in any part of Palestine. No Palestinian, rational Palestinian, not a  sellout Palestinian, will ever accept a Jewish state in Palestine.''   When global BDS movement supporters chant, ``From the river to the  sea, Palestine will be free,'' these are not words of peace. This is a  call for the destruction of the entire State of Israel and the  elimination of the Jews from the land--all the land, not just Gaza and  the West Bank.   That is why it is so important that we take a stand today and vote to  condemn the global BDS movement.   Let me also be clear: This resolution explicitly recognizes that  boycotts have a long tradition in this country, including the civil  rights movement, efforts to end apartheid in South Africa, and other  matters. However, not all boycotts seek just ends.   Such is the case of the BDS movement against Israel and its  fundamental aims: the delegitimization of Israel and the destruction of  the Jewish state.   I am proud that this resolution has gained 350 cosponsors, including  more than three-quarters of the Members of both parties. I would like  to thank the leadership of my Democratic colead Congressman Jerry  Nadler as well as the efforts of our Republican coleads,  Representatives Lee Zeldin and Ann Wagner.   This strong, bipartisan support sends a clear, united message that  this Congress not only supports the Jewish, democratic State of Israel  and two states as the path to peace for both Israelis and Palestinians  but that at the same time we condemn efforts to delegitimize and block  the path to peace.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1837, the  United States-Israel Cooperation Enhancement and Regional Security Act.   Israel is our greatest ally in the Middle East, and we work jointly  in a number of strategic areas. This bill strengthens our partnership  and expands important economic, scientific, and security cooperation  between the United States and Israel.   This bill also encourages the United States to designate a new  coordinator of U.S.-Israel research and development and establishes a  grant program on cybersecurity development. It authorizes R&D on  issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder, agriculture, and the  development of health technologies, as well as vital security  assistance in accordance with the 2016 MOU.   It also provides an important fix that ensures a path to justice for  American victims of terrorism and retains our ability to provide vital  assistance that promotes security and stability for both Israelis and  Palestinians.   I would like to thank my colleagues, Mr. Deutch and Mr. Wilson, for  their leadership on this important bipartisan bill.   I urge all my colleagues to vote on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for  allotting me this time, and commend my colleagues, Mr. Gottheimer and  Mr. Mast, for bringing this bill.   I rise in support of H.R. 1850 and applaud the House for taking  action to combat terrorist activity in the Middle East.   This bill sanctions individuals and foreign governments that  knowingly and materially assist Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad  or an affiliate or successor entity.   These groups have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations  by the Department of State since 1997. There is no disputing that they  have and continue to sow instability and terror, including by  indiscriminately launching countless rockets and mortars at Israel,  attacks from subterranean tunnels, and even the use of human shields.   To achieve two states for two peoples living side by side in peace  and security, we cannot let extremist voices control the narrative and  we must always confront these terrorist activities.   But let me be clear: This bill does not target the vast majority of  Palestinian people who long for peace. Rather, it solely goes after  Hamas and PIJ and those who assist their terrorist activities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
