 Mr. Speaker, to my friends on the other side of the aisle,  every now and then in our Nation's history we find ourselves at a  singular, searing, and seminal moment, a moment such as this.   And so, whether it was the great debates of the 1960s and the civil  rights bill or the granting of women the right to vote 100 years ago or  the debates of war and peace which predate all of us, this is our  moment. And it is our moment to do the right thing on behalf of the  faceless and nameless men and women who have lost their lives as a  result of police violence.   So when future generations peer through the telescope of time and  look back on us and this day, let them say of us that, when it came to  addressing the issue of racist, ugly, violent, criminal actions by bad  police officers, we did not waiver, that we did not flinch, that we did  not shirk our responsibility to do the right thing. The right thing is  passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, and to do so on  behalf of all those who are not here to pass it and to vote and to  speak for themselves.   I strongly urge passage. This is the moment that we have to act in,  and it will be a fleeting moment.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from New  York, the chair of our Caucus, for yielding.   I listened intently to the litany that the minority leader chose to  deliver, and I watched and looked through a lens of history about his  admonitions about our 16th President, Abraham Lincoln, and they were  all well-stated.   I think the bottom line, though, is that, in any debate, there ought  to be real context. So there are other things that Lincoln said that  are relevant to this debate as well.   In 1848, in a speech delivered in Edwardsville, Illinois, he spoke  these words to his countrymen. He said:         When you have succeeded in dehumanizing the Negro; when you       have put him down and made it impossible for him to be but as       the beasts of the field; when you have extinguished his soul       in this world and placed him where the ray of hope is blown       out as in the darkness of the damned, are you quite sure that       the demon you have roused will not turn and rend you?    Lincoln went on to say:         Destroy the Negro's spirit and you have planted the seeds       of despotism at your own doorstep.    He said:         Ignore the chains of bondage, and you prepare your own       limbs to wear them.    Finally, he said:         Accustomed to trample on the rights and the freedoms of       others, and you would have lost the creative genius of your       own independence, and then become the fit subjects of the       first cunning tyrant who rises among you.    So while I appreciate the minority leader's comments, I think it is  important that we have context in this debate. We have driven here and  have been driven here by the actions of people all across this country  who want justice, who want an end to police violence, who want an end  to rogue cops and want to be able to live, work, and breathe in a  society like anyone else.
