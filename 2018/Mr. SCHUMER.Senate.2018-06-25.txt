 Mr. President, as we are all aware, the Trump  administration's border policy has resulted in thousands of families  having been separated at the border over the past few months. Despite  the administration's recent executive order, thousands of young  children remain separated from their parents in cities across the  country, across America. According to the New York Times, right now,  there are 2,053 children who are stuck in limbo, waiting for various  Federal agencies to reunite them with their families.   Some of the most basic questions about their whereabouts and the  whereabouts of their families are unknown to Federal officials. Of the  thousands of children having been taken away from their parents since  the President's family separation policy went into effect, only about  500 children in CBP's custody have been reunited with their families.  That is not good enough. Who will be held accountable if these children  are not returned to their parents? Some of these children are even too  young to know their names.   This unprecedented situation demands a Federal point person to manage  the family reunification process and ensure it is resolved as quickly  and transparently as possible. Multiple agencies have jurisdiction,  including the Department of Homeland Security, Health and Human  Services, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Justice. We  need someone in power to work across Federal agencies, cut through the  bureaucracy, and lead the accurate, humane, and timely reunification of  every child who has been separated by President Trump's policies.   I urge President Trump to appoint a family reunification czar to  manage this process.   The administration needs to bring in an experienced and competent  person to impose order on the chaos that the President's decision has  caused--someone to be accountable so that this doesn't go on for months  or longer with different agencies pointing fingers at each other while  children languish alone in detention. When multiple Federal agencies  are involved in responding to a crisis, the response is often  cumbersome and slow. Each agency has its different track, its different  goals, its different paths. Without someone in the White House to bring  order and have them work in sync, all too often, nothing happens.   A czar--this is a good czar, not a bad czar--would help to avoid the  situation whereby the agencies would be at cross purposes and paralysis  and inaction would result. We did this when Ebola occurred. There were  many agencies involved when we were worried about the national threat  of Ebola. President Obama wisely appointed a czar--I believe it was Ron  Klain. It worked, and the Ebola fear that we all had--thank God--didn't  materialize. The same can happen here in the sense that a czar could  help solve the problem.   It is agonizing--so agonizing--to see young children, with anguished  looks on their faces, being separated from  [[Page S4357]]  their parents. This crisis demands a timely and efficient response. A  family reunification czar would help get the job done. It is not a  political situation whereby it is ideological. It is, simply, getting  the bureaucracies to work.                                    China    Mr. President, on China, this morning, the New York Times reported  that in several industrial cities in China's interior, Chinese  manufacturers have been using incredibly dangerous chemicals known as  CFCs, which destroy the planet's ozone layer and are explicitly banned  by an international agreement from the 1980s. The CFCs are more  dangerous to our atmosphere even than CO2, even than  methane. That is why the world came together in a rare moment and  successfully, for a long time, banned these CFCs.   Now it seems that this is not occurring in China, and it comes as no  surprise. China cracks down so effectively on free speech, so one  wonders why the state is unable to crack down on the use of  environmentally toxic chemicals that have been banned for over 30  years. It took China's Government a matter of days to block online  access to HBO after John Oliver poked fun at President Xi on the  network. Yet, when it comes to the use of toxic chemicals that are  banned by international agreements, China's government can't get its  act together? Please. It is a metaphor. What is happening with CFCs is  a metaphor for so many of China's policies, most especially for its  trade policy.   Many question if China will ever moderate its self-interested,  mercantilist behavior and join the community of nations in fair trade  by lowering trade barriers, by abiding by international trade rules,  and by ending its practice of intellectual property theft. Well, this  news shows that when push comes to shove, China always does what is  best for China--short-term profit for China--without regard to the  well-being of its neighbors or the strictures of international  agreements. Whether it is lead in our children's toys, cadmium in  exported fish, or CFCs in the atmosphere, time and again, China flouts  and skirts international laws, agreements, and vital environmental  standards in ferocious pursuit of its economic interests.    We should not be accommodating when it comes to trade with China. We  cannot appeal to its better angels and hope for the best--at least with  President Xi in charge. We must recognize that China's government will  not retreat from its fundamentally self-interested posture until and  unless we force it to, through tough penalties for misbehavior and  strong incentives to abide by free-market principles.   (Mrs. Ernst assumed the Chair.)                                  Healthcare    Madam President, on healthcare, last week insurers in Indiana and in  the Presiding Officer's State of Iowa requested an increase in 2019  rates. The addition of Indiana and Iowa asking for increasing rates  adds to the growing list of States--including Virginia, Maryland, New  York, and Oregon--that have raised rates as a result of Republican  healthcare policies.   The CEO of one of the largest insurers in Indiana, Celtic, said  insurers could have potentially lowered rates in 2019 if the Trump  administration had not attempted to sow mass uncertainty and undermine  the market.   Let me repeat that. The CEO of one of the largest insurers in Indiana  said that health insurance costs could have gone down if not for  President Trump and Congressional Republicans. He went on to say that  the rate increases were also a result of the uncertainty caused by the  Republicans' repeal of the coverage requirement and the Trump  administration's expansion of short-term junk insurance plans.   Think about it for a moment. Middle-class families in Indiana could  have saved on their healthcare next year if President Trump, aided and  abetted by Republicans here in the Senate, hadn't sabotaged the system.  If the Republicans and President Trump would have simply left our  healthcare system alone, things would have been so much better. So many  people in so many of our States will pay far more in premium increases  than they will get benefits from a tax cut--particularly if you are  middle-class and not rich. Is that right? Does that put more money in  people's pockets? No. Does that get the economy going? Absolutely not.   Sadly, because of a political vendetta against the Affordable Care  Act, Republicans have undermined our healthcare system at every turn.  They don't have an answer as to what to do. They don't have a new  system to put in place. They have tried that for a year and a half, and  they haven't gotten anywhere. They just want to sabotage the existing  law and make it worse for average Americans because they are so fixated  on killing the ACA bill, even though they have nothing to put in its  place, and American families are paying the price in the form of higher  premiums, higher out-of-pocket costs, and more expensive prescription  drugs.                               Civil Discourse    Finally, Madam President, a word on a different subject. Here in the  Senate we disagree with one another frequently and often fervently. I  certainly do. Many of us disagree with the policies of the current  administration. In a country as large and diverse as ours, politics has  always been a noisy, raucous affair--probably even more so today. That  is OK, but we all have to remember to treat our fellow Americans--all  of our fellow Americans--with the kind of civility and respect that we  expect will be afforded to us.   I strongly disagree with those who advocate harassing folks if they  don't agree with you. If you disagree with something or someone, stand  up and make your voice heard. Explain why you think they are wrong and  why you are right. Make the argument. Protest peacefully. If you  disagree with a politician, organize your fellow citizens to action and  vote them out of office, but no one should call for the harassment of  political opponents. That is not right. That is not American.   Now, I understand those who look at the conduct of this President--a  man who habitually engages in bullying, name-calling, slander, and pure  nastiness for its own sake--and think: We have to fight fire with fire.  I know I felt those emotions myself. I think we all do. I understand  those who are outraged at the hypocrisy of this President when he  complains about bullying, harassment, or nastiness when it is used  against him or his allies, and he uses it as a regular tool almost  every day. I am outraged by the double standard that we seem to let  this President get away with. But the President's tactics and behavior  should never be emulated. They should be repudiated by organized, well- informed, and passionate advocacy. As Michelle Obama, a person who  represents the same kind of fineness that we have always had in  America, in complete contrast to the coarseness of this President,  said: ``When they go low, we go high.'' That is a contrast of civility,  honor, and decency to President Trump's coarseness and meanness. It is  a contrast that will serve those of us who oppose what the President  does so well.   To opponents of the President's policies, the best way to limit what  he can do, to show that America is not as coarse, as mean, as  hypocritical as his behavior suggests, the best solution is to win  elections. That is a far more productive way to channel the legitimate  frustrations with this President's policies than harassing members of  his administration.   I yield the floor.
