 Madam Speaker, tonight we are going to try to do sort  an of an extension of the last couple of times I have been behind this  microphone and have a discussion about what is actually going on with  the big fiscal picture of our country.   I am going to be a little mean to some of the Democratic policies,  but I am going to show factually how I think it actually hurts, but  there is actually something that happened this last week that we should  actually be almost giddy about if it ultimately proves out, a major  breakthrough on one of the things that creates misery around the world,  let alone our own country, but also has real fiscal impacts.   So, let's actually sort of start with some of the basics. How much do  you think we borrowed every single day last year? We were playing with  the math a little while ago. We were borrowing about $3.8 billion every  single day. Break that down, do that math, an it is $160 million an  hour.   I know every time I get behind this mic and start talking numbers,  people just glaze over, but it is important because if you are someone  who says I really care about investments in the environment, I really  care about investments in healthcare, I really care about investments  in education, where do you think the money is going to come from?   If we continue policywise the avoidance of the drivers of our debt,  we continue doing public policy by feelings. One of the things that  enrages me around here is we have entire conversations, entire speeches  behind these microphones, and then we make public policy by our  emotions, by our feelings, but not by a calculator.                                time  1830    And I know the calculator sounds cold, and as Republicans, we sound  like accountants on steroids, but at some point the math is important.  But also, what happens when I can show you that getting the math right  means you don't hurt people?   We saw in the Democrat social spending bill, their Build Back Better,  multiple university papers coming out saying, Hey, we are looking at  this and we believe the working poor will be poorer at the end of the  decade. The disassociation of the value of your labors to money coming  in, the other social policies that were driven in that piece of  legislation, they may be great politics,  [[Page H6849]]  and they are really crappy for the society, and they are really crappy  for the very people that the left claims they care about.   So let's pull it back and just deal with where we are at right now.  Now, this board here is from math from a year ago. And once again, we  are not going to talk about 1965, but I start with this over and over  because I can't tell you how many people will come up to me at Costco,  and they will walk up and say, David, if you would just cut back on  that foreign aid. David, if you would just get rid of waste and fraud.  Or if they are liberals, Hey, if you cut back on defense spending.   Well, we have a reality problem. You see this red area? That is  mandatory spending. That is functionally, Social Security, Medicare-- the primary drivers.   The green area over here is what we get to vote on. The little blue  area, that is defense. The green is all domestic. It is down to 13  percent of what we, as Members of Congress, vote on is the non-defense  spending around here. And that is today. This gets dramatically worse.  And you know what makes it worse? We are getting old as a society.   Demographics. Demographics are actually what primarily drive the U.S.  sovereign debt. And yet, how many times--for anyone that is crazy  enough to watch C-SPAN, or even our fellow Members or staff--do we talk  about where we are going to be in just a few years.   And I thought I would also just sort of start with some of the  folklore. You will hear the speeches here of: Rich people need to pay  their fair share. They sure do.   A couple months ago we made a whole presentation here on the floor  begging our Democrat colleagues, saying instead of doing policy where  you are going to go--say, we are going to raise taxes on small  businesses. We are going to go raise taxes on individuals. How about  just stop subsidizing them?   We came in and showed almost $1.4 trillion over 10 years that the  policies of this place subsidize the rich. And I am talking the really  rich. So the Democrats did their build back better social spending  bill. If you look at it, it now substantially subsidizes the really  rich even more.   The other perversity in that piece of legislation, if you get to year  five, you do realize you have driven almost another $800 billion of  borrowing. Then we play this pretend game around here and say, Oh, then  we are going to make these programs disappear, and then we are going to  keep the taxes going for the rest of the decade. And that is how we  only end up with about $400 billion of borrowing.   I mean, no wonder those in the public who pay attention to Congress  in Washington, D.C., just realize we treat the public like fools. These  are people who are just trying to survive. They are trying to take care  of their kids. They are trying to get ready for retirement. And this  place is basically getting ready to destroy the next couple decades.  And the scale of debt is off the charts and it will drive every bit of  policy around here, instead of the fraud that is going on so far this  year where it looks more like trying to buy votes than save the future  of this country.   So let's take a quick look. Even 100 percent tax rate on small  businesses and upper-income families, if you took 100 percent of it,  you can't get close to covering where we are spending-wise. It is just  math. And I know this is a math-free zone, but at some point the math  will always win.   So take a look here. If you took every dime of people that make over  $500,000, and with that, every dime of the small business earnings, you  get about 5.5 percent of GDP. This is the most elegant way to do the  math. But in 2030, just the borrowing will be 6.3 percent of GDP. And  29 years from now, it is 15.1. You don't get close to it. You can take  every dime of $500,000 and up and every dime from small business, and  where are we 29 years from now? You hit a third of the revenues  necessary.   We are living in just an absolute economic fraud. The share of  Federal tax revenue spent on interest--and this is one of those that  scares me to death. Let's see if I can try to explain this.   What happens to a country when you have borrowed and borrowed and  borrowed and borrowed and borrowed, and you put yourself right up  against the edge. And then you have a new virus and all of a sudden you  need to stabilize the economy. Or God forbid, there is a military  conflict or some other tragedy in your country, you have made yourself  very, very fragile as a country.   It is the concept of, we all have this occasion where we live a  little too close to the fire and that one time there is a traffic  accident, that one time something happens and we miss our airplane. We  understand the consequences of what they call fragility. We are doing  that to this country.   This board here is really simple. If we had a 2 percent increase in  interest rates, by the time we get to that 29 years from now, 100  percent of all the tax revenues, 100 percent of the tax revenues go  just to pay the interest payments. You start to think about that, hell,  just a 1 percent rise in interest from the CBO's baseline is 70 percent  of all tax revenues will be consumed just making our interest payments.   Is this the future you plan for your children? I mean, is this the  future this place plans for your own retirement? You think you are  going to continue to still get all the benefits you have earned when  your government, 100 percent of its income is going just to cover the  borrowing interest? This is where we are at. And this is last year's  math. This is before the huge amount of borrowing that has already  happened this year.    So now the most difficult part of when you get behind this  conversation, for those who come behind these microphones, this is the  part that my brothers and sisters around here on the left--and even a  number on the right--don't want to have.   What is the primary driver of the U.S. sovereign debt? Two things:  Remember how I said demographics? It is the fact we are getting older.  You have got to understand, 29 years from now--and this was actually,  this math was done before the massive amount of spending this last  year--we will be at $112 trillion of borrowed money in 29 years. And  that is inflation-adjusted, so today's dollars, $112 trillion of  borrowed money, most of it is Medicare.   If you are like I am, and you believe Medicare is a societal promise  we made, how do you plan to keep paying for it? Social Security is the  rest of the balance. The rest of the budget is actually in balance. As  a matter of fact, the latest math actually says the rest of the budget  actually has a small positive balance in 29, 30 years.   How many times today behind my Democratic microphones--or even the  Republican microphones--did we tell the public the truth? That if we  don't get our act together and find a way to disrupt the cost of  healthcare, we have just--and it is a technical economic term for the  future--we have screwed our kids and our own retirements. I am sorry to  be crass, but I don't know how to get anyone here to listen.   It is math. It is demographics. It is not Republican or Democrats.  Getting older is not Republican or Democrat. It is not partisan. It is  math.   And the solution so far this year is, Well, let's just spend a hell  of a lot more money right now, let's pay for it with a bunch of fake  accounting. And maybe it is enough spending where we can buy enough  votes, we will survive another election, but the country will be in an  incredible amount of trouble.   So what is the solution? Well, let's first, what is the primary  driver? You just saw the slide. The primary driver of U.S. sovereign  debt is Medicare.   So let's break it down. Five percent of our Nation's population, our  brothers and sisters who have really tough lives--they have chronic  conditions, they have diabetes, they will have other comorbidities, as  you have heard over and over during the pandemic--well, they are a  majority of our healthcare spending. If you actually love and care for  people, why not go and do your very best to help these poor people that  are suffering? Oh, by the way, you also get an amazing economic value  for it.   Go help our brothers and sisters who are sick, who are suffering. It  is not putting up a bunch more clinics. It is investing in the  disruptive technologies that are around us right now that are curing  people.   I beg this place to think like disruptors. Because good politics are,  Oh, we are going to go spend a bunch of  [[Page H6850]]  money; we are going to put up a bunch more diabetes clinics in my  district, and I will look like a hero. Yeah, maybe that is great  politics, but you just functionally patched over the misery, the  suffering. Go put the resources in a cure.   I did a presentation back in March or April here, talking about a  cure for Type 1 diabetes and how it also means part of that will  translate to Type 2. I saved some of the really nasty emails I got  saying, Oh, that isn't true; it can't happen.   Wait until the last board here. Guess what? There are miracles  happening around us. Do you remember a couple weeks here I did a little  presentation on messenger RNA? We now have a vaccine.   Now, it is not 100 percent effective. It is only mildly effective. It  has to be used for malaria. It looks like we are about to have a  vaccine for so many other diseases that plague us. Why aren't we  putting our resources into something of that nature? Because if it is 5  percent of our brothers and sisters who are suffering, who are the  majority of our healthcare spending--and healthcare spending is what is  bankrupting the country--putting up a bunch more clinics doesn't solve  the problem.   Also the other absurdity, I will have liberal friends who will say,  Well, we did the ACA, known as Obamacare. That was a financing bill. It  basically just moved around who got subsidized and who had to pay. It  didn't change the price of healthcare. And I hate to say, the  Republican alternative did the same thing. We just moved around who got  subsidized, who had to pay. I think we did some more things to create  some creativity and competitiveness, but that bill died in the Senate.  We did pass it out of the House.   But then you will get some that say, Well, how about Medicare for  all. Medicare for all doesn't save a dime. Model after model after  model says it doesn't save a dime unless you begin rationing--and even  then it really doesn't save much.   So what do you do? What are the actual drivers?   You remember that Medicare number that is the primary driver of our  debt? Remember on that chart, it was $77 trillion over the next 29  years. And after this year's binge spending, God knows what the new  numbers are. Thirty-one percent of Medicare spending is just diabetes,  so almost a third of overall healthcare spending is just diabetes.   Take a step and think about it. For someone like myself, who is  terrified of that failed bond auction because we have built up so much  more debt, and the public--and internationally--they just don't have an  appetite for our debt anymore, that becomes the cascade of hell.                                time  1845    If I came to you, and said, Why don't we focus on how to help people  not have such misery, and also it would have incredible effects on our  fiscal situation.   Madam Speaker, 31 percent of just Medicare is diabetes. So why aren't  we doing something like an operation warp speed on diabetes, instead of  social spending where we can buy another election with taxpayers' money  and then borrow and borrow and borrow, and then use absolute fraud as  the pretense of how it is going to be paid for? Or we could do  something where we end people's misery, and the future looks brighter  and optimistic.   This slide here, I think I brought to the floor in April, and I did a  whole little thing about the concept of the technology being developed,  and it is really impressive. They have worked on it for years, taking  stem cells and adjusting the DNA there to make it--and forgive me if I  mispronounce these things--an islet cell and their ability to produce  insulin.   I showed this slide--and I still have a few of those emails of folks  saying, Stop making things up. This technology can't work. You can't  cure diabetes. Well, a couple great articles this weekend--and this is  where the optimism is. This is a place of optimism. We live in an  amazing country. We have suffered and done great things, and yet we  seem to roll in misery these days instead of the fact that we are on  the cusp of ending so many individuals' misery, sickness, and maybe  even changing the world.   I only did this just so people could visualize. Imagine the concept  of grabbing some stem cells. You can grab them now from skin--we have  learned all sorts of things. The ability to program them, and then  functionally you can teach them to grow into what you need.   If we have that technology, just imagine the diseases, the illnesses,  the misery--so you have messenger RNA that now we are about to know how  to take on so many viruses, so many other types of diseases. We are now  about to have the technology--we actually now do have the technology-- to actually take on other types of diseases where it is failures of  certain organs.   Now, I am going to give you one other one, just as part of the  thought experiment, before we do the closing board that I am most  excited about.   If Congress wanted to have an impact on healthcare costs, what is  something we could do in 1 year? What is something we could do-- Republicans and Democrats could do in 1 year? If I came to you right  now, and said, In 1 year, you are not going to get all of it, but 16  percent of healthcare spending turns out to be people not taking their  pharmaceuticals as they should. You realize that is well over a half a  trillion dollars a year.   A half a trillion dollars a year in spending because someone didn't  take their high blood pressure pill and they have their stroke. They  had trouble and they didn't take their insulin; they didn't do this and  that. What if I came to you right now, and said, Instead of  nationalizing healthcare and doing this and that, why don't we promote  subsidized--make it part of CMS--the technology where the pill bottle  cap beeps at grandma when she didn't take her meds?   For someone like myself with high blood pressure--I take my pill  religiously--but if I didn't, my phone would beep at me, and say:  David, we don't want you to have a stroke. Please take your medicine  because we know it works. We know the same thing. How many people do we  know who have had clogged arteries, and if they had just taken their  statins?   Madam Speaker, 16 percent of all healthcare spending relates back to  people not taking their meds. That is $528 billion a year.   There are disruptions. If you take that and then put it into what we  already know about the messenger RNA and the fact that there are so  many illnesses and diseases--if you read anything, you have to have  seen the articles that believe that we are close to a vaccine for HIV,  close to a vaccine for herpes. Now you see the vaccine out there for  malaria. There are so many amazing things happening, you saw it two  boards back.   When I came to this mike back last March and we talked about, Hey,  there is maybe this stem cell therapy that is going to turn how to make  islet cells that actually could be injected back into someone, and it  could be at least the cure for type 1 diabetes.   How many of you saw the articles this weekend? It was only one  person; it was the first person they tried it on. Guess what? It works.  They have successfully cured someone with type 1 diabetes. That is a  million and a half of our brothers and sisters in this Nation.   What are we willing to do to find a way to almost put that type of  technology--let's have it be proofed. Are we willing to put it on a  production line, just like we have done, messenger RNA on a production  line? And now can we also make the really tough policy decisions, are  we willing to change the farm bill, nutrition, some of the inputs into  type 2 diabetes? And if we can fix those, the articles and papers are  saying the same ability to fix the body's ability to make insulin again  may be a path to cure type 2 diabetes. If that is true, think about it.   You just saw, the primary driver of U.S. sovereign debt is healthcare  costs, Medicare.   Madam Speaker, 31 percent of Medicare spending is just diabetes. Why  wouldn't this place take on something that is that obvious, that is  loving and compassionate, and also really makes a big difference to our  future, both economically and just from a moral health standpoint of  loving and caring for our brothers and sisters?   The last thing I will throw out--we are working on a little project  in my  [[Page H6851]]  office and the math is really hard. If you care about things like  income inequality and you look at the differentials of our brothers and  sisters, like Tribal communities out West, other people that may have  urban minority communities that are suffering from type 2 diabetes, we  are trying to figure out what would the math look like if those  populations had this disease cured?   What would their economics be? Would we actually see so many others  able to come back into society, back into the economy, back into trying  to develop a life in the middle class?   The crazy thing is our preliminary math--it may turn out that curing  a big portion of our population where we see the huge income inequality  and helping them get back into society and the economy may be one of  the most powerful things, if not maybe the single largest thing, we  could do to actually take on income inequality in this country.   Who would have ever thought? It is the math. I want to make the  argument that people here who want to make policy by their feelings are  crushing individuals, crushing families, crushing the country. People  are willing to see love and compassion through actual facts or how we  do what is moral and do what is right and also do what makes this  country as great as can be.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
