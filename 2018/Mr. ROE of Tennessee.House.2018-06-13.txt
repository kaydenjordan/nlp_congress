Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material into the Record on H.R. 2147, as  amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2147, as amended, the  Veterans Treatment Court Improvement Act of 2018.   This bill would require the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, to  hire at least 50 Veterans Justice Outreach specialists, also referred  to as VJO specialists, to serve in a veterans treatment or other  veteran-focused court.   VJO specialists provide direct outreach to and case management  services for veterans who are involved in the local criminal justice  system. They serve to protect some of our most vulnerable veterans from  unnecessary criminalization and incarceration by working with law  enforcement and the courts to identify service-related mental health or  substance abuse issues that may be underlying criminal behavior among  veterans, and to link veterans with treatment they need from the VA to  recover and become fully functional and contributing members of  society.   This bill is sponsored by Congressman  Mike Coffman of Colorado. Mr.  Coffman is a senior member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and a  tireless advocate for service members, veterans, and their families.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this bill,  and I urge all of our colleagues to join me in supporting this.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Coffman), both an Army and Marine veteran,  my good friend and the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all  Members to support H.R. 2147, as amended, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4635) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  to increase the number of peer-to-peer counselors providing counseling  for women veterans, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4635         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PEER SUPPORT COUNSELING PROGRAM FOR WOMEN                     VETERANS.         (a) In General.--Section 1720F(j) of title 38, United       States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following       new paragraph:        ``(4)(A) As part of the counseling program under this       subsection, the Secretary shall emphasize appointing peer       support counselors for women veterans. To the degree       practicable, the Secretary shall seek to recruit women peer       support counselors with expertise in--        ``(i) female gender-specific issues and services;        ``(ii) the provision of information about services and       benefits provided under laws administered by the Secretary;       or        ``(iii) employment mentoring.        ``(B) To the degree practicable, the Secretary shall       emphasize facilitating peer support counseling for women       veterans who are eligible for counseling and services under       section 1720D of this title, have post-traumatic stress       disorder or suffer from another mental health condition, are       homeless or at risk of becoming homeless, or are otherwise at       increased risk of suicide, as determined by the Secretary.        ``(C) The Secretary shall conduct outreach to inform women       veterans about the program and the assistance available under       this paragraph.        ``(D) In carrying out this paragraph, the Secretary shall       coordinate with such community organizations, State and local       governments, institutions of higher education, chambers of       commerce, local business organizations, organizations that       provide legal assistance, and other organizations as the       Secretary considers appropriate.        ``(E) In carrying out this paragraph, the Secretary shall       provide adequate training for peer support counselors,       including training carried out under the national program of       training required by section 304(c) of the Caregivers and       Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 (38 U.S.C. 1712A       note).''.        (b) Funding.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall carry       out paragraph (4) of section 1720F(j) of title 38, United       States Code, as added by subsection (a), using funds       otherwise made available to the Secretary. No additional       funds are authorized to be appropriated by reason of such       paragraph.        (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than two years after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs       of the Senate and House of Representatives a report on the       peer support counseling program under section 1720F(j) of       title 38, United States Code, as amended by this section.       Such report shall include--        (1) the number of peer support counselors in the program;        (2) an assessment of the effectiveness of the program; and        (3) a description of the oversight of the program.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material in the Record on H.R. 4635, as  amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4635, as amended. This  bill would ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs existing  volunteer peer support counseling program includes peer counselors for  women veterans.   As the number of veterans who are enrolled in the VA healthcare  system continues to grow, it is critical that the VA programs are  prepared to meet their needs. The peer support counseling program  recruits veterans to serve on a volunteer basis to assist their fellow  veterans who are struggling with mental health or readjustment issues  and to conduct outreach to inform veterans and their families of the  benefits and services that are available to them through the VA  healthcare system.   Peer support counselors are trained and overseen by VA and, as peers,  are often able to communicate on a more personal and effective basis  than nonveteran clinicians, particularly to veterans who may be  hesitant to seek VA care due to stigma or other barriers.   This bill is sponsored by Congressman  Mike Coffman of Colorado. I am  grateful to Mike for his leadership on the committee and for sponsoring  this bill to ensure that VA recruits a sufficient number of women  veteran volunteers to support the need through the peer support  counseling program.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4635, as amended,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Coffman), my good friend and a senior member of the  Veterans Affairs' Committee. He is also both an Army and Marine  veteran.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, encourage all Members to  support this legislation, and I want to thank both sides of the aisle  for bringing this forward.   As a physician and a veteran, I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that  peer-to-peer counseling is the way to go. This legislation will help  our female veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage all Members to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
