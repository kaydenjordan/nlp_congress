 Madam Speaker, I am delighted that today we will be  voting to pass the Affordable Insulin Now Act. This is personal for me.  I have type 1 diabetes and insulin keeps me alive. This tiny 2 teaspoon  bottle that used to cost $40 now retails for over $300. Most of us need  more than one bottle a month to survive.   No one should have to ration their insulin--taking just enough to  stay alive but not enough to stay healthy. That is a dangerous and  sometimes deadly tightrope to walk, which is why this bill to cap  insulin at $35 a month is so critical for my patients, as a  pediatrician, and for people like me.
