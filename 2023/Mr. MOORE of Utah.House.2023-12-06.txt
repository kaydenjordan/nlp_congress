 Mr. Speaker, American leadership has always been  the most influential, powerful agent for freedom, peace, and democracy.   One month ago, the House stood up to protect our values and national  interests by passing a bipartisan package to help Israel defend itself  from Hamas.   I recently attended a screening of the footage from Hamas that  Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Meeks invited us all to, and I am so  grateful for their leadership to have us do that. I knew it was footage  that would be tough to see, but I knew it was footage I needed to see.  I won't ever be the same after having seen that.   As we support our ally, we must take a comprehensive look at the  Biden administration's Middle East policy.   Encapsulating all of my thoughts today in my remarks is a simple  concept: With foreign policy, although it would be desired by all, you  can't have it all. You have to make tough choices when it comes to  foreign policy. You don't get to have everything that you would ever  want. You cannot have it all with respect to foreign policy.   I will share a little bit about how important it is to take a stand.   While I am grateful for President Biden's clear support for Israel,  his administration's attempts to placate Iran, the number one state  sponsor of terrorism in the world, have been a critical misstep.   For the past 3 years, the Biden administration has embarked on a  deeply misguided and contradictory quest to resurrect the Iran nuclear  deal while begrudgingly continuing one of the Trump and Pence  administration's most successful efforts at peace in the Middle East,  the Abraham Accords, and the recognition of Israel by its Arab  neighbors in embracing diplomatic and economic ties through these  accords.   Rather than maintaining the maximum pressure campaign that sanctioned  and starved Iran of foreign revenue, the Biden administration has  balked at enforcing sanctions. They have allowed Iranian oil exports to  surge back to levels higher than they were in 2018 and attempted to  unfreeze billions of dollars in Iranian assets from foreign banks.   The Iranian regime is flush with cash thanks to the global energy  crisis and the administration's policy of appeasement. Iran uses this  cash to fund, equip, and train a terrorist network across the region.  This includes groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.   According to reports from The Wall Street Journal, 500 or so Hamas  terrorists trained in Iran in the months leading up to the October 7  attack on innocent Israelis. The Iranian regime has developed this  terror network not just in Gaza and Lebanon but also in Syria, Iraq,  and Yemen for one purpose: to cause just enough chaos to make the Arab  world think twice about sustainable peace with Israel and the  reliability of U.S. diplomacy.   The Biden administration says its Iran appeasement is geared toward  preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, a goal I think we could  all get behind, but it has obviously emboldened Iran and undermined  regional security.   We need our four main regional security partners--Israel, Saudi  Arabia, Egypt, and Turkiye--to work together in unity, and we need  America to lead on this front.   President Biden's approach creates tremendous doubt that the United  States is more committed to the security of our partners than to a  delusional accommodation of Iran. What must Riyadh, Cairo, and Istanbul  have thought these past 3 years while watching the U.S. respond meekly  to Iranian proxy groups disrupting political order, trafficking illegal  weapons, and lobbing rockets at American diplomats with impunity?    Iran would love nothing more than for Saudi Arabia to think twice  about normalizing relations with Israel, given the current crisis. Iran  would love nothing more than for Egypt to decide that the opportunity  costs for working with Israel on humanitarian corridors in Gaza,  something that I have been calling for in a bipartisan fashion, is too  high. Iran would love nothing more than for Turkiye to decide that it  is more beneficial to work directly with Iran rather than through the  United States.   The Trump-Pence administration correctly understood that the Abraham  [[Page H6152]]  Accords were the best chance we have for sustainable peace in the  Middle East. We are stronger together than we are apart.   President Biden is undermining regional security and unity by  appeasing the region's chief destabilizer: Iran. We must enforce  sanctions, communicate clearly that we stand on the side of Israel and  our partners, and line up our diplomatic and military commitments with  our national interests that are also the national interests of Israel  and the Arab world.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my sympathies to  the family and friends of Anthony White for the tragic loss of their  father, husband, friend, and coach.   My remarks will be particularly directed to Anthony Jr. and Olivia  Grace.   I met their father 25 years ago this very week when I actually voted  for him to be the next Wendy's High School Heisman recipient, an award  given to members of the community that excelled in athletics,  academics, and citizenship.   He then later went on to play University of Utah football, and his  crowning achievement was taking a school that hadn't seen success for  years and turn it into a championship team in Buena Park in southern  California, most recently creating that same type of success for Santa  Ana Junior College.   Anthony was an incredible human being that will leave a legacy that  is beyond description. I hope they can always remember what he has done  for not only them as his dad but every community and every person he  has touched. We are all better for knowing Anthony. Losing him has been  tragic.    We want San to know that her husband has touched so many of us, and  we want to just share with her that we will be here for her after his  passing.   We offer our prayers and condolences to his entire family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special  Order.    Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to be here tonight to  talk about some of the key pieces of legislation House Republicans are  championing this week, from fighting President Biden's unfair student  loan program to protecting consumer choice in purchasing a vehicle to  holding universities accountable for their influence from foreign  adversaries. We are laser focused on putting Americans' interests  first.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, President Biden is once again  circumventing the rule of law and leaving hardworking Americans who  never went to college with a $559 billion bill to cover unpaid student  loans.   House Republicans will bring to the floor H.J. Res. 88 expressing our  disapproval of President Biden's Saving on a Valuable Education, SAVE,  plan which would drastically alter the Income-Driven Repayment program  and make America's student loan program even more expensive for  taxpayers. Let's be clear: This sets the precedent that Federal  education loans do not need to be repaid.   Using American tax dollars to give a blanket subsidy to those who  earn disproportionately more money than others is government at its  worst. For those who never went to college, for those who are  struggling with inflation and don't need more money flooding into a  broken system, and for those who already paid off their loans, any  effort to wipe the slate clean is completely unfair.   I, along with many other House Republicans, support universities  focusing on a strong ROI to keep costs down. We support Federal student  loan reforms. We do not support blanket student loan forgiveness for  political pandering in an election year.   Even though the system has plenty of room to improve, it is my job to  highlight ways the State of Utah is getting it right. Utah has the  lowest average student loan debt per borrower in the country and the  lowest percentage of graduates leaving campus with student debt. The  University of Utah's medical school and nursing program at Weber State  University work to hold down student debt by designing instructional  schedules to allow students to work while attending college.   I have had to apologize multiple times to constituents in the First  District who built businesses after paying their way through school or  other programming and paid their taxes, only to have their hard-earned  dollars transferred to folks who have chosen a career and a different  approach that required carrying some debt that they planned for.   Now, with the government saying they don't need to plan for it, we  are teaching our children the exact wrong thing that made our country  so great. I am deeply frustrated that I am going to have to continue to  apologize.
