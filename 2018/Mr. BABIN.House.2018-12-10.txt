 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Our Nation lost a true patriot on November 30 with the passing of  George Herbert Walker Bush.   Our 41st President ascended to the office with an impeccable resume  for the position, having served as Congressman, Ambassador to China,  CIA Director, and Vice President to our 40th President, Ronald Reagan.   His service as a Navy pilot during the Second World War, during which  he was shot down over the Pacific, cemented his status as an American  hero. But the humble Bush rarely referenced his war experiences.  Indeed, President Bush rarely discussed his own record.   His accomplishments as President, particularly on the world's stage,  seem more impressive with the passing time, and historians and scholars  hold his administration in increasingly high esteem.   Mr. Speaker, I met President Bush only once, but I still treasure the  photograph that I had taken with him. He was a real gentleman.   Despite a life spent in public service at the highest levels,  President Bush was a devoted family man. He was constantly surrounded  by his loved ones. His children adored him, and his relationship with  his wife, Barbara, has long been celebrated for its commitment and its  warmth.   The people of Texas, which became his adopted home after his service  in the Navy, will forever hold President Bush in special regard.   George Bush led an exemplary life. His service to his country and his  kindness to his fellow Americans ranks him among our most beloved of  Presidents. His reputation as a loving husband and father will persist,  and I believe that his legacy as President will continue to grow long  after his passing.   Thank you for your service. Rest in peace, Mr. President.
