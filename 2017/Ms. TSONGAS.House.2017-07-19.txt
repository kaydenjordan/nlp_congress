 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 12, after line 9, add the following:        (h) Limitation on Application.--This section shall not       apply to any application for an authorization under section 3       of the Natural Gas Act or a certificate of public convenience       and necessity under section 7 of such Act with respect to       which any part of a pipeline facility that is a subject of       the application is to be located on lands required under       Federal, State, or local law to be managed for purposes of       natural resource conservation or recreation.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 454, the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Massachusetts.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment protects a robust public  review process for any proposed pipeline that seeks to cross protected  conservation and recreation lands. The legislation before us today,  with its short-circuited environmental reviews, puts treasured public  lands at risk.   My home State of Massachusetts, like many areas around the country,  faces real energy challenges. We need careful and strategic long-term  planning in order to lower energy prices and maintain reliability and  resiliency. Over the past several years, we have seen proposals for new  natural gas pipelines that would stretch hundreds of miles and cross  many different communities.   We must work to identify ways to lower energy prices for our homes  and businesses, and increasing the supply of lower cost natural gas may  be one way to achieve that objective while we transition to cleaner,  more affordable, and sustainable alternatives. However, we cannot, in  the long run, afford to be careless about our other environmental  interests as we make that transition.   These major infrastructure proposals in New England and elsewhere  around the country deserve close and careful scrutiny given the  potential environmental impacts and the costs borne by ratepayers.   Regrettably, this legislation moves us in the wrong direction. This  bill would force FERC to rush decisionmaking, including environmental  reviews necessary to determine if pipelines will have negative impacts  on State forests, parks, wildlife management areas, and wetlands, lands  expressly put aside as a result of a public decision to protect them.   Our Nation has a longstanding history of preserving natural habitats  and protecting open spaces for the public benefit, and we have invested  enormous public resources toward these goals. These lands and the  decisions behind them deserve to be honored.   In my district, we recently went through the public review process  for a  [[Page H6008]]  proposed natural gas pipeline. Hundreds of my constituents expressed  their concerns about the project. Construction of the pipeline could  have jeopardized local wildlife and impacted both State and federally  designated conservation land, as well as Massachusetts' scarce  farmland.   Thanks to a robust review process, the public had numerous  opportunities to question the project and express these legitimate  concerns, and their views were able to be fully considered.   While I believe we must protect that review process for all  infrastructure projects, my amendment focuses on pipelines that cross  protected conservation and recreation lands.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and protect investments  by Federal taxpayers, States, and local communities in preserving their  natural and historic resources.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to say, first, that energy  infrastructure is critical to our economy; yet we cannot simply give  the fossil fuel industry carte blanche to build pipelines without  robust public reviews.   I yield 1\3/4\ minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on  the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Massachusetts will be  postponed.                     Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Lynch    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in  part A of House Report 115-235.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 3, after line 14, insert the following:        (D) Additional requirement for oil and natural gas pipeline       facilities.--In the case of a request for a certificate of       crossing for a border-crossing facility consisting of an oil       or natural gas pipeline facility, the Federal Energy       Regulatory Commission may not issue a certificate of crossing       under subparagraph (A) if any part of the oil or natural gas       pipeline project is to be located on lands required under       Federal, State, or local law to be managed for purposes of       natural resource conservation or recreation.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 454, the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Massachusetts.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment protects a robust public  review process for any proposed pipeline that seeks to cross protected  conservation and recreation lands, this time for pipelines that  includes a crossing with Canada or Mexico. The legislation before us  today, with its narrowly defined environmental reviews and limited  public input, puts treasured public resources at risk.   My home State of Massachusetts, like many areas around the country,  faces real energy challenges. We need careful and strategic long-term  planning in order to lower energy prices and increase reliability and  resiliency.   However, as with H.R. 2910 that we considered earlier this afternoon,  H.R. 2883 moves us in the wrong direction. In fact, it doesn't allow  any careful or strategic planning when it comes to fossil fuel  pipelines.   Cross-border and natural gas pipeline interests should not be  permitted to cavalierly tread on public lands, lands expressly set  aside by Federal taxpayers, State and local communities for the benefit  of conservation and public recreation.   Our Nation has a longstanding history of preserving natural habitats  and protecting open spaces for the public benefit, and we have invested  significant public resources toward these goals. These lands and the  decisions behind them deserve to be honored.   The potential negative environmental impacts of an oil or natural gas  pipeline are too great to risk such treasured investments by Federal  taxpayers and State and local communities, and we should not quickly  forego the essential public review process that has helped ensure these  public treasures are available to future generations.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I don't have any additional speakers.   I would just like to say that energy infrastructure is critical to  our economy, yet we cannot simply give the fossil fuel industry a carte  blanche to build pipelines that adversely impact conservation and  recreation lands.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts will be postponed.              Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Gene Green of Texas    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3  printed in part B of House Report 115-235.   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, as the designee of Mr. Veasey, I  offer an amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 5, after line 3, insert the following:        (D) Scope of nepa review.--Nothing in this Act, or the       amendments made by this Act, shall affect the scope of any       review required to be conducted under section 102 of the       National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 with respect to a       project for which a certificate of crossing for a border-      crossing facility is requested under this subsection.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 454, the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, again, this is Congressman  Veasey's idea, and I am doing it for him because he couldn't be here.   Our intent when crafting the bill was never to reduce or limit the  National Environmental Policy Act applicability when considering  whether to approve a cross-border project.   Before a Federal agency can make a final determination on a proposed  Federal action, the National Environmental Policy Act requires that the  agency identify the proposal's effects on the quality of human  environment and whether these effects will be significant.   To make this determination, Federal agencies identify and evaluate  the direct and indirect cumulation of effects of the proposal. Direct  effects are the impacts caused by the project occurring at the same  time and place. Indirect effects are the impacts that are later in time  or further removed but still reasonably foreseeable. And cumulative  effects are impacts on the environment that result with incremental  [[Page H6020]]  impacts on the action, regardless of what person or agency undertakes  that action.   The Federal agencies currently implement NEPA. The requirement to  identify all three of these impacts has required the analysis of  impacts to include not just the cross-border section of the project,  but any new facility or structure constructed within the United States.   Our office had the bill analyzed by the experts at the Congressional  Research Office, who confirmed that the underlying bill did not in any  way limit the scope of future National Environmental Policy Act reviews  under it. Under our language, they will continue to involve reviews of  the entire project, not just that part that crosses the border section.   With that said, I have heard concerns from Members who are worried  that the bill will limit the NEPA in some way. I am happy to support  this bipartisan amendment with my colleague, Mr. Veasey, which  unequivocally states that nothing in this act or the amendments made by  this act shall affect the scope of any review required to be conducted  by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.   I support this good faith amendment--and like I said earlier, it is  belts and suspenders, but sometimes we need them to pass legislation-- and I urge my colleagues to do so as well.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
