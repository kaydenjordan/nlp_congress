 Mr. Speaker, as Christmastime approaches, I rise  to share the history of one of the most beloved carols--and there are  more to come.   ``God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen.''   The first line means, gentlemen, may God keep you in good spirits--a  blessing.   Immensely popular throughout its history, this carol even merits a  mention by Charles Dickens in his famous tale, ``A Christmas Carol.''  It is also a very old carol and was almost certainly sung by wandering  groups of singers called waits. In Merrie Olde England, music was an  important part of everyday life. Minstrels carried the news of the day  from town to town and were often handsomely rewarded for their efforts.   In many towns, the waits played the role of town criers, singing the  hours of the day and reporting local happenings. Christmastime kept  them especially busy. As they strolled through the snowy streets, they  told the story of the nativity in song, adding to the festive  atmosphere. Townspeople would show their appreciation by giving the  singers money or food.   These are the words of that famous carol:       God rest ye merry, gentlemen; let nothing you dismay.      Remember, Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day.      To save us all from Satan's power, when we were gone astray.      tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy.      tidings of comfort and joy.   In Bethlehem, in Israel, this blessed babe was born,   And laid within a manger upon this blessed morn;   The which His mother Mary did nothing take in scorn.      tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy.      tidings of comfort and joy.      From God our Heavenly Father, a blessed angel came;      And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same;      How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name.      tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy.      tidings of comfort and joy.    I hope that you keep this history in mind of this beautiful song as  you celebrate during the holiday season.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of central Texas, I wish you all  a Merry Christmas and a happy holiday.                            ____________________
