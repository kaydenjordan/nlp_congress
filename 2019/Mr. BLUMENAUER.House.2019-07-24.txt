 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Neal), and I appreciate his laser-like focus on this issue.   We are hearing people in an alternative universe. The problems that  we are facing financially are not an issue of mismanagement. It is the  near collapse of the economy that plunged it into a downward spiral and  the fact that the deregulation by the Congress in the trucking industry  meant that there were many, many jobs that disappeared. Many plans were  no longer sustainable.   But I find it rich to hear my friends on the other side of the aisle  talk about fiscal conservatism and protecting the taxpayer's money.  These are the folks who passed a tax bill, without the benefit of a  hearing, that added $2.3 trillion to the deficit. And they are ignoring  the fact that, if we allow these plans to go over the edge, it will  cost five, six, eight times as much money.   Let's get real here.   I appreciate the commitment that we have, Mr. Chairman, to a  bipartisan solution. There are people on the other side of the aisle  who want to work on that. This isn't the last word. We have things to  do, but this is, however, the first step to get us there.  [[Page H7331]]                                     time  1800     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the  time and for his tireless efforts on this with Mr. Yoho. I have watched  as the gentleman has battled this for years. I have worked with him to  get cosponsorships.   We have had the Animal Protection Caucus having sessions, bringing  staff members, having demonstrations of this horrific practice.   This is the ninth year that this has been before us. Now, I am  pleased that we are here. I am pleased that we are making the case. I  am pleased that, tonight, we are going to pass this legislation,  although I wish it weren't at 10:30 at night for a few minutes; because  there is no guarantee that, even with this case, with the momentum,  that we are going to be able to get it through the Senate, where we  have seen objection in the past.   I hope that this legislation occasions a little bit of soul- searching. The animal protection agenda of this Congress is one of the  areas that brings people together, like my two veterinarian friends  have shown bipartisan cooperation dealing with the facts, mustering  support, being far more patient than I would have.   I mean, the last two Congresses, we had 280 cosponsors. We couldn't  even get a hearing, let alone get it on the floor. That is outrageous.   Now, there is a little bit of political blowback. Some people who are  part of that aren't here anymore. I hope that there are some lessons,  both in terms of the politics and the basic decency for protection of  animal welfare.   I agree with the gentleman from Georgia, I wish it went through  regular order. I wish that we had an opportunity in committees of  jurisdiction to give a little bit of the time that is merited to be  able to give the public a view of what is going on; the bureaucracy  that, for 49 years, has been unable to take the self-policing mechanism  and be able to make it work.   I hope that this is the first of a series of items. I plan on talking  to our leadership, and I hope we will have leadership on the other side  of the aisle who, in the past have held off, despite overwhelming  support, to the frustration, I know, of one of the principal sponsors.   I hope that we understand that this is something that shouldn't be  dealt with in a partisan fashion, and there shouldn't be jurisdictional  battles. People ought to be able to take fundamental animal welfare  issues and bring them forward on the merits, have the debate, and get  them enacted. It will make people in this body feel better, because for  a number of days, I think, people don't feel so good watching what  happens around here, and we don't have much to show for our efforts.   So I want to commend my colleagues for their patience and their  perseverance.   Vern Buchanan, my co-chair of the Animal Protection Caucus, has been  writing op-eds with me and working on this, so it's a culmination of a  lot of work.   But I hope it is a first step toward dealing with an area that is  supported by the American public. It is important work. It is not  particularly controversial, except for a few special interests who,  frankly, don't have a leg to stand on, even though they didn't have one  of those things on their legs.   I hope that we can use this as an opportunity to make more progress  in a bipartisan way to solve problems, not just for animal welfare, but  other areas that the American people would like us to add
