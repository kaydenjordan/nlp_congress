 Madam Speaker, my mother was a maid and my father a  janitor, but they were good, decent, honest people who saw voting as  their duty and knew their vote mattered regardless of who they were and  where they lived.   When did some of us, as elected officials, start believing it is okay  to no longer protect basic rights but to lie if you have to, cheat if  you have to, suppress the vote if you have to, and then stand up and  claim victory?   John Lewis called the right to vote ``precious, almost sacred,'' and  he was willing to risk his life to protect it.   We reject the politically motivated lies that seek to undermine faith  in our elections. We are the United States of America. Yes, we are the  greatest Nation in the world.   Let's live up to America's promise once again by protecting the  precious, almost sacred right to vote.
