 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Chairman Brady,  Chairwoman Foxx, and Chairman Walden for addressing opioid and  substance abuse disorders and their work on H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for  Patients and Communities Act. I am grateful to my colleagues for  treating the crisis with the urgency it deserves.   In my district, this crisis has affected way too many. I am also  grateful that my bill, H.R. 5889, the Recognizing Early Childhood  Trauma Related to Substance Abuse Act of 2018 was included in the final  package before us today.
