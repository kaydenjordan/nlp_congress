 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2781, the  Ensuring Veteran Enterprise Participation in Strategic Sourcing Act.   This important legislation clarifies that veteran-owned small  businesses should be given proper consideration for contracts with the  Department of Veterans Affairs. It will help to ensure that our  contracting is efficient and fair to our Nation's veterans.   The VA has a special responsibility to maximize business  opportunities for our heroes when they come home from serving abroad.  Helping veteran-owned small businesses succeed is a bipartisan effort,  as you have heard already here today. I am happy to see so many of my  colleagues support it.   I want to thank my colleague, Dr. Dunn, for offering the commonsense  fix to contracting at the VA, and I look forward to voting in favor of  it. I urge Members to support H.R. 2781.
