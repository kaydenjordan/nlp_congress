 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of subtitle H of title XII, add the following       new section:       SEC. 12_. REPORT ON STRATEGY TO DEFEAT AL-QAEDA, THE TALIBAN,                     THE ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ AND SYRIA (ISIS), AND                     THEIR ASSOCIATED FORCES AND CO-BELLIGERENTS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to       Congress a report on the United States strategy to defeat Al-      Qaeda, the Taliban, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria       (ISIS), and their associated forces and co-belligerents.        (b) Elements.--The report required under subsection (a)       shall include the following:        (1) An analysis of the adequacy of the existing legal       framework to accomplish the strategy described in subsection       (a), particularly with respect to the Authorization for Use       of Military Force (Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note)       and the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq       Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note).        (2) An analysis of the budgetary resources necessary to       accomplish the strategy described in subsection (a).        (c) Congressional Testimony.--Not later than 30 days after       the date on which the President submits to the appropriate       congressional committees the report required by subsection       (a), the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense       shall testify at any hearing held by any of the appropriate       congressional committees on the report and to which the       Secretary is invited.        (d) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Armed Services of the Senate; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Armed Services of the House of Representatives.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) and a Member opposed each will control 15  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma.    Mr. Chair, since 2001 when we passed the original  Authorization for Use of Military Force against al-Qaida and against  associated enemies, the nature of the war on terror in which we find  ourselves has changed dramatically. We now find ourselves fighting  enemies that simply did not exist at the time in areas that nobody in  Congress anticipated we would be at war.   This has caused a number of us to have very serious concerns as to  whether or not the original Authorization for Use of Military Force is  still relevant, and frankly, many of us have concerns that the war- making power of Congress is slipping away from us. Indeed, we find  ourselves engaged since that original AUMF in 14 different countries on  more than almost 40 different occasions without Congress authorizing  the use of force. In our view, a new AUMF is necessary.   However, I also recognize that needs to come through a process. My  effort here is to try and set up a process where the administration can  participate, we can have an orderly discussion, and the appropriate  committees can mark up a new AUMF if Congress, indeed, thinks it does-- and again, I think many of us do.   A new AUMF would provide clear authority for ongoing operations  against ISIS and other terrorist groups, and it would fulfill the  constitutional responsibility of Congress to authorize the use of  force. My amendment directs the President to put forward a strategy, an  analysis, and a framework that we can actually debate and take action  on.   The underlying bill being considered today provides authorization for  training and equipping our military. Just as important is the time to  debate and deliberate how that military should be used to defeat our  enemies.   Recently, in an appearance before the House Defense Appropriations  Subcommittee, Secretary Mattis made an appearance, and I actually asked  him would it be helpful to have an AUMF. At that time, he said it  absolutely would be helpful.   Our men and women who we have deployed in places, again, that nobody  in 2001 thought they would be deployed to, need to know that the  Congress of the United States is fully supportive of their deployment.   So this amendment would direct that the President, within 30 days  after the passage of the legislation, present to Congress a report  that, again, justifies the action, tells us the strategy, lays out the  objectives. Within 30 days after that report was received, the  Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense could be called before  the relevant committees to actually explain and defend that.   Now, again, in my view, I still think we need a new Authorization for  Use of Military Force, but I want to start a process whereby that would  begin, and I think this would help us achieve that. If others have an  opinion, that is fine too, but I think they would still find the report  useful and the testimony invaluable.   Sooner or later, Congress needs to take responsibility. I think with  the best will in the world, we have slipped into almost endless warfare  in a lot of places that none of us anticipated we would be.                                time  1800    Again, these are not actions that I necessarily question, but I think  they have not been authorized, not been debated, not been examined,  and, frankly, the American people have been denied that debate. Also,  frankly, they have been denied the opportunity to hold their Members  responsible.   Remember, that original Authorization for Use of Military Force was  2001. Almost 80 percent of the Members of this body have been elected  since that original authorization. I think they ought to listen to the  debate, and, frankly, their constituents ought to be able to hold them  accountable.   So I would urge adoption of the amendment, Mr. Chairman, and I  reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I will not oppose the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Palmer). Without objection, the gentleman from  Massachusetts is recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Cole amendment.  I am a great admirer of the gentleman from Oklahoma. We have worked  together on several bipartisan letters to Speaker Ryan asking that the  Speaker bring to the House floor an AUMF to address the fight against  the Islamic State in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere. I value the  gentleman's leadership and desire to find common ground with Members on  both sides of the aisle.   But it is frustrating, Mr. Chairman, to know that this amendment was  made in order while every other amendment to require the House to take  concrete action on these wars were denied their right to debate.   Maybe my good friend from Oklahoma is right and Congress has to take  baby steps. It needs yet another report on Afghanistan, Iraq, and  Syria. Its Committees on Foreign Affairs and Armed Services need to be  ordered to hold hearings with the Secretaries of Defense and State to  review these matters.   But what then?   According to this amendment, nothing.   Now, I have had my fill of Congress doing nothing. I admire the  gentleman from Oklahoma. I support his amendment. But I am sick and  tired of reports. After 16 years in Afghanistan, we need a debate on  the future of U.S. military engagement there, and we need it now.   The gentleman said ``sooner or later.'' Well, after 16 years, we have  already arrived at sooner and later. After  [[Page H5807]]  6 years of military operations in Iraq and Syria, we need to vote on an  AUMF to address the fight against the Islamic State, and we need it  now.   How much longer will Congress keep sending our brave servicemen and - women to war while it sits on its hands back here in Washington safe  and sound?   So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, but I demand that  the House Republican leadership find the courage to act on these  matters now. Our troops and their families deserve more than silence  from a Congress that has no qualms about sending them to war but fails  to have the political courage to take a vote.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Thornberry), who is the distinguished chairman of the House Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Thornberry), who is the distinguished chairman of the House Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Thornberry), who is the distinguished chairman of the House Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Thornberry), who is the distinguished chairman of the House Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Thornberry), who is the distinguished chairman of the House Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Thornberry), who is the distinguished chairman of the House Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Thornberry), who is the distinguished chairman of the House Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Thornberry), who is the distinguished chairman of the House Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Thornberry), who is the distinguished chairman of the House Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Thornberry), who is the distinguished chairman of the House Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Thornberry), who is the distinguished chairman of the House Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I want to commend both the chairman and the  ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee for their approach  to this problem. It is well known in this body that probably the House  Armed Services Committee is the most bipartisan committee that we have.  The fact that you have tried in the past and the fact that you are  willing to work with us here today is deeply appreciated.   I also thank my friend from Massachusetts, and I want to associate  myself with his frustration. He has every right to be frustrated. My  friend, the ranking member, is correct. This is a difficult job. It  will require bipartisan cooperation and bicameral cooperation.   But isn't that what war is about, to achieve a national consensus?   I think that is exactly what Secretary Mattis was asking for: We will  go do any mission that you as the Congress and the administration ask  us to do, but give us a clear mission and give us your absolute support  in carrying that through.   If we have this debate, there will undoubtedly be dissenting views.  That is what democracy is supposed to be about, too. So my friends that  would oppose the use of force, for instance, in Afghanistan, that voice  ought to be heard and that case ought to be made. Frankly, those of us  who are supportive of what we are trying to accomplish against ISIS  need to make our case and persuade the majority of this House and of  the United States Senate to move forward.   So I take this as the first step on a road. Like my friend, it is a  baby step. I would agree with his characterization, but at least it is  a step. This couldn't have happened without the cooperation of our  leadership in the House and certainly without the help of the chairman  and the ranking member of the committee. But, also, it couldn't have  happened without the persistence of my friend from Massachusetts. We  have worked together, and, believe me, that is unusual. We don't agree  on a lot of issues, but we respect one another.   This is also a question of congressional authority. I think it is a  profoundly important constitutional issue, and I do believe we have  inadvertently--because of the difficulty of the task--allowed war- making power to slip away from us. That needs to stop. We are  responsible to the American people. The Constitution is very clear  about where war-making power lies.   Frankly, it ought to be difficult to go to war. It ought to demand a  lot of cooperation. It ought to be something that we think is worth  setting aside our differences, working together, because we are asking  men and women to risk their lives. We are putting them in harm's way,  and they deserve to know that we are 100 percent supporting them.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5808]]        Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff).    Mr. Chairman, I want to advise my friend that I am prepared  to close, although, believe me, I could talk about this a long time.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Chairman, I always enjoy hearing the gentleman talk  about this. When we agree on things, it is always pleasant. I commend  the gentleman from Oklahoma for this amendment because I think it is  important that we move forward, even if it is a small step forward.   As I said initially, I am frustrated. I know Mr. Schiff is  frustrated, and a lot of other people are frustrated who had amendments  that were perfectly germane to this bill that I think should have been  debated and that many of us think they are long overdue.   Mr. Chairman, 16 years in Afghanistan is an awful long time. Some of  us fear that these wars are becoming endless. They are essentially on  automatic pilot. We don't give the attention that I think is  appropriate to what is happening, especially given the fact that so  many brave men and women have their lives on the line on behalf of our  country.   But beyond that, this AUMF in Afghanistan that has now been going on  for 16 years has also been used to justify what we are doing in Syria,  what we are doing in Iraq, in Somalia, and I could go on and on. This  is ludicrous.                                time  1815    As the gentleman from Oklahoma knows, before we began to get sucked  in militarily in Syria, some of us tried to have a debate on an AUMF in  Syria, because we thought the time to debate an AUMF, the time to  debate military action, actually should be before we get involved.   Once we are involved, it is a lot harder to have these debates and to  raise the questions that are so important as to whether or not some of  these interventions are actually the right thing to do. But we skirted  that issue, and we continue to put this on the back burner.   As I said, I have no objection to this amendment. I support this  amendment. I just think we are at a point where we should be doing much  more. We are much further along than to just require a report or to  mandate hearings. I am concerned that after these reports and these  hearings are done, then what? The gentleman's amendment doesn't require  that Congress take up an AUMF or that we actually have to have a vote  in so many days or so many months.   So I look forward to working with the gentleman to make sure that not  only are these reports and these hearings conducted as we all want them  to be, but to continue to press this leadership to do the right thing:  to not give away Congress' constitutional responsibilities and to do  what is right by the men and women who sacrifice so much for our  country.   There are only a small group of people who are directly impacted by  these wars, and that is the men and women who are fighting and their  families. The rest of us are asked to do basically nothing. I think  that Congress has shirked its responsibility. We can't tolerate that.   I hope there is a big, strong bipartisan, if not unanimous vote, for  the gentleman's amendment, but this is just the first teeny step in  what we need to do. I promise him that he has my cooperation in any  efforts to get it to the point where we actually debate these wars and  develop AUMFs where people, as he said, can vote for them or against  them.   My view of what we should be doing, I know, is very different from  the gentleman from Oklahoma, and perhaps even different from the  gentleman from California, but that is the kind of genius and the  wonder of this place. We can all have different points of view, and we  can even differ, but at the end of the day, the majority decides.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Cole amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by associating myself very much with  the remarks of my good friend from Massachusetts.   Frankly, this is an area where we have found common ground because I  think we both deeply revere this institution and, frankly, respect the  Constitution of the United States.   When he says that we have shirked our duty, in my view, we have. I  think it is absolutely a fair statement to make. I think the gentleman  from Washington is also correct that it is hard. This is a very  complex, difficult kind of war. It is a new kind of war, its enemies  morphing into different forms and different places.   All that is true, but it doesn't excuse us from the obligation to do  our job and give those men and women the assurance that they are acting  at the direct request and order of the American people in fulfilling  the responsibility we have asked them to take.   It doesn't directly relate to this issue, but I felt very much the  same way as my friend did at the time about Libya. We stretched the  NATO alliances so far to get involved in a country where, in my view,  we should have never been involved. More importantly, Libya didn't  attack NATO. It really didn't make a lot of sense to use that kind of  instrument to justify a war.   I aim this at no particular President, either the last one or current  one, but, frankly, Presidents don't like Congress very much to tell  them what they have to do. They want to be able to do it. Well, I am  sorry; the Constitution is very clear about that.   One of the reasons we have a Constitution is because we didn't want  to live under a system where it is a monarchy as opposed to a  Presidency. It is part of our duty to keep a check on the extraordinary  power that we place in the hands of the Chief Executive of the United  States, regardless of who that person is, regardless of what party they  represent.   My friend makes a good point when he says sometimes we don't trust  one another, or we don't want to give the President too much power. We  also  [[Page H5809]]  don't want to take too much responsibility ourselves, sometimes. For  that, we ought to look in the mirror. We ought to be willing to take  that awesome responsibility that the Constitution entrusts us with and  make the tough decisions that the American people send us here to make.  I actually think going through this process will be very good for this  institution.   My friend is correct, it is a baby step, and I share his frustration.  But I think the current administration deserves a chance to be heard  and to present a justification, not just inherit an ongoing conflict.   I think the committee of jurisdiction, the Foreign Affairs Committee,  deserves the opportunity to hear this.   My friend expresses a concern which, quite frankly, I share, that we  will have a hearing and not much more. That would not be where I would  propose that we end. I would hope and would work with my friend to make  sure that is not where we end.   I think at the end of the day, whatever the deliberation is, whatever  the recommendation is for a new AUMF, it needs to come to this floor,  and it needs to be open for full debate. If we can't muster a majority  to approve that, then we shouldn't be fighting in the places we are  fighting if we are not willing to actually vote and use that.   So I am going to pledge to continue to work with my friend and urge  the administration, assuming this actually gets in the final bill, to  take it as an opportunity to establish a very clear set of objectives,  a very clear strategy, a very clear estimate of the budgetary cost, and  a very clear analysis of the legal framework under which they are  operating.    I think they, and we, owe that to the country. We certainly owe it to  the men and women that we have asked to go and do difficult things and  risk their lives on our behalf. They do it willingly. Again, the  Secretary of Defense said this would be helpful. This kind of debate  would make a difference.   I, again, thank my friends for their cooperation in this. I thank  particularly the chairman and the ranking member for allowing us to use  this particular vehicle to express it. I thank the leadership of the  House for being willing to grapple with this issue. I thank my friend  from Massachusetts for his persistent efforts; and my friend from  California, Ms. Lee, who has also worked on this. A lot of people on  our side of the aisle feel exactly the same way.   This is a debate about the future of a conflict, but it is also a  debate about the appropriate constitutional authority of the Congress  of the United States and a willingness by the Members to embrace this.   So it is actually, I think, a good day, even though it is the first  step in a long journey.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).   The amendment was agreed to.              Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mr. Franks of Arizona    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13  printed in House Report 115-217.
