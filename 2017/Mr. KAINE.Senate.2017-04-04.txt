 Madam President, I also rise to discuss the Supreme Court  nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch of the Tenth Circuit. I take this very  seriously.   I started my legal career as an appellate law clerk in the Eleventh  Circuit Court of Appeals in the South, working for a spectacular  jurist, Judge R. Lanier Anderson III. He taught me about what it was to  be an appellate judge: humility, not making a case a personal cause,  and careful application of the law.   I then went on to practice law in the State and Federal courts, the  trial and appeal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court as a civil  rights lawyer for 17 years. When I was the Governor of Virginia, I  twice had to appoint members of the Virginia Supreme Court and grappled  with qualifications to serve on an appellate bench.   Maybe most especially, my wife was a judge. So with a judge in the  house--she was a judge for 8 years--I spent a lot of time also thinking  about the characteristics of a good judge. Judge Gorsuch has some  strong characteristics, educational background, and professional  experience. These are characteristics that are worthy of respect. But I  have decided that there is an additional characteristic that is very  important--judicial philosophy.   And as I have looked at Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy, I have  concluded that I cannot support him. I have read scores of his  opinions. I met with him in my office. I am so proud of my colleagues-- Democrat and Republican--because in 2 months, Judge Gorsuch has enjoyed  something that Merrick Garland didn't get in 10 months. Judge Gorsuch  has had meetings with virtually all Senators. He has had a Judiciary  Committee hearing, a Judiciary Committee vote. He is getting floor  debate, and he will get a floor vote. Those are the five things he is  entitled to, and he is getting all of them.   Judge Merrick Garland was nominated. Republicans wouldn't meet with  him. They wouldn't hold a hearing. They wouldn't do a committee vote.  They wouldn't do a floor debate, and he wouldn't get a floor vote. He  got nothing he was entitled to as a sitting judge on the DC Circuit.  Also, the Senate didn't exercise the advice and consent function that  is part of our constitutional job description.   Let's talk about Judge Gorsuch's record. Many of my colleagues have  been speaking for hours. I want to focus on one aspect of his record.  Judge Gorsuch was promoted by President Trump as not an activist. And  Judge Gorsuch has written with scorn about activist judges, saying that  judges who impose their moral or social preferences on others can't  square their position with the Constitution. He even scorned activists  in courts, saying that liberals are addicted to the courtroom, as if  somehow bringing constitutional claims in courts is wrong.   So I think it is fair to look at Judge Gorsuch by his own standard.  Is he an activist or not? The best definition of a nonactivist judge  was the definition given by Chief Justice Roberts during his  confirmation hearing. He said: I am an umpire. I have no platform. I  have no agenda. I call balls and strikes without fear of any party,  without favor to any party. I am an umpire.   I looked at Judge Gorsuch's record and talked about a set of cases  that determine whether that is, in fact, true. And I have concluded  that Judge Gorsuch is definitely an activist. He may not be an activist  on everything. I don't think you have to be an activist on everything  to be an activist, but I do believe he is an activist. It shows through  in no area clearer than it shows through in cases dealing with women's  ability to make their own decisions about their own healthcare,  especially reproductive health.   There is a famous 2013 case that has been much discussed during these  discussions and in committee--Hobby Lobby v. Burwell. It was a  challenge brought up in the Tenth Circuit, where Judge Gorsuch now  sits. The legal question before the circuit court was pretty  straightforward. Under a congressional act designed to protect  religious liberty--the Religious Freedom Restoration Act--a company  claimed that its religious views conflicted with the contraception  mandate of the Affordable Care Act. And, if so, could they gain  protection for their own position?    It was sort of a controversial case because the notion that a company  could assert religious views was sort of a novel theory at the time.  But, with Judge Gorsuch as part of the majority, the majority in the  Tenth Circuit ruled that, yes, a company could assert a claim based on  sincerely held religious beliefs under the RFR statute. And they could  assert that their beliefs conflicted with the ACA's contraception  mandate.   Then, in 2014, that ruling was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court--a  controversial decision, but the majority agreed with the position that,  yes, a company could assert that its sincerely held religious beliefs  were, in fact, in conflict with the statute, and they could get relief  from the statute for doing that. Judge Gorsuch joined the ruling, which  was later affirmed by the Supreme Court.   What interested me about Judge Gorsuch in the case was that he chose  to write a concurring opinion. Most folks know what they are. If you  are not a lawyer--when a panel writes an opinion, there is a majority  opinion that is the ruling in the case. If a judge feels that it is  wrong, a judge will write a dissenting opinion saying: No, you are  wrong, and here is why. You are dutybound, if you think the majority is  wrong, to write a dissent.   A concurring opinion is about as voluntary as it gets. A concurring  opinion is: I agree with the outcome, but I have a point I want to  make. I can't convince the rest of the majority to go along with me,  and I want to make this point.   So Judge Gorsuch wrote a concurring opinion that was incredibly  revealing. It was voluntary, and that shows you a little about a  person's philosophy. It was incredibly revealing for two reasons.  First, Judge Gorsuch had already joined the majority opinion to say  that the employer, Hobby Lobby, could challenge the employer mandate of  the ACA. He had already joined that, but he stretched beyond to rule  that, in addition, the individuals owning the company should be able to  sue to challenge the employer mandate, even though they weren't the  employer.   The ACA mandate applied only to the employer of the female employees.  The employer was Hobby Lobby. But even though the mandate didn't even  apply to the Green family who owned the company, Judge Gorsuch said  that they should be able to challenge the ACA anyway.   I practiced law for a long time. There is a complete separation-- there is supposed to be--between individuals and an incorporated  company. You can run a business and not incorporate it, and in that  case, there is no separation. But as soon as you incorporate it, you  get all kinds of protections, especially that you can protect your own  personal assets from liability for corporate actions. The Green family  had done that. But Judge Gorsuch said: Even though you voluntarily  separated yourself from the company and even though the mandate doesn't  apply to you, you should be able to file a lawsuit to challenge the  mandate. I found that to be highly unusual--a great stretch. I asked  him about it when we talked. He did not give me a satisfactory answer.   Here was the thing about the Hobby Lobby case that was more notable.  It was the way Judge Gorsuch described what the case was about. The  majority opinion in the Tenth Circuit and the majority opinion in the  Supreme Court described the case the same way. They basically said that  the owners of this company claimed that the contraception mandate was  contrary to their religious views. That is what the case  [[Page S2315]]  was about. The clash was between the owners' religious beliefs and the  statute. That is what the case was about. But Judge Gorsuch described  the case completely differently. Here are his words:         All of us face the problem of complicity. All must answer .       . . to what degree we are willing to be involved in the       wrongdoing of others.    He didn't describe it as a clash between the owners and the statute.  He described it as a case about whether you are willing to be complicit  in the wrongdoing of others. That wasn't the legal issue at all. In the  Gorsuch concurring opinion in Hobby Lobby, what does that phrase mean-- ``the wrongdoing of others''? Who are the others he is talking about?  He is talking about female employees of Hobby Lobby, who wish to make  their own choice from among available and lawful methods of  contraception. Those are the others he is referring to.   He is also referring to that choice as ``wrongdoing.'' That is a  completely editorial comment that is not drawn from what a lawyer said  or what a plaintiff said. That is his own characterization of the case,  and it is completely irrelevant and, I would argue, insulting. It is a  completely irrelevant and insulting reference to something that was not  part of the case at all, except Judge Gorsuch decided to inject it into  the case.   Somebody who looks at women making their own choice of contraception  as the ``wrongdoing of others''--that is very telling.    I would appreciate it. I will take 2 minutes and finish  quickly.    I thank my friend, the deputy majority leader, the senior  Senator from Texas.   I draw support for my conclusion about that language from two other  cases that Judge Gorsuch was involved in in the Tenth Circuit, one case  dealing with contraception and one case dealing with an effort to  defund Planned Parenthood in Utah.   In both cases, the Tenth Circuit reached a decision that was pro- women's health, pro-women's health access. The parties were fine with  the decisions. They were going back to the district court and they did  not apply to have the cases reheard en banc. But in both those cases,  Judge Gorsuch took the highly unusual step of trying to get the appeals  heard anyway, even though the parties did not want to have them  reheard. In my experience as an appellate advocate, that is virtually  unheard of. I have talked to litigators in the Tenth Circuit, and they  have said the same thing. It is highly rare. The fact that Judge  Gorsuch would do it in two cases--both of which involved women's health  access--is important.   Finally, in his confirmation hearing, Judge Gorsuch was asked  directly whether he agreed with the decision in Griswold v.  Connecticut, the 1965 decision that said married couples could not be  criminalized for using contraception.   He said it was a precedent worthy of respect like all precedents, but  he would not agree--he would not say he agreed with the case. Chief  Justice Roberts, during his confirmation, said he agreed with the case.  Justice Thomas said: I have no quarrel with Griswold. Justice Alito  said he agreed with the case. But Judge Gorsuch would not.   Griswold v. Connecticut has been used repeatedly in the last 50 years  to basically create a body of constitutional precedent that says the  relationships of people--romantic, inmate relationships--should be free  from the intrusion of Big Government. You can't criminalize somebody  because of their relationship. I think somebody who is not willing to  commit to that principle is somebody who has not earned my vote.   With that, I yield the floor. Again, I thank my friend from Texas.
