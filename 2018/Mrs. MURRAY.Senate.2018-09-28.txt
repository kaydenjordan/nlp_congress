 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, like millions of people across the  country, I watched the hearing yesterday with a mix of so many strong  emotions.   First, I watched Dr. Ford with tears in my eyes. She was so brave, so  compelling, so real. The memories that she recounted--the memories that  she will never forget--were heartbreaking: the living room, the stairs,  the bedroom, the music turned up loud, the bed, Brett Kavanaugh drunk  and on top of her, the feeling she had when he covered her mouth to  stop her from screaming, the raucous laughter between Brett Kavanaugh  and Mark Judge.   She remembered the way she felt it then and told it now: two boys  laughing and having a good time while a scared 15-year-old girl lay  pinned down on a bed, worried that she may die; the bathroom, listening  for Brett and Mark to leave, hearing them bounce off the walls as they  went back downstairs; leaving the house; the sense of relief that she  escaped; and something anyone who has been a 15-year-old girl can  understand, not wanting to tell her parents that she had been at a  house with no adults, older boys, and beer. It was gutting.   Dr. Ford spoke for herself, but she was channeling the voice of  millions of women and survivors across the country who are too often  ignored, interrupted, bullied, or swept aside.   She was an inspiration, and I hope every one of my colleagues watched  her speak and answer questions. She made it clear she was not there  because she wanted to be but because she felt she had to be. She shared  her story not because she wanted to create a spectacle or embarrass  anyone but because she felt it was her civic duty to share what she  knew about Judge Kavanaugh with the people making the decision about  whether or not he should be on our Nation's highest Court.   The Republicans on that committee were too afraid to ask her anything  themselves, but she did an amazing job keeping her composure under  cross-examination by the prosecutor Republicans hired to question Dr.  Ford on their behalf, and Dr. Ford made it clear over and over,  politely but firmly, that she welcomed an investigation. She opened up  herself to questions and scrutiny. She took a polygraph.   She remembered some details that further investigation could help  expand  [[Page S6368]]  on, like seeing Mark Judge at the supermarket a few weeks later, and  she seemed not to be able to understand why nobody was digging into  these details that could help uncover even more.   She said she came to be helpful. She wants to be more helpful. She  did her job as a U.S. citizen, and she was simply asking for Senators  to do theirs.   Then, I watched Judge Kavanaugh, and, frankly, I was appalled and  dismayed by the rage on his face; the sense of entitlement he  displayed; refusing to answer questions, sneering at Senators while he  demanded they answer his questions; the outrage that he was even being  questioned about an issue like this after all he has done for his  country; not an ounce of contrition; not a modicum of shame; the  attempts over and over to turn this away from the substance, the  allegations from women against him, and the facts that could shine a  light on them, and toward attacks on the process and a political party;  the continued falsehoods and evasions and things he said that just are  not credible, from his claims that he never got blackout drunk and had  memory lapses during a night of drinking, despite everything we have  heard from people who know him and everything we have heard from him  and about him in the past about his younger days, to his claim that he  and Dr. Ford didn't ``travel in the same social circles,'' when we know  that is just not true--he has said before that he was good friends with  Holton-Arms girls, and we know Dr. Ford dated a good friend of Judge  Kavanaugh, who introduced the two of them--to his absolutely false  claims that the committee had already received all the evidence it  needs, which as a judge, he knows is simply not the case, and on and  on.    But the most striking thing to me was this--and this is something I  hope every Senator pays close attention to because I know it is what  people across the country saw vividly and repeatedly--and that is the  fact that Judge Kavanaugh so clearly does not want an investigation. He  does not want the facts to come out. He doesn't want other witnesses to  be brought in who, if he is telling the truth, could corroborate his  story and help clear his name.   He certainly doesn't want anyone to hear from the other two women who  have come forward with their experiences regarding him and sexual  assault and who are willing to come and testify under oath.   He wants to rush through this as quickly as he can with as little  information as possible coming out. Is that how someone acts if they  truly have nothing to hide? Is this how someone behaves if they truly  want to clear their good name? Is this what someone truly innocent of  everything he is being accused of would do?   I want to close by setting aside what I thought of the hearing  yesterday for just a minute. I believe Dr. Ford. I thought she was  telling the truth. But I want to set that aside to make one more point  because maybe some of my colleagues watched that hearing yesterday and  didn't see it the same way I did. Maybe they saw that hearing and  thought Dr. Ford was credible, and they also thought Judge Kavanaugh  was credible. Maybe they thought: This is a he said, she said, and I  just don't know whom or what to believe.   Here is my message to those colleagues of mine. Yesterday's hearing  does not have to be the final word. There is absolutely no rush--none,  zero. We have an opportunity to take a breath and slow down and let  this process work the way it is supposed to.   The 11 Republicans on the Judiciary Committee may have scrambled to  rush this through their phase, but we do not have to follow suit here  in the Senate. We can have the FBI investigation. We can continue our  own investigations. We can bring in additional, relevant witnesses in  the most appropriate ways or hold additional hearings.   I know we all want this to be over. Trust me, I wish we didn't have  to go through this, but we simply cannot allow a Supreme Court Justice  to be jammed through like this right now. It would be a disgrace. It  would damage the integrity of the Supreme Court, and it would shred  whatever integrity we have left here in the Senate.   So I say to those colleagues: Even if you hate how this process has  gone so far, even if you wish this had been done differently and that  the information had come out about these allegations sooner, even if  you think this was bungled completely, even if you want to point  fingers and blame Democrats for that--fine, but we are right here,  right now. We are facing one of our most important jobs as Senators,  laid out in article II, section 2 of our Constitution, to provide  advice and consent on Supreme Court nominations.   We can litigate how this went later. I am sure there are ways it  could have gone better. We can figure that out. We should figure that  out so we can do better next time, but we should not--we cannot--let  anger and pique over process and politics cloud what is clearly the  right thing to do here.   I hear there are conversations going on in the Judiciary Committee  right now about slowing down and starting investigations. I am hopeful  that those end up leading us to being able to do our jobs. No one  should want those allegations hanging out there or should want the  investigations to happen and information to come out while he is on the  Court.   Let's slow down. Let's learn more. Let's not put a man on the Supreme  Court with these allegations swirling around him while we still have  the opportunity to clear this up and get it right.   Finally, I want to say one more thing right now to women and  survivors who are angry, who are dispirited, who have reached out to me  and told me they are shocked; they are crying; they are in disbelief.  To them, I say we all have a right to these tears, but we all have a  duty not to give up. I am not giving up. I am not going to give up this  fight of making sure that women who bravely come forward are not  ignored, swept under the rug, or silenced by powerful men. I know that  I stand with millions and millions of women and men across the country  who are watching the U.S. Senate very closely right now and that they  are not going to give up either.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of this week  as Malnutrition Awareness Week.   Malnutrition Awareness Week is a multi-organizational, multipronged  campaign that aims to educate healthcare professionals on how to  identify and treat malnutrition, encourage patients to discuss their  nutrition status with their healthcare providers, and increase  awareness of nutrition's role in patient recovery.   While we know malnutrition can severely impact patients' health  outcomes, we do not currently know the full extent of malnutrition  plaguing our senior population. This is because national health surveys  and indicators do not include screening measures for malnutrition.  National surveys and indicators are crucial not only for identifying  key issues, such as malnutrition, but also for shaping public health  programs and guiding healthcare professionals. By fully understanding  the health problem, we can refine these tools to better address health  issues affecting older adults.   Similarly, older adults and their families need guidance on how to  meet seniors' unique nutrition needs. National dietary guidelines,  developed every 5 years by the Departments of Health and Human Services  and of Agriculture, provide valuable information to the public in  regard to a healthy diet. These guidelines are examples of Federal  resources that could be tailored to reflect the nutritional needs of  specific populations, such as older adults.   Since malnutrition can lead to greater risk of chronic disease,  frailty, disability, and increases in health care costs, it is  important to properly identify cases and provide adequate  interventions, even as people transition across care settings. To  strive toward this goal, we must consider options within the healthcare  system and our Federal programs to improve care and nutritional support  for older adults.   This week is an important opportunity to remember that the  nutritional challenges facing people of all ages, and I hope my  colleagues will join me in working to understand and address these  challenges.                            ____________________
