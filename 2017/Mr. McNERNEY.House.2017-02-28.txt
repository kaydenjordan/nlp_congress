 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment is straightforward. It  exempts from the bill any agency rule relating to the physical and  cybersecurity of the bulk power system, including any emergency action  to protect and restore reliability. The bulk power system is comprised  of facilities and control systems necessary for operating an  interconnected electrical transmission network to maintain reliability.   Our Nation's electrical system touches each and every part of our  lives, hospitals, schools, transportation, homes, businesses, and our  national security. Our electrical system is the central element of our  Nation's critical infrastructure because all other components of our  infrastructure depend on it.   The electrical system is composed of 640,000 miles of high-voltage  transmission lines and more than 6 million miles of distribution lines.  This network is undergoing a transformation. There are an ever- increasing number of devices that are connected to the grid;  technological advancements are allowing for efficiencies and cheaper  production of power, whether it is renewable energy or natural gas; and  consumers have more choices and more control. With increased  digitization, automation and interaction also have enhanced grid  flexibility and security.   While these developments present tremendous opportunities, such as  new jobs and reducing carbon emissions, they also pose additional  physical and cyber threats to the transmission and distribution  systems. Stakeholders across the system are facing numerous new threats  and challenges in detecting problems, responding to intrusions, and  keeping rates affordable while maintaining reliability. The long-term  health of the electricity sector is now, more than ever, a shared  responsibility between communities, consumers, industry, and  government.   Despite these challenges, the bulk power system is an example of  industry stakeholders and the Federal Government working well together,  when needed, and working independently, when needed and succeeding.   Transmission and distribution providers have taken it upon themselves  to establish industry-led standards, best practices, and supply chain  management when it comes to grid security. They have worked well with  NERC and FERC in developing Critical Infrastructure Protection  standards for the bulk power system.   These Critical Infrastructure Protection standards cover critical  cyber asset identification, security management, personnel and  training, electronic security, physical security, systems security,  incident reporting and response planning, and recovery plans. There are  72 inactive CIP standards, and 11 that are now subject to enforcement.  These standards aren't always perfect, but they do represent compromise  and collaboration.   A well-protected and reliable grid makes economic sense. Power  outages and disturbances can cost more than $180 billion annually, and  data suggests that electrical system outages attributable to weather- related events are increasing, costing the U.S. economy an estimated  $20 billion to $55 billion annually. Electric companies are projected  to spend more than $7 billion of their own money on cybersecurity alone  by the year 2020, and are expected to invest nearly $53 billion to  enhance the grid.                                time  1530    These are significant investments, but essential investments as well.  A more resilient, secure electric sector is something we all benefit  from. It will continue to require investments at all levels, including  from the Federal Government.   We should enhance funding for our national laboratories that have  partnered together via the Grid Modernization Lab Consortium. We should  provide high levels of funding for the Office of Electricity and its  mission to ensure the energy delivery system is more secure, resilient,  and reliable. We must promote R&D that helps bring new, innovative  technologies to the grid.   We will always struggle to keep ahead of those bad actors who are  seeking to attack us, but we can establish metrics, procedures, and  technological capabilities that allow us to respond and adapt.   I agree with many of my colleagues that we should work to identify  and remove regulations that are no longer relevant. The Critical  Infrastructure Protection standards have worked. My amendment ensures  that Federal agencies will have the flexibility needed to respond to  challenges without sacrificing any other necessary protections.   I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
