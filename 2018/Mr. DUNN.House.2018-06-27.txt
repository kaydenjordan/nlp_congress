 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the hardworking  people of Eastpoint, Florida, who lost their homes, their belongings,  and even their livelihoods to a devastating fire this week.   This past weekend a fire broke out in Franklin County, which  destroyed more than 40 homes and almost 1,000 acres. My heart goes out  to those whose lives have been forever changed by this horrible and  unexpected wildfire. My office stands ready to assist them in any way  we can.   Thank you to all of our first responders, volunteer firefighters, and  local law enforcement for your heroic efforts in containing this blaze.  Your quick actions saved many lives.   Thank you also to Franklin County Sheriff, A. J. ``Tony'' Smith,  Franklin County Emergency Management Director Pam Brownell, local  community leaders, the Salvation Army, and the American Red Cross, all  of whom stepped up and provided aid and comfort to those who need it  the most.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in praying for the victims and their  families during this time of loss.                            ____________________
