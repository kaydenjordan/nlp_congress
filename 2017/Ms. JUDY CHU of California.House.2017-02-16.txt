 Mr. Speaker, this week, after news came  out that General Flynn lied to the people and even to the Vice  President, Donald Trump was forced to fire yet another adviser because  of their inappropriate ties to Russia.   That brings the total since he first launched his campaign to at  least three. This includes former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who  resigned after secret records showed he worked with, and profited from,  the corrupt pro-Russian Government in Ukraine before it was ousted.   As we suspected, it turns out that Trump's campaign was in near  constant contact with Russia.   Now we ask the questions: Why? Did Trump know? How will these secret  talks influence our foreign policy?   We deserve answers. Republicans have said that they don't want to  politicize this, and I agree. That is why I support an independent  investigation conducted by experts who will provide a more public  report.   We have a responsibility to the people to unearth the truth.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong  opposition to H.J. Res. 43. This bill is another in a long line of  attacks on women's health, women's choices, and women's lives.   For 50 years, title X has been the only federally funded program  dedicated to providing comprehensive family planning services for low- income patients. Thanks to title X, these women have gained access to  services like birth control, STD testing, cancer screenings,  counseling, and sex education.   For most of its history, title X has received broad, bipartisan  support from Congress. That is because it has helped millions of women  and families. But now, Republicans are using this longstanding program  to continue their attack on women's health.   Last year, Republicans eliminated title X funding from their budget  altogether. This bill is just the latest attempt to do the same thing  by putting family planning resources out of reach for poor women across  the country. We cannot let this happen. We cannot let healthy  pregnancies and healthy families become a luxury reserved only for the  wealthy. It must remain a right for all.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution.
