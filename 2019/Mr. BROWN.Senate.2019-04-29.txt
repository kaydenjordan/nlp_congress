 Mr. President, over the past few weeks, we have learned  more and more about the President's pick, Stephen Moore, for the  Federal Reserve.   We now know he has made all kinds of offensive, disparaging comments  about women, even about women who play sports. He has even questioned  women who are in broadcast booths. We know he is against child labor  laws. He thinks we should have 11-year-olds working. He has said that  he wants people to start working at 11, at 12. He has said he is a  radical in this.   Think about this. The President is about to nominate for the Federal  Reserve a gentleman who says he is an economist but who really isn't.  He didn't get his degree and didn't get a Ph.D. in economics, as  Federal Reserve people often do. Yet put that aside.   He said: I am a radical in child labor. I mean, who thinks that way  in the year 2019?   Other things we know, he was banned from the op-ed page of the Kansas  City Star after publishing an editorial with all kinds of factual  errors. See, the editor knew he was a conservative. The editor may have  been a conservative. I don't know. That is not the point. The point is  it was filled with factual errors, and the editor said: Those kinds of  factual errors are just unacceptable. We are finished with him--not  that the editor doesn't agree with certain viewpoints, but she just  said: We are not running him anymore because he doesn't tell the truth.   We have him on videotape showing breathtaking contempt for people in  the middle of the country, from places like Arkansas and Kentucky and  Tennessee and my State of Ohio. Here is what Mr. Moore said, and it is  on tape and many people have seen it:         If you want to live in the Midwest, where else do you want       to live besides Chicago? You don't want to live in       Cincinnati--    The home of Senator Portman--         or Cleveland.    My home. He said:         You don't want to live in Cincinnati or Cleveland or these       armpits of America.    That is what he said.   President Trump is showing his disregard for Cincinnati and Cleveland  and Kentucky and Arkansas and Tennessee and the middle of the country  by nominating someone who is so out of touch and has such contempt for  the middle of this country. ``The armpits of America'' is what he  called two of my State's great cities.   Make no mistake, he wasn't just insulting Cleveland and Cincinnati;  he was insulting Little Rock; he was insulting Nashville; he was  insulting people who get up every day and work hard. He was dismissing  millions of Americans. He was undermining the dignity of work by  dismissing them, people who have been ignored by Washington and have  been preyed upon by Wall Street.   Across the industrial heartland, tens of millions of Americans raise  families; they serve in our military; they power our companies; they  contribute to our country.   Mr. Moore, how dare you demean them and diminish them with those  kinds of comments? How dare you insult them and their hometowns?   You can't fight for these Americans when you don't know the first  thing about the places they live. You don't understand that all work  has dignity. You don't understand the dignity of work. You don't  understand honoring and respecting work.   It is particularly ironic where Mr. Moore made these comments. He was  speaking at an event sponsored by a think tank called the Heartland  Institute, located, I believe, in Chicago. Can you believe that?   Take a look at who is really behind this group, the Heartland group.  I mean, people can name themselves whatever they want. They call  themselves the Heartland Institute, but they are funded by ExxonMobil,  the biggest oil company, I believe, in the world. They are funded by  Philip Morris, one of the tobacco giants--Big Tobacco--that poisons our  children. Four hundred eighty thousand people die every year from  tobacco in this country--480,000 people. You know what that means? It  means Philip Morris has to find 1,300 new customers every day just to  make up for the people tobacco has killed.   So the Heartland Institute is funded by ExxonMobil; it is funded by  Philip Morris; it is funded by the Koch brothers--or at least we used  to know they were funded by these groups.   Today, unfortunately, they don't disclose who their individual donors  are, which is pretty shocking. The Heartland Institute didn't want  people in the actual heartland to realize they are nothing but a  corporate front--a corporate, special interest-funded front.   What have they done with those donations? Well, you can expect them  to do the bidding of ExxonMobil; you can expect them to do the bidding  of Philip Morris; you can expect them to do the bidding of the Koch  brothers, and those interest groups have certainly gotten their money's  worth.   The Heartland Institute has pushed junk science on behalf of tobacco  companies to try to block and stop and neuter anti-smoking public  health laws.   As recently as the late 1990s, their president wrote an op-ed. I  mean, this isn't really funny at all. I don't know why I laughed, but  it is so ridiculous. The president of that group wrote an op-ed  claiming that moderate smoking--moderate smoking--doesn't raise your  risk of lung cancer. You know, getting those 15-years-olds to start  smoking only a little bit, I guess that is OK because that doesn't  increase their chance of lung cancer. That is their notable  achievement.   So, of course, we shouldn't be surprised that the men in the room-- and it was almost all men. You could tell from the video and the audio  that the men in the room, when Mr. Moore talked about my city,  Cleveland, Senator Portman's city, Cincinnati, talked about them being  armpits of the Nation, the men in the room howled with laughter because  look who comes to the Heartland Institute. It is a bunch of lobbyists,  a bunch of drug company people, a bunch of oil company men, a bunch of  tobacco men, a bunch of gun lobby people. All these people who come to  the Heartland Institute, of course, they were laughing at those people  in the industrial Midwest, in Cleveland, in Mansfield, in Toledo, in  Zanesville, and all over our country. That is what these phony,  rightwing, tobacco-funded think tanks really think of America's  heartland.   President Trump likes to pretend he cares about people in places like  Cincinnati and Cleveland. He likes to  [[Page S2479]]  make big promises to the people in the heartland, but look at whom he  puts in charge--these conservative elites. Make no mistake, they are  far-right conservatives, and they are elites. They all think they are  better than the rest of the country. These conservative elites, whether  they are on Wall Street, whether they are in Trump Tower, whether they  are at the White House, where the White House looks like a retreat for  Wall Street executives, whether these conservative elites are going in  and out of the office doors of the Senate majority leader with their  requests for tax cuts in hand, these are people who have contempt for  the people they are supposed to serve.   Stephen Moore says he doesn't want to be judged on all the extreme  and offensive articles he has written; he wants to be judged by his  economic record.   So let's do that. Let's look at his economic record. It is just as  bad. It is in line with views of all these rightwing elites. It stems  directly from contempt for ordinary people. You see it in their  policies: Make it easier for Wall Street to pay these huge--$1 million,  $2 million, $5 million, $10 million--bonuses that Wall Street elites  get, so often at the expense of workers.   I was at my high school reunion in Mansfield, OH, some time ago. I  sat across the table from a woman who had worked at one of America's  largest banks. When I grew up and I used to put my family farm paycheck  into this bank, it was called Farmers Bank in those days. It has been  bought and sold and bought by other bigger banks. The point is, she had  worked as a teller in this bank for 30 years. She was making $30,000 a  year. Yet Wall Street continues giving million-dollar bonuses, massive  tax cuts for corporations, for billionaires and pennies for working  families.   Look at what happened in Kansas, where Stephen Moore was banned from  writing in the newspaper because he lied so much. He helped design the  tax cut boondoggle that bankrupted the State. It was the plan that  eliminated taxes entirely for LLCs and passthrough corporations. The  people who paid the price were millions of ordinary Kansans. There was  no money for teachers. There was no money for healthcare. There was no  money for higher ed.   When Republicans in the State finally rebelled and repealed that  Stephen Moore far-right tax plan, Kansas had fallen behind the rest of  the country. They were actually losing jobs in Kansas, a once  prosperous State, while almost every other State was adding them.   One advocate in Kansas who saw his work up close said: ``I wouldn't  let Stephen Moore within 100 yards of my enemy's piggy bank, let alone  put him on the Federal Reserve.''   So why on Earth would we want to hire that guy to help run our  national economy? It is pretty clear that creating jobs for workers in  the heartland doesn't really matter to Stephen Moore and his crowd.  After all, they don't even want to set foot there.   It comes back to the dignity of work. We need people in office who  understand, who respect work. Whether you punch a clock or swipe a  badge, whether you work on a salary, whether you work for tips, whether  you are raising children, whether you are taking care of an aging  parent, it comes down to honoring and respecting work--something  apparently Stephen Moore and his far-right elitist crowd know nothing  about.   The last thing we need is another conservative elitist looking down  his nose at American workers, at Ohio workers, at workers in Arkansas,  at workers all across this country.
