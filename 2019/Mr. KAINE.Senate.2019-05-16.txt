 Mr. President. the U.S. infrastructure system is in  critical need of an upgrade. The American Society of Civil Engineers  recently graded the U.S. system a D+ given its capacity, condition,  funding, future need, operation and maintenance, public safety,  resilience and innovation. Any investment to improve our country's  infrastructure system would create millions of new jobs, requiring  millions of skilled workers to fill them.   A recent study by the Center of Education and the Workforce at  Georgetown University estimated that a $1 trillion infrastructure  investment would create 11 million new jobs. Nearly half of these would  require training past the high school level. Even without a significant  investment, though, infrastructure industries are already struggling to  meet workforce demands. Workers in infrastructure industries are  expected to retire at a 50% higher rate than the general workforce. To  ensure infrastructure investments benefit businesses, workers and the  economy, the U.S. must invest in the creation of a diverse pipeline of  workers with skills necessary to access in-demand opportunities.   Industry and sector partnerships are a proven strategy for helping  workers prepare for middle-skill jobs and helping businesses find  skilled workers. Congress requires States and local areas to support  the development of these partnerships under the Workforce Innovation  and Opportunity Act (WIOA), but no dedicated funding has been provided  for these activities. According to a recent national poll, 77% of  business leaders say it would help their business to create closer  links between education providers and businesses to train people for  the jobs for which businesses are hiring.   For workers, especially those underrepresented in infrastructure  industries, support services like career counseling, child care, and  transportation can often be the key to succeed in work-based learning  programs. Providing these services may be outside the capacity of a  business. Industry partnerships bring business together with community  and human service organizations that can make these connections for  workers and drastically improve their ability to succeed in training  and meet business demand for skilled workers.   This is why I am pleased to introduce with my colleague, Senator  Portman, the Building U.S. Infrastructure by Leveraging Demands for  Skills Act or BUILDS Act. The BUILDS Act creates a grant program that  would support industry and sector partnerships working with local  businesses, industry associations and organizations, labor  organizations, State and local workforce boards, economic development  agencies and other partners engaged in their communities to encourage  industry growth, competitiveness and collaboration to improve worker  training, retention and advancement in targeted infrastructure  clusters. Additionally, businesses and education providers would be  connected to develop classroom curriculum to complement on-the-job  learning and workers would receive support services such as mentoring  and career counseling to ensure that they are successful from the pre- employment to placement in a full-time position.   Our Nation desperately needs improvements to critical infrastructure  like our roads and bridges, however to do that work we must have a  trained workforce that's ready to fill these good-paying jobs. Virginia  businesses in the transportation, maritime, and information technology  industries continue to tell me they have trouble finding job applicants  with the necessary skills. This bill will help workers get the job  training they need to be hired. I hope that my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle consider the BUILDS Act as a necessary component to any  investment in our Nation's infrastructure.                            ____________________     Mr. President. the U.S. infrastructure system is in  critical need of an upgrade.
