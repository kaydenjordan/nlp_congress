 Mr. Speaker, all of us are anxious to go home to our  families and our celebrations, but more and more Americans are seeing  every single day, particularly in the last couple days, just how messed  up the values and priorities of the Republican majority really are.   They saw the Republicans go off to the White House and high-fiving  and cheering each other for a tax cut that provides 81 percent of its  benefits to the wealthiest Americans and that blows about a $1.5- trillion hole in the budget. That means debt and deficit.   Who is left with the coal in the stocking?   We are looking at 9 million children and their parents who are sick,  who have been worrying about how they are going to have the Children's  Health Insurance Program. Yes, we extended it now until March. It  expired in September, but we didn't have time for those children.   We don't have time for the 800,000 young people who are serving this  country right now as DACA recipients. We could pass the Dream Act  today. Let's get our values straight. Let's do better than we are.
