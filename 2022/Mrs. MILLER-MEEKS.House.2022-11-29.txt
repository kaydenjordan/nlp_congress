 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the Biden  administration's self-made energy crisis.   Since taking office, I have been vocal about my commitment to  alternative forms of energy that bring revenue and flexibility to Iowa  and allow Iowa to be a major energy exporter.   However, the Biden administration's policies have relied on foreign  nations instead of prioritizing American energy independence.   Iowans have felt the effect of President Biden's policies. Grocery  and energy prices continue to soar with inflation rates at historic  highs. So while the temperatures drop into the teens, some are forced  to choose between turning on their heat and buying groceries.   According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association,  diesel prices could top $6 per gallon this winter, but Iowa could fill  the gap with biodiesel. Struggling families simply cannot afford  President Biden's energy policies.   I want to reiterate my calls to President Biden to unleash domestic  energy and look towards Iowa as a framework for an any-of-the-above  approach to lower energy costs for Americans.   I also want to wish a very happy birthday to Andy Swanson.                            ____________________
