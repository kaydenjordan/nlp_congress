 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Collin College  Student Government Association for winning the 2019 Event of the Year  award at the Texas Junior College Student Government Association  convention.   The event which earned the organization this prestigious recognition,  ``Love Does Not Hurt: An Oath Against Domestic Violence,'' provided  resources for victims of domestic violence and featured speakers who  inspired all in attendance.   I was honored to attend the event and witness firsthand the  incredible difference these student leaders are making, both on and off  campus.   I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me today  in thanking the Student Government Association of Collin College for  their dedication and commitment to our community.                            ____________________
