 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we learned  last week that the Department of Homeland Security has established a  ``Ministry of Truth.'' They are calling it the Disinformation  Governance Board--how Orwellian.   Now, the details are scarce of this effort, but one would assume that  the DHS Intelligence and Analysis would be part of that effort.   The nominee being considered today was one of the architects of  George W. Bush administrations's bulk metadata collection at the NSA-- what a great recommendation for him. Sarcasm included--which gathered  the private electronic communications of millions of Americans without  warrant.   Is this someone we would want to be involved in the Biden  administrations's new ``Ministry of Truth''?   I will not provide my consent to expanding the surveillance state and  the suppression of First and Fourth Amendment rights of Americans.   I oppose this nominee and object.  [[Page S2258]]
