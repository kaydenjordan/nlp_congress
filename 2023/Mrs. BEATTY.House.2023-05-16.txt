 Mr. Speaker, 43 years ago, the trailblazing Ohioan, a  friend, and founder of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman  Louis Stokes, stood on this very floor and entered into the Record an  extraordinary speech.   It was a speech he had heard by a young, accomplished, talented Black  American, a lawyer, Patricia Russell-McCloud titled, ``If Not You, Who?  If Not Now, When?''   It was a speech with themes that are still very much relevant today:  of what does it mean to be Black in America and the struggle to carve  out a place in society.   I am pleased to say that Patricia Russell-McCloud now lives in Ohio's  Third Congressional District and is one of my constituents, a mentor,  and friend.   I cannot recommend enough that my colleagues refer to the  Congressional Record of May 14, 1980, and seek out her wise and  inspirational words.                            ____________________
