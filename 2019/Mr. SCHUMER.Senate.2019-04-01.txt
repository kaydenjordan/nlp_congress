 Madam President, I will be speaking about rules changes  in a minute, but I heard my friend from Tennessee when he said we will  be faced with a terrible choice.   I would simply say that that choice is being foisted on us by Leader  McConnell and none other. You can't brag about passing more judges than  ever before and then say the process is broken, and we have to change  the rules. There is a total, total--there is a word that begins with  ``h'' that I will not quite say. It ends in ``y.''                                   H.R. 268    Madam President, on Puerto Rico, as the Senate takes up the disaster  package, I want to implore my friends on the Republican side to  remember that Puerto Rico is still recovering from Hurricanes Irma and  Maria. From city to countryside, the entire island has been decimated.  Yet the administration's response to this catastrophe can be summed up  in two words. The administration's response to Puerto Rico can be  summed up in two words: cruel and nasty.   The administration has yet to disburse $20 billion in recovery and  mitigation funds for Puerto Rico that were already appropriated, and  this is more than a year after they were appropriated by Congress.  There is $20 billion sitting there as people suffer.   Bureaucracy has similarly delayed crucial rebuilding projects at  hospitals and schools and stoked real concerns that the administration  is not interested in helping the island rebuild the way Congress  intended.   It should hardly bear repeating, but every single American citizen  deserves a Congress and a President fully committed to providing every  resource necessary to rebuild in the wake of a natural disaster. Our  fellow citizens in Puerto Rico are every bit as much American  citizens--that is by law--as we are. Yet the President seems to want to  treat them differently, cruelly, and nastily.   Now Republican Senators are attempting to strip away recovery funds  from Puerto Rico and other territories from the disaster package that  passed the House. They have even rejected a Democratic effort to speed  up the release of the billions in already allocated funding. Those are  no new appropriations. They have already rejected our efforts to speed  up the release of the billions in already allocated funding that the  Trump administration has locked away in the U.S. Treasury.   Now, because the House passed their disaster bill back in January, it  didn't include any aid to assist those affected by the recent  devastated flooding in the Midwest, but my friend Senator Leahy is  planning to offer an amendment to the House bill that would provide  much needed aid to survivors of those recent disasters because they too  deserve the aid they need to recover.   They said Emperor Nero fiddled while Rome burned. President Trump  tweets while Puerto Rico suffers. I hope my Republican colleagues will  join us in supporting this amendment and voting yes on the House bill  to support all communities that need to rebuild.                                  Healthcare    Madam President, on another matter, last week we were reminded of an  evergreen truth: The Republican Party is still trying to take away the  healthcare of millions of Americans. They are just sick and tired of  being blamed for it, even though the blame falls right on their  shoulders.   Just this morning, we read that some of my colleagues from across the  aisle have begged Attorney General Barr to reverse the administration's  wild decision to declare our current healthcare law unconstitutional--a  decision that would throw the future of preexisting conditions and  healthcare coverage for millions into doubt.   I have a better idea. If Republican colleagues truly oppose this  decision, they can work with their leadership and come down and offer  some solutions. Stop with the backroom phone calls. Stop waiting for  someone else to bail you out. Stop whispering: Oh, President Trump,  don't do it and then be afraid to buck him publicly because Americans  are depending on their healthcare.   This is a fiasco that Republicans spent years in making as they tried  to keep voting on repeal and replace and couldn't come up with a  replace. Everyone knows it. It helped shape the elections of 2018. It  will be on the minds of voters in 2020.   You know, facts are stubborn things. If the Republican Party is truly  sick of getting blamed for standing between Americans and their  healthcare, maybe they shouldn't have voted again and again to repeal  the Affordable Care Act. Maybe they shouldn't have voted to allow the  President to sabotage, piece after piece, the healthcare net we have  provided for people.   If our Republican colleagues are sick of blame, maybe they shouldn't  have given this administration the green light to sabotage the  exchanges and cut funding for programs that help people get covered and  protect them from preexisting conditions.   If Republicans are really sick of getting blamed for sabotaging the  American healthcare system, then, let me provide some friendly advice  from across the aisle: Stop sabotaging the American people's  healthcare.   Republicans can try to hide from their record, but the American  people aren't fooled. Healthcare has been a defining issue for  Republicans for generations. In the same way that the party has sworn  fealty to tax cuts for the rich and handicapping the government, the  modern Republican Party now swears fidelity to the cause of higher  healthcare costs and diminished coverage for tens of millions of  American citizens.   Tomorrow Senate Democrats will join our colleagues in the House to  take action for ourselves against the Department of Justice's war on  healthcare. We will set the record straight on the Republican's effort  to steamroll American families who enjoy coverage for the first time  thanks to this law. We will make clear that unless Republicans join us  in taking action, they will continue to own this mess--and a sorry mess  it is--when people's lives and health are at stake and our Republican  colleagues do nothing--nothing--but make it worse.                                 Nominations    Madam President, on another matter, one of the Senate's core  responsibilities is vetting any and all of the President's nominees.  Unfortunately, if we have learned anything in the last 2 years, it is  that this administration seems far too often willing to put nominees  forward to the Senate without performing due diligence and careful  background checks.   Just last week, we learned that the President's choice for the  Federal Reserve Board of Governors may have serious personal financial  issues. That is just the latest in a long line of red  [[Page S2109]]  flags in the records of Trump nominees. It is clear that we cannot  falter in our role as a check on the administration.   So I was bemused this morning to read the Republican leader's case  that the Senate needs to speed up President Trump's nominees to an even  faster pace. Is this the majority leader's idea of an April fool's  joke? Was his op-ed his April fool's joke on the Senate, on  bipartisanship, and on America? It is the most ridiculous thing in  print since Sidd Finch.   This is the double standard to trump all double standards. It is  simply galling--galling--for the Republican leader to say that we  aren't moving fast enough. When Barack Obama was President, qualified  nominees languished to the detriment of our government. Take the  example of Richard Cordray. For no good reason, he waited 729 days,  more than 2 years, to be confirmed to lead the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, and he was hardly an exception.   Of course, because of Republican obstruction in what the Republican  leader called one of his ``proudest moments,'' the Republican-led  Senate refused to even consider Merrick Garland's nomination to the  Supreme Court for nearly a calendar year.   But now, under President Trump, Leader McConnell has sung a different  tune. Overnight, he has become a reformer in the cause of Trumpism.  Working hand-in-hand with the Federalist Society, the Republican leader  became, in the words of his own adviser, the principal enabler of the  Trump agenda. At Leader McConnell's command, Republicans ended the blue  slip rules for circuit court nominees and even refused to confirm  Democratic nominees for bipartisan Boards and Commissions like the SEC  and the NLRB. With these moves, the Republican leader has driven a  stake further into the heart of comity and bipartisanship in the  Senate.   Now, despite openly bragging about the number of Trump judges that he  has led the Senate to confirm, Leader McConnell demands that the rules  of the Senate be changed to speed up confirmation. On the one hand,  there is too much obstruction. On the other, we proved we supported a  record amount of judges and gotten them through.   Leader McConnell, you can't have it both ways. You can't have it both  ways. Everyone sees through that.   The Senate needs to do its job. We should not be a conveyor belt for  President Trump's radical and unqualified judicial nominees. So let's  call this for what it is. This rules change is yet another power grab  by Leader McConnell, the Republican Party, and its rightwing allies. It  is a transparent attempt to further politicize our courts by packing  them with President Trump's hard-right, ideological, and too-often  unqualified nominees, and we will not be complicit in the Republican  leader's games, which sacrifice much of the comity and bipartisanship  that this Senate used to represent.                             Security Clearances    Madam President, on a final matter, I was extremely troubled to see  yet another report that this administration repeatedly overruled career  officials to provide security clearances to Trump officials, despite  concerns about even blackmail and foreign influence.   Our Nation's intelligence must be protected. That is why 3 weeks ago  Vice Chairman Warner and Ranking Members Feinstein, Menendez, and Reed  called for a thorough review of compliance with security clearance  policies and procedures. The Trump administration has flouted these  rules again and again. The American people deserve some answers.   Where are the leaders of our intelligence community? Where is the  inspector general of the intelligence community? Why would our  Republican counterparts not let us confirm the Nation's top  counterintelligence official? Director Coats and the relevant inspector  general must investigate these allegations immediately and take  whatever steps are necessary to protect our national security. This  cannot wait a moment longer.   I yield the floor.    Will my colleague yield for a brief comment?    I have every confidence that if my friend from Georgia  were running the Senate, we wouldn't be in this pickle.   I yield to him.                                   H.R. 268
