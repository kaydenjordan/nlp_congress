 Madam Speaker, just over 2 months ago, a man walked into  an Allina Health clinic in Buffalo, Minnesota, and opened fire, killing  one employee and injuring four others.   On that tragic day, nurses, doctors, social workers, and others were  reportedly targeted because of their professions.   Tragically, this senseless and horrific act of violence is  representative of a broader trend in our society. Today, members of the  healthcare workforce are five times as likely to suffer a workplace  injury than Americans in other professions.   Madam Speaker, what in the hell are we doing in Congress if we are  not going to stand up and do anything for our healthcare heroes and  those workers?   My colleagues who vote against this bill are ignoring the pleas of  the EMTs, the emergency workers, and all of those folks who have been  on the front lines of this healthcare pandemic.    Madam Speaker, it is our responsibility to step forward  and help protect our workers. It is beyond the pale to put our heads in  the sand, as Members of Congress, and say there is nothing that we can  do. What the hell are we doing here if we do that?
