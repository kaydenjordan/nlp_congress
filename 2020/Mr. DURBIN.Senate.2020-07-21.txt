 Madam President, John Lewis was a great American, but  there was a humility in his heart that showed his greatness even more,  and he gave speeches that stirred a nation. Who among us can forget his  trademark speech of explaining how, as a young man, growing up on a  farm, he practiced public speaking to an audience of chickens? He told  that story over and over again.   John Lewis used to say, ``People come up to me in the airport, and  they say, `I'm going to cry. I'm going to pass out.' ''   John's reply was, ``Please, don't pass out; I'm not a doctor.''   John Lewis was a healer and a balm for troubled souls. I was struck  by an article in the Atlanta newspaper that talked about an incident  that occurred in January of 2009.   A former Ku Klux Klan member, Elwin Wilson, confessed to being part  of the White mob that had bloodied John Lewis and other Freedom Riders  in Rock Hill, SC, nearly 48 years before. Lewis noted in his 2012 book  ``Across That Bridge'' that Wilson was the first of his attackers to  apologize for his actions. Wilson traveled to Washington a short while  later to meet Lewis face-to-face and ask for forgiveness.   ``Without a moment of hesitation, I looked back at him and said, `I  accept your apology,' '' John Lewis wrote.   This was a great testament to the power of love to overcome hatred.   John Lewis had another incident that I thought was worth mentioning  this morning, as well, that was another example of the forgiveness.   Kevin Murphy wasn't born until a year after John Lewis was knocked  unconscious by a blow from a wooden Coca-Cola crate in 1961 after the  Freedom Riders pulled into the bus station in Montgomery, AL. As the  city's police chief in 2013, Mr. Murphy wanted to issue an apology for  the officers who declined to step in as a White mob descended on Lewis  and his bus-riding colleagues. So, when Lewis and other dignitaries  assembled at Montgomery's First Baptist Church to commemorate the  event, Murphy walked to the microphone and offered Lewis what was long  a symbol of oppression for many African Americans--his police badge.  Murphy told Lewis he hoped it would serve as a token of reconciliation.   ``I often said, when I started going up through the ranks, that if I  had a chance--if I ever became police chief--that I was going to try to  right that wrong,'' said Murphy during an interview--now the deputy  sheriff for Montgomery County, AL. He went on to say: ``A lot of my  peers didn't want to talk about it. They didn't want to face the  truth.''   Because of that gesture, John Lewis and Kevin Murphy struck up a  friendship, and John Lewis invited Murphy to the White House to meet  President Barack Obama. Then the two of them, both Lewis and Murphy,  traveled to Ireland and Northern Ireland to talk with Catholics and  Protestants about bridging the religious divide.   Murphy said he was awed by Lewis's capacity to walk through the world  with an open heart. You can just tell, with everything he had been  through, that he wasn't a bitter man. He truly had tried to put a lot  of what happened--the injustices--behind him. That was John Lewis.   It is a miracle that he didn't die when angry Klansmen and their  sympathizers torched the bus that carried a young John Lewis and other  Freedom Riders near Anniston, AL, in 1961. It is amazing that he  survived the Edmund Pettus Bridge, on Bloody Sunday in 1965, when the  Alabama State troopers nearly beat him to death. Clearly, there was a  purpose in his life that had to be served.   I had the honor to serve with Congressman Lewis in the House for 10  years, and I called him my friend for nearly 40 years. For a man who  had witnessed the depths of hatred and despair, John Lewis was one of  the most hopeful people I had ever met. He once said the only time he  came close to giving up was after the murder of Robert Kennedy in 1968.  Martin Luther King had been assassinated 2 months earlier. So when  Bobby Kennedy died, it seemed for a few weeks that any hope for justice  and equality had died too. That is what John Lewis said. Yet he didn't  allow despair to overcome him. He didn't spend his life hoping for  better; he spent his life making the world better. He still had hope,  and he had a profound belief in the future of this Nation.   I was reminded this weekend of a story that captured so well John  Lewis's humility and his enormous redemptive influence on America. It  was January 20, 2009--a day I will never forget. Barack Obama was sworn  in to be the first African-American President of the United States. As  he was leaving the podium, John Lewis stepped forward to the new  President and asked him to sign his inauguration program. The President  hesitated, pulled out a pen, and wrote the following inscription:  ``Because of you, John. Barack Obama.'   John Lewis was an icon of the American civil rights movement. If he  had confined his life's work to only ending racial injustice, he would  have still been in the pantheon of heroes, but his vision and faith  were bigger than justice for just one group. His commitment was to  genuine democracy and equality. He said so many times: ``You cannot  build a wall when it comes to equality; it must be equality for all and  not for some.'' He told us: ``We must be headlights, not taillights.''  For John, being a headlight meant going out ahead and shining a light  so that we could see the people living in the cold shadows of  discrimination and bring them into the warmth of America's promise.   He challenged us always to expand our concepts of justice and  equality--as he said, ``to respect the dignity and worth of every human  being, Black or White, Latino or Asian, immigrant to Native American,  gay, straight, Muslims, Christians, Jews.'' John spoke for all of them.  How many times did he tell us: ``We are one people, one family; we live  in one house''?   One of the great injustices for our times was overly harsh drug laws.  It was a measure passed in the 1980s and 1990s that disproportionately  harmed people and communities of color. Many of us worked for years to  replace those biased laws. John Lewis was deeply committed to our  cause.   About 2 years ago, a proposal was offered that would have shifted the  focus of our efforts and really walked away from a commitment to  criminal sentencing reform. It was John Lewis who stepped up. His  steadfast insistence made a difference, and it resulted in having the  FIRST STEP Act being signed into law.   Rosa Parks was one of John Lewis's heroes. When she died in October  2005, her body lay in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. Tens of  thousands of people filed past to pay their respects to this great  heroine of justice who had the courage to refuse to sit in the  segregated portion of that bus. They came all night and all the next  morning.   Late at night, John Lewis walked quietly into the Rotunda. He waited  in line with every other mourner. Accompanying him were a handful of  blind men and women who were using white canes. That was John Lewis,  showing the way by quiet and powerful example. He showed us that the  promise of America is the promise of dignity for everyone. In John's  eyes, none of us is free until all of us are free.   Born in rural Troy, AL, the son and grandson of sharecroppers, he saw  the injustice of Jim Crow even when he was a young boy. When he was 15,  he discovered a man who became an iconic leader and his personal  mentor. At that age, John bought a comic book entitled ``Martin Luther  King and the Montgomery Story.'' It was 14 pages long, and it cost him  a dime, but it touched his heart and inspired his life. That thin dime  had yielded arguably the greatest return on investment of any purchase  in the history of our Nation.   Now we are asked, how should we honor this man?  [[Page S4313]]    It was a little over 10 years ago that I joined the Faith & Politics  pilgrimage and made a trip to Alabama. It was a weekend that John had  led for so many years wherein we visited the shrines of the American  civil rights movements. We saw the monument and tribute to Rosa Parks,  and we went to the church where those little girls were killed in  Birmingham. Unfortunately, my schedule was such that I had to leave  before we actually visited Selma, which was to occur at 12 noon on  Sunday.   I went to John and said: I am sorry I can't be there, as I have  always wanted to be on that Selma bridge and to hear your story in your  own words.   He said: You have got to come. We will make a special trip. I will  meet you in the lobby of the hotel at 6:30 in the morning, and we will  drive over and see it. I will take you on that tour.   How could I possibly say no?   I said: I will be there in the lobby. Let's go.   And off we went.   We talked all the way over about his memories of what led to that  march in Selma. He was the one who told me personally how Federal Judge  Frank Johnson had often been overlooked but that if it were not for his  rulings that had allowed that march to go forward, it might never have  happened.   It was an inspirational visit for me to be there in the early Sunday  morning hours on that misty day, standing at the end of the Edmund  Pettus Bridge, right next to John Lewis. He pointed down, just at the  foot of the bridge, and said:         That's where I fell. That's where they hit me.    There is a lot of talk about what to do next to honor John Lewis.  There has been talk of renaming the Edmund Pettus Bridge in his honor.  I am not opposed to that. I think that humble bridge is becoming a  defining piece of American history. Yet John Lewis did not risk his  life on Bloody Sunday for the right to rename a bridge; he risked his  life for the right of every man and woman in America to vote and to  have a voice in our democracy. John said so many times that the right  to vote is precious, that it is almost sacred, and that it is the most  powerful, nonviolent tool we have.   The Voting Rights Act of 1965 has been weakened and whittled down by  recent Supreme Court and other court decisions and by the actions of  this Department of Justice. In December, the House of Representatives  voted to restore the Voting Rights Act. John Lewis presided over the  U.S. House of Representatives on the day of that important vote. That  bill to restore the Voting Rights Act has been sitting on Senator  McConnell's desk for more than 225 days.   Words of praise for John Lewis are fine, but they are not enough.  This Senate should honor the life and the sacrifice of John Lewis by  voting to restore the Voting Rights Act. There are some who are trying  mightily to diminish American's faith in our democracy and our  elections. We can honor John Lewis by protecting the right to vote.  Let's do it and do it now.   Let me close with another story I learned about John Lewis this  weekend. We have seen those iconic photos of the 23-year-old John Lewis  as he led those marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 1965--a  young man, dressed in a tan trench coat, with a backpack. John Lewis  had been arrested before for nonviolent protests. He just had a hunch  that he was going to be arrested again that day and jailed, so in his  backpack he had his toothbrush, toothpaste, an apple, an orange, and  two books.   One book was ``The Seven Storey Mountain'' by the Catholic monk and  mystic Thomas Merton. That book spoke about the power of hope to  transform abstract principles into realities that, one day, if  necessary, we would be willing to sacrifice and even die for.   On that day, the other book in John Lewis's backpack was entitled  ``The American Political Tradition.'' It opened with a quote from the  writer John Dos Passos. Here is what it read: ``In times of change and  danger when there is quicksand of fear under men's reasoning, a sense  of continuity with generations gone before can stretch like a lifeline  across the scary present.''   John Lewis was the bridge that connected the civil rights generation  with what we see today in the streets of America--again, a common  effort to make sure we fulfill the promise of equality for everyone.  John Lewis was heartened by the Black Lives Matter movement. His last  public appearance was here in Washington in the area they have reserved  for speaking their minds about this important issue.   In this time of change and loss, may we honor the legacy of John  Lewis and find within us the hope and courage to continue his work, as  he reminded us that the cause of justice and equality is the cause of a  lifetime.                                   Protests    Madam President, let me start by saying that there is no place for  violence or vandalism in the exercise of any constitutional right. The  use of force against peaceful protesters or members of law enforcement  in the reasonable exercise of their responsibilities is unacceptable.   In recent days, President Trump has indicated that he wants to send  Federal agents into cities, including Chicago, to conduct policing  activities that are traditionally handled by local law enforcement.   The Chicago Tribune has reported that the Department of Homeland  Security is developing a plan to send an additional 150 agents to  Chicago as soon as this weekend, although details have not been made  public as to what they are going to do.   I join Governor J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Chicago Mayor Lightfoot  in strongly urging the Trump administration to refrain from taking any  action that resembles what has occurred in Portland, OR. Any  involvement by Federal law enforcement in community policing activity  must be conducted in coordination with and with the approval of local  law enforcement officials. In this time of heightened tension, we  cannot have Federal law enforcement operating at cross-purposes with  local leaders.   In recent days, the Trump administration has deployed Federal law  enforcement agents in the streets of Portland, OR. They have arrived  without any visible identifying information. These Federal agents have  reportedly used excessive force against peaceful protestors and  detained residents in unmarked vehicles. Such conduct is unacceptable  anywhere in the United States and certainly unacceptable in the city of  Chicago and the State of Illinois.   I am joining Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon this week in introducing  legislation to prevent President Trump from taking this action in  Chicago or any other American city. The bill we jointly are offering  would require Federal officers to wear identifying insignia. There is  no place in America for secret police.   The bill also would limit Federal forces to the immediate vicinity of  Federal property unless there has been a written request by local  leadership or the Insurrection Act has been invoked. There is no  question that the Federal Protective Service and other Federal law  enforcement does have the responsibility for Federal facilities, but  what we have seen in Portland has gone far beyond that location and  into the community at large.   Our bill would also prohibit arrests or apprehensions in unmarked  vehicles and render any arrests made in violation of this act unlawful.   How in the world can we explain that in the year 2020, the Trump  administration would follow the example of Vladimir Putin in his  invasion of Ukraine with these so-called green monsters, who would  arrive without any insignia or any indication of whom they were  fighting for? These little green men turned out to be agents of the  Russian Government. We don't need anything like that--even close to  it--in the United States.   Finally, the bill would require notice to the public in the event of  crowd control-related deployments that includes information about the  agencies involved, the number of personnel, and information related to  requests and other details. That is what you come to expect in a  democracy.   In February 2017, Senator Tammy Duckworth and I sent President Trump  a letter suggesting how he could help, how the Federal Government could  come forward to give us assistance in fighting crime and gun violence  in the city of Chicago. The letter noted that public safety is  primarily a  [[Page S4314]]  local responsibility, but the Federal Government can be a partner in  public safety efforts alongside local officials, law enforcement, and  community stakeholders.   We recommended the administration take steps to assist local  violence-prevention efforts, including enhancing Department of Justice  programs that improve community policing; directing the Department of  Justice to promote mentoring and job-training programs for youth and  the formerly incarcerated; improving mentoring and violence-prevention  initiatives and boosting funding for recidivism-reduction programs;  directing the Department of Justice to abide by its commitment to help  implement policing reforms recommended by the Department's Civil Rights  Division; closing the gaps in the FBI gun background check system and  in Federal firearm laws that enable straw purchasers and gun  traffickers to flood Chicago's streets with illicit guns; prioritizing  career and youth training programs to address lack of economic  opportunity; and redirecting resources that are devoted to the  construction of his border wall to making our cities and communities  across the United States safer. That is the way the Trump  administration can show that it really cares about law enforcement in  the city of Chicago and across this Nation and can help us move forward  in reducing the incidence of violence.   I join Mayor Lightfoot in making it clear to President Trump that we  have no need and will not tolerate tyranny by the Federal Government on  the streets of Chicago.   If the President truly wants to cooperate with law enforcement  efforts, we can find ways to find common ground and make it a safer  city together, but sending in secret police with unmarked vehicles to  snatch people off the streets is not only unacceptable, it is un- American                                 Coronavirus    Madam President, I listened carefully to Senator McConnell this  morning as he came to the floor and talked about the situation we  currently face.   Make no mistake--we are still in the midst of this pandemic. COVID-19  is taking its toll on many parts of America. In the last week, more  than 40 different States that decided to open their economies early  have found that it was not a wise decision; that, in fact, many more  people are becoming infected and dying. Over 140,000 have died in the  United States so far, and over 3 million have been infected. I am  afraid that there will be more to follow. I wish that were not the  case. The question is, What can we do?   First, what can we do when it comes to COVID-19?   I listened the other day when Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National  Institutes of Health was interviewed, and he and Dr. Collins have both  been asked, why does it take so long to get results when people go in  for testing for COVID-19? Well, there is no explanation, and there is  no good reason, and, sadly, that delay is causing a problem. People are  uncertain of their status as to whether they are positive or otherwise  for days on end, waiting for the results of the test.   It is time for us to develop a test that is timely in its results and  widely available to Americans. We cannot realistically open the economy  or even conceivably get our schools back to normal until we have that  testing.   Why, then, does the White House resist putting money in the next  COVID-19 bill for the additional testing that is fundamental to the  question of dealing with the future of this COVID-19 virus?   In addition, I am joining with a number of my colleagues--Kirsten  Gillibrand, Michael Bennet, Chris Coons, and others--in an effort to  try to expand the medical and healthcare personnel necessary to make  sure that we finally bring this virus to bay. We are going to try to  include this in the COVID-19 legislation.   I have legislation that Senator Rubio--a Republican from Florida--and  I have cosponsored that would enhance the training of National Health  Service doctors, nurses, and dentists and medical professionals, mental  health counselors and the like. I think our bill is a step forward  because it provides scholarship assistance to those who will pledge  years of service to the National Health Service Corps once they have  graduated and are licensed. We need that.   Chris Coons is talking about expanding the opportunity for Americans  to step forward and serve their Nation doing contact tracing and other  things that are essential. It would create thousands and thousands of  jobs across the United States at a time when we desperately need them  for a cause that we must conquer ultimately.   These are good things to include in this legislation, but there are  more immediate things on the economic side.   Do you realize that this coming Saturday will be the last day we will  be sending out unemployment checks with the Federal supplement that we  voted on on March 26 in the CARES Act? Yes, this week--before next  Sunday--the last check will be mailed because, you see, our effort  under the CARES Act expires on July 31.   The last payment will be made on Saturday, and then what? And then  what? For the millions of Americans who depend on this Federal  supplement to feed their families, pay their rent, pay their mortgage,  pay the utilities, pay their health insurance premiums--what are they  going to do next?   I listened to Senator McConnell say: Well, we are going to have to  take a look at what that is going to be in the future. Well, let's do  it, Senator, but let's do it quickly. Why have we waited? It has been  since March 26 that we have taken up any legislation on the subject,  and we knew this day would come. Why did we wait until the last minute?   Eight weeks ago, the House of Representatives did their measure, the  Heroes Act--one which I think is sound and principled and I would have  supported. Senator McConnell has come to the floor regularly to say it  is so bad, it is inadequate, it is wrong. Yet we still don't have a  proposal from the Republicans, who are the majority in the Senate,  about what they would do to move forward from this point in the next  COVID-19 bill.   One of the areas that I want to address specifically is the fact that  almost 3 months ago--maybe longer--Senator McConnell came to the floor  and said: There is a redline here. If the COVID-19 bill that we are  considering in the future does not include a provision giving  immunity--legal immunity--to businesses across the United States, it  has no chance. We are not going to consider it.   Well, many of us have a lot of questions about this legal immunity  that Senator McConnell is asking for. What is it? How far does it go?  Well, it turns out there was a memo describing it that was leaked to K  Street. That is where the lobbyists' offices are for special interest  groups in Washington. That memo found its way into a newspaper, and we  have read it, and there are still many unanswered questions.   We have been waiting for months for the language--this redline  immunity language that Senator McConnell insists on. He has described  the number of lawsuits and litigation that have been filed under COVID- 19 as being a tsunami, overwhelming in number. Completely false. The  number of claims that have been filed is few across the United States,  with more than 3 million people who have so far been infected.   Should we have a standard of conduct? Of course we should. The Senate  Judiciary Committee, almost 3 weeks ago, had a hearing where a Texas  businessman came forward and said: I want to do the right thing, but  what standard should I be following here? Something local? Something  State? Something Federal? Give me the standard, and I will do my very  best to live up to it.   Well, that sounded like a good-faith effort by a businessperson who  wants customers and employees to be safe when they come into his  establishment. He has every right to ask for that standard, and we have  every responsibility to provide it based not on the politics of the  moment but on public health, on medical certainty, and on science. That  is what the standard should be drawn to, and the notion that any  standard published by anyone--whether by a town, a city, a township, a  county, a State, whatever it might be--is sufficient to absolve any  business from any liability goes way too far. Unfortunately, it is  going to be misused, I am afraid, by those who do not--as this  businessman clearly was not going to do--want to live up to their  responsibility.  [[Page S4315]]    What that Texas businessman said in the Senate Judiciary Committee  gave me a good belief and strong faith that the business community  wants to do the right thing but just wants guidance. It would be  amazing if the CDC and OSHA stepped forward and provided clear,  enforceable standards so that businesses and others across the United  States knew exactly what to do in terms of social distancing and masks  and the like. We need that, but first we need the language from Senator  McConnell. This so-called redline has been promised now for months.  Let's see the details. Let's move forward from there.   The notion of immunity for businesses by any standard that will not  protect employees and customers is unacceptable. It would not make  America safe; it would make the situation even worse.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, a few steps from the Senate Chamber, at  my whip's office, on the credenza behind my desk, is a framed  government document. It is my mother's naturalization certificate. She  was an immigrant to this country. She was brought here at the age of 2  from Lithuania. She lived long enough to see me being sworn in to the  U.S. Senate. I am proud of the fact that I stand here today as the son  of an immigrant. That is my story. It is my family's story. It is  America's story.   I believe immigration has made America the Nation that it is today.  Immigrants are an integral part of our economy, our culture, and our  soul.   In the midst of this deadly coronavirus pandemic, we should never  forget that 1 in 6 healthcare and social service workers--that is 3.1  million people out of 18.7 million--is an immigrant. They risk their  lives every day in the midst of this pandemic for the good of this  Nation. Immigrants are playing this critical role in the battle against  COVID-19. Yet our broken immigration laws do not allow many of them to  fulfill their dreams of finally becoming Americans.   Thousands of immigrant workers, including many health workers, are  suffering because of a serious problem in our immigration system--the  green card backlog. What is a green card? A green card is our  immigration ticket. If you are here as a temporary worker, a green card  or legal permanent resident status allows you to remain in the United  States without having fear of  [[Page S4327]]  deportation and to be on a path toward permanent citizenship in the  United States.   Green cards are critical in the lives of so many who are here on  temporary and work visas. The backlog in this system puts families at  risk of losing their immigration status, as they wait year after weary  year to finally make it through this green card backlog, and it stops  their ability, many times, to participate in the fight against COVID-19  and to work toward building our economy.   Under the current law, there are not nearly enough immigrant visas-- also known as green cards--available each year. The current numbers for  140,000 EB immigrant visas were established in 1990--30 years ago. The  American economy has doubled, but the number of green cards has  remained the same. As a result, immigrants are stuck in a crippling  backlog year after year after year. Close to 5 million future Americans  are in line, waiting for these green cards. Many are working in the  United States on temporary visas while many are waiting overseas and  are separated from their families. Only 226,000 family green cards and  140,000 employment green cards are available each year.   The backlogs are a real hardship on these families who are caught in  this immigration limbo. For example, the children in many of these  families age out and face deportation. How does this happen? Well,  those applying for the green cards also list their spouses and  children. If they have to wait a long period of time and the children  reach the age of 21, they are no longer protected by the parent's  efforts to obtain the green cards, and they can be deported at any  time. For many children who age out and face deportation as they reach  the age of 21, it is a family disaster.   The solution to this green card backlog is eminently clear to anyone  who looks at it: Increase the number of green cards. The number that  might have made sense 30 years ago makes no sense today.   The senior Senator from Utah, Senator Lee, with whom I have worked on  previous legislation, has introduced S. 386, known as the Fairness for  High-Skilled Immigrants Act, to address this issue. I have a basic  concern with this bill, and I have told Senator Lee. S. 386 adds no  additional green cards, and without additional green cards, S. 386 will  not reduce the backlog or the wait.   Here is what the Congressional Research Service says about Senator  Lee's legislation. To all of those following this debate, don't take my  word for it; read the Congressional Research Service's study that was  released on March 26, 2020, entitled the ``Employment-Based Immigration  Backlog.'' What does it write about Senator Lee's bill? It writes:         S. 386 would not reduce future backlogs compared to current       law. . . . The total backlog for all three categories [of       employment visas] would increase from an estimated 915,497       individuals currently to an estimated 2,195,795 individuals       by FY2030. These outcomes would occur whether or not S. 386       is enacted [and here are the operative words] because the       bill maintains the current limit on the number of green cards       issued.    That is the bottom line. If you don't change the number of green  cards and 5 million people are in the queue, waiting for 140,000  employment green cards and 226,000 family green cards, you understand  the math.   Despite my concerns that S. 386 would not work as intended, I agreed  to sit down with Senator Lee and work in good faith to resolve our  differences. Last December, we reached an agreement on an amendment to  his bill that addressed many of these concerns.   I want to be clear. This amendment was far from perfect and not what  I would have written. The biggest problem is that it still does not  increase the number of green cards. As a result, it would not eliminate  the backlog. But it has made a substantial improvement to his original  bill.   Here is how it reads:         It protects immigrants and their families who are stuck in       the backlog. Immigrant workers and their immediate family       members would be allowed to ``early file'' [a provision that       Senator Lee suggested and I accepted] for their green cards.       They would not receive their green cards early, but they       would be able to switch jobs and travel without losing       immigration status.    I thought that was fair. Early filing adds a critical protection that  was not in the original Lee S. 386. It prevents the children of  immigrant workers from aging out of green card eligibility so that they  will not face deportation while they are waiting for green cards.   Our agreement also included a green card set-aside for immigrant  workers who were stuck in the backlog overseas. The amendment would  reserve 4,600 green cards on an annual basis for immigrant workers who  would not be eligible for early filing because they would be outside  the United States. This number is based on the approximate number of  people who apply for employment green cards from overseas each year.   Finally, our agreement would crack down on the abuse of H-1B  temporary work visas. I thought this was going to be an easy provision.  It has turned out to be the real problem in this bill, and let me tell  you why. The amendment prohibits companies from hiring additional H-1B  workers if the companies' workforces have more than 50 employees and if  more than 50 percent are temporary workers. This 50-50 rule is from the  bipartisan H-1B reform bill that I offered with Senator Grassley,  Republican of Iowa. This provision was included in the comprehensive  immigration reform bill, which I voted for and which passed in the  Senate. Senator Lee has said, ``This is a commonsense reform to root  out abuse.''   When most people think of the H-1B visa, they think of well-known  companies--Microsoft, Google--that hire top-notch professionals at top  dollar when no American is available. That is how the program was  supposed to work, but the reality is different. In fact, the top  recipients of H-1B visas are outsourcing companies that use loopholes  in the law to exploit immigrant workers and even offshore American  jobs.   In the most recent year for which data is available, 8 of the top 10  recipients of new H-1B visas were outsourcing companies. The vice  president of one of them, Tata--one of the leading firms--candidly  acknowledged that it uses H-1Bs to exploit immigrant workers.   He said:         Our wage per employee is 20-25 percent lesser than the U.S.       wage for a similar employee. . . . The issue is that of       getting workers in the U.S. on wages far lower than local       wage.    It is important to understand that the vast majority of immigrant  workers in the backlog in the United States is on an H-1B temporary  work visa. So if we want to stop the future exploitation of immigrant  workers and the displacement of American workers, we have to stop the  abuse of H-1B visas.   Back in December, I asked my Democratic colleagues to support this  bipartisan agreement that Senator Lee and I reached. They all agreed. I  told Senator Lee that I wanted to move immediately to solve this  problem. There were so many people whose lives were tied up in this  debate. However, Senator Lee asked me for more time to discuss it with  his colleagues. I agreed.   In March, 3 months later, Senator Lee told me he wanted to make  significant changes in the agreement, and he said that without these  changes he could no longer support it.   Some of the changes were made at the request of the Trump  administration, which I will note is not exactly the most reliable or  objective source on advice on immigration. Let me briefly explain the  changes Senator Lee demanded.   The original version of Senator Lee's bill provides that no  individual who had already been approved for a green card would receive  the green card at a later time than they otherwise would have. This  provision, known as a hold harmless clause, is a critical protection  that assures immigrants who have been waiting years, patiently, in line  that nothing we do on the floor will change the number of years they  have to wait--perhaps improve them but not make them worse.   Now, at the request of the Trump administration, Senator Lee wants to  delete this hold harmless provision which was in his original bill.  That would jeopardize many people who are innocently waiting patiently  for their opportunity.   Second, Senator Lee wants to delay for 3 years the effective date of  the 50-50 rule to crack down on outsourcing companies.   Why on Earth would we give companies that are outsourcing American  [[Page S4328]]  jobs and exploiting immigrant workers a free pass for 3 more years?   Third, at the request of the Trump administration, Senator Lee wanted  to make two changes that would allow early filing for people who are  stuck in the green card backlog. He would delay early filing for 1  year--1 more year for children to age out; 1 more year for them to  wait. Why?   That means that any children who age out in the meantime lose their  chance for a green card and will be subject to deportation.   He would also require that immigrant workers could only ``early  file'' after their green card petition had been approved for 2 years--a  2-year delay on top of a 3-year delay. Any children who had aged out  during this new 2-year waiting period would not be protected and would  also be subject to deportation.   Why is Senator Lee--or at least those in the Trump administration  advising him--so afraid that these children might have a future in  America?   When we met in March, I told Senator Lee these changes were not  acceptable. It has now been 7 months since Senator Lee and I reached  our original agreement and more than 4 months since we met in March.  Immigrants who are stuck in the backlog and their children have waited  long enough.   I am now going to ask unanimous consent on my agreement with Senator  Lee from December 2019--the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act,  as amended by the Lee substitute amendment.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the  Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 1044,  Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration; further, that the Lee amendment at the desk be  agreed to, the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and  passed, and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, let me  say to Senator Lee, the changes he came back with were significant.   Removing the hold harmless provision, to me, is fundamentally unfair  to anyone who has been waiting patiently for a green card. Why would  the Senator jeopardize anyone and make them wait even longer for a  green card? That was one of the modifications he suggested.   The two other modifications the Senator suggested delayed protection  for children that left them subject to deportation for 2 to 3 years.  Why would we do that? We both agree that is a terrible outcome. That  was one of his modifications as well.   As far as the 50-50 rule, listen, I believe that is what is driving  this conversation. These outsourcing companies make a bundle of money,  and there are people who want to keep them in business and making  money, even at the expense of American workers, and I think that is  wrong. I really do.   I can't believe that that is what is really going to stop us now at  this point, to try to protect these outsourcing companies for 3 years  before this provision affects them.   As far as what we can do here today, I think what I am going to offer  next is going to be the simplest thing we can achieve and maybe more at  a later date. But let us protect the children. That is the next thing I  am going to offer.   Let us protect the children and make sure that as they are waiting in  line, they can't age out and be deported. That is not an unreasonable  request.   So I am going to refuse to agree to the modification, but I will  offer protection for the children next, and I hope--let's agree on that  today and continue the rest of the discussion beyond.    Madam President, I have a few minutes more to close this  debate. I ask forbearance of those who are prepared for the 4 p.m.  vote. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 additional minutes.    Madam President, I am sorry we were unable to reach an  agreement today.   The proposal which I am about to make, called the Protect Children of  Immigrant Workers Act, simply ensures that children will not age out in  this process.   How many times do parents come to me with tears in their eyes saying:  Don't hurt my child.   Here is our chance, as we work out all the other issues, to take care  of this one provision. It would not increase the number of green cards.  It does not get into the other issues we have debated. I ask the  Senator to please, for the sake of these children, give them the  protections, and let us continue to try and negotiate the other  provisions.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of my bill, the Protect Children of Immigrant Workers  Act, which is at the desk; that the bill be considered read three times  and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, in the interest of the moment, I cannot  offer my third amendment, but I will say this: It will be back. This is  a chance to do something for the children. It is very simple. You know  what it is. Let's do this.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.  [[Page S4352]]    There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4242         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
