 Mr. President, I would say that I also agree. I want to  thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his leadership, and I want to  thank him for setting the tenor and the environment that surrounds the  Armed Services Committee, which resulted in the 24-to-3 vote today in  the Armed Services Committee. Because of the relationship that we have,  but also because of his leadership, we have a very bipartisan  committee, which is vital to maintain, considering the awesome  responsibilities we hold.   The Senator from Rhode Island has displayed time after time a  willingness to work together for the good of the country. I think this  is the latest example, even though he had significant reservations-- which are valid--concerning the short period of transition from wearing  the uniform to holding down the highest civilian position as far as  defense of the Nation is concerned. I know he didn't reach this  conclusion without a lot of thought, a lot of study, a lot of--as he  has displayed--references to history; reasons for the origination of  this legislation, which requires 7 years before an individual is  eligible to be Secretary of Defense after leaving the military.   So I just wanted to thank the Senator from Rhode Island, and I look  forward to an overwhelming vote.   Mr. President, could I ask the parliamentary situation as it is right  now.    Mr. President, has a time been set for the vote?    I yield to my friend from Rhode Island.    Mr. President, is it accurate to say that 2:45 p.m. is a  time that is being seriously considered?    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed  5 minutes prior to the vote, if the time of the vote is set, and the  Senator from Rhode Island be given 5 minutes prior to that, in the case  of the time of the vote being set.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I would like to modify my unanimous  consent request that I be allowed 5 minutes prior to the vote.                              Order of Procedure    Before I do that, however, I ask unanimous consent that the time  until 2:45 p.m. be equally divided between the managers or their  designees, and that following the use or yielding back of that time,  the bill be read a third time, and the Senate vote on passage of S. 84;  further, that following the disposition of S. 84, the Senate recess  subject to the call of the Chair for the all-Members briefing.   So I would ask the Senator from Oregon how much time he needs.    Mr. President, I am asking for a ruling on the unanimous  consent request I just made.    Mr. President, I add to that unanimous consent request  that I be given the final 5 minutes before the vote.    Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Oregon who  asked if there were not any people who were qualified to serve as  Secretary of Defense, I am absolutely certain there are. Is there  anyone as qualified as General Mattis? My answer to the Senator from  Oregon is no. I have watched General Mattis for years. I have seen the  way that enlisted and officers react to his leadership. I have seen the  scholarly approach he has taken to war and to conflict.   I hope the Senator from Oregon will have at some point a chance to  get to know him, and he will then appreciate the unique qualities of  leadership that are much needed in these times where the outgoing  President of the United States has left the world in a state of chaos  because of an absolute failure of leadership, which is disgraceful. We  now see an outgoing President of the United States who in 2009  inherited a world that was not being torn apart in the Middle East. The  Chinese were not acting assertively in the South China Sea. The  Russians had not dismembered Ukraine and taken Crimea, in gross  violation of international law. All of those things have come about  because of his presidency.   So now he comes to the floor and objects to one of the most highly  qualified individuals and leaders in military history. I say to the  Senator from Oregon: You are wrong.   I believe the overwhelming majority of this body will repudiate and  cancel out his uninformed remarks.   Mr. President, in a few minutes we will vote on a historic piece of  legislation. For just the second time in seven decades, the legislation  before us would provide an exception to the law preventing any person  from serving as Secretary of Defense within 7 years of Active-Duty  service as a regular commissioned officer of the Armed Forces. This  legislation would allow Gen. James Mattis--the President-elect's  selection for Secretary of Defense, who retired from the Marine Corps 3  years ago--to serve in that office.   Earlier today, the Senate Armed Services Committee received testimony  from General Mattis. Once again, he demonstrated exceptional command of  the issues confronting the United States, the Department of Defense,  and our military servicemembers, but he also showed something else-- that his understanding of civil-military relations is deep and that his  commitment to civilian control of the Armed Forces is ironclad.   General Mattis's character, judgment, and commitment to defending our  Nation and its Constitution have earned him the trust of our next  Commander in Chief, Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, and  so many who are serving in our Armed Forces. General Mattis is an  exceptional public servant worthy of the exceptional consideration.  That is why, directly following the conclusion of today's hearing, the  Senate Armed Services Committee reported this legislation to the Senate  with an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 24 to 3--I repeat: with an  overwhelming vote of 24 to 3.   I am not saying that members of the Armed Services Committee are  smarter than the Senator from Oregon, but I am saying that members of  the Armed Services Committee have scrutinized--both sides of the aisle,  Republican and Democrat, including the ranking member--have looked at  General Mattis. Many of us have known him for years and years, as he  has shown the outstanding characteristics of leadership that he has had  the opportunity to display in his service to the country, and he was  voted out by an overwhelming vote of 24 to 3. So obviously there are 24  people on the Armed Services Committee who believe in General Mattis  and believe that this exception should be made, as opposed to 3 who  share the view of the Senator from Oregon.    That is why, directly following the conclusion of today's  hearing, the Senate Armed Services Committee reported this legislation  to the Senate with a vote of 24 to 3. I urge this body to follow suit.   That said, it is important for future Senators to understand the  context of our action here today. Civilian control of the Armed Forces  has been a bedrock principle of American Government since our  Revolution. A painting hanging in the Capitol Rotunda not far from this  floor celebrates the legacy of George Washington, who voluntarily  resigned his commission as commander of the Continental Army to the  Congress. This principle is enshrined in our Constitution, which  divides control of the Armed Forces among the President as Commander in  Chief and the Congress as coequal branches of government.   Since then, Congress has adopted various provisions separating  military and civilian positions. In the 19th century, for example,  Congress prohibited an Army officer from accepting a civil office, more  recently, in the National Security Act of 1947, and subsequent  revisions, Congress's 7-year ``cooling off'' period for any person to  serve as Secretary of Defense. It was only 3 years later, in 1950, that  Congress granted GEN George Marshall an exemption to that law and the  Senate confirmed him to be Secretary of Defense.   Indeed, the separation between civilian and military positions has  not always been so clear. Twelve of our Nation's Presidents previously  served as generals in the Armed Forces, and over the years, numerous  high-ranking civilian officials in the Department of  [[Page S307]]  Defense have had long careers in military service.   The basic responsibilities of civilian and military leaders are  simple enough--for civilian leaders: to seek the best professional  military advice while under no obligation to follow it; for military  leaders: to provide candid counsel while recognizing civilians have the  final say or, as General Mattis once observed, to insist on being heard  and never insist on being obeyed. But the fact is that the relationship  between civilian and military leaders is inherently and endlessly  complex. It is a relationship of unequals who nonetheless share  responsibility for the defense of the Nation. The stakes could not be  higher. The gaps in mutual understanding are sometimes wide.  Personalities often clash. And the unique features of the profession of  arms and the peculiarities of service cultures often prove daunting for  civilians who have never served in uniform.   Ultimately, the key to healthy civil-military relations and civilian  control of the military is the oath that soldiers and statesmen share  in common ``to protect and defend the Constitution.'' It is about the  trust they have in one another to perform their respective duties in  accordance with our republican system of government. It is about the  candid exchange of views engendered by that trust and which is vital to  effective decisionmaking. And it is about mutual respect and  understanding. The proper balance of civil-military relations is  difficult to achieve, and, as history has taught us, achieving that  balance requires different leaders at different times.   I believe that in the dangerous times in which we live, General  Mattis is the leader our Nation needs as Secretary of Defense. That is  why, although I believe we must maintain safeguards of civilian  leadership at the Department of Defense, I will support this  legislation today and General Mattis' nomination to serve this Nation  again as Secretary of Defense.   I want to assure my friend from Rhode Island, the ranking member of  the Armed Services Committee, who has very serious concerns--I want to  assure him that this is a one-time deal. I know the Senator from Rhode  Island had deep concerns about this whole process we have been through.  Yet I think he has put the interests of the Nation and placed his  confidence in General Mattis as being so exceptional that the law that  was passed back in 1947--there can be made one single exception to it.    Has time expired according to the previous UC?    I object.
