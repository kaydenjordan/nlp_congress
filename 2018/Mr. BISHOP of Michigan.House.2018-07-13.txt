 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with grave concern  regarding the security of our world.   Recently, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act,  which included my amendment urging our NATO allies to step up and  participate in the cost of their own defense. President Trump was  correct to raise this issue at the NATO summit in Brussels.   America's commitment to our NATO allies is absolutely ironclad--it  always has been--but for too long, the United States has shared an  unequal financial burden in contributing to the global and regional  security that NATO provides.   In 2014, each member country agreed to spend a minimum of 2 percent  of their GDP on defense, but currently, only 5 of 29 member countries  meet this threshold. With new challenges from an increasingly  belligerent Russian state, instability across the Middle East and North  Africa, and emerging cybersecurity threats around the world, it is time  for our allies to honor their commitments.    As negotiators continue to finalize the NDAA conference report, I  urge the inclusion of my amendment that passed the House to ensure our  allies pull their own weight in support of our collective defense,  which will strengthen NATO and help achieve peace through our  collective commitment.                            ____________________
