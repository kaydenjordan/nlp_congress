 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2353, the Strengthening  Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. This important  legislation would allow more Americans to enter the workforce with the  skills needed to compete for high-skilled, in-demand jobs.   Delaware employers tell me they need a skilled workforce. CTE support  is a vital tool in addressing the skills gap in many industries in our  country. Our support ensures that all students have access to high- quality CTE programs. It allows States to strengthen these programs,  providing hands-on learning opportunities that lead to higher  graduation rates as well as better postsecondary and career options.   In 2012, Delaware started Pathways to Prosperity to give high school  students an industry-recognized certificate, college credits, and  relevant work experience, all before they graduate. In 2 years, it has  grown from 30 students to over 6,000 students, who are now better  suited to determine their next steps and build a career.   I thank Mr. Thompson and also Mr. Krishnamoorthi for their  leadership, and I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation.
