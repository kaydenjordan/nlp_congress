 Madam Speaker, this is a potentially very black day for  America. I want to emphasize some things that I think are very  significant that haven't received enough attention.   We are paying for the government to care for 3- and 4-year-olds.  Traditionally, in America, the raising of the children is the  responsibility of the parents. I know there are people--Marxists--who  believe that the raising of children is the responsibility of the  state, but this is a sad day for America. The Federal Government-- against the Constitution, by the way--is going to weigh in and say  taking care of 3-year-olds is the responsibility of government--not  mom, not dad, not grandma and grandpa, the government.   The next thing is a big push toward encouraging illegal immigration.  In this bill, we are paying for free college for people who are here  illegally, something that the American middle class doesn't get.  American middle-class kids, they are going 30 or 40 grand in debt, and  we are giving free college to people who come here illegally. What a  shame.   I guess it matches the free healthcare while the average American is  sitting there looking at a $10,000 deductible.                            ____________________
