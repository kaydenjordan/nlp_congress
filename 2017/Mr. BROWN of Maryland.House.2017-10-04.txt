 Mr. Speaker, 3 days after Congress allowed the  Children's Health Insurance Program to expire, this House once again  passed a bill that restricts women's health and reproductive rights.   This should not be the time to prioritize politics. Women should be  able to make their own choices about their bodies and their healthcare.   Over the past 40 years, the Supreme Court has affirmed a woman's  constitutional right to privacy, including the right to choose.   Not only is the 20-week ban imposed by this Congress not based on  accepted science, but this ban disregards the role doctors play in  making health decisions.   In States that have already passed this ban, young people, women of  color, low-income women, and immigrant women are the ones who are most  impacted by the ban.   If we care about women's health, we should work to reduce unintended  pregnancies, expand access to contraception, and support maternal and  children's health. Instead, the majority is slashing Medicaid,  attacking Planned Parenthood, and passing bans.   Not me. I will remain committed to protecting women's health and  supporting the constitutional right to choose.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Virginia  for yielding.   I rise in strong support of the Congressional Black Caucus budget,  which is a more responsible alternative than the GOP budget.   A nation's budget reflects its priorities, but the GOP budget  continues to push the wrong ones, catering to the wealthy and the  special interests.   The GOP likes to say that a rising tide lifts every boat, but that is  only if every vessel is seaworthy. The GOP budget leaves too many  Americans in dinghies, rubber rafts, and rowboats, subject to being  capsized.   It includes trillions of dollars in irresponsible cuts, such as $5.4  trillion slashed from job-creating programs; $2 trillion cut from  Medicaid and Medicare; $5 billion eliminated from investments in  education, research, and infrastructure that will prevent us from  competing globally.  [[Page H7833]]    The GOP budget would devastate our economy by balancing the budget on  the backs of students, workers, seniors, the disabled, and vulnerable  communities in Maryland and across our country.   And for what?   To provide tax cuts to the top 1 percent--people who make at least  $900,000 every year.   In stark contrast, the CBC would create a fairer Tax Code and provide  for much-needed investments in our communities. Our budget would boost  our GDP by $329 billion.   I, too, Mr. Chairman, served on the House Armed Services Committee,  and I stand here to say that the CBC's budget would end sequestration  for our military so that we can improve military readiness and, at the  same time, restore critical domestic programs that support working  families and revitalize our neighborhoods.   Rather than giving the top 1 percent a $6 trillion tax cut, our  budget would call for major investments here at home. We invest $665  billion to modernize highways and infrastructure, $120 billion in job- creating programs, $80 billion so that every child learns in a modern  classroom, and $15 billion to rebuild our VA.   Perhaps, most importantly, Mr. Chairman, we invest $300 billion over  the next decade to eradicate poverty and provide basic standard of  living to all Americans.   Mr. Chairman, our budget responsibly pays for all of our investments.  Our budget is a credible alternative and a real plan for America, and I  urge my colleagues to support the CBC budget.
