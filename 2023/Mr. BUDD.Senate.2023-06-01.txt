 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up Senate  amendment No. 134 and ask that it be reported by number.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the amendment by  number.   The bill clerk read the amendment as follows:         The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Budd] proposes an       amendment numbered 134.    The amendment is as follows:         Strike title I of division B and insert the following:                  TITLE I--RESCISSION OF UNOBLIGATED FUNDS       SEC. 201. RESCISSION OF UNOBLIGATED CORONAVIRUS FUNDS.         The unobligated balances of amounts appropriated or       otherwise made available by the American Rescue Plan Act of       2021 (Public Law 117-2), and by each of Public Laws 116-123,       116-127, 116-136, and 116-139 and divisions M and N of Public       Law 116-260, are hereby permanently rescinded, except for--        (1) such amounts that were appropriated or otherwise made       available to the Department of Veterans Affairs; and        (2) amounts made available under section 601 of division HH       of Public Law 117-328.     Madam President, on March 13 of 2020, the Federal  Government declared a national emergency concerning the COVID-19  pandemic. More than 3 years later, on May 11, 2023, that declaration  ended. And yet, to this day, billions of COVID dollars throughout the  Federal Government remain unspent.   So let's be clear. Each and every one of those dollars came from a  hard-working taxpayer, from a working family's budget. That is why my  amendment would rescind an additional $17 billion of unspent COVID  money.   If we really want the Fiscal Responsibility Act to live up to its  name, the least we can do is to rescind the taxpayer dollars that  remain to fight a pandemic that everyone knows is over. Every taxpayer  dollar is sacred and should be treated that way.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.    Madam President, any remaining time?   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 5 seconds.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.
