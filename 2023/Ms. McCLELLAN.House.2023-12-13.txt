 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my friend and  colleague, Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton, to share her strong support  and statement regarding this important legislation.   These are her words:   ``I rise today in strong support of the National Plan to End  Parkinson's Act.   ``As many of you know, earlier this year, I shared that I have been  diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy, or PSP for short, which  is an atypical Parkinson's, a kind of Parkinson's on steroids.   ``Even those of you with whom I have never interacted one on one have  witnessed my physical deterioration, from my striding confidently  through the Chamber earlier this year to walking more haltingly and  dependent on my walking sticks this summer, to leaning heavily on my  walker now. In all likelihood, some time in 2024, I will come to the  floor in a wheelchair.    ``Eventually, those of us who have these diseases will be unable to  walk, talk, or even feed ourselves. We will require extensive and  expensive institutional or in-home care, the cost of which will likely  be borne primarily by U.S. taxpayers.   ``Since my diagnosis, I have seen firsthand how Parkinson's disease  or atypical Parkinson's can change everything, not only for those of us  who suffer from the disease itself, but for all of the many people in  our lives who love us and want us to be well again.   ``The physical challenges are tough. In just 2016, I ran the Marine  Corps Olympic-distance triathlon and as recently as last year got up  every morning during session to go to the gym with Chair Rodgers and a  small group of dedicated women Members.   ``My family has felt the impacts, as well. My husband, Andrew, and I  were supposed to be getting to the good part and were looking forward  to enjoying our empty nest as our younger son went off to join his  brother in college.   ``Instead, he will be a caregiver, and we are looking for ways to  convert the first floor study and half bath to a bedroom and en suite  so that I will be able to remain in our home when I am no longer able  to make it up or down stairs.   ``Instead of scuba diving together in the morning and sitting under a  palm tree and playing Scrabble in the afternoon, we will not enjoy a  leisurely retirement a decade plus from now.''                                time  1630    ``I know it has been difficult for my sons to watch as their  vivacious, cool--for a mom--confident Congresswoman mom goes through  these changes and challenges as well.   ``This is my family's story, but we, unfortunately, are not alone.  There are over 1 million people in the United States who have these  diseases, and countless loved ones surrounding them.   ``We did not expect this to happen to us, and it could happen to  anyone. That is why this legislation is so critical. Today marks a  historic step forward toward a world where no family has to endure what  ours has.   ``To my colleagues, friends, and those from across the country from  whom I have heard an outpouring of support, I have been touched by your  kindness and the desire for action from both sides of the aisle.   ``If there is one thing we can all agree on, it is that we can and  must do better to fight these terrible diseases.   ``The past year has been a difficult road and an emotional journey  for me, not only facing the great health challenges that come with this  diagnosis, but also coming to terms with the fact that I have to give  up doing what I love.   ``I have spent my career uplifting the stories of those in need and  fighting to serve my community, and I am proud to continue that fight  on behalf of the broader Parkinson's community for as long as I am  able.   ``I am grateful to have a platform to be a voice for those struggling  with this disease and to fight and help bring greater resources to the  search for a cure. The National Plan to End Parkinson's Act will do  just that.   ``This is not the end of the road, but a vital and necessary first  step on a journey that will lead to a cure or, even better, eradicate  Parkinson's and atypical Parkinson's altogether.   ``I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and  reaffirm Congress' commitment to finding treatments and cures for  millions of families across the country.''   Mr. Speaker, I would only add to the words of Congresswoman Jennifer  Wexton that she is a fighter.   Having served with her in the Virginia General Assembly, I saw her  fight on behalf of others and turn their pain into progress, and now I  am honored to serve with her as she does that with her own pain, turns  it into progress to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves. I  join her in supporting this bill and asking our colleagues to vote  ``yes.''
