 We are at war.    Senator Graham, thank you for joining me here tonight.   I wish the C-SPAN camera, for a moment, could pan this Chamber. It is  empty. There are three Senators in this Chamber right now. Senator  Rounds is the Presiding Officer from South Dakota. He has to be here  because he is the Presiding Officer. Senator Graham is here, from South  Carolina, and I am here.   Senator Graham, this Chamber is empty tonight. We should be here, at  this moment, voting.   Our phones are ringing off the hook. Twenty-three hours ago--in fact,  I was presiding--we were told that we were at the 1-yard line. The  minority leader came down here and said: We are at the 1-yard line, and  we are going to have discussions all night----    I will.    I have.    We are at the 1-yard line, we were told last night.  Negotiations would go all night. Everybody here said it has to be a  good, bipartisan bill. But what we have right now is an economic  emergency on our hands. This is like somebody has been seriously  injured and called the ambulance, and we are debating right now about  what color ambulance to send, while the patient is dying on the side of  the sideline.   Listen to some of these stories I had just today from the people of  Montana. There is a 60-year-old woman who provides cleaning services in  Ravalli County, south of Missoula. It is in the Bitterroot. It is a  beautiful part of our State. She said that normal business is almost  down to nothing because folks are scared to let her clean their homes  and businesses because of the coronavirus. To make ends meet, she said  she is even willing to do outside yard work during these times. She is  worried about becoming homeless. This is a real story that came from a  Montanan today.   I posted a video, Senator Graham, about her plight and a couple of  others I am going to share with you tonight.   Here is a warming part of this story. We had Montanans hear about her  situation, and they said: We are going to band together here and help  her. We are going to hire her and try to make sure she doesn't become  homeless, which is her current concern.   Listen, we were told that we were at the 1-yard line last night to  get this done. All I have to say is, the Senate may think it is at the  1-yard line right now, but Montanans are getting sacked. In fact, our  unemployment claims in Montana since March 17--we just looked it up 15  minutes ago--14,350 Montanans have filed for unemployment in the last  week.   There was a gentleman from Kalispell--another story here--who said  his business has been hit hard because of the coronavirus. He wrote:  Help, both for the businesses to remain afloat and our team members who  are being laid off or having reductions in work hours.   He is worried about his employees. Emergency personnel in Missoula,  MT, let us know that ambulance drivers--EMTs--must travel longer  distances because the volunteer fire departments don't have enough  equipment or staff. They can't get enough personal protective  equipment.   That is in this bill, Senator Graham--immediate billions of dollars  right now--to get more PPE to the frontlines.   And he said this: Many are working while spouses have lost their  jobs. And they are wondering if they will be able to pay their bills if  there is no relief soon. And their family members have lost their jobs  with the community. They need relief now.   I just got this letter. This came in this evening. In fact, it is  stamped 7:50 p.m.         Dear Senator Daines:        I am the General Manager of Fairmont Hot Springs Resort.    He gave us permission to use his name. I am not going to read you the  description of the plight that he is in, but here is the bottom line.         I just processed 146 layoff notices, or 85 percent of our       staff.    This is this evening. It is breaking the hearts of these employers to  lay their people off.    It is breaking the hearts of these employees who are  losing their jobs while the Senate is sitting here fiddling at the  moment. We have got to come together and pass this bill tonight.    Senator Graham, that is in this bill.   For these small businesses, help is on its way. But we can't send the  help, Senator Graham, until we pass the bill. Yet the good news for the  general manager of Fairmont Hot Springs is that, as the Senator just  said, it will not be a loan but a grant that will be forgiven. In other  words, he won't have to pay it back as long as he keeps the payroll  paid, the rent paid, the mortgage paid. That makes a lot of sense.     He wouldn't have to lay them off today. In fact, he  continues to write that they just canceled conferences in the last week  that total $848,000. This is a big deal in Montana.   In fact, another small business owner in Montana let us know, by the  way, about two other of our well-known kind of resorts--Grouse Mountain  resort, which is up in Whitefish, as well as Chico Hot Springs. In  fact, Senator Graham, in 1979, Chico Hot Springs is where we had our  homecoming dance dinner for Bozeman High School.    Listen. They are in trouble. They are temporarily closed.  In fact, they just closed Yellowstone National Park and Glacier  National Park today. This business owner said  [[Page S2005]]  they are currently looking at additional layoffs. They are looking at  cashflows of nearly zero.   OK. So, right now, we are hearing about the plight of Montanans who  are losing their jobs and losing their businesses. There are 14,000- plus Montanans who have filed unemployment claims, and what is the  Senate doing tonight, Senator Graham? Look around this Chamber. There  is nobody here. It is you and I.    Senator Graham, I support the idea, if we don't get  something done here, that Members of Congress shouldn't be paid. Again,  there are constitutional issues, but we can get around that by just  saying we will donate our paychecks to some important COVID-19 relief  effort that is going on. We will find something.   Here is what we get. At least here in the Senate tonight, we have a  choice as to whether we want to donate our paychecks or not. There are  14,700 Montanans who don't have that choice because they have lost  their paychecks in the last 7 days. I am usually a guy who stays pretty  calm, cool, and collected.    Lindsey, you could probably testify to that.    This is a moment in which I am just bringing the  frustration and the fear that I hear in the voices of Montanans who are  asking: What in the world is going on back in Washington, DC?   We have a package. As you can see, what happened today in the markets  around the world is that there was optimism. Why? Because we have  something here that is going to be a rescue. First, they called it a  stimulus. Then they called it a recovery package. I think this is  called a rescue package. We are into a rescue here--rescuing this  economy and rescuing the jobs of these small business owners. We could  spend the next 30 to 40 minutes going through, in detail, all of the  things that are in this bill that are going to help working people in  this country and small businesses.   In the meantime, Senator Graham, I agree with you. If we can't get  this passed, every Member of Congress should start donating his pay to  a charity that is currently on the frontline of dealing with the  coronavirus and COVID-19.    It more than doubles what they would otherwise receive in  the State of Montana in unemployment benefits.    By the way, this unemployment insurance backstop that is part of this  rescue package is not what Montanans are after. They want their jobs.    So their first choice is, Would you please help me keep  my job.   For whatever reason, if we can't do that, there will be the  unemployment insurance. I will tell you that Montanans don't want a  handout, but it is there if they need it because it is really a hand- up--a bridge--until we get this economy back on its regular course.    There has been plenty of time to negotiate, Senator  Graham. There have been good faith negotiations on both sides, and  there has been shuttle diplomacy going on between both sides. There has  been a lot of give and get. We are at a point now at which we need to  vote, and we should be voting tonight.   Regarding that $10 billion that is in this bill, I have been spending  a lot of time thinking about how we get out of this war.    How do you win this war?    When you step back for a moment and think about the  basics--of the panic and fear that the American people have with regard  to this economy--the panic and the fear will not stop until the  pandemic stops, and the pandemic will not stop until these great drugs  start.   Here is what we are thinking about, and I want to give a reason for  great hope and optimism as to how we are going to get over this great  hurdle that we face in our Nation today. We have some amazing vaccines  in development as we speak. In fact, they started a trial in Seattle a  week ago on Monday. They vaccinated 45 adults aged 18 to 55. They are  getting the initial results. They will be looking at the safety as  [[Page S2006]]  well as the efficacy--how well does it work?--over the course of  several weeks.   We have some other amazing, miracle drugs. They are called monoclonal  antibodies. That is the technical term for them. When you take that  drug, it provides protection against the coronavirus so that you don't  even get the COVID-19 disease.   Here is the challenge, Senator Graham. We have to be operating on  parallel paths right now to make sure we have those drugs available to  the American people in a widespread fashion before the next flu season  hits this fall. We are seeing reports right now from Singapore and Hong  Kong, and there are some reinfections going on. That should put us on  notice.    Assuming our containment strategy works and that we bend this curve,  as we have talked about, so that we look more like South Korea than  Italy--we pray for that and hope for that and are working to that end-- the challenge will be our not having enough immunity in our society  coming up this fall. That will leave us vulnerable to a second wave of  this virus.   The solution--the way we win this war--is to start manufacturing some  of these drugs earlier, in parallel with the testing that is going on,  so that, by the time the fall hits, we will have it available for the  American people. That is in this bill.   Listen, every hour that goes by in which we don't pass this bill is  an hour that is lost in this fight. We see what is going on. If you  look at the World Health Organization's numbers--we are calculating  them on a daily basis and sometimes on an hourly basis--every hour  matters right now, and every day matters. We have now lost 2 days this  week. It has been incredible.   Lindsey, it is Wednesday tomorrow. It is time to vote. This Chamber  is empty. Senator Graham, let's get this Chamber full of Senators, and  let's have an up-or-down vote. Let's get it done.    Senator Graham, thank you, and we will conclude here.   This is a moment in our history as a nation. Truly, we have got to  come together. The American people are asking us to come together.   Senator Graham, I thought for certain we would have a vote today, and  here we are, approaching 8:30 p.m., and no sign of a vote. We are going  to lose another day while the unemployment claims are rising and people  are getting sicker. There is help on the way with this historic  package. It is time to forget who is a Republican and who is a  Democrat. The question is--these are 100 Americans serving the U.S.  Senate. It is time to rise above the current fracas and vote.
