 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the 50th  anniversary of Roe v. Wade.   Abortion is one of the greatest tragedies in our Nation, and Roe v.  Wade opened the door for abortions on demand until birth.   Over the last five decades, more than 60 million unborn lives have  been taken and a tragic, irreversible mark has been left on countless  mothers, fathers, and families.   While there is still so much work to be done, I stand here hopeful.  The pro-life community is stronger than ever. With last year's Dobbs v.  Jackson decision, this country is beginning to move in the right  direction to defend the defenseless and support life. We are changing  hearts and minds.    Of course, we still have a long way to go in this fight, and I am  proud that one of the first things that we voted on in this Congress  was the born-alive act to protect babies who have survived an attempted  abortion.   I am also proud to have introduced two bills to help protect the  unborn, women, and taxpayers: the Defund Planned Parenthood Act, which  I was asked to carry by former Congresswoman Vickie Hartzler who  carried the bill in the last Congress, and the Protecting Life and  Taxpayers Act.   We know that Americans across the country value the lives of the  precious unborn babies, and it is just wrong to force them to spend  their tax dollars on something that goes against their most closely  held values.   This evening, I am pleased to be joined by so many champions of the  unborn to celebrate the victories, with many more to come.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud), who is  championing the efforts with Chairman Bost to end taxpayer-funded  abortions at the VA. He has been a lead sponsor of the Women's Public  Health and Safety Act, which gives States the authority to exclude  abortion providers, like Planned Parenthood, from receiving Medicaid  funds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman), who will be reintroducing the Ensuring Accurate  and Complete Abortion Data Reporting Act which would compel States to  report both the number of abortions and the number of infants born  alive after an abortion attempt.    Mr. Speaker, I know that we will all continue to be a  voice for the voiceless. It is so important, and our work is not done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Moore), another  defender of life.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for all of his  work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde), who  reintroduced the Protect the UNBORN Act last week to prohibit the  implementation of and funding for President Biden's pro-abortion  executive orders.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Lamborn), who is looking forward to reintroducing the Second  Chance at Life Act, which would require abortion facilities to provide  information at least 24 hours in advance that explains that the  chemical abortion process may be reversed before taking the second of  the two drugs required.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his pro-life  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), who is  a great defender of life.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  commitment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles), who  is a freshman and a great pro-lifer.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his commitment  to the unborn and for those wonderful words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford),  who is a proud father, grandfather, and great-grandfather committed to  fighting for life.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for  his remarks. He mentioned the culture of death, but we are working and  we are succeeding in turning back into the culture of life and changing  hearts and minds.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber),  who is my great friend. My colleague from Minnesota is a true champion  of life.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for  sharing his personal story and that strong and true support for life.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly),  who introduced the Heartbeat Protection Act which would prohibit  abortions when a fetal heartbeat is detected with the exceptions of  rape, incest, and life of the mother, when necessary.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania.  We are here to speak up for the unborn. We hear their cry, and we will  continue to fight and hear the unborn.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Guest),  who with the House Congressional Pro-Life Caucus chair, Chris Smith,  helped lead the amicus brief in support of Mississippi's Dobbs case.  The amicus brief was joined by more than 200 Members of Congress,  including myself, and urged the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade.  The Congressman from Mississippi was instrumental in that fight.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Guest for all of his work in  defense of the unborn.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt),  the Values Action Team chair and a longstanding protector of life.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate all the work Mr. Aderholt  has done. We will continue our fight, and we will continue our work to  protect unborn life.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Grothman for his words and  his commitment to the unborn.  [[Page H273]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Thompson), a champion of life, the chairman of the House Agriculture  Committee, and my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  for his steadfast commitment to the unborn and strong support of the  right to life.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues who spoke this evening for  standing up to give a voice to the voiceless unborn children, for  standing up for life. Our Conference will continue to be strong for  mothers and their unborn children.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
