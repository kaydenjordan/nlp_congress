 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of  Andrew Wheeler as the Administrator of the EPA. Under the provisions of  the Federal Vacancies Act, Mr. Wheeler can continue to lead the EPA  until August 7 of this year.   Rushing to judgment on his nomination will close the window of  opportunity the Senate has now to ensure that he reverses course on a  handful of important policies that protect our planet while creating  American jobs.   I am not calling for delay for delay's sake. We have 161 days to  ensure that Mr. Wheeler withdraws his proposal to put the mercury and  air toxics standards rule in legal jeopardy. We have 161 days to hear  him say that he supports Senate ratification of a treaty that phases  out harmful HFCs while creating jobs. We have 161 days to ensure that  he negotiates with a coalition, including California and 12 other  States, on vehicle fuel efficiency standards and greenhouse gas  emissions while giving the auto industry the certainty they need.   While progress is being made on these important issues, I am asking  my colleagues to vote no today on cloture on the motion to proceed to  this nomination.    Mr. President, I rise to speak this afternoon about the  nomination of Andrew Wheeler to become Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency.   The day after Mr. Wheeler was named EPA Acting Administrator, I wrote  him a letter. I reminded Mr. Wheeler of the opportunity he had to try a  new course for that Agency after Scott Pruitt's scandal-plagued  administration. Yet in the 7 months as Acting Administrator,  unfortunately, Mr. Wheeler has so far chosen not to reverse course at  EPA in too many important instances. In some cases, he has even  accelerated the environmental damage and regulatory zeal that his  predecessor began.   I knew that Mr. Wheeler and I would not always agree on every issue,  but like so many others, I did hope that he would moderate some of  Scott Pruitt's most egregious and environmentally destructive policies,  specifically on policies where industry and the environmental community  are in broad agreement. Sadly, my hopes have not been realized.   To be clear, Mr. Wheeler is not the ethically bereft embarrassment  that Scott Pruitt was. Mr. Wheeler has also engaged more frequently and  substantively than Scott Pruitt did with both Congress and EPA career  staff, but time and again, Mr. Wheeler has proven that his  environmental policies are almost as destructive and extreme as his  predecessor's, despite the explicit promises Mr. Wheeler has made to  Members of Congress, both in private and in public meetings.   One of those promises was Mr. Wheeler's recent insistence that, when  it comes to getting a deal on vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas  standards with California and a coalition of 12 other States, including  my State and the Presiding Officer's State, ``no one wants a 50-State  deal more than I do.'' That was Mr. Wheeler's promise during his  nomination hearing in front of the Environment and Public Works  Committee in January.   Just weeks later, the headlines told a different story. For months,  Mr. Wheeler said repeatedly that he shared my goal of striking a deal-- not just my goal, but the goal of many of us here--with the State of  California and a dozen of other States on fuel economy and greenhouse  gas emissions standards. Not long after he became Acting Administrator,  however, Mr. Wheeler signed off on the Trump administration's proposal  that freezes the standards for the better part of a decade, eliminates  most of the air conditioning, electric vehicle, and other compliance  credits that are supported by chemical companies, automobile and parts  manufacturers, and utilities and preempts California's authority to set  its own stronger standards.   What is more, the Trump administration reportedly plans to penalize  rules that call for a 0.5-percent increase. That is a one-half of 1- percent increase in the stringency of those standards--one-tenth the  pace called for in the rules that are already on the books.   Since that proposal was put forth, the entire automobile industry,  many Members of Congress, and many other stakeholders have repeatedly  asked the EPA to forge a compromise that avoids years of costly  litigation and uncertainty for our automobile industry. So far, that is  all for naught.   Just last week, unfortunately and inexplicably, EPA announced, with  the  [[Page S1511]]  White House and the Department of Transportation, that they decided to  end their so-called negotiations with the State of California and,  effectively, with 12 other States. These negotiations were superficial,  at best, or duplicitous and designed to fail, at worst. Between you and  me, I don't see how these discussions could have ended or failed  because they never seriously began in the first place. It is  outrageous.   That brings me back to Mr. Wheeler's promise. After his emphatic  insistence that he wanted to find a 50-State solution for these  standards, the decision to end them without ever making a serious  effort to ever reach a compromise sends a clear message that, sadly,  Mr. Wheeler--at least, in this instance--is unable to keep his word. I  say that with no joy, but I say it nonetheless.   A second example of Mr. Wheeler's failure to lead in an appropriate  way lies in his unreasonable opposition to submitting to the Senate for  ratification something called a the ``Kigali Amendment'' to the  Montreal Protocol.   I mentioned this to one of our colleagues. He said: Talk to me in  English.   I reminded him that we used to use something called CFCs. It was a  refrigerator coolant that was broadly used in this country until we  found out it had very serious consequences for our ozone layer.  Science, chemical companies, and chemists came up with a replacement to  CFCs. We call them HFCs, or hydrofluorocarbons, which are better for  the ozone. They are still destructive to the greenhouse gas and  destructive to our planet. Well, guess what. Scientists and chemists  have, again, come up with a follow-on product to HFCs. It is not  scientists and chemists in companies in other countries. They are right  here in America. They have invested in a lot of money to come up with  this discovery, this invention. They want to sell it. That requires the  phaseout over time of HFCs.   We need the Kigali Amendment to be submitted to the Senate for  ratification in order to open the door for our American companies to  compete with a new technology that is good for jobs in America and good  for our planet. Our country could gain 150,000 direct and indirect new  jobs, and almost $40 billion in annual economic benefits by 2027  because the safer substitutes to HFCs are made in Texas and Louisiana.  These are good-paying jobs. These are green manufacturing jobs that  could help our efforts to address climate change while bolstering our  country's economy.   Ratification of this treaty is supported by an extraordinary list of  stakeholders, including more than a dozen of our Republican colleagues  here in this Chamber. From the American Chemistry Council to the  Chamber of Commerce, to FreedomWorks, to the Sierra Club, it seems that  just about everyone supports ratification of this amendment, as best I  can tell--everyone, that is, except EPA.   Under Mr. Wheeler's leadership, EPA also decided it is no longer  ``appropriate and necessary'' to protect babies' brains from mercury  and air toxic pollution emitted by electric utilities.   In the eleventh hour before the government shutdown, Mr. Wheeler  signed a proposal that guts the legal foundation of the mercury and air  toxics standards, also known as the MATS rule. Using outdated data and  deciding that some benefits--like reduction in cancer, birth defects,  and asthma attacks--are no longer important for the Agency to count,  EPA is now setting a dangerous precedent and putting the mercury and  air toxics standards rule in legal jeopardy. In fact, EPA has gone so  far as to request public comment on whether the standards should be  eliminated altogether.   Mr. Wheeler says that this action was necessary and that the proposal  strikes a balance. That is just not true. In fact, the utility industry  is in full compliance with these standards already, and they have done  so at a third of the expected costs. That is why every stakeholder-- from coal-fired utilities that comply with the rules to religious  leaders, to environmental organizations, to the Chamber of Commerce-- urged this administration not to take this step. In fact, utility  groups and organized labor organizations wrote to EPA saying:         The industry already has invested significant capital--      estimated at more than $18 billion--in addition to these       operating costs, and states are relying on the operation of       these controls for their air quality plans. Therefore, we--    This being the group that wrote to EPA, including utility groups and  organized labor groups--       urge EPA to . . . leave the underlying MATS rule in place and       effective.    Yet Mr. Wheeler has chosen to ignore the chorus of stakeholders who  all hoped he would chart a more responsible path--on this front, too-- even though utilities are not asking for this action that he is taking  and the EPA is taking, and the courts are not requiring it.   Yet, from the stakeholders, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the  utility industry over here to all of the NGOs and environmental groups  and health groups over here, everybody says to leave this rule alone.  It was adopted 7 years ago, and it works. It has worked at half the  cost or at one-third of the cost. Leave it alone. I just don't get  this. This is just another example of when Mr. Wheeler has taken a  recklessly and unnecessary extreme course of action at the EPA.   Here is another one.   In May of 2018, after meeting with a victim's mother, Scott Pruitt,  the former EPA Administrator, announced plans to finalize the Obama  administration's ban to prohibit consumer and commercial paint  stripping uses for something called methylene chloride--a hazardous  chemical that has killed dozens of unsuspecting users in this country  alone.   Despite explicit assurances provided to my office and others that the  EPA would follow through with Mr. Pruitt's promise to protect both  consumer and commercial users from methylene chloride, under Mr.  Wheeler's leadership, the EPA sent a final rule restricting only the  consumer uses of methylene chloride to the White House's Office of  Management and Budget. There have been 56 accidental exposure deaths  related to methylene chloride since 1980--56--including properly  trained workers who have worn protective gear on the job. Yet the EPA,  under Mr. Wheeler's leadership, has decided to exempt workers from the  methylene chloride ban.   A number of people have said to me they think it is unconscionable. I  think they are right. With Mr. Wheeler at the helm, the EPA cannot even  manage to ban a chemical that is so harmful to human health that  stores--and this includes Walmart, Sherwin-Williams, Ace Hardware, Home  Depot, and others--have already voluntarily taken it off their shelves.   That is not all. Even the EPA's recently announced PFAS Action Plan,  which was released with much fanfare 2 weeks ago, did not do much more  than renounce the same measures announced by Scott Pruitt almost a year  ago. PFAS is sometimes referred to as forever chemicals. The reason, my  colleagues, is that they last forever in our environment. It took a  public outcry to make Mr. Wheeler reverse the Agency's inexplicable  decision not to set an enforceable drinking water standard for PFAS. At  his hearing last month, I asked him if he would agree to set a clean  drinking water standard in 2 years--not in 2 weeks, not in 2 months but  in 2 years--and he could not do that.   In short, over the past 7 months as the Acting Administrator, Mr.  Wheeler has perpetuated and in at least one instance I have cited here  today has worsened the preexisting inadequacies and failures Scott  Pruitt left behind. When faced with opportunities to protect human  health and the environment in ways that also have the support of the  industries that would be regulated, time and again, Mr. Wheeler has  failed to act in a way that I believe is responsible and has, instead,  listened to some of the most extreme voices around him.   As I have said before and will say again, I am not making some futile  attempt at changing the hearts and minds about this nominee at the  eleventh hour. I am not that kind of Senator and never have been, and I  was not that kind of Governor. I am not grandstanding, trying to get  any press attention, or the perfect sound bite. I am, however, trying  to convince some of my colleagues to seize this window of opportunity  we have now to ensure that Acting Administrator Wheeler reverses course  and governs responsibly  [[Page S1512]]  at the EPA. That is what I am trying to do. That is what we are trying  to do.   As the President's nominee to lead this Agency, under the provisions  of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, Mr. Wheeler can continue to lead  the EPA as Acting Administrator until August 7 of this year. He is  there, and he is going to be there. Rushing to judgment on this  nomination will close the window of opportunity we have to ensure the  Acting Administrator reverses course at the EPA and embraces the  commonsense, bipartisan policies I just laid out--policies which make  our environment cleaner and safer while they also create jobs and  strengthen America's economy. I think we all want that. I think that is  why people sent us here to negotiate those kind of win-win agreements.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on this nomination so we  can achieve those win-win situations that are there for the taking.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before my colleague from Virginia leaves,  I admire him so much. I just want to applaud him and applaud his early  work as a missionary in Honduras.   During our past recess, Senator Jeff Merkley and I and four of our  colleagues from the House were privileged to be a part of a 5-day  congressional delegation to Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. We  were there to find out how the Alliance for Prosperity was being  implemented, of which the Senator has been very supportive, as have I,  in order to focus on hope, economic opportunity, crime, violence, and  corruption.   The Alliance for Prosperity is focused on all of those matters. The  United States puts up some of the money to address them, but we expect  the other countries, including Honduras, to put up even more. It is  like being at Home Depot--you can do it, and we can help. For every $1  in El Salvador, they put up $7, and we leverage our money to get the  support of foundations, NGOs, private companies, and others to do their  share. It is like turning the course of an aircraft carrier, and it is  starting to turn.   Probably late this week--maybe tomorrow--I suspect Senator Merkley  and I will want to have a colloquy on the floor. It would be great if  the Senator could join us because he has forgotten more about that part  of the world than we will ever know.   Thank you.   I didn't come to the floor to focus on that, but I am glad I had the  chance to since Senator Kaine was here.                            ____________________
