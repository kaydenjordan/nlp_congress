 Madam Speaker, I come before you with many  wonderful colleagues to honor the life and legacy of Richard L. Trumka.  Rich was a passionate and steadfast leader who committed himself to  bettering the lives of working men and women in every nook and cranny  of this country.   Like many made-in-America stories, Richard Trumka's had humble  beginnings. He grew up in southwest Pennsylvania's coal country, the  son and grandson of coal miners. He worked the mines himself, and he  was able to go to college and then to law school. His talent and his  charisma were hard to miss, which I guess helps explain how he came to  lead one of our great and historic unions, the United Mine Workers of  America, at a very young age.   As President of the United Mine Workers, Rich led the iconic Pittston  Coal strike, a difficult but ultimately successful effort to fight off  cuts to healthcare benefits of workers and their families. As a young  activist, this labor struggle made a huge impression on me.   I knew Rich Trumka for over a quarter of a century, and I enjoyed  working with him in numerous capacities. In 1995, I had the honor of  running the field operation of his historic campaign to become  secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, along with president John Sweeney  and executive vice president Linda Chavez-Thompson. Their victory was  historic because it represented the only insurgent takeover of the AFL- CIO leadership since the American Federation of Labor and the Congress  of Industrial Organizations joined to create the AFL-CIO in 1955. That  remains true to this day, 66 years later. Rich brought earthiness and  oratory to the ticket, complementing the widely loved but more taciturn  president John Sweeney from SEIU.   A mine worker from western Pennsylvania, a service worker from New  York City, and a public sector champion in Linda Chavez-Thompson from  Texas, they made a perfect combination and they brought big change to  the labor movement in many ways.   For the next 11 years, I served as assistant director of organizing  at the AFL-CIO, working closely with Rich and seeing his drive through  innumerable organizing legislative and political campaigns throughout  the Nation.   The picture next to me represents one such effort and one such  opportunity for me to help Rich and the other officers carry out their  missions.  [[Page H5918]]                                     time  1700    In their campaign to take over the AFL-CIO, they said that they were  going to get young people involved in the labor movement in  unprecedented ways. And so we created something called Union Summer,  and they told me without a whole lot of notice that I had to put it  together and lead it.   In fact, we recruited young people from across the Nation, had over  3,500 applicants, and put 1,000 young people, which was the commitment  they made--and they fulfilled it--1,000 young people on union  organizing and bargaining campaigns throughout this Nation, and they  were incredibly diverse. Something like two-thirds were women, and over  half were people of color.   This picture comes from the launch of the Union Summer campaign, and  after Union Summer was over, the officers gave me a little framed copy  of this picture, and Rich Trumka's comments were classic Trumka. He  said, ``Levin, you did a good--no, an outstanding job on this effort.  But thank God those kids of yours look like Mary.'' That was Rich  Trumka. I still remember it.   It is no secret that Rich was elected to be president of the AFL-CIO  in 2009 at a difficult moment for the labor movement. Due to a  confluence of many different factors, working men and women faced a  string of complex challenges. Becoming the head of the AFL-CIO was no  easy task, but Rich was not one to pass up critical fights.   Instead, he was able to rely on his character and conviction and his  relationships to forge a path of consensus and solidarity among the 57  unions representing 12.5 million members of the AFL-CIO.   Regardless of whether he was talking with workers on a factory floor  or to the President of the United States in rooms of the White House  few people ever see, even on TV, Rich was grounded in his pursuit to  improve the material life of all working people and their families. The  AFL-CIO was truly made better through his many contributions and his  strong leadership.   Coming to Congress and working with Mr. Trumka as president of the  AFL-CIO was a real highlight for me. I, and all who knew him, will miss  him dearly.   I am grateful to my colleagues for being with me here tonight to pay  tribute to Rich and to his remarkable life.   At this time, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the  chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Scott. That is  really amazing, the idea that the PRO Act would be named for Rich  Trumka. It is so fitting. It is really moving to me, as somebody who  worked for him for so long.   I now yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the  chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee of the House of  Representatives.    Madam Speaker, I thank Rosa. That was really  moving. I remember that 1996 day on the New Haven Green.   I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer), a great ally  of the working people of this country.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this  Special Order.     Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Newman).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Suozzi), one of the co-chairs of the Labor Caucus in the  House of Representatives.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), a true champion of workers in this country for  decades in this House, the longest serving woman in the history of the  House of Representatives, and my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), Rich Trumka's great partner in the House of  Representatives.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Tonko), another person like Marcy Kaptur and me who  represents a district full of gritty, working-class factories and  neighborhoods that Rich championed so fiercely.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader of the House of  Representatives.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Levin), the better half of the Levin caucus, my  brother.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Madam Speaker, I have to say that this tribute to our great friend,  Rich Trumka, would not be complete truly without hearing from the  representative of his home district, his home area in Nemacolin,  Pennsylvania.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Lamb),  my brother.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Lamb.   Madam Speaker, it is really fitting that we are honoring Rich Trumka  during what has come to be called Striketober. This month has seen more  workers in motion in more industries across more regions than at any  time in modern history.   We have people in the healthcare industry, nurses, on strike.   We have miners in Alabama, members of Rich Trumka's home union, the  United Mine Workers of America, toughing it out for a better life in  their workplace.   We have agricultural and industrial workers.   We have workers like those at John Deere represented by the UAW  striking for better conditions.   We had stage and production workers, members of IATSE, go right up to  a strike deadline to demand a better and fairer contract.   We have food production workers, like those from Kellogg's, a company  based in my home State of Michigan.   Rich Trumka knew that workers never want to go on strike, but the  right to withhold your labor is a sacred right that every worker should  possess, and it should be protected by law.   When he had to lead a strike, he showed that he was up to it in order  to get fairness for workers he represented and workers all over this  country.   Madam Speaker, I want to also mention--and Leader Hoyer mentioned  this--that Rich's passing was so unexpected. A number of people have  mentioned this. It was shocking to us because he seemed like such a  strong, strong figure. It is hard to imagine him passing from the  scene.   But I do have to commend the executive council of the AFL-CIO, the  officers of the AFL-CIO, for carrying on. That is what we do in the  labor movement. We carry on the struggle for justice, for the workers  of this country, and in particular, Liz Shuler, who was chosen by the  executive council to step up and become president for the remainder of  Rich's term.   I have known Liz since she was an assistant to the president at IBEW  back when Ed Hill was president there. She was a really important ally  when I was on the AFL-CIO staff, and she was IBEW staff in those days,  then her election as secretary-treasurer, her years of working with  Rich Trumka. I didn't know what to do when he passed, on the morning  that he passed, so I called Liz. She was heartbroken. Yet, she just  immediately stood up and said we will not miss a beat. We will fight on  for the workers of this country.   I know she will do a tremendous job in leading. She is a historic  figure, as Steny Hoyer said, the first woman to lead the national labor  union movement in this country.   In terms of Rich, himself, and his passing and how we should take it,  I want to quote the words of one of my favorite union songs called ``I  Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night,'' a song about a union leader who  was murdered unjustly by the copper bosses. The premise of the song is  Joe Hill appears to someone in a dream, and these lyrics say:       Joe Hill ain't dead, he says to me,      Joe Hill ain't never died.    And now I add working women.       Where working men are out on strike,      Joe Hill is at their side.      Joe Hill is at their side.      From San Diego up to Maine,      In every mine and mill,      Where workers strike and organize,      It's there you'll find Joe Hill.      It's there you'll find Joe Hill.    And Rich Trumka will be there with us in every labor struggle. His  spirit, his militancy, his insistence on justice for working people  will always be with us.   Madam Speaker, I yield to my good friend, the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer), another great colleague who knew Richard  Trumka.    Madam Speaker, I want to end, in the spirit of  Rich Trumka, by thanking my legislative assistant, Meseret Araya, for  doing an amazing job of organizing this Special Order and thanking all  the staff who work the floor of the House of Representatives for doing  such an amazing job of keeping this place running.   Madam Speaker, I want to say to Barbara and the whole Trumka family  that we are so grateful to you for sharing this person with us, with  the mine workers union and with all the unions of the AFL-CIO, and with  all the workers of America and of this world.   Rich, we love you. You will be in our hearts forever. Madam Speaker,  I yield back the balance of my time.
