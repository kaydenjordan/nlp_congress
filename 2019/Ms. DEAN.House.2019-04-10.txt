 Mr. Speaker, over the last 100 days, this Congress has  tackled many of America's central challenges. That starts, of course,  with cleaning up our election system itself, and our vote on H.R. 1 is  a giant step in the right direction.   We have also tackled America's gun violence epidemic by requiring  universal background checks and closing the Charleston loophole.   We have passed H.R. 7, to ensure that equal work means equal pay; and  we have passed the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act,  expanding protections for young victims, survivors, those in shelters,  and LGBTQ people as well. On all of these, we await the Senate's vote.   Now we are advancing more of the public's priorities: H.R. 4, to  restore and protect America's voting rights; H.R. 5, to protect LGBTQ  Americans' rights; and H.R. 6, to defend Dreamers and TPS recipients.   In addition, we are holding hearings on climate change,  infrastructure, and lowering prescription drug costs.   Finally, we are fulfilling our obligation of oversight, defending our  constitutional and democratic norms.   Since January, we have worked to stand up for our fellow citizens and  build a more decent, humane, and caring society.                            ____________________
