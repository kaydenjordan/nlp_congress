 Madam Speaker, I apologize for not being present to vote. I  had a family health emergency in Florida to attend. Had I been present,  I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 100, ``yea'' on rollcall No.  101, ``nay'' on rollcall No. 102, and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 103.                            ____________________
