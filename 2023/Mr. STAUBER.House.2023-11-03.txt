 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer my amendment that prohibits  any funds from being used to carry out the Biden administration's NEPA  Phase 1 rule.   It is clear we have bipartisan consensus--our permitting system is  broken. Our permitting system is holding up projects in every district,  whether it is Republican or Democrat, and NEPA deserves a lot of this  blame.   When NEPA was first passed in 1969, it was a five-page bill. Over the  last 50 years, it has grown out of control thanks to executive actions  and activist courts. Today, NEPA is an albatross, blocking everything  from highway infrastructure projects that connect communities and  enable commerce to energy projects that are necessary for securing our  energy independence.   In 2020, the Trump administration enacted the first real NEPA reforms  in a generation. It helped bring NEPA back to its original intent.  Importantly, the Trump administration's reforms removed the requirement  to consider ``cumulative impacts,'' that go far beyond a proposed  project. This prevented opponents of important projects from abusing  the NEPA process and pointing to outrageous, distant, so-called  cumulative impacts a project could hypothetically pose.   The reforms also forced Federal agencies to build consistency in  permitting reviews and ensured all Federal agencies follow the same  standards and procedures. These reforms began to point us back in the  right direction. The Biden administration's NEPA Phase 1 rule reversed  the Trump-era reforms. It reinstated the cumulative impact  requirements. It gave free rein back to Federal agencies to put up  roadblocks for projects they didn't want.   The Phase 1 rule is just another part of the Biden administration's  anywhere but America, any worker but American agenda.   Mr. Chair, the Biden administration's NEPA Phase 1 rule is a step in  the wrong direction. It is important that we adopt my amendment and  return some sanity to our broken permitting system.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I think my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle don't understand this.   This administration just last month removed NEPA for the Floyd  Bennett Field to host migrants. The Biden administration completely  took NEPA off the table for their agenda because of the open border. By  the way, the IRA, the IIJA, and the CHIPS Act are not going to happen  without permitting reforms and NEPA changes. Come hell or high water,  it is not going to happen without the changes. I think both sides of  the aisle understand that and agree with that.   We have the highest standard of living in the world because of our  process. This administration continues to put up roadblocks for energy  transmission, distribution, generation, mining projects, nuclear  projects, road construction projects, dams, and forest management.  Everything that the American people want to do in a reasonable fashion  is held up in part because of NEPA. This is a very good amendment, and  I urge adoption.   Mr. Chair, in closing, we can agree that our permitting process is  broken. In the debt ceiling, we got a couple of permitting concerns  addressed that were generational, hadn't been done in 40 years. We want  to be able to make sure that the American worker, the American  manufacturer, American technology, our natural resources in our country  can be used responsibly.   Why are we putting agreements together with the Congo to mine our  minerals that we have, for instance, in northern Minnesota, the biggest  copper-nickel find in the world. Why are we doing that?   Why is this administration stopping the American worker, stopping the  creativity that we have, stopping not only our energy independence but  our national security by going to our adversaries and asking them for  our critical minerals or asking them for their energy? We can do  better.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer my amendment that prohibits  any funds from being used to finalize or otherwise carry out the Biden  administration's proposed NEPA Phase 2 rule.   Rather than working to fix our broken permitting system and working  to address the incredible challenges and barriers NEPA poses, the Biden  administration's proposed rule makes our already broken system even  worse. This proposed rule expands the broken NEPA framework, adds  additional requirements, and creates new tools for opponents to shut  down good projects.   The NEPA Phase 2 rule would require Federal agencies not only to  consider climate change but also add a new requirement to consider  environmental justice during the NEPA review process, including  environmental tree justice and tree equity. These new requirements are  just another way that opponents of highway infrastructure projects,  water infrastructure projects, critical mineral mining projects,  renewable energy projects, transmission projects, oil and gas  development projects get to a ``no.'' This administration does not want  to do it here in the United States of America.   Additionally, the NEPA Phase 2 rule violates the reforms Congress has  put forth to address our permitting woes. These reforms were part of  the bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act that we passed earlier this  year.   Trust me, the permitting provisions in the debt ceiling agreement did  not solve all of our permitting problems, but they were an important  step in the right direction. For example, it included strict page  limits and review deadlines for an environmental assessment or an  environmental impact statement.   Does the NEPA Phase 2 rule implement these reforms? Absolutely not.   This administration is not following the laws that Congress put  forward. In fact, when CEQ chair Brenda Mallory, the Biden  administration official tasked with fixing NEPA and our broken  permitting system, testified before the Natural Resources Committee in  June, she claimed the administration didn't need to change a thing.                                time  1000    She told Congress this administration would just follow and do  business as usual.   She falsely claimed that this administration was already doing  everything the debt ceiling agreement instructed it to do, and that is  absolutely not true.   The NEPA Phase 2 rule is a blatant show of disregard for  congressional intent and the law that this body passed and President  Biden signed into law.   The NEPA Phase 2 rule is completely misguided. It is a step in the  wrong direction, and it is important we vote today to prevent the  administration from moving to finalize the rule.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, what this amendment does is that it allows  American energy, American prosperity, American technology, and American  workers to provide energy and critical minerals, transmission projects,  highway and bridge projects, dams and rivers.   This allows us to do it here. This allows our communities to have a  voice in what happens, not Federal three-letter agency bureaucrats  telling the American people what they need and what is best in their  communities because our local elected officials know better than  Washington, D.C., and the bureaucrats.   These three-letter agencies are out of control. They are unelected.  They are not accountable to anybody, and this administration is not  following the laws that this body passed.   For years and years, administrations haven't followed what Congress  and the Senate have put forward. It is about time we do that, and it  can start today.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.  [[Page H5389]]
