 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution.   Without a coherent strategy, such actions as the recent ones that  occurred in Iraq present a dangerous move toward the United States'  engaging in a war that the American people do not want.   Today, we move to reclaim power that the executive branch has tried  to usurp from Congress. We assert our constitutional authority to  determine if the country ought to go to war, and we send a message loud  and clear that we do not want to go to war.   We will not engage in reckless hostilities to endanger American  lives, American interests, and our American values without fully  evaluating imminent threat. We must continue to assert that, without  new authorizations from Congress, this administration cannot engage in  offensive military actions. That is what our Framers intended.
