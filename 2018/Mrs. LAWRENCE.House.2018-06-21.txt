 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to  H.R. 4760, the Securing America's Future Act.   Instead of working in a bipartisan manner, like open rules and  committee hearings, Members of this body now must vote on two bills  that will hurt immigrant families and communities by worsening the  family separation crisis on the border and funding the divisive border  wall.   H.R. 4760 is a hardline anti-immigration bill that fails to provide a  permanent path to citizenship for our Dreamers. It makes family  reunification much more difficult. It provides $25 billion for the  Trump wall. This is while we are going to be confronted with a farm  bill that cuts food for starving and poor children in America. It would  expand the family separation, and it harms children.  [[Page H5427]]    Madam Speaker, this is not the America I know. This bill is nothing  more than an attempt to appease the administration and the most extreme  faction of the Republican Party.
