 Madam Speaker, listening to the initial debate here, you  would believe that there was a legitimate difference of opinion here on  the floor about protecting the Justices. Clearly, there was no such  difference in the U.S. Senate. What there is, though, is a story that I  think needs to be told.                                time  1230    When I authored this legislation a month ago, I knew that we had  support in the Senate, and I knew that we would have support in the  House. The first thing I did was I called up the most senior member of  the Judiciary Committee on the other side of the aisle and said to him  that I believe we should do this. He agreed. Not checking with staff,  he agreed to this simple bill of protecting those who would be  intimidated and those who would be threatened and those whose lives  could not be replaced in a timely fashion without changing the outcome  of the Court. And that was it; I had my cosponsor.   A day later, mysteriously, another bill, very different, was dropped  in the hopper by the Speaker's staff. It was done so without a  Republican cosponsor, without a call to the ranking member who stands  here today. That was done because they wanted to play message with it.  They wanted to delay, and the Speaker has delayed for a month.   Madam Speaker, 18 U.S.C. 1507 is not a suggestion that you prevent  intimidation of the Court. It is a law. It is a law that the President  of the United States has sworn to uphold and, through his Attorney  General, has not, has negated the responsibility.   This legislation is not only essential to protect against another  assassination attempt of a Justice or their family, but it is even more  important because this administration, as we speak, is not obeying the  law that they have sworn to obey, one that the Attorney General is  required to. So, it is a double-edged sword that I come with today.   Democrats took 30 days and waited a week after the attempted  assassination of a Supreme Court Justice before they would bring a  commonsense, noncontroversial piece of legislation to the floor. I  applaud all of those who will vote for it today, and I suspect that it  will be voted for unanimously here on the floor.   But justice delayed, or protection of our Justice delayed, could have  led to the death of a Justice and, even as we speak, still could.   Let's pass it. Let's pass it without further controversy. And let's  never again do something as shameful as ignore the law and delay  protection of people who are being intimidated.
