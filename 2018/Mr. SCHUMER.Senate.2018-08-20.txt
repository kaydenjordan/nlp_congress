 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as we continue the review of the  nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, let's recap what we  already know about the judge.   Judge Kavanaugh's judicial opinions reveal a man skeptical about our  healthcare laws, reproductive rights, contraceptive coverage, and the  basic powers and independence of Federal agencies. His public speeches  and writings reveal a man with a nearly unbounded, almost monarchical  view of Executive power, and yet an incredibly limited interpretation  of Executive accountability. Those beliefs are profoundly troubling at  any moment in time, but they are particularly troubling at this moment  in time as the President of the United States routinely belittles the  rule of law and as his lawyers pronounce that they will fight a duly  authorized subpoena--a subpoena that has been obeyed in the past by  previous Presidents.   There is still much about Judge Kavanaugh we don't know because  Senate Republicans have engaged in a blatant, historic obstruction of a  large portion of his record.   First, Chairman Grassley broke with tradition and fired off a one- sided, partisan request for documents. Senator Feinstein is known as  the most reasonable of Members, and if she couldn't join with Senator  Grassley in a request for documents, clearly, it indicates how biased  that request was.   Chairman Grassley unilaterally declared papers from Judge Kavanaugh's  time as Staff Secretary irrelevant, even though those documents  constitute the bulk of Judge Kavanaugh's record, and Judge Kavanaugh  himself has said those years were among the most instructive as to his  work as a judge.   They keep chipping away at what we are allowed to see, what the  American public is allowed to see about Judge Kavanaugh. Then it was  revealed that a small percentage of the documents we will receive are  being prescreened by a political operative named Bill Burck, a longtime  Republican lawyer and former deputy to Brett Kavanaugh--a man who has  counted among his clients Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, and Don McGahn.  This man is hardly a fount of impartiality. He is a partisan. Mr. Burck  also refuses to provide us with a log of the documents he has withheld.   Why are you withholding this one but not this one? No one is going to  know.   Could it be that some of the information being withheld would be  embarrassing to Judge Kavanaugh or, at the very least, harmful to his  quest to become a Supreme Court Justice? Possibly. The American people  have a right to know.   We have been denied the opportunity to evaluate whether the documents  are being withheld for legitimate or self-interested purposes by a  lawyer who is clearly a partisan.   That is two layers of obfuscation already. First, we are not allowed  to see the most important documents of Judge Kavanaugh's time as  Secretary. Second, of the counsel documents, which are a small  percentage of his total documents, those are being prescreened by a  Republican lawyer, not an impartial observer, who tells us which ones  we can have and which ones we can't, without giving us any reason as to  why one is OK and one isn't.   To make matters worse, Chairman Grassley has added a third level of  withholding documents. He has declared that one-third of the small  prescreened universe of documents only from the counsel's office, only  prescreened by Burck--that wasn't good enough for people who want to  avoid Judge Kavanaugh's record coming out in full. So those are now  deemed ``committee confidential,'' meaning no one outside of the  Judiciary Committee, not even other Senators, can see those documents,  at least by Chairman Grassley's determination. It is outrageous.   Chairman Grassley is usually a fair-minded man. I have enjoyed  working with him on many issues. We are the two Charles E's of the  Senate. We carry, for instance, rural hospital legislation all the time  and help our rural hospitals. When it comes to this area, Chairman  Grassley's actions are manifestly unfair, not typical of his character.  I understand the pressures he is under, but that doesn't forgive the  result.   Withholding documents from the Senate and the American people under  [[Page S5707]]  the bogus label of ``committee confidential'' is a dark development for  the Senate. ``Committee confidential,'' by the way, means that Senators  on the Judiciary Committee can see the documents, but they can't tell  anyone about it--not their fellow Senators, not the American people.  Why shouldn't the American people see them? There are key issues here  that we need to understand better.   On Friday, three of my colleagues raised questions about Judge  Kavanaugh's truthfulness regarding testimony he gave about the Bush  administration's post 9/11 terrorism policies in 2006. We need to  understand the issue better, and we also need to know what he thought  about the Bush administration's efforts on warrantless wiretapping,  efforts to curtail reproductive rights, and more. He testified in 2006,  when he was nominated to join the DC Circuit, and we have to see if he  was being truthful. This is such an important position, the Supreme  Court. We should see those. The American people should.   Locking up documents in committee, even on those important issues, is  an affront to transparency, openness, and to the basic integrity of the  confirmation process. We have been given no reason--no legitimate  reason--why the committee confidential documents are acceptable for  some Senators but not others to see.   My understanding of the Senate rules is that every Senator has the  right to access documents in the possession of a Senate committee, any  Senate committee. I am now going to ask the Chair to confirm that  understanding.   Mr. President, am I correct that under Rule 26.10(a) of the Standing  Rules of the Senate, all committee records are the property of the  Senate as a whole and that all Senators ``shall have access to such  records''?    Thank you. The words say ``shall have access to those  records.''   Is there anything that undoes those words in the rules?    Yes. I asked if, under the rules, all committee Senate  records are the property of the Senate as a whole and that all Senators  shall have access to those records--shall have access.   The Presiding Officer said: Yes, those are, in part, the rules. Of  course, those are not all of the rules.   Is there anything the Presiding Officer knows in the rules that would  undercut that ruling in the Senate rules?    Fine. Then it is clear there is nothing that undercuts-- I appreciate the Chair's reading of the entire rule. Nothing in the  rest of the rule undercuts what I have said, obviously.   Based on your ruling--the ruling of the Chair--I will therefore be  submitting a request to the chairman and the ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee for access by all Senators to all of the Kavanaugh  documents in the possession of the committee. This request will include  approximately 81,000 pages of documents that have been deemed  ``committee confidential'' by the private lawyer, Mr. Burck, and by the  chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley. My colleagues should do  the same.   Again, the purpose here isn't dilatory. We will work hard, day and  night, to go through these documents to see if anything worth  questioning Judge Kavanaugh arises in them. We certainly have that  right, by the rules of the Senate, and I am glad the Chair so  interpreted it.   This is not just about rules or about having more reading material.  This is about the Senate, and by extension the American people,  understanding the stakes and consequences of elevating Judge Kavanaugh  to a lifetime appointment on our Nation's highest Court. This is about  our constitutional duty to advise and consent on a Supreme Court  nominee. Senators cannot do that in an informed manner without fair and  full access to a nominee's record. And, of course, the Constitution  assigns this duty to Senators on behalf of the American people. Without  access to the nominee's record, the American people will be in the  dark. That is unacceptable.                            ____________________     Finally, on another matter--I see that my colleague from  Vermont, who, incidentally, is doing an excellent job on the  appropriations bills, which I believe he will want to discuss--is  waiting. One more matter: Last week, the Trump administration announced  it was revoking the security clearance of a former Director of the CIA.  The action was taken not after a thorough review of the security  clearance process. It did not affect a new policy. The revocation of  the former CIA Director's security clearance was a gratuitous act of  political retribution taken out of spite and malice--sometimes,  unfortunately, attributes the President shows. It was an attempt to  silence critics of the President--something the President regularly  tries to do, usually unsuccessfully.   My Republican colleague, Senator Corker, said this in July about the  possibility of President Trump's revoking security clearances. This is  Republican Senator Bob Corker, a well-respected man in America. He  said:         When you're going to start taking retribution against       people who are your political enemies . . . that's the kind       of thing that happens in Venezuela. . . . it's a banana       republic kind of thing.    Senator Corker is right. The abuse of the powers of public office to  silence critics and punish political enemies is exactly what goes on in  dictatorships, in banana republics. We are not one of those, thank God.   Then we found out on Saturday that the President is openly  considering reaching into the Justice Department to revoke security  clearances of a current career professional--this professional that the  President mentioned works drug cases, anti-gang cases--based solely on  rumors and innuendo spread by the chairman of the House Intelligence  Committee--hardly a credible source--and spurious other sources.  Revoking the clearance of current Justice Department officials without  cause is so far out of bounds for what can be considered the proper use  of Presidential power that it is appalling. The words of Senator Corker  are even more strongly felt.   What is next? Will President Trump decide to revoke the security  clearance of everyone working for Special Counsel Mueller because he  thinks it is in his craven political interest? There is enormous  potential for gross abuse of Presidential power.   Congress, on a bipartisan basis, ought to make sure the President  does not politicize the security clearance policy. Revoking a security  clearance is a decision that should be done for national security  reasons and national security reasons alone.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
