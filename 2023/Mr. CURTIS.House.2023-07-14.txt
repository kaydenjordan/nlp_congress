 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend  and dedicated public servant. Last week, Wayne Parker, Provo City's  chief administrative officer for two decades, announced his retirement.   Having served with Mr. Parker for 8 years, I know firsthand how  impossible it is to fully grasp the positive impact of Wayne Parker on  Provo City. His touch for good can be found in everything we like about  Provo.   For many years he has worked without fanfare or attention. Those of  us that know his work best know that everything from our vibrant  economy to our fun downtown and so much more have been blessed by  Wayne's hard work and dedication to Provo City.   Because of his great leadership skills, Wayne was awarded the 2020  Award for Career Excellence from the International City/County  Management Association. This award was a recognition of Wayne's impact  on the quality of life in Provo.   I hope that his retirement brings joy and happiness. Those of us that  call Provo home will never forget all he has done for us as a city. I  know I will never forget all he has done for me.                            ____________________
