 Mr. President, before we break for the Fourth of July  recess, I think it is important for the Senate to go on record  condemning the rising tide of mob violence that we see across the  country and the increasingly prevalent mob mentality that is fueling  it. The violence struck home for me this week when one of my  constituents was shot after an armed mob surrounded his vehicle in  Provo, UT.   This resolution is not controversial. Even in these divisive times,  it is something, I think, we can all agree on, and I want to read  through some highlights right now so you get a feel for it.         The United States of America was founded in 1776 on       universal principles of freedom, justice, and human equality.        Throughout our nation's history, Americans have struggled       to realize those ideals . . . but nonetheless [have made]       greater progress toward them than any [other] nation on       earth.        [The United States is a diverse nation] committed to       cultivating respect, friendship, and justice across all such       differences, and protecting the God-given equal rights of all       Americans under the law.        America's law enforcement officers do an extremely       difficult job extremely well, and despite the inexcusable       misconduct of some, the overwhelming majority of such       officers are honest, courageous, patriotic, and rightfully       honored public servants.        In recent weeks, people across the United States have       organized legitimate, peaceful, constitutionally protected       demonstrations against instances of police brutality and       racial inequality.        [Some of these Americans have organized these peaceful       protests, asking for investigations into serious problems       meriting investigation and reform.]        Some Americans, unsatisfied with peaceful and positive       demonstrations, have instigated and indulged in mob violence       and criminal property destruction, not in service of any . .       . coherent cause, but simply as an arrogant, bullying tantrum       of self-righteous illiberalism and rage.        These mobs have demonstrated not only contempt for public       safety (as evidenced, among other crimes, by an unprovoked       physical assault on a Wisconsin State Senator and the [more       recent] shooting of a motorist in Provo, Utah) and common       decency (as evidenced by their . . . obscene berating of law       enforcement officers standing their posts to protect their       communities), but also their manifest ignorance and       historical illiteracy (as evidenced by their destruction of       public memorials to historical heroes like Ulysses S. Grant,       St. Junipero Serra, Miguel Cervantes, George Washington, Hans       Christian Heg, and a reported plan to target a statue of       Abraham Lincoln financed in 1876 entirely by private       donations from freed African-American slaves).        It is the sense of the Senate that the rising tide of       vandalism, mob violence, and the mob mentality that feeds       it--including its cruel and intolerant ``cancel culture''--      should be condemned by all Americans; [that] peaceful       demonstrations and mob violence are different in kind; [that]       physical assault and  [[Page S4182]]       property destruction are not forms of political speech but       violent crimes whose perpetrators should be prosecuted to the       full extent of the law; and [that] the innocent law       enforcement officers, public officials, and private citizens       who suffer the mob's violence and endure its scorn while       protecting our communities from them deserve [every       American's thanks and appreciation].    As I say, it is very straightforward.   As we saw in Seattle this week, these mobs are not going to stop  until they are stopped. A nonbinding resolution is the tiniest first  step of a response--the merest exercise of the Senate's atrophied  institutional muscles. We need to do much, much more, and I look  forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  develop the legislation to do it.   Yet, in this divided political moment, heading into the 244th  birthday of the greatest, freest, most tolerant, and prosperous nation  the world has ever known, I think showing that Senate Republicans and  showing that Senate Democrats can work together and speak with one  voice against woke mob violence and in defense of equal justice and  civic peace would be a welcomed step.   Therefore, Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S.  Res. 645, submitted earlier today. I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to; that the preamble be agreed to; and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.    Reserving the right to object, as I look at the language  proposed by my colleague from New Jersey, I would accept the rest of it  except for the words ``especially the President of the United States.''  The rest of it is unobjectionable.   The point here is that without pointing to any one specific  individual, we should all be able to acknowledge, as a sense of the  Senate, that we do hold these truths as self-evident; that our country  was founded on these very strong ideals. Even if, as the resolution  itself acknowledges, we have failed at times to live up to them, we  have still done it.   So I would accept the modification but only with the removal of the  words ``especially the President of the United States.''    Mr. President, what is happening here? This is the U.S.  Senate. Just so everyone is clear about the bat guano-inspired insanity  we just witnessed, I just proposed a nonbinding resolution condemning  mob violence, and Senate Democrats objected. I don't know whether to be  outraged or embarrassed for them. This isn't even a bill; it is just a  statement that says mob violence is bad. Democrats can't say mob  violence is bad without simultaneously taking a jab at the President of  the United States?   By the way, what about the mayor of Seattle? What about the city  council of Minnesota? What about the countless other people who have  perpetuated or enabled or facilitated or coddled mob violence across  the country?   It is one of the reasons why we are not going to engage in this task  of making it a political tit-for-tat. It is not that. People are being  shot. Businesses are being looted. Innocent Americans are being  attacked and threatened. Lives are being ruined. Communities are  burning--literally burning.   So whose side are you on? This resolution was designed to be  unifying. It avoided controversial subjects.    Mr. President, the resolution was designed to be unifying.  It avoided controversial subjects. All it asks of us is basic dignity  and respect.   As long as we are on the topic of rule XIX, it is unbecoming to  accuse a colleague of using language that is supremacy simply by  reflecting on language in the Declaration of Independence, simply by  reflecting on language that acknowledges the incivility and  intolerability of mob violence. But apparently that is too much to ask  today. I guess we should be thankful for clarity. And now we know. We  don't have to ask. They told us how they feel about this resolution.   You can't really oppose this, it seems to me, without being on the  side of the mobs, of mob violence, of mob mentality, of cruelty and  intolerance and terror. Now we understand what this resolution is  about. I don't think one can oppose this without being comfortable with  those things. These mobs  [[Page S4183]]  are not progressive. These mobs are not enlightened. These mobs are not  edgy. They are not hip. They are frauds. They are dim-witted, phony,  drama addicts----    Failed by an education system and addled by a social media  culture that taught them to be victims instead of citizens. A  privileged, self-absorbed crime syndicate with participation-trophy  graduate degrees, trying to find meaning in empty lives by destroying  things that other Americans have spent honest, productive lives  building.   Today we learned--today we learned--that there are those who are  comfortable with this. There are those who are at least not inclined to  vote for this resolution, which simply condemns mob violence. Now we  know. Now we know.   I want all my colleagues to know that when we return from recess, we  are coming back to the Senate floor and we are not just going to be  debating nonbinding resolutions. It is long past time to expose the  shiftless idiocy of the anti-American, anti-science, anti- establishment, anti-Constitution mob and remove their snouts from the  Federal trough.   Colleges and universities that punish free speech and discriminate  against conservative and religious students; city councils that defund  their police departments and refuse to protect public safety; States  that force doctors to mutilate confused children without their parents'  consent; school districts that embrace the ahistorical nonsense of the  1619 Project; the smug, sneering privilege of all of the above and much  more--the whole garbage fire that is the so-called ``woke'' ideology-- depends on Federal money.   The mob hates America on America's dime. It is time to cut off their  allowance. I think the American people would be very interested to know  who stands for them and who stands for subsidizing the mob. I intend to  show them.   Mr. President, this debate is not ending today; it is only the  beginning.    Mr. President, all I asked in my counter was that we remove  the words ``especially the President of the United States.'' Why?  Because it is different than the entire approach taken by the  resolution.   As long as we are calling each other out on casting aspersions on  each other's intentions, no one's intention here is to shield anyone  from anything, as evidenced by the fact that, as my proposed  modification would have provided, it would have said that ``our elected  officials should not incite violence or legitimize those who engage in  hate-fueled acts.'' Last I checked, the President of the United States  was and is an elected official. This would apply to him. My counter in  no way insulated--not him, not any elected official, not any of us from  this resolution, which simply condemns mob violence.
