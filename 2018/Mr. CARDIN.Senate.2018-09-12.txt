 Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators  Collins, King, Brown, Markey, Murphy, Menendez, Warren, Klobuchar,  Blumenthal, Hassan, Jones, Van Hollen, Casey, Baldwin, and Donnelly to  recognize the week beginning September 9th, 2018 as National Direct  Support Professionals Recognition Week. Direct Support Professionals  are an invaluable part of our Nation's health care system, caring for  the most vulnerable Americans, including the chronically ill, seniors,  and those living with a disability. With the help of Direct Support  Professionals, these individuals can perform daily activities that many  people take for granted, such as eating, bathing, dressing, and leaving  the house. The work of Direct Support Professionals ensures that these  individuals can be active participants in their communities.   Let me share with you the experience of Euricka Stevens, a direct  support professional who was recognized this year for her incredible  work and dedication when she was given Maryland's Direct Support  Professional, DSP, of the Year Award by the American Network of  Community Options and Resources, ANCOR. It was said of Euricka that  she, ``doesn't see limitations or disabilities. She sees a person for  their distinctive collection of traits and strengths and frailties and  meets them there. She listens to the person and has an uncanny knack  for unearthing what makes them remarkable.''   For example, there was an instance where a non-verbal individual was  experiencing distress. Euricka was able to patiently determine that he  was bothered by noise and calmed by sitting in a recliner. Because of  her efforts, this individual is now able to participate in the life of  the center, and have his needs taken care of if he is showing signs of  discomfort.   As Euricka's story demonstrates, the job of a direct support  professional is not easy. The hours are often long, and the wages are  low. The job can be physically laborious, as well as emotionally  draining. The reward for direct support professionals, however, is that  they are able to improve the lives of individuals with disabilities and  help fulfill the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act by  making it possible for these Americans to participate in their  communities to the fullest extent possible.   In our Nation, we are incredibly fortunate to have millions of  service-oriented individuals who are willing to rise to the task of  becoming a Direct Support Professional. According to the Bureau of  Labor Statistics, the employment of DSPs is projected to grow by an  average of 26 percent from 2014 to 2024, compared to a 7 percent  average growth rate for all occupations during that period.  Unfortunately, direct support professionals are often forced to leave  the jobs they love due to low wages and excessive, difficult, work  hours. Many Direct Support Professionals rely on public benefits, and  some must work multiple jobs in order to provide for themselves and  their families. Now, more than ever, it is imperative that we work to  ensure that these hard-working individuals have the income and  emotional support they need and deserve.   I urge my colleagues to join me and Senators Collins, King, Brown,  Markey, Murphy, Menendez, Warren, Klobuchar, Blumenthal, Hassan, Jones,  Van Hollen, Casey, Baldwin, and Donnelly in expressing our appreciation  for the critically important work of our country's Direct Support  Professionals, in thanking them for their commitment and dedication,  and in supporting the resolution designating the week beginning  September 9, 2018, as National Direct Support Professionals Recognition  Week.                            ____________________
