 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate  Black History Month. This month is designed to celebrate the  achievements of African Americans and the significant role that they  have played in our Nation's history.   The State of Florida is home to one such leader, Hillsborough  County's Clarence Fort. Mr. Fort organized and participated in Tampa's  first lunch counter sit-in in the downtown Woolworth's department  store. After a week of nonviolent sit-ins, Tampa's mayor appointed a  biracial committee to discuss segregation. By September 1960, the  city's lunch counters were integrated.   Mr. Fort also led the initiative to integrate the workforce of Tampa  Transit Lines and later went on to serve 20 years as a Hillsborough  County sheriff's deputy.   Strong men and women like Clarence Fort persevered during some of  America's most divided periods. His strength and courage are part of  what makes our Nation great.   Madam Speaker, I thank all the brave African Americans whose positive  influence and impact inspire us this month and every month of the year.                            ____________________
