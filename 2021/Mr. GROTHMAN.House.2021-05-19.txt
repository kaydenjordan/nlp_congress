 Mr. Speaker, a tragedy is going on in Israel. Over  4,000 rockets have been shot from Gaza and a handful from Lebanon.  Twelve Israelis and about 200 Gazans have died. This is entirely  unprovoked on Israel's part. It may have something to do with a future  election on the West Bank. Iran is showing support for Hamas and is  giving them financial aid, so they are partly responsible.   Gaza, of course, could be a liveable, modern country. It used to be a  vacation destination. And prior to 2005, when Israel turned it over,  there were greenhouses for an agriculture sector. It is their own fault  by collectively electing a government which not only declares a  unilateral war, but chooses residential and commercial facilities as  military locations, guaranteeing deaths of civilians, including  children.   Israel is a strong country, and, of course, they will not be defeated  militarily. There is a danger, however. As explained by James Burnham  in his book, ``Suicide of the West''--now over 50 years old--a decadent  West may blame themselves for the corruption and lack of caring for  human life in Gaza.   Some Members of this body are already doing this.   The United States and Israel must not shirk from our responsibilities  as moral leaders of the world. We support Israel in defending  themselves from the attacks of the morally bankrupt government in Gaza.  We encourage them to continue this fight for as long as necessary to  make sure their citizens are not at risk in the future.    Mr. Speaker, since our last couple of floor periods, I  had a chance to visit our southern border one more time, and I would  like to point out what is going on there because I think it is the most  important issue in America today.   So that our listeners understand, there are two classes of people who  come to our border. There are people who are caught or deal with the  Border Patrol--and a lot of people want to be found by the Border  Patrol because they think they can come into this country through an  asylum process--and there are other people who sneak across the border.   In April, our Border Patrol touched--or dealt with about 178,000  individuals. A year ago, that number was 17,000. So we have voluntarily  gone up from having the Border Patrol deal with about 17,000 to  178,000.   As we deal with more people who are touched by the Border Patrol, the  Border Patrol has to spend more time doing paperwork, particularly with  the children.   We have another group of people coming across the border called get-  [[Page H2607]]  aways. Because they are get-aways, nobody knows exactly how many there  are. We do have drones. We do have our new wall together with sensors.  And we are guessing right now that the number of get-aways has gone  from about 10,000 a month a year ago to 30,000 a month.   We feel when you combine the two totals, we are going from about  10,000 a month people coming across our border to--just guessing--70-  to 80,000 people a month crossing our border.   One thing I found at the border is that it is a misnomer to say most  or all of these people are necessarily coming from Mexico or Central  America. The last time I was down there, we looked at the three western  sectors of the Mexican border. There are nine sectors. We looked at the  San Diego, El Centro, and Yuma sectors.   In the San Diego sector, the second most common nationality coming  across at the time we were down there was Russian. In the other two  sectors, the most common nationality for quite a while had been  Brazilian.   While I was there, we watched Border Patrol process a group of about  40 people coming across. They weren't even from one country. It was a  group, and some of the people were from Russia, some were from Romania,  some were from Cuba.    When we looked at the facilities the Border Patrol had down there,  they had names of countries in--what else to call them--pens, where  they were holding people. Sometimes a lot of people were kind of  squished together.   Another country that people are commonly coming from was Ecuador. I  said a lot of people are coming here from Cuba. We saw a large pen for  people from India, though, to be honest, nobody was in it. But in any  event, people are coming here from all around the world.   We also noticed at the border that the huge slats used to build the  wall, which they had to cut short on, are apparently being stolen.  Somebody paid for all these things that were supposed to be used to  build a wall that was 30 feet high above the ground and 8 feet below  the ground.   We cut short the building of that wall right when President Biden was  sworn in. We already paid for the equipment. There was a lot of  equipment used to put together the wall that had been rented.  Apparently that money was wasted. Right now, the slats used for the  wall are apparently being stolen at night by people who are selling  them on the market.   One other observation about the wall: There has been an increase of  traffic coming by boat in the San Diego area. And the reason the Border  Patrol thinks that is true or the reason it is true is because of the  effectiveness of the wall. Because the wall is doing a good job, people  are more likely to get in a boat, go 20 miles out to sea and 20 miles  back to come in.   The people who are let in this country pending an asylum hearing are  put all over the country. They are frequently left with a nonprofit  organization, perhaps the Catholic Social Services, and they find  somewhere for them everywhere you look.   Another thing that you have to realize as things get worse with the  wall is the number of drugs coming across the southern border. I had  always wondered what would happen to the drug cartels as marijuana was  legalized in the United States. One of the arguments for legalization  of marijuana is it would weaken the drug cartels. Because they would no  longer have to sneak the drugs across the border, that what would  happen is that they would grow the marijuana in greenhouses here-- Colorado, Washington, where have you--and the drug gangs would dry up.  Not so.   I recently heard an anecdote in which a lot of marijuana was shipped  across the border, and they couldn't find anybody to sell it to because  the quality of marijuana grown in America is superior to the marijuana  grown in Mexico. Because it is no longer that profitable to ship  marijuana across the border, what happens is there has been a dramatic  increase in more severe drugs: heroin; cocaine; meth; and the worst of  all, fentanyl.   We recently hit a new record in which we have had 90,000 deaths in a  12-month period in the United States. In Milwaukee County, of which I  represent a part, there were 540 deaths last year. Milwaukee County is  not big like Cook County or some of these other counties around here.  It is about a million people. 540 deaths in Milwaukee County is a huge  deal. For whatever reason, I think the press has underpublicized it.                                time  2110    I think one of the reasons for the big increases is because you are  seeing more and more dangerous drugs coming across the southern border.   I would like to give a tip of the cap to the dogs that the Border  Patrol uses at the border. When we were down there, we saw dogs who had  detected fentanyl located in a gas tank. Of course, a gas tank smells  so much, you figure there is no way that a dog could detect that  because the smell of the gasoline is so strong. But even there, the  dogs had detected it.   The thing is, the dogs could only sniff so many cars coming across.  It would be a good idea if the Border Patrol would get more dogs.   In any event, if you want to talk about an underpublicized problem:  90,000 deaths in America last year from drug overdoses. At least at the  drug administration in Milwaukee County, they speculated that the drugs  that killed every one of the 540 people down there, either the drugs  themselves or the ingredients for the drugs came across the southern  border.   Now, you might say: Can we do anything to prevent this? Can we do  anything to prevent there being 17,000 up to 178,000 contacts coming  across the border? Yes.   Why did we not have a problem a little while ago, and what changed  it?   First of all, President Trump had negotiated something called the  migrant protection protocol in which people were held on the Mexican  side of the border pending a hearing for asylum. Because of that, less  people showed up in the first place. President Biden got rid of  President Trump's agreement with Mexico to hold people at the southern  border. First of all, more people are let in right away, and secondly,  it advertises to prospective illegal immigrants around the world that  now is the time to come.   Secondly, we had an asylum cooperative agreement with the Central  American countries to hold people south of the Mexican border. In other  words, if somebody wanted to come up from Venezuela and said, ``I need  protection. I need asylum,'' they were held in Central American  countries. Obviously, if they were concerned that they were being  persecuted by the government, why would you have to come to the United  States? It would be perfectly fine to stay in Guatemala, stay in El  Salvador, wherever. That agreement was torn apart.   Finally, we changed the way we are dealing with COVID. Given the big  deal we make about COVID, it is kind of surprising the Biden  administration is letting people in without being tested for COVID, but  they are.   Between these three things, we have managed to go to probably about  10,000 people who we don't want coming here a month to an unknown  number, but probably 70,000 to 80,000.   I am afraid what will happen is that number will continue to grow.  One of the reasons it is so much greater than it was in the past is  because the gangs that help people get here charge people to come here.  They charge $3,000 for a Mexican to cross the border, about $5,000 for  a Central American. I am told $9,000 to $10,000 for a Brazilian.   Obviously, as it is easier to come here, the drug gangs will educate  people in other countries and market in other countries to see if they  can get here.   Other comments that I learned at the border: We already, in this  fiscal year, have 6,000 arrests. That is over twice the amount we had  in the entire last fiscal year. And these are for very serious crimes.   I also want to point out that usually you frequently only know if  somebody has committed a crime or if somebody is a criminal if they  committed a crime in this country. You don't know if they are coming  here to escape from another country. So, we are letting an increased  number of a criminal class in this country.   It is estimated that 33 percent of the women who come to this  country, on their way up, as they walk through Mexico, are abused. Some  of these women may find they have to pay the  [[Page H2608]]  money they are supposed to give to the gangs by being trafficked, and  that is a horrible thing. I don't know where these people are in this  building who purport to be concerned about human trafficking, but one  way women can pay their way, for their $5,000 or $8,000 or whatever, is  obvious. The current system encourages that.   Another problem with it is when people cross the border, and it is a  very mountainous border, whether you are in Arizona, whether you are in  California, whether you are in New Mexico, you can wind up dehydrating  to death. The drug gangs that show people how to get here do not take  people necessarily all the way to civilization. They take them across  the Mexican border, and they may say there is a town 10 miles that way  or 15 miles that way. There may or may not be a town that close.   The Americans do put jugs of water out for people and hope they  survive. But last year, in the Tucson sector alone, they found 100  people dehydrated to death, which is another problem that you have with  this hodgepodge at the border.   Another problem that you find out is the children who come across the  border, sometimes the children are people who are borrowed or rented or  whatever from other people and are not related to the people who claim  to be their parents or relatives in some fashion. Sometimes, we are  able to identify that with DNA testing. Sometimes, we don't.   Children come up, maybe young children, even 7- or 8-year-old  children, have fastened to their clothing who they are supposed to  contact when they come here. The United States, under a bad court  decision--in my opinion, a bad court decision--those children, rather  than, say, being sent back to their parents in Honduras, may be sent to  their supposed aunt or uncle in New York.   In the United States, when the children come to the border, they  provide transportation to get those little kids to somewhere in the  United States. The idea being that once one child comes here,  eventually, the rest of the family is going to follow.   All the way across the board, we have a very dangerous situation. I  implore the Biden administration to do something about this, and I  implore the American public to get upset about this and demand that  their Congressman does something.    I think the first thing we have to do is, of course, beg the Mexican  Government to reinstate the migrant protection protocol, beg the  Central American governments to reinstate the asylum cooperative  agreements, and do what we can to immediately test for COVID the people  coming across the border.   The next thing we have to do, Mr. President, is address the Vice  President. The Vice President was appointed over 8 weeks ago now to be  the czar for the southern border. I have been at the border three times  this year. You do not know what is going on at the border unless you  literally sit down, talk to the Border Patrol agents, talk to law  enforcement of the counties that are on the border, talk to the  ranchers who have to live with people crossing their land.   Clearly, Vice President Harris is not interested in finding these  things out. I have made bad hires in my life. I have assigned people to  jobs that maybe they couldn't do that well. I beg President Biden, who  says he is a moderate, to find somebody else to be the border czar.   The current situation in which we have the number of people let in  this country rocketing up is just unacceptable. If Ms. Harris, or Vice  President Harris, can go 8 weeks without visiting the border, it  clearly shows that she is insubordinate, is not interested in doing a  good job. There must be somebody else in the Biden administration who  can pick up the slack and express some interest in closing our border.   I should digress and point out that this does not mean we are anti- immigration. In 2019, almost 850,000 new citizens were sworn in, in  this country. There are work visas, as well. There are plenty of ways  to come into this country legally, but we do not need this massive sea  of people coming here illegally.   Again, I implore the American public. When we see the Border Patrol  touch 178,000 people a month, that is unacceptable. When we talk about  30,000 getaways, that is not acceptable. The numbers are going to  continue to spiral up as we have had public comments from both the  President and Vice President that indicate they are not interested in  enforcing our laws.                                time  2120    Now I would like to touch briefly on another crisis that I hope the  American public expresses their concern about during our 3-week recess.   There have always been people trying to destroy America. And America  is such a hope for people all around the world, both our example and  the fact that we do have many immigrants coming here. There have been  various ideologies which have been used to overthrow our government, or  change our government so it is no longer in accordance with our  Constitution.   John Adams said our Constitution is fit for a moral and religious  people and not fit for anyone else.   There was a time when Marxists traditionally felt they could  destabilize the American population and that way have a rebellion in  the United States. Eventually, they gave up hope on traditional  Marxism, or at least gave up hope for a while.   The reason they gave up hope is, quite frankly, the American middle  class was so prosperous. And in America you could find just by going to  work, working hard, saving some money, you could buy a house bigger  than what you would find in any other country. And as a result, the  lure of Marxism, which took over in China--albeit with some mistakes  made by the American Government--which took over in Russia, which took  over in Cambodia, resulting in maybe over 100 million deaths of  Marxists caused in other countries, not to mention the destruction of  the churches, the destruction of the family. That failed.   More recently, the left-wingers in our university system has taken it  upon themselves to talk about critical race theory. Now under classic  Marxism, they try to take over by educating the American public that  they should be bitter and angry, and they should want to revolt so that  they could own the factories or own the big houses, and have a  revolution that way.   The new effort is to try to create anger based on race, and they call  it critical race theory. And they want to tell people that if you don't  have all you have, it must be because of racism. If you don't have the  nice house you want, if you don't have a big amount in your savings  account, or whatever, that is the problem.   Recently, I ran into a little bit of what I will call critical race  theory in one of my local high schools. In the high school, a teacher  educated a class, which was devoted to racism, mentioned that in the  past year, 4 percent of the kids in this high school were Black, and 20  percent of the kids who were arrested were Black. The teacher told the  kids, of course, or implied to the kids that this was the result of  racism.   There is a problem twice. First of all, you are educating people in  the United States of America, which we have just covered, the whole  rest of the world wants to get in here. You are educating kids that  America is not worth preserving, America is not worth fighting for,  America is a bad country.   Secondly, you educate people that if they are arrested for drugs, for  fighting, what have you, or if the police interact with you, it is not  a matter of you did something wrong, it is a matter of racism.   I can't think of any clearer way to make sure that people do not  progress in our system than telling them that if they do something  wrong, the punishment was not because they deserve the punishment, it  was because of racism. But this is the mindset that is out there right  now in our schools. It is the mindset that is out there in our large  businesses and in our military.   I think people have to educate themselves as to what critical race  theory is, because clearly, the goal of critical race theory is to make  people not proud or not respect the United States and, furthermore,  make people bitter and angry, and tell people rather than work hard-- you work 45-50 hours a week, try to afford a house, try to have  children, buy a car--it tells people if you don't have all you want, it  is because of racism.  [[Page H2609]]    And there is no way teaching our young people that is going to lead  to anything other than resentment and a great deal of unhappiness. I  think it is obvious that America does not have the racist problems that  other countries have. And I beg people to read about countries like  India, countries like Somalia, where minor ethnic differences result in  deaths, huge amounts of discrimination.   Here in the United States, in recent years, Asians, and before that,  many other different so-called minority groups outdid financially-- finances aren't everything--but financially exceeded the native-born.   We can see that America is not a racist country because I talked  about, a second ago, people from all around the world are trying to get  in here, and almost nobody ever wants to leave. So when it really comes  to saying it is bad, no one wants to leave, but the whole rest of the  world tries to come here, be it from Africa, be it from Latin America,  be it from the Indian subcontinent, be it from Southeast Asia.   So many wonderful people come here. My district has a lot of Hmong  who are tremendously successful, despite coming from a very different  background, loving America, taking full advantage of the opportunities  that are there.   However, if we let this pernicious ideology get in our schools and  get in our businesses, it will be a success for the left-wing groups  that have always wanted to destroy the special country that is America.   And I encourage parents and grandparents and employees to report or  publicize when they are forced to put up with this stuff in the schools  or in the businesses.   There is something for our wonderful American listeners to deal with  over the next 3 weeks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
