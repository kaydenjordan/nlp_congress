 Mr. Speaker, let me make one thing clear: Israel has never  been and will never be an apartheid state.   Amnesty International's latest report that labels Israel as an  apartheid state is nothing short of an outright denial of the Jewish  State's right to exist. This report should be condemned immediately. It  is the textbook definition of anti-Semitism.   Instead of peddling these falsehoods and baseless allegations,  Amnesty International would do well to focus on the human rights  violations of the Chinese Communist Party.   America has stood side by side with Israel since its creation, and  our shared values remain the keystone of our strategic partnership.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with Israel and the Jewish  community. They deserve our unwavering support.                            ____________________
