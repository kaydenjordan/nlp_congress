 Mr. Speaker, I am proud today to speak on behalf of the  Strategic Forces portion of the Mac Thornberry National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Ranking Member Thornberry for his  outstanding 25 years of service in this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to extend my thanks to Ranking Member  Turner and all of our subcommittee members for their contributions to  the bill. Our subcommittee has particularly heavy, often technical  responsibilities.   This bill does make America stronger and safer by improving the odds  for peace and stability with regard to our nuclear forces, hypersonic  weapons, and space and missile defense.   Preventing a nuclear attack is the first responsibility of the U.S.  Government. It is absolutely imperative to ensure our nuclear forces  are safe, secure, and reliable and that we strengthen our  nonproliferation efforts. This mark ensures that the Departments of  Defense and Energy are wisely spending their budgets in a responsible  and efficient manner.   Regarding space, we continue our focus on protecting our space  assets. The bill also focuses on near-term priorities for hypersonic  weapons in a way that avoids increasing the risks of ambiguity and  miscalculation.   We continue oversight in missile defense, including supporting U.S.- Israeli cooperation. In addition, after the failure of the redesigned  kill vehicle program, the bill strengthens oversight of the next- generation interceptor program.    Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would like to thank our outstanding  staff: Leonor Tomero, Jason Schmid, Maria Vastola, Grant Schneider, and  Zach Taylor.
