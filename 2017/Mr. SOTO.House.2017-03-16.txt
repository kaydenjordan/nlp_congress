 Mr. Chairman, we send our servicemen and -women overseas in  harm's way to protect our country because we know that freedom isn't  free. So it is fundamental, as we, with such vigor, ask them to go to  the battlefield, that we protect them when they are off the  battlefield. And it is fundamental that, when they return, they have a  world-class hospital system.   Now, today we begin consideration of H.R. 1367, which is exciting  because it is a bipartisan bill to improve the VA's authority to hire,  train, and retain physicians and other critical staff in the Veterans  Health Administration.    Over the last 5 years, we have seen more than 2 million veterans  enroll in the VA healthcare system, and we believe--both parties  believe that nothing should stand in the way of any veteran having  confidence in and access to care and benefits they earned and deserve.   I represent the central Florida area, and we are so honored to have a  brand new Orlando VA, in a high-growth area, and the need is great. I  was also honored to be able to have an office right across the street  from the VA hospital that we just opened up last week, to be in  proximity and to help our veterans.   But I can tell you, having met with some of our veterans already, we  are looking at 3- to 6-month waits, even in a new facility.   A gentleman, who I will refer to as Mr. Smith so that I don't divulge  his personal information, came to me yesterday, and he had issues with  a podiatrist. He was not able to see them over the next couple of  weeks. And in his goat farm in my district, he is unable to pursue his  gainful employment, and we are trying to get him in over the next 2  weeks, but it could be 3 to 4 weeks.   So we need to stand together to restore trust and accountability and  fill these positions. And so I applaud both parties, and I am excited  for the Veterans' Affairs Committee to take this bold action to recruit  and retain the most talented workforce, which is well-needed to provide  quality and timely medical care for our Nation's veterans, for those in  central Florida, Florida, and beyond.                                time  1830
