 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Native American  Heritage Month by honoring the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska on their 30th  anniversary of restoration as a federally recognized Tribe.   The Ponca Tribe was originally part of the Omaha Tribe and settled  near the Niobrara River of Nebraska in 1793. In 1877, the Ponca Tribe  was forcibly removed from their beloved Niobrara River homeland and  sent to Indian territory in central Oklahoma.   During their first year in Oklahoma, 25 percent of the Ponca Tribe  died from malaria and starvation. Among the dead was Chief Standing  Bear's eldest son Bear Shield, who had pleaded to be laid to rest in  their sacred burial grounds. A few weeks later, in January of 1879,  Chief Standing Bear began the 600-mile trek to their Niobrara homeland.   Just 2 days shy of their homeland, during a brief stop at the Omaha  reservation, the group was stopped and arrested for leaving Oklahoma.  The arrest led to the landmark case of Standing Bear v. Crook, which  established the precedent of recognizing ``Indian'' as an equal person  under the law, including the constitutional guarantee of fair treatment  during trial.   At the end of the trial, Chief Standing Bear delivered a speech  demanding equality, with the famous words: ``That hand is not the color  of yours, but if I prick it, the blood will flow, and I shall feel  pain. The blood is the same color as yours. God made me, and I am a  man.'' After the trial, Chief Standing Bear and his companions were  allowed to return to their Niobrara homeland.   However, in 1962, Congress decided the Ponca Tribe would be among the  Tribes no longer recognized. Two decades later, in 1986, the Northern  Ponca Restoration Committee was created by Fred LeRoy, a veteran and a  Ponca himself. Within 2 years, LeRoy drafted the petition for  restoration, and the Ponca Tribe met the requirements of the Bureau of  Indian Affairs for Federal recognition.   On October 31, 1990, the legislation was signed into law, and the  Ponca were once again recognized by the Federal Government. Fred LeRoy  was then named chairman of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska.   Although the Ponca Tribe will still be without a reservation, they  have established service delivery areas throughout Nebraska, Iowa, and  South Dakota. These areas have centers offering health, social,  domestic violence, and education services. One such center was aptly  named the Fred LeRoy Health and Wellness Center.   Through the tremendous efforts of Chairman LeRoy and subsequent  leaders, the Ponca have not only preserved but further cultivated their  heritage. Current Chairman Larry Wright, Jr., considers his proudest  accomplishments to be the purchase of 1,800 acres of the original  homeland, including Chief Standing Bear's burial site.   Chairman Wright, Jr., illustrated the belief that because their  ancestors are buried in the Niobrara River Valley, Ponca DNA is infused  within the land, water, animals, and everything that grows there,  completing the circle of life.   Today, three different statues pay tribute to the fearless leader  Chief Standing Bear. One statue resides in Centennial Mall of Lincoln,  Nebraska, and another overlooks the Niobrara homeland. Finally, a  bronze statue of Chief Standing Bear stands in its rightful place in  Statuary Hall in the U.S.  [[Page H4648]]  Capitol, representing the State of Nebraska. With these three  monuments, thousands of Nebraskans and millions from around the world  will come now to know the Poncas and their story.   Unfortunately, social disconnects of racial disparity and basic human  rights still exist in our country. In recognizing the Ponca Tribe's  abundant history, we highlight a story of oppression, despair,  struggle, and perseverance.   Today, we honor and celebrate the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska and every  Native American once considered a half person. American author and  civil rights activist Audre Lorde once said: ``It is not our  differences that divide us. It is our inability to recognize, accept,  and celebrate those differences.'' Now more than ever, we must unite as  Americans and celebrate our diversity to heal the wounds of social  injustice.                            ____________________
