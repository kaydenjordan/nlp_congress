A free, independent media is vital to our  democracy. It is enshrined in our Constitution. We depend on reporters  around the world to both tell the stories that have an impact on our  day-to-day lives and dig for those stories that might not be told  otherwise.   Journalists are generally tenacious and dedicated. They ask the tough  questions. They challenge special interests. They connect us with our  communities and our world. They put themselves in harm's way to tell  the unvarnished truth, unfiltered by government propaganda, at a time  when the world needs it more than ever, and too often, that comes at a  cost.   Increasingly, journalists find themselves under attack, arrested, or  targeted for simply reporting facts. Some even make the ultimate  sacrifice to reveal the truth.   In March, I spoke on this floor about three talented, brave  journalists who were killed while reporting on Vladimir Putin's brutal  invasion of Ukraine. Since then, at least nine other journalists have  been killed in Ukraine, journalists who were covering this war.   In May, Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was killed  while reporting on an Israeli military raid in Jenin in the West Bank.  This danger is not something American journalists are immune from.   In September, Jeff German, a reporter with the Las Vegas Review- Journal, was murdered--was murdered--for his investigative reporting  here in the United States of America.   These are only a few of the journalists who lost their lives this  year while trying to uncover the truth.   Since Mahsa Amini's death on September 16, Reporters Without Borders  has found that ``at least 42 journalists have been arrested throughout  Iran.'' The Committee to Protect Journalists reports that since the  beginning of 2022--fewer than 11 months--60 journalists--6-0  journalists--have been killed.   Politicians in this country throw around all kinds of incendiary  language describing journalists, making fun of them, demeaning them,  contributing to this view too often that could lead to the injury or  attacks or even murders of journalists.   We remember those who lost their lives. We recognize their unwavering  commitment to the democratic ideals of truth and accuracy and  transparency, a commitment so strong that they put their lives on the  line--often putting truth before personal safety--to cover floods and  hurricanes and the important stories from global war zones. We have a  better understanding of what is happening in the world today because of  journalists, because of journalism.   Our thoughts are with the families and the friends and the colleagues  whose loved ones were killed in search of truth, but thoughts and  prayers aren't enough. We need to support efforts here and abroad to  hold those who kill or even threaten journalists accountable.   That is why the work of organizations like Reporters Without Borders  and the Committee to Protect Journalists--why organizations like that  are  [[Page S6701]]  integral to ensuring our basic right to freedom of the press.   Earlier this month, we commemorated the International Day to End  Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists. Attacks and threats against  journalists are attacks and threats against all of us, attacks and  threats to freedom of speech and expression itself.   I have called for the release of journalists unjustly detained in  Egypt, Morocco, and elsewhere. I will keep calling for justice.   We honor the memories and the work of journalists best by defending  the freedom of the press, defending the right to free speech,  protecting journalists in their pursuit of the truth, and holding the  regimes--no matter where they are--that attack journalists accountable.  Today, we recommit ourselves to that fight.
