 Madam Speaker, today I rise to introduce the Transforming  Student Debt to Home Equity Act of 2019.   My bill would enable graduates current on repayment to renegotiate  their student debt into an opportunity to purchase and own a home,  which, of course, is an equity-accumulating instrument.   With an estimated $1.6 trillion student debt, it is no wonder  homeownership rates among young adults have plummeted.   Luckily, there is a proven financial instrument already in widespread  use that could facilitate a solution: the home mortgage.   This common lending tool has the power to incorporate student loan  repayments into a means for building equity, not just debt: the home  mortgage.   This bill directly asks HUD and the Federal Housing Administration to  establish a pilot program that connects creditworthy Federal student  debt holders with eligible homes by arranging financing that  recalculates terms, debt-to-income ratios, interest rates,  community reinvestment thresholds, and other factors.    Short-term student debt in certain situations could transition into  longer-term home mortgage ownership opportunity.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to  help unleash the student debt stranglehold on so many in the aspiring  generation.                            ____________________
