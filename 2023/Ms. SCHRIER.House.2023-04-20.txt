 Mr. Speaker, I would like to pay tribute to my chief of  staff, Erin O'Quinn.   Erin and I met just a week after I was elected to Congress. This was  in November 2018. It was an overwhelming time. There was a lot to  organize, and job number one was to find a chief of staff.   Dr. Ami Bera suggested that I meet his deputy chief, Erin. We sat  down to coffee and hit it off. I never looked back. I knew right away I  could trust Erin to guide me through this whole new world of  Washington, D.C., which was quite a contrast from the life of a  community pediatrician.   I still remember that first meeting when she asked me what I wanted  The Seattle Times editorial board to say about me in 2020. It was a way  to figure out my values and goals. Wouldn't you know it? Two years  later, the comments made by The Seattle Times endorsement board were  remarkably similar to what we set out to achieve.   Erin understands the value of a strong team, remarkable constituent  services, outreach, and townhalls. She made sure I was everywhere in  the district and that we hired the best team members with hearts of  gold and a dedication to service.   With a background in social work, she kept our team in sync and  collaborative, and several of our staff are still here today.   I couldn't have done it without Erin. We could not have done it  without Erin. I thank Erin and wish her all the best in the next  chapter in her life. We will miss her.                            ____________________
