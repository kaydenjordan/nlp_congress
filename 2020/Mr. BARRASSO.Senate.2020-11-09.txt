 Madam President, I rise today to recognize a  significant anniversary for the Wyoming Association of Conservation  Districts. When they meet next week, the association will celebrate 75  years of service to Wyoming's natural resources. Without question, the  forests, streams, and soils in the state have seen immense benefit from  the important work conservation district employees do every day.   Conservation districts succeed through their work and partnerships  with diverse stakeholders. Landowners, farmers and ranchers, government  agencies, counties, towns, and other community organizations contribute  to the conservation of land and water resources on private and public  lands in Wyoming. Local conservation district boards perform as a  liaison between local landowners, resource users, and State and Federal  governmental agencies. The association helps individuals navigate  programs and provides exemplary technical assistance to cultivate  productive lands and healthy ecosystems. Agriculture, industry, cities,  forests, and wildlife all depend on strong and healthy watersheds.   Wyoming has 34 conservation districts in our 23 counties. Each  district is run by staff and a board of five supervisors, who serve  voluntarily. Conservation districts direct programs protecting local  renewable natural resources at the local level. Each district  [[Page S6623]]  puts its focus on issues important to resource concerns in the county.  These range from water quality monitoring and watershed planning to  seedling tree sales and living snow fence programs, forest planning and  rangeland management to wildlife habitat improvement and endangered  species issues.   I rely heavily on conservation districts for their expertise in  water, conservation, wildlife, forestry, and general land management.  As their mission statement says, in part, the Wyoming Association of  Conservation Districts provides leadership for the conservation of  Wyoming's soil and water resources and promotes and protects the  quality of Wyoming's waters through responsible conservation ethic.   People are the key to conservation district success, from local  volunteers to dedicated staff and partners who dedicate themselves to  the cause. The association provides valuable insight and expertise to  countless projects and issues at the local, State, and national level.  One of the best examples is in the recently retired, Bobbie Frank.   Bobbie Frank served as executive director of the Wyoming Association  of Conservation Districts for the last 29 years. Bobbie's list of  achievements is long. From being intimately involved in a myriad of  water quality issues both at the State and national levels to  developing and implementing programs at the local level. Bobbie has  received the Wyoming Stock Growers Guardian of the Grassland Award and  the Kurt Bucholz Conservation Award. She has also been inducted as a  member of the Wyoming Ag Hall of Fame. I look forward to working with  the Wyoming Association of Conservation District's new executive  director, Hunter Petsch, moving forward.   It is without hesitation that I say Wyoming's forests and plains  would look much different today if the Wyoming Association of  Conservation Districts had not unified in 1945. Each municipal water  manager, rancher, hiker, forester, hunter, and miner owes a debt of  gratitude for the good work of the Wyoming Association of Conservation  Districts.
