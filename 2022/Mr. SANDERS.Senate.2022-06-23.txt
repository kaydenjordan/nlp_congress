 Mr. President, S. Con. Res. 14, the fiscal year 2022  congressional budget resolution, included a reserve fund in section  3003 to allow the chairman of the Committee on the Budget to revise  budget aggregates and committee allocations for legislation that would  not increase the deficit over the period of fiscal years 2022 to 2031.   The Senate will soon consider S. 2938, the Bipartisan Safer  Communities Act, as proposed to be amended by Senate Amendment No.  5099, which meets the condition of not increasing the deficit over the  relevant 10-year period. As such, I am filing a revision to the  aggregates and committee allocations under the budget resolution, which  were last revised on April 7, as well as the Senate pay-as-you-go  scorecard. Specifically, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that  Division A of the bill would increase 2022 budget authority by $7.5  billion and increase 2022 outlays by $1 million but decrease spending  over the 5- and 10-year windows. Over the 2022-2026 period, the bill  would decrease spending by $5.7 billion and increase revenues by $4  million. Over the 2022-2031 period, the bill would decrease spending by  $5.3 billion and increase revenue by $10 million. Division B of the  bill appropriates additional discretionary spending, but that spending  is designated as an emergency and not subject to budget enforcement.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:        REVISIONS TO BUDGET AGGREGATES--BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAYS  (Pursuant to Section 3003 of S. Con.
