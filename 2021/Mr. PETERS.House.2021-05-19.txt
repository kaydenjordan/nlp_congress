 Mr. Speaker, I rise during Mental Health Awareness Month  to bring attention to tardive dyskinesia, or TD, a persistent and  potentially disabling movement disorder that can be a side effect of  medications prescribed to treat mental illness.   According to a survey of people diagnosed with TD, more than half  reported that the disorder seriously disrupts their sleep and their  ability to work. People living with TD often face stigma, which can  worsen mental health symptoms and cause withdrawal from society.   While TD affects over half a million people in the United States, it  remains a relatively unknown condition, often unrecognized, and  patients suffering from the illness may be misdiagnosed.   Earlier this month, Senator Chris Murphy introduced S. 184,  recognizing the week of May 2 to May 8 as Tardive Dyskinesia Awareness  Week.   Improving awareness and understanding of TD will help reduce the  stigma of mental illness and help us provide better treatment to this  underserved patient population.                            ____________________
