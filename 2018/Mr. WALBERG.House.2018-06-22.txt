 Mr. Chairman, I am grateful for your leadership and for  the work my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee are doing  to tackle the opioid crisis.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for  Patients and Communities Act. Everywhere I go around Michigan, I hear  about the opioid crisis plaguing our State and country. It is a deeply  personal and painful issue for many of our friends and loved ones,  including the family of Jessie Grubb, whose life was cut short. Her  family grieves that a mistake was made that, because of our  legislation, hopefully, will never happen again.   Over the past 2 weeks, the House has considered more than 70 bills to  enhance treatment and recovery programs, increase prevention efforts,  protect communities, and fight the synthetic drug fentanyl. These  measures include two bipartisan bills I introduced with Congresswoman  Debbie Dingell. They have been incorporated into legislation we are  voting on today, including Jessie's Law.   This is an urgent crisis, and I urge the Senate to take swift action  and advance these solutions. There is not a moment to waste.
