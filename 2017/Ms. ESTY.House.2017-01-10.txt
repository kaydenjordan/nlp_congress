 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to put  people before politics. As we speak, the Senate is moving to strip  millions of families of their healthcare coverage and replace it with,  well, nothing.   Now, I know that some of my colleagues ran on a platform of repealing  the Affordable Care Act, and now they feel boxed in by politics. But  let's be very clear about this. The political stakes of repealing the  Affordable Care Act without a replacement are nothing compared to the  terrible human cost.   I would like to share with my colleagues the experience of Suzie  Clayton, my constituent from North Canaan, Connecticut. ``The ACA had a  huge, positive impact on my life,'' Suzie wrote to me last week.  Because Suzie is a breast cancer survivor, a preexisting condition, it  was nearly impossible for her to get decent healthcare coverage before  the ACA.   ``All that we had put away in retirement funds, nearly $70,000, had  to be tapped in order to cover our health costs,'' she wrote. If it  weren't for the coverage she gained through the Affordable Care Act,  she and her husband would have lost everything they had worked for,  quite likely, including their home.   Instead, with the ACA, her family is once again saving for  retirement, completing some overdue home repairs, and getting their  medical needs taken care of at an affordable price. All of that will go  away if this House follows through on its political crusade to wipe  away the Affordable Care Act without a replacement.   Mr. Speaker, there are millions of Suzie Claytons in this country,  millions of people who will lose their homes, lose their savings, and  some will even lose their lives if this Congress repeals the Affordable  Care Act without a replacement.   In my home State of Connecticut alone, 180,000 people who have gained  coverage since the ACA was implemented stand to lose their health care.  That includes 43,000 children.   Think about that for a moment. If Congress repeals the ACA and  doesn't replace it with anything, 43,000 children just in my State will  lose their health coverage. When those children get sick, too many of  their parents will be faced with a heart-wrenching choice: bankrupt the  family to pay for their child's medical care or go without the health  services their child needs to get better. All of us here who are  parents know that that isn't really a choice.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues who are beating the drum for  wholesale elimination of the Affordable Care Act: How can you, in good  conscience, take away the health care from 43,000 children in my State  just to score a political point? How can you throw our healthcare  system into chaos just because you are in a political jam?   Let's work together. Let's work together to improve our healthcare  system. Let's forge a sensible, bipartisan approach to lower healthcare  costs and ensure access to quality care for everyone.   The politics of ObamaCare, no matter how fraught and divisive, should  not, must not take priority over the well-being of the American people  that we are here to serve.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 321, the INSPIRE Women Act.   This bill calls on the NASA administrator to support initiatives that  encourage girls and young women to study STEM fields and pursue careers  in aerospace. Unfortunately, women are woefully underrepresented in  many STEM fields, including aeronautics and aerospace. One of the key  barriers to women entering technical fields is self-selection out of  STEM degrees due to a lack of role models.   In the words of longtime children's advocate and activist, Marian  Wright Edelman: ``You can't be what you can't see.''   Too many girls and young women decide not to pursue studies in  technical fields such as science, engineering, and aerospace because  they look at their teachers and their role models and they see no one  who looks like them.   When students are able to visualize themselves working in technical  fields, they gain the confidence they need to take the first step in  pursuit of a challenging and rewarding STEM career, to their benefit  and to the benefit of society as a whole.   NASA, with its extraordinary STEM workforce, is in a unique position  to help close this gap. The agency has access to a diverse group of  current and retired women astronauts, scientists, engineers,  mathematicians, and innovators whose accomplishments and career paths  are just the sort of inspiration that girls and young women need.   Astronaut Kate Rubins broke barriers and boundaries when she became  the first person to ever sequence DNA in space during her spaceflight  last year.   Just last Friday, Peggy Whitson, the first female commander of the  International Space Station, completed her seventh space walk.    Vera Rubin's recent passing reminded us of her trailblazing career in  astronomy in which she made the groundbreaking discovery of dark  matter.   As has already been mentioned by my friend and colleague, Barbara  Comstock, the newly released movie, ``Hidden Figures,'' highlights  through the pioneering story of early NASA mathematicians and engineers  Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson that women have  been instrumental to our aerospace enterprise since its inception.   NASA has developed a number of programs aimed at leveraging its  inspirational workforce to encourage girls and young women to pursue  STEM degrees and STEM careers. This includes the NASA GIRLS program,  the Aspire 2 Inspire program, and the Summer Institute in Science,  Technology, Engineering, and Research, or SISTER program.   H.R. 321 instructs the NASA administrator to continue supporting  these and other programs that encourage women and girls to study  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, as well as to pursue  careers in aerospace.   Additionally, the bill calls on NASA to develop a plan for how it can  best facilitate and support current and retired astronauts, scientists,  engineers, and innovators to engage with K-12 female STEM students.   Although retired engineers, astronauts, scientists, and engineers are  invaluable to inspiring the next generation of NASA scientists, I am  especially glad and thankful to my colleague for including early career  female astronauts, scientists, engineers, and innovators in this plan.  It is very important for America's young girls to have experiences  interacting with young women who look like them in the STEM fields.   I thank my Science, Space, and Technology Committee colleague,  Representative Comstock, for her leadership on the bill, as well as our  esteemed chairman, Lamar Smith, and our wonderful ranking member, Eddie  Bernice Johnson.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), my ranking member.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  H.R. 321, the Inspiring the Next Space Pioneers, Innovators,  Researchers, and Explorers Women Act.   I want to express my appreciation for the leadership of Congresswoman  Esty and Congresswoman Comstock.   This bill would help ensure that the incoming administration  continues to promote and strengthen important programs at NASA to  inspire and mentor girls and young women to pursue studies and careers  in STEM areas.   Despite progress in the right direction, women remain largely  underrepresented in STEM fields because they continue to face cultural  and institutional barriers throughout their studies and career  progression.   H.R. 321 would support existing programs at NASA that encourage young  girls and women to study STEM fields and pursue careers in aerospace.                                time  1600    These programs include NASA GIRLS, a virtual mentoring program;  Aspire to Inspire, a program connecting young girls with women in STEM  careers at NASA; and a summer institute program that increases  awareness and exposes young, middle school girls to the STEM careers at  NASA.   H.R. 321 also calls on NASA to develop a plan for how best to use its  current and retired workforce to mentor female K-12 students. What  comes to mind are the inspirational women who are featured in the new  movie ``Hidden Figures.'' Those brilliant and brave women opened the  door for so many who followed. We must continue to support our great  women in STEM who dedicate their time to mentor the girls and young  women who will be our next scientists, engineers, and innovators.   I thank my colleagues again--Representative Comstock for her  leadership on this bill and Representative Esty. I strongly support  this bill and encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  pass it.    Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my esteemed colleagues for  their leadership on this, in particular, Representative Comstock from  Virginia and the ranking member.   This is a very laudable bill that plays an important role in  inspiring the next generation of STEM engineers and scientists, and I  am pleased that we are able to offer this again. This did pass in the  last Congress. Unfortunately, it did not make it through the Senate. I  am delighted that we are moving early in this session and would urge  all of my colleagues to swiftly pass this, to send it to the Senate,  and to get it on the President's desk and make sure these important  programs are supported long into the future.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 255, the Promoting Women in  Entrepreneurship Act.   Our bill encourages the National Science Foundation to use its  successful entrepreneurial education and training programs, such as the  Innovation Corps, known as I-Corps, and Partnerships for Innovation, to  inspire, recruit, and support women scientists and engineers who are  interested in turning their laboratory discoveries into commercial  technologies.   Mr. Speaker, you may ask: Why is it that we need a bill like this? We  have these programs. Doesn't everyone know that we need more women in  the STEM fields?   The answer is twofold:   Number one, we have a workforce shortage. If you take the field of  advanced manufacturing by itself, in New England, there are 16,000  positions that are open currently. We have people who are looking for  work--many of them women. They don't have the skill sets to meet that  open job need right now, and that is a need for America to fill those  jobs; so, number one, we need our qualified workforce with appropriate  skills to meet the jobs of today.   We also need to think about the jobs of tomorrow. We are a  wonderfully diverse country. Over half of our workforce is made up of  women and people of color--historically, chronically, still-- underrepresented in the STEM fields. There are problems we aren't even  addressing and solutions we haven't thought of if we don't have more  women with these power tools of the STEM skills to address the  challenges and opportunities that this country is facing; so it is both  a moral and an economic imperative that we equip more young women, and  that is what our bill aims to do here today.   I have heard time and time again in my district, in which we have a  lot of small startup companies and major universities, about this  challenge that we face of bridging that gap between the laboratory and  what happens in the commercial workforce. Through my work, I have  formed a STEM advisory council and have met with them for the last 2  years. Among these are the problems they identified: limited access to  capital, a lack of women mentors in the STEM fields, unmanageable  expectations for work-life balance, and unconscious biases against  women in the sciences. These are among the sorts of issues for which  the I-Corps and the Partnerships for Innovation have been designed--in  order to help close that gap to deal with these issues.   I want to give you examples of two of the women in my district with  whom I have met who are benefiting from these programs and why we need  to have more of them and the kind of difference that they will make.  [[Page H274]]    The first is Zengmin Xia. She is a student at the University of  Connecticut, and she helped the Wei Laboratory secure a National  Science Foundation I-Corps grant to commercialize her work on tissue  engineer scaffolds, innovative work which is going to help with bone  repair and regeneration. She attributes her success to her female  adviser and mentor, Professor Mei Wei, who encouraged her as a young  woman to carry out her path forward in the biotech world. She helped  her make that transition from the lab and the classroom out into the  commercial world. She was lucky that she had a mentor with the  experience to help close this gap.   Claire Leonardi is the CEO of Health Esense, which is a digital  health startup firm in Avon, Connecticut. She received seed grant  funding and gained access to hands-on training workshops to learn how  to market her technology to consumers. She is now equipped with the  tools to take her discovery and bring it into market.   Both of these women scientists are examples of the kind of  innovation, the kind of economic engine, and the problem solving we  need all Americans to participate in. That is what is at stake. That is  why we are proposing this. This is not simply about having a poster  with a diverse group of scientists to hang on the wall at the Air and  Space Museum and inspire young people. That is important, but it is  also important to build on the good work we have already done with the  National Science Foundation--to really provide that equipment, those  tools, those mentors, the training, and to take those lab discoveries,  the basic R&D, and commercialize it.    I am very excited that we are reintroducing this bill. It passed with  overwhelming support in the last Congress. Once again, sadly, it did  not pass in the Senate, but we will start early in this Congress. I am  delighted to be working again with my colleague, Mrs. Comstock; with  the ranking member, Eddie Bernice Johnson, who is here today; and with  Chairman Smith, who is detained with other committee work.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson).   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  H.R. 255, the Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act.   The bill helps to build on STEM education and mentorship programs,  such as those highlighted in the INSPIRE Women Act.   More women are pursuing STEM degrees and careers overall, but they  continue to be underrepresented in many STEM fields. This is especially  true in STEM fields with high entrepreneurship rates, such as  engineering and computer science. Women who successfully complete  degrees in these fields and want to turn their research and their  talents into building new companies and creating new jobs then  disproportionately face new hurdles, such as obtaining access to  credit.   Unfortunately, because of these barriers, it remains as important as  ever for our Federal science agencies to support programs and provide  grants with the goal of encouraging, inspiring, and supporting women in  STEM at all levels of their education and training, including  entrepreneurship education and training.   H.R. 255 ensures that longstanding entrepreneurship education and  training programs at the National Science Foundation continue to  encourage and recruit women who are looking to move beyond the  laboratory and commercialize the results of their research. If we are  serious about growing our economy, it is just common sense that we  would encourage all of our best and brightest--male and female--to  commercialize their best ideas and create new companies and new jobs.   I thank my colleagues Representative Esty for her leadership and  Representative Comstock for her leadership on this bill. I strongly  support the bill and encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to support it.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank Congressman Comstock,  Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson, and our Chairman Lamar Smith, and  I would urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile piece of  legislation. It is wonderful to be able to start out the legislative  session with important legislation that will help make a difference.  Not only the lives of the individuals who receive these grants and this  training but the entire country benefits when we have more women and  more young women trained in these fields and able to operationalize and  commercialize their discoveries to the benefit of all Americans and, in  many cases, the entire world.   I urge my colleagues to adopt this and vote in favor of this  important resolution.   I yield back the balance of my time.
