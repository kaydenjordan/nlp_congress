 Mr. Speaker, my belief in God and my Christian  faith, they are the catalyst for every decision I make. Remarkable  Americans from across the country are gathering this week in  Washington, D.C., to advocate for the protection of unborn children.   Written into the Declaration of Independence is our founding faith  and principle that we are all created by God, created equally, endowed  by our creator with the unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness. However, since the infamous Supreme Court  decision of Roe v. Wade some 49 years ago, we have fallen short of that  national edict by not acknowledging that life at every stage is  precious, valuable, sacred, and should be protected.   To the many Americans marching in person this week and supporting the  pro-life movement through other means, I want to say thank you for your  dedication to this most worthy cause and know that you are not alone in  this fight. As you continue to stand up for those who cannot stand up  for themselves, remember that my pro-life colleagues and I stand with  you.   Mr. Speaker, I promise to use this platform right here in Congress  and beyond to continue my vocal and unapologetic advocacy for unborn  children. I will not stop fighting until our laws and policies protect  life at every stage. I hope you won't either.
