 Mr. President, I rise to speak about the nomination of  Mike  [[Page S2409]]  Pompeo to be our next Secretary of State.   By now, we have all heard about Director Pompeo's accomplishments:  first in his class at West Point, U.S. Army officer, graduate of  Harvard Law School, editor of the Harvard Law Review, successful  businessman, and Member of Congress. It is rare that a nominee to this  position has had so many diverse accomplishments.   Some of my colleagues who are opposed to Director Pompeo argue that  he will not deliver tough messages to the President or outline all of  the policy options. They argue that Director Pompeo is a hawk who would  prefer armed conflict to diplomacy. I find these comments  disappointing. That has not been my personal experience with Director  Pompeo. In addition, military officers are frequently the last ones to  seek a military solution to a foreign policy challenge because they  know firsthand the cost of war. On the other hand, they also know that  without strength, no amount of diplomacy will be able to stop an  authoritarian dictator.   I believe Director Pompeo's recent trip to North Korea highlights how  effective and committed he is to pursuing diplomatic opportunities. He  not only defended core U.S. interests, but he also moved the United  States and North Korea closer to negotiations. Maximum pressure,  combined with a willingness to talk, is working right now.   I also want to address the issue of communication with Congress. I  have heard claims about information not being shared with the Hill. As  a member of the Intelligence Committee, I have worked with Director  Pompeo regularly and can personally vouch for his accessibility and  candor. Having worked with a number of CIA Directors over the years on  the Intelligence Committee, I can personally attest that Director  Pompeo is at the top of the class for being open and straightforward.   I would also like to address the issue of bipartisanship. Since  coming to the Senate a decade ago, I have had the chance to vote for  three Secretaries of State. Mr. Pompeo will be my fourth. In each case,  I have supported the President's nominee to serve as Secretary of  State. President Obama's choices for Secretary of State would certainly  not have been my choices. In the case of Secretaries Clinton and Kerry,  there were numerous issues where we had substantial disagreements. I  believed that as to the Secretary of State, however, the President was  entitled to deference as to his choice, and that choice deserved  bipartisan support because their credibility as the top diplomat is  strengthened by bipartisan support.   Another important factor is that, with Secretary Pompeo, world  leaders will know that he speaks directly on behalf of the President-- something that has been an issue in the past. This quality is very,  very important for a Secretary of State.   Director Pompeo is more than qualified to serve as Secretary of  State. In fact, at this point, because of his service at the CIA,  Director Pompeo is uniquely positioned to be a very successful  Secretary of State. No other place in our government provides more  insight into the inner workings of other countries than the work of our  intelligence agencies. The CIA is certainly one of the top intelligence  agencies, and Director Pompeo, in his service, has had access to and  indeed directed the work of the CIA and has a very deep and profound  understanding of the other nations in the world, and that applies  particularly to the troubled spots in the world. He is uniquely  qualified because of this experience to serve as Secretary of State.   We have often used the phrase ``politics ends at the water's edge''  to signal that our domestic political differences do not erode our  diplomats' strength overseas. I hope that this vote does not change  what has been a longstanding goal for our diplomatic efforts.   I urge my colleagues to thoughtfully consider support for Director  Pompeo.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today, along with my colleague Senator Mike  Crapo, I wish to recognize fellow Idahoan Larry Cope who retired from  Clear Springs Foods, Inc., in Buhl, ID, in March of this year. Larry,  who is president and CEO of the company, has had an exemplary career as  a visionary and selfless leader at Clear Springs for the past 45 years.  He deserves to retire.   Idaho is very proud to be home to the headquarters of Clear Springs  Foods, the world's largest producer of aquacultured rainbow trout,  supplying restaurants and major supermarkets throughout the United  States and propelling fish farming well beyond our borders. Larry would  tell us it has taken a great team to lead this originally privately  owned small business into the immensely successful 100-percent  employee-owned operation it is  [[Page S2433]]  today, but we know it was with Larry's cutting-edge leadership and  distinguished commitment to the business that it has grown into such a  global industry.   In 1973, with just $10,000--money critical to the company at the  time--and a true spirit of recognizing the value of good workers, Larry  created an employee retirement plan and stayed committed to the plan.  Today the retirement fund is more than $60 million. Larry believes in  taking care of his workers, many of whom go in every day to do  difficult, routine work. Larry exhibits the type of leader every  industry needs: focused while looking ahead, kind, fair, and employee  friendly. No one has to tell him to serve in this manner; it is who he  is, and he does it with a spring in his step.   Mike and I have known Larry since the days Clear Springs had an  annual production of 450,000 pounds of trout. Now, the company produces  24 million pounds every year, making it an exemplary industry leader.   Larry has been immensely valuable to the aquaculture industry  worldwide. He has been in many leadership roles in business  associations and boards, and he has won many awards. To name a few of  his roles in the food industry and beyond, Larry has served as a board  member and chairman of the National Fisheries Institute, the American  Frozen Food Institute, the Idaho Association of Commerce & Industry, as  well as St. Luke's Health System. In addition, he has served as a  trustee at the College of Idaho, his alma mater.   Another important character quality Larry exhibits is believing in  serving his community. He is a pillar of support and encouragement to  the region, having helped bring St. Luke's Hospital into the Magic  Valley, as well as supporting the growth of the region's food  production industry. As food production grows, so does the number of  jobs and residual businesses. This is good growth for Idaho.   Mike and I are proud to recognize Larry Cope, our good friend and a  strong, courageous, and dedicated leader in Idaho. As I said a minute  ago, Larry has done so much in business and community service for more  than 45 years that he has earned his retirement.   Larry, kick up your feet and go fishing.   Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as you may know, small businesses  make up a significant portion of the retail and food services economy,  both in my home State of Idaho and around the country. In Idaho, small  businesses employ 67 percent of workers in the food services sector. As  chairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am  proud to recognize Smitty's Pancake and Steak House as the Small  Business of the Month for April 2018. Located in Idaho Falls, Smitty's  Pancake and Steak House has provided exceptional service and quality  food in a welcoming environment for decades.   Like many small restaurants, Smitty's began as just one location  within a larger franchise network. However, in 1971, Leo and Cleo  Werner left their jobs to buy the franchise license, thus changing the  structure of the restaurant. Right away, the Werners knew that, in  order to build a successful restaurant and leave a positive legacy,  they would need to build customer loyalty by emphasizing customer  service and creating an environment that makes their customers feel at  home. When the Smitty's chain rebranded, Mr. and Mrs. Werner decided to  strike out on their own as independent owners. The Werners decided that  they should continue focusing on the values at the center of their  business, rather than sacrifice their restaurant's charm for the  relative stability of being part of a chain. These values live on in  the restaurant today, as the business is led by Mr. and Mrs. Werner's  granddaughters, Katrina Lott and Amanda Rosenberg. They have kept the  restaurant in the family, taking over when their mother, the Werner's  daughter Darlene, retired.   The Werners were eager to lead their team of employees by example,  taking up any task that needed to get done around the restaurant, no  matter how big or small. Their attention to customer service created  strong loyalty among their customers, which is one of the many reasons  people return. The Werners know that their customers are coming back in  part for the family atmosphere cultivated by their friendly staff.  Smitty's is known for serving a high volume of people at all times of  the day, with some people lining up before 6 in the morning in order to  get a taste of their hand-cut steaks and buttermilk pancakes. They have  truly lived up to their motto of ``everybody's favorite.''   The restaurant enjoys strong customer loyalty not only because of the  superb service, but also because of the tasty breakfast and dinner  offerings, which remain largely unchanged from when Leo and Cleo Werner  took control of the restaurant over 46 years ago. Whether you are  looking for a traditional American breakfast or a homestyle steak-and- potatoes dinner, visitors and native Idahoans alike know they can find  it at Smitty's.   Smitty's Pancake and Steak House has become a landmark in the Idaho  Falls community by having the friendliest service in town and  maintaining a menu of favorite items that keep customers coming back  for more. Mr. and Mrs. Werner knew what it would take to build a small  business in the food service industry and ensured that their values  have been passed down to their children and grandchildren, who maintain  these values today. Smitty's embraces the values of loyalty, service,  and hard work and serves as an example for all entrepreneurs.   With great pleasure, I extend my congratulations to the Werner family  and all of the employees of Smitty's Pancake and Steak House. I wish  you well as you continue serving the people of Idaho Falls, and I look  forward to  [[Page S2435]]  watching your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
