 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the horrible  inflation crisis we are seeing in this country.   I can remember back to the terrible inflation period of the 1970s,  and I always hoped we would never return back to those times.  Unfortunately, what I see coming lately, it is looking very similar.   With the lifting of the pandemic restrictions and the increasing rate  of vaccinations, many Americans are getting back to their normal  routine. Many are dining out, traveling, and enjoying social events  again.   While this is great news, virtually every American is noticing a  massive increase in the price of nearly everything because of the  unprecedented inflation caused by the Biden administration's reckless  spending and willingness to pay people to sit at home instead of work.   Inflation has increased every single month since Biden has taken  office. The Consumer Price Index has increased more than 5 percent over  a year ago, which is the largest jump since just before the 2008  financial crisis.   Gas prices have increased 45 percent compared to last year; food  prices have increased more than 2 percent; and consumer prices overall  are up near 5 percent.   While these numbers may not concern President Biden, they are  absolutely killing the working class. The Biden administration's  failures have real consequences, and his policies are crushing the  working- and middle-class families across Alabama and throughout our  Nation.   The working class is the backbone of this Nation, so I urge President  Biden and my colleagues across the aisle to get serious about  addressing this crisis and get to work building the economy that  benefits all Americans.
