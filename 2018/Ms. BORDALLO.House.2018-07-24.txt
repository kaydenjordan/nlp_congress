 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Guam  Temporary Workforce Act. A near 100 percent denial of temporary H-2B  petitions on Guam has hindered our island's ability to grow the economy  and provide affordable and timely services for our civilian population.   While our community fully supports providing job opportunities and  career advancement for those already living on Guam, we do not have the  population or the organic workforce to fill the labor demands of our  island. Local companies have tried to recruit from other territories  and mainland United States, all to no avail.   I am pleased that we made some progress in alleviating these  workforce challenges in the defense bill that we are considering this  week, but, Mr. Speaker, we need to do more. The Guam Temporary  Workforce Act would make sure that local labor needs are met by giving  the Governor of Guam more input in temporary labor need determinations.  Specifically, it would allow him to certify the temporary needs of  Guam's civilian labor market while safeguarding the local economy from  overreliance on temporary workers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this very, very important  measure and to support our island economy                            ____________________
