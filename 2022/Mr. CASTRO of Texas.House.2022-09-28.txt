SEC. 4. SUNSET.         The authority to carry out the John Lewis Civil Rights       Fellowship Program established under section 115 of the       Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (22       U.S.C. 2451 et seq.), as added by section 2, shall expire on       the date that is 7 years after the date of the enactment of       this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 8681, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 8681, the John Lewis Civil  Rights Fellowship Act of 2022, and I thank Ms. Williams for authoring  this important bill.   I want to begin with a passage from an essay written by  Representative John Lewis before his death, which was published on the  day of his funeral.   Representative John Lewis, in reflecting on the past and looking to  the future said: ``You must also study and learn the lessons of history  because basic humanity has been involved in this soul-wrenching,  existential struggle for a very long time. People on every continent  have stood in your shoes, through decades and centuries before you. The  truth does not change, and that is why the answers worked out long ago  can help you find solutions to the challenges of our time. Continue to  build union between movements stretching across the globe because we  must put away our willingness to profit from the exploitation of  others.''   These words are a call to action and H.R. 8681, the John Lewis Civil  Rights Fellowship Act, seeks to meet that call, to learn from history  and find solutions to the challenges of our time.   The John Lewis Fellowship will be part of the Fulbright Scholarship  Program administered by the State Department and will advance the  teaching of the history of nonviolent movements around the world by  fostering research and international exchange.   The fellowship supports 25 young scholars in studying the history of  nonviolent civil rights movements around the world and improving the  understanding of nonviolence as a critical tool for change.   Fostering constructive methods of civic expression is vital for a  healthy, flourishing society. Thanks to John's leadership by example,  thousands of people around the world over have learned how to confront  the injustices of their own societies through nonviolent means. Now,  the duty of honoring his legacy and shepherding a new generation of  leaders falls on our shoulders.   I can think of no better time than now to pass this bill that honors  the legacy of the great John Lewis. I strongly urge all Members to vote  in support of this important legislation, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, it is my honor to yield 3 minutes  to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Williams).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, I want to reiterate my staunch support for the John  Lewis Civil Rights Fellowship Act of 2022.   This legislation encourages the values of peaceful expression and  invigorates a new generation of leaders with  [[Page H8195]]  the same spirit that drove John in his lifelong advocacy for civil  rights. His leadership during the civil rights movement was pivotal for  extending the American promises of life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness to all Americans. Many of us may not be standing here before  this Chamber but for his contributions to racial equality.   This legislation seeks to instill that very same drive and purpose in  the leaders of tomorrow, promoting the use of nonviolent civil rights  as a tool for change around the world.   Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me and support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.

Section 8 of the Global Food Security Act of 2016 (22       U.S.C. 9307) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a), in the matter preceding paragraph       (1)--        (A) by striking ``During each of the first 7 years after       the date of the submission of the strategy required under       section 5(c)'' and inserting ``For each of fiscal years 2024       through 2028'';        (B) by striking ``reports that describe'' and inserting ``a       report that describes''; and        (C) by striking ``at the end of the reporting period'' and       inserting ``during the preceding year'';        (2) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``, including any       changes to the target countries selected pursuant to the       selection criteria described in section 5(a)(2) and       justifications for any such changes'' before the semicolon at       the end;        (3) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``identify and'' before       ``describe'';        (4) in paragraph (5), by striking ``agriculture'' and       inserting ``food'';        (5) in paragraph (6)--        (A) by inserting ``quantitative and qualitative'' after       ``how''; and        (B) by inserting ``at the initiative, country, and zone of       influence levels, including longitudinal data and key       uncertainties'' before the semicolon at the end;        (6) in paragraph (7), by inserting ``within target       countries, amounts and justification for any spending outside       of target countries'' after ``amounts spent'';        (7) in paragraph (11), by striking ``and the impact of       private sector investment'' and inserting ``and efforts to       encourage financial donor burden sharing and the impact of       such investment and efforts'';        (8) in paragraph (13), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (9) in paragraph (14)--        (A) by inserting ``, including key challenges or       missteps,'' after ``lessons learned''; and        (B) by striking the period at the end and inserting ``;       and'';        (10) by redesignating paragraphs (12) through (14), as       amended, as paragraphs (15) through (17), respectively;        (11) by redesignating paragraphs (5) through (11), as       amended, as paragraphs (7) through (13), respectively;        (12) by striking paragraph (4) and inserting the following:        ``(4) identify and describe the priority quantitative       metrics used to establish baselines and performance targets       at the initiative, country, and zone of influence levels;        ``(5) identify such established baselines and performance       targets at the country, and zone of influence levels;        ``(6) identify the output and outcome benchmarks and       indicators used to measure results annually, and report the       annual measurement of results for each of the priority       metrics identified pursuant to paragraph (4), disaggregated       by age, gender, and disability, to the extent practicable and       appropriate, in an open and transparent manner that is       accessible to the American people;'';        (13) by inserting after paragraph (13), as redesignated,       the following:        ``(14) describe how agriculture research is prioritized       within the Global Food Security Strategy to support       agriculture-led growth and eventual self-sufficiency and       assess efforts to coordinate research programs within the       Global Food Security Strategy with key stakeholders;''; and        (14) by adding at the end the following:        ``(18) during the final year of each strategy required       under section 5, complete country graduation reports to       determine whether a country should remain a target country       based on quantitative and qualitative analysis.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 8446, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bill that  reauthorizes the Global Food Security Act. I thank my colleagues, Ms.  McCollum, Mr. Smith, Chairman Meeks, and Ranking Member McCaul, for  leading this bill.   Today, as the world grapples with a rapidly changing climate, the  ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the global consequences  of Russia's war of choice in Ukraine, the U.S. must step up to support  the hundreds of millions of hungry and food insecure people in all  corners of the world. More importantly, perhaps, we need to give these  communities the tools they need to feed themselves.   The Global Food Security Act was passed with strong bipartisan  support in 2016 and reauthorized in 2018. It is critical that Congress  once again acts to reauthorize this important piece of legislation.   Not only does this reauthorization increase annual funding for the  Feed the Future initiative; it also requires an additional focus on  building resilience, strengthening food systems, and forming more local  partnerships to advance agriculture-led economic growth. This will play  a critical role in delivering food to those in need today while  creating more durable and sustainable food systems for tomorrow.   Food insecurity is a key driver of instability and violent extremism  throughout the world. Investing in combating global hunger not only  reflects U.S. values; it is also in our national security interest.  [[Page H8197]]    By passing this legislation, along with President Biden's  announcement last week that the United States will provide over $2.9  billion in new assistance to address food insecurity, we will make  important strides toward achieving our goal of creating lasting food  security.   This important bipartisan legislation will continue support for the  Feed the Future initiative that has already lifted millions out of  poverty.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support this bipartisan legislation, and  I urge my colleagues to do the same. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee.)    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, as the world continues to experience climate-related  devastation, downstream effects of COVID-19 on global supply chains,  and the crippling effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on food  delivery and production, the United States must continue to support  those vulnerable to food insecurity.   Now is not the time to continue business as usual. The United States  must step up to meet the moment and adapt our policy tools and foreign  assistance to do the same. H.R. 8446 ensures that the United States  maintains global leadership in combating the global hunger crisis by  sowing the seeds of food security for the future.   Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 8463) to modify the requirements under the  Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 for candidate countries, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8463         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Millennium Challenge       Corporation Eligibility Expansion Act''.       SEC. 2. MODIFICATIONS OF REQUIREMENTS TO BECOME A CANDIDATE                     COUNTRY.         Section 606 of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 (22       U.S.C. 7705) is amended to read as follows:       ``SEC. 606. CANDIDATE COUNTRIES.         ``(a) In General.--A country shall be a candidate country       for purposes of eligibility for receiving assistance under       section 605 if--        ``(1) the per capita income of the country is equal to or       less than the gross national income per capita of the 125th       poorest country as identified by the World Bank for the       fiscal year; and        ``(2) subject to subsection (b), the country is not       ineligible to receive United States economic assistance under       part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 by reason of the       application of any provision of the Foreign Assistance Act of       1961 or any other provision of law.

(a) Amendment to Millennium Challenge Compact Authority.--      Section 609(b)(2) of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 (22       U.S.C. 7708(b)(2)) is amended--        (1) by striking the heading and inserting ``Country       contributions''; and        (2) by striking ``with respect to a lower middle income       country described in section 606(b),''.        (b) Amendment To Report Identifying Candidate Countries.--      Section 608(a)(1) of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 (22       U.S.C. 7707(a)(1)) is amended by striking ``section       606(a)(1)(B)'' and inserting ``section 606(a)(2)''.        (c) Amendment to Authorization To Provide Assistance for       Candidate Countries.--Section 616(b)(1) of the Millennium       Challenge Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7715(b)(1)) is amended by       striking ``subsection (a) or (b) of section 606'' and       inserting ``section 606(a)''.       SEC. 4. MODIFICATION TO FACTORS IN DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY.         Section 607(c)(2) of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003       (22 U.S.C. 7706(c)(2)) is amended in the matter preceding       subparagraph (A) by striking ``consider'' and inserting       ``prioritize need and impact by considering''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 8463.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I am glad to bring this bipartisan legislation, which  I authored together with my colleague, Representative Young Kim of  California to the House floor.   It will allow the Millennium Challenge Corporation, or MCC, to  continue to work where it can do the most to foster development and  reduce poverty.   When Congress established the MCC almost 20 years ago, it was  envisioned as a selective agency that would work collaboratively with  the best-governed developing countries.   Perhaps the most visible part of MCC's rigorous selection process is  its scorecard, which evaluates more than 20 different policy indicators  of good governance. But Congress also set an income-based threshold for  nations where MCC could work. It was intended to make sure MCC focused  on developing countries and on helping the people who need it most. I  strongly support that focus and nothing in this bill is intended to  alter that core part of MCC's mission and mandate.   But the way we define that threshold, based on who falls within two  categories in the World Bank's estimates of per capita gross national  income, has led to several issues this legislation seeks to address.   In the decades since the original standard was defined, the number of  potential countries eligible for MCC's compacts has shrunk by almost a  third. These compacts, which need to be ratified by both the United  States and the partner country, can take years to negotiate, ratify,  and implement.   Under the income threshold's current structure, countries can  suddenly become ineligible for assistance in the middle of a multi-year  negotiation. Global disruptions like a pandemic or major conflict can  also lead to changes in a country's eligibility.   Under my legislation, the MCC would continue to use World Bank  measures of GNI per capita as the basis to calculate eligibility, while  expanding consideration for potential compacts to the world's 125  poorest countries. This change will ensure that MCC has a stable number  of potential candidates, even as we continue to make progress in the  fight against global poverty.   The new pool of potentially eligible countries would cover 98 percent  of the world's poor and 90 percent of the countries MCC has identified  as facing substantial vulnerability, including to pandemics, natural  disasters, migration, and food insecurity.   It is important to note that this is potential eligibility.   This bill does not change any of MCC's scorecard criteria. To qualify  for a potential compact, countries must also be generally eligible to  receive American foreign assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act  and other provisions of United States law.   The MCC Eligibility Expansion Act also includes protections to ensure  that newly eligible countries do not crowd out support for low and  lower-middle-income countries that qualify under the existing income  threshold.   For example, it includes language that would strengthen statutory  direction to the MCC's board to prioritize development need and impact.  The legislation would also require all potential candidate countries to  identify appropriate national contributions during compact  negotiations, meaning wealthier countries would pitch in more.   In implementing this legislation, I also expect the MCC to compare  this small pool of newly eligible upper-middle-income countries against  their peers in determining eligibility through the scorecard.   This bill would provide the MCC with more certainty and stability  when it chooses to pursue a compact.   Madam Speaker, with the support of my colleagues today, we can ensure  that the MCC will continue its important work and maximize its impact  fighting poverty and promoting development.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, the Millennium Challenge Corporation Eligibility  Expansion Act will improve the MCC's ability to form stable, long-term  compacts in the well-governed countries that will benefit most from  United States' development assistance.   I thank my colleagues, particularly my co-lead on this bill,  Representative Young Kim, for the bipartisan work that has brought this  legislation forward today.   Madam Speaker, I urge the House to pass this legislation. I hope the  Senate will take it up swiftly so that it can become law this year, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4821) to hold accountable senior officials of the  Government of the People's Republic of China who are responsible for,  complicit in, or have directly persecuted Christians in China, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4821         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Combating the Persecution of       Religious Groups in China Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) According to the Department of State's International       Religious Freedom (IRF) report estimates, Buddhists comprise       18.2 percent of the country's total population, Christians,       5.1 percent, Muslims, 1.8 percent, followers of folk       religions, 21.9 percent, and atheists or unaffiliated       persons, 52.2 percent, with Hindus, Jews, and Taoists       comprising less than one percent.        (2) The Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC)       recognizes five official religions, Buddhism, Taoism, Islam,       Protestantism, and Catholicism (according to the State       Department's IRF report) and only religious groups belonging       to one of the five sanctioned ``patriotic religious       associations'' representing these religions are permitted to       register with the government and hold worship service,       excluding all other faiths and denying the ability to worship       without being registered with the government.        (3) The activities of state-sanctioned religious       organizations are regulated by the Chinese Communist Party,       which manages all aspects of religious life.        (4) The Chinese Communist Party is actively seeking to       control, govern, and manipulate all aspects of faith through       the ``Sinicization of Religion'', a process intended to shape       religious traditions and doctrines so they conform with the       objectives of the Chinese Communist Party.        (5) On February 1, 2018, the PRC Government implemented new       religious regulations that imposed restrictions on Chinese       contacts with overseas religious organizations, required       government approval for religious schools, websites, and any       online religious service, and effectively banned unauthorized       religious gatherings and teachings.        (6) There are numerous reports that authorities forced       closures of Buddhist, Christian, Islamic, and Taoist houses       of worship and destroyed public displays of religious symbols       throughout the country.        (7) Authorities arrested and detained religious leaders       trying to hold services online.        (8) There are credible reports of Chinese authorities       raiding house churches and other places of religious worship,       removing and confiscating religious paraphernalia, installing       surveillance cameras on religious property, pressuring       congregations to sing songs of the Chinese Communist Party       and display the national flag during worship, forcing       churches to replace images of Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary       with pictures of General Secretary Xi Jinping, and banning       children and students from attending religious services.        (9) It has been reported that the PRC is rewriting and will       issue a version of the Bible with the ``correct       understanding'' of the text according to the Chinese       Communist Party. Authorities continued to restrict the       printing and distribution of the Bible, Quran, and other       religious literature, and penalized publishing and copying       businesses that handled religious materials.        (10) According to the Department of State's IRF reports,       the PRC Government has imprisoned thousands of individuals of       all faiths for practicing their religious beliefs and often       labels them as ``cults''.        (11) The Political Prisoner Database maintained by the       human rights NGO Dui Hua Foundation counted 3,492 individuals       imprisoned for ``organizing or using a `cult' to undermine       implementation of the law.'' Prisoners include--        (A) the 11th Panchen Lama, Gedun Choekyi Nyima, who has       been held captive along with his parents since May 17, 1995;        (B) Pastor Zhang Shaojie, a Three-Self church pastor from       Nanle County in central Henan was sentenced in July 2014 to       12 years in prison for ``gathering a crowd to disrupt the       public order'';        (C) Pastor John Cao, a United States permanent resident       from Greensboro, North Carolina, who was sentenced for 7       years in prison in March 2018 under contrived charges of       organizing illegal border crossings; and        (D) Pastor Wang Yi of the Early Rain Covenant Church who       was arrested and sentenced to 9 years in prison for       ``inciting to subvert state power'' and ``illegal business       operations''.        (12) Authorities continue to detain Falun Gong       practitioners and subject them to harsh and inhumane       treatment.        (13) Since 1999, the Department of State has designated the       PRC as a country of particular concern under the       International Religious Freedom Act of 1998.        (14) The National Security Strategy of the United States,       issued in 2017, 2015, 2006, 2002, 1999, 1998, and 1997,       committed the United States to promoting international       religious freedom to advance the security, economic, and       other national interests of the United States.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         (a) Holding PRC Officials Responsible for Religious Freedom       Abuses Targeting Chinese Christians or Other Religious       Minorities.--It is the policy of the United States to       consider senior officials of the Government of the People's       Republic of China (PRC) who are responsible for or have       directly carried out, at any time, persecution of Christians       or other religious minorities in the PRC to have committed--        (1) a gross violation of internationally recognized human       rights for purposes of imposing sanctions with respect to       such officials under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights       Accountability Act (22 U.S.C. 2656 note); and        (2) a particularly severe violation of religious freedom       for purposes of applying section 212(a)(2)(G) of the       Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)(G)) with       respect to such officials.        (b) Department of State Programming to Promote Religious       Freedom in the People's Republic of China.--The Ambassador-      at-Large for International Religious Freedom should support       efforts to protect and promote international religious       freedom in the PRC and for programs to protect Christians and       other religious minorities in the PRC.        (c) Designation of the People's Republic of China as a       Country of Particular Concern.--It is the policy of the       United States to continue to designate the PRC as a ``country       of particular concern'', as long as the PRC continues to       engage in systematic and egregious religious freedom       violations, as defined by the International Religious Freedom       Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-292).       SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that the United States should       promote religious freedom in the PRC by--        (1) strengthening religious freedom diplomacy on behalf of       Christians and other religious minorities facing restrictions       in the PRC;        (2) raising cases relating to religious or political       prisoners at the highest levels with PRC officials because       experience demonstrates that consistently raising prisoner       cases can result in improved treatment, reduced sentences, or       in some cases, release from custody, detention, or       imprisonment;        (3) encouraging Members of Congress to ``adopt'' a prisoner       of conscience in the PRC through the Tom Lantos Human Rights       Commission's ``Defending Freedom Project'', raise the case       with PRC officials, and work publicly for their release;        (4) calling on the PRC Government to unconditionally       release religious and political prisoners or, at the very       least, ensure that detainees are treated humanely with access       to family, the lawyer of their choice, independent medical       care, and the ability to practice their faith while in       detention;  [[Page H8201]]         (5) encouraging the global faith community to speak in       solidarity with the persecuted religious groups in the PRC;       and        (6) hosting, once every two years, the Ministerial to       Advance Religious Freedom organized by the Department of       State in order to bring together leaders from around the       world to discuss the challenges facing religious freedom,       identify means to address religious persecution and       discrimination worldwide, and promote great respect for and       preservation of religious liberty.       SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ACTIONS AT UNITED                     NATIONS.         It is the sense of Congress that the United Nations Human       Rights Council should issue a formal condemnation of the       People's Republic of China for the ongoing genocide against       Uyghurs and other religious and ethnic minority groups, as       well as for its persecution of Christians, Falun Gong, and       other religious groups.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4821, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4821, the Combating  the Persecution of Religious Groups in China Act, introduced by my  colleague, Representative Vicky Hartzler.   The state of religious freedom in China has been alarming for several  years now. Despite religious freedom being guaranteed in its  constitution, the PRC actively suppresses this fundamental right.   While this government's systemic orchestration of genocide and crimes  against humanity against the Uyghur people and other ethnic and  religious minorities in the Uyghur region has been widely broadcasted  across international media, followers of a variety of religious faiths  and traditions have long experienced religious persecution in China.   The ability to freely practice one's religion or engage in worship  has continued to deteriorate. Those who bravely speak out against the  infringement of religious freedom or refuse to join state-sanctioned  religious organizations face the PRC Government's inhumane repression  and human rights abuses.   Thousands of religious leaders and worshippers have been harassed,  detained, disappeared, tortured, physically abused, sentenced to  prison, or subjected to forced labor and indoctrination due to their  religious affiliation or the practice of their religious beliefs. Some  have even been pressured to renounce their religious beliefs.   In addition to these atrocities, the People's Republic of China  officials have removed or replaced religious images, iconography, and  symbols; have desecrated or demolished places of worship; and have  rewritten religious text in an effort to align with Communist Party  ideology.   This is unacceptable, but infringement on personal rights has become  business as usual in China. Nobody should be forced to endure  discrimination because of their religion anywhere in the world.   Congress must act now to support efforts to protect and promote  religious freedom in China and to protect adherents of all religious  faiths in China. We must continue to call out the PRC Government for  these atrocities and take actions to prevent the stifling of religious  freedom in China.   By passing this important, bipartisan legislation, this body sends a  clear message to the PRC Government that it will be held accountable  for its pattern of gross human rights abuses and severe violations of  religious freedoms.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Hartzler for authoring this  important, bipartisan legislation which I was proud to move through the  Foreign Affairs Committee, I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting it, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, September 23, 2022.      Hon. Gregory Meeks,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Meeks: This letter is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 4821, the ``Combating the       Persecution of Christians in China Act,'' that fall within       our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us       on those provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection       to your including them in the bill for consideration on the       House floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to       forgo action on H.R. 4821, with the understanding that we do       not thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, September 26, 2022.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       4821, the ``Combating the Persecution of Religious Groups in       China Act.'' I appreciate your willingness to work       cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary under House       Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H.R.       4821 to expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge       that the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill       does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction.        I also acknowledge that your Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this, or similar       legislation moves forward and will support the appointment of       Committee on the Judiciary conferees during any House-Senate       conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Gregory W. Meeks,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I am  ready to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 4821 sends a strong and unequivocal message that  the United States stands firmly in support of worshippers of all  religious traditions and faiths and their ability to freely practice  their religion or engage in worship without fear of discrimination or  persecution.   This legislation signals strong bipartisan House support for the  administration to hold accountable all those responsible for the severe  violations of religious freedom and persecution of religious groups in  China.  [[Page H8203]]    Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.
