 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to urge my colleagues to pass  the National Medal of Honor Monument Act. This is bipartisan  legislation, as was mentioned, that I introduced with Representative  Moore of Utah.   This bill honors our Nation's brave servicemembers by paving the way  for the creation of a monument in our Nation's Capital recognizing the  Medal of Honor and its more than 3,500 recipients.   Our Nation's Medal of Honor recipients are patriots. They have put  their lives on the line to ensure we can live freely and prosperously  in the greatest nation on Earth. That is why I am happy to have  spearheaded this from the beginning and pay homage to the values the  Medal of Honor represents--courage, patriotism, citizenship, integrity,  commitment, and sacrifice--and the brave individuals who earned it in  service to our country.   The National Medal of Honor Museum will actually open in my district  in Arlington, Texas, in the next few years, and it will also serve as a  beacon for these values.   My hope is that we are able to pass this legislation to honor these  individuals because this is a very, very prestigious award for our  Nation's veterans and for those that have sacrificed. We want to make  sure that we do everything we can to rally around this and honor the  bravest individuals who serve in our country by having a monument here  in Washington, D.C.
