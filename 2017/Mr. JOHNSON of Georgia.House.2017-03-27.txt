 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this  opportunity to congratulate the American people for what you did over  the course of a few months since January, when you found out that your  healthcare benefits were threatened by the TrumpCare repeal-and-replace  attempt.   Because you went out into the streets, because you marched, because  you attended townhall meetings, and you made your feelings known about  the fact that you wanted to save the Affordable Care Act, you were  successful. You gave backbone to the moderate Republicans who stood up  and said no to the Trump replacement.   For that, I congratulate you, and I congratulate the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that my  name be removed as a cosponsor of H.R. 1695.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Francis Rooney of Florida). Is there  objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
