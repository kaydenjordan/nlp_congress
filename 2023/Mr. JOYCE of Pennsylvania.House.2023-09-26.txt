 Mr. Speaker, last week our national debt  reached a record $33 trillion. During the next 30 years, the interest  payments alone on this debt will become  [[Page H4471]]  the Federal Government's single largest expenditure.   Now more than ever, we need to address the runaway spending that has  created this debt crisis while sending inflation skyrocketing and  costing American families an extra $10,000 a year.   Pennsylvanians cannot afford business as usual from Washington. It is  time to put an end to the wasteful spending in our budget. It is time  to stop the inflation that has driven up the prices of gas and  groceries. It is time to rein in the runaway spending and once again  pass a budget that is truly worthy of the American people.                            ____________________
