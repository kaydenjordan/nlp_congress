 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the incredible  career of CenturyLink CEO, Glen Post. Glen is retiring after 42 years  with the company. He spent 26 of these years as the CEO, a feat  recognized recently by Fortune Magazine, as Glen is one of the longest- serving CEOs in the Nation.   CenturyLink has been an incredible growth company under Glen's  leadership, expanding from 3,000 employees to more than 65,000. It is  now the third largest communications service provider in the United  States, a cornerstone of his legacy.   It is quite a story for a small, rural, family-owned telephone  company that started up in the 1930s by Clarke Williams. The company's  original principles, fairness, honesty, integrity, commitment to  excellence, faith, positive attitude, respect, and perseverance, have  remained the guiding goals under Glen's leadership.   Like his company, Glen got his start in north Louisiana. He earned  his bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Louisiana Tech  University in Ruston, Louisiana.   He received the Louisiana Tech College of Business Distinguished  Alumni Award in 1991, the Louisiana Tech University Tower Medallion  Award in 1997, and the DeGree Enterprises Lifetime Achievement Award in  Business in 2003.   In addition to his career achievements, he has provided invaluable  advice to the United States Government as a member of the President's  National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee. He has also  chaired the Communications, Security, Reliability, and Interoperability  Council in 2012 and 2013.   As a native of Farmerville, Louisiana, Glen is a north Louisiana duck  hunting, country boy at heart.   CenturyLink now operates in 60 countries and sees revenues in the  billions of dollars, yet, it remains  [[Page H4854]]  headquartered in Monroe, Louisiana, not far from where Glen grew up as  a boy. Maintaining the headquarters in north Louisiana is a testament  to Glen's commitment to his home and his State that he loves.   By growing CenturyLink locally, Glen has provided incredible  opportunities for Monroe and Louisiana. Having such a large company in  our backyard recruits talent to our region, yields higher wages, and  attracts other companies that provide complementary services within the  communications industry which, in turn, produces even more jobs.   We can build on the success of CenturyLink. Coupled with the  innovative cyber initiatives at Louisiana Tech and Barksdale Air Force  Base in Bossier City, Louisiana's Interstate 20 corridor can help lead  our Nation into the future as we continue to develop cutting-edge  technologies.   I want to thank Glen for his dedication to our region and his role in  helping us grow. His career shows how far you can go with hard work,  integrity, and commitment, and it is proof that you can achieve great  things no matter where you come from.   Today, I am proud to acknowledge the change that Glen Post and  CenturyLink have brought to north Louisiana, and I wish Glen a very  happy and relaxing retirement. It is well-deserved.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would increase the Corps of  Engineers construction account to address the $96 billion backlog in  construction projects across the country.   My amendment would offset this increase by reducing the Department of  Energy's departmental administration and bringing it closer in line  with the President's budget request.   Our water infrastructure is aging and deteriorating, and the Corps of  Engineers has failed to keep up with these projects across the country  because of the growing bureaucratic morass that delays construction and  leads to wasteful cost overruns.   While the Corps needs reforms to expedite project delivery, we in  Congress should also prioritize spending and provide more resources to  water infrastructure.   Projects in Louisiana would greatly benefit from increased  construction and operation and maintenance funding, especially projects  like the J. Bennett Johnston Waterway, the Ouachita-Black Rivers  Navigation Project, and the Madison Parish and Lake Providence Ports.  These projects are critical for the economy in the Mississippi Delta.   I commend Chairman Simpson for his leadership in increasing water  infrastructure funding since he has been chairman of the Energy and  Water Subcommittee.   This bill provides significant increases in the additional funding  pots for both construction and operation  [[Page H4926]]  and maintenance. This additional funding will increase the  opportunities for worthy projects to compete for limited dollars.   Although I intend to withdraw my amendment, Congress should continue  to provide more funding to projects across the country that improve  commerce, grow the economy, and that protect homes and businesses from  flooding. I hope to work with Chairman Simpson and his committee to  address the issue moving forward.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for his commitment to  work with me on this issue, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, I withdraw my amendment.
