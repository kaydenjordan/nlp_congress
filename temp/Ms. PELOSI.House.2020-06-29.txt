 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his tremendous  leadership in bringing this important and historic legislation to the  floor. He has been a part of advancing lower costs for healthcare and  better benefits for all Americans in his career in Congress. I thank  Mr. Scott for his tremendous leadership as chair of the Education and  Labor Committee and for the opportunity he is giving us today. I salute  the gentleman and Chairman Pallone, the chair of the Energy and  Commerce Committee, who has played such an important role in all of  this, as well as Mr. Richard Neal, chair of the Ways and Means  Committee, so much an important part. These three committees of  jurisdiction and the members of their committees have been so essential  to its excellence and to its success.   I also salute our freshmen who have been leading the charge to lower  healthcare costs and strengthen healthcare protections every step of  the way from the first day they arrived in the Congress.   In the election of this past 2018, Democrats made a pledge to the  American people. For the people we would do three things. For the  people we would lower the cost of healthcare by lowering the cost of  prescription drugs and preserving the preexisting medical condition. We  are doing that today.   For the people we would not only lower healthcare costs, we had  bigger paychecks by building the infrastructure of America in a green  way with good paying jobs. We will be doing that the rest of the week.   For the people we would be having cleaner government, and that is  what we did the end of last week with the Justice in Policing Act, as  well as part of our H.R. 1, voting for statehood for the District of  Columbia. There is certainly more to come on the cleaner government  front as we fight for voting at home and removing obstacles to  participation.   But here today we are focused on that first for the people priority.  Access to affordable care is a matter of life and death. That is so  self-evident as we see every day during the COVID-19 crisis which now  has killed more than 125,000 Americans, infected over 2.5 million  Americans, and left tens of millions of people without jobs.   As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said: ``Of all the forms of  inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and most inhuman  because it often results in physical death.'' Yes. As lives and  livelihoods are shattered by the coronavirus, the protections of the  Affordable Care Act are more important now than ever, and this is a  health justice issue.   Democrats with this bill will strengthen America's health and  financial security during this time of crisis and for years to come. It  lowers Americans' healthcare coverage costs: Significantly increasing  the Affordable Care Act's affordability subsidies to be more generous  and cover more middle class families. It negotiates lower prescription  drug prices: Drawing from our H.R. 3 legislation to ensure that  Americans no longer have to pay more for our medicines than Big Pharma  charges for the same drugs overseas.    This has been a long-term goal of Democrats in the Congress. In 2006  when we were running and won the majority, our For the People  equivalent agenda was a new direction for America, Six for '06, and we  had six bills that we said we would pass immediately upon obtaining the  majority. We passed all six of them in the House of Representatives.  Five of them became law. Only one of them did not, the law enabling the  Secretary of HHS to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices. This  has been a fight over the years we continue to make because it is  central to not only the health but the financial health security of  America's working families.   In addition, this legislation expands coverage and pushes holdout  States to adopt Medicaid expansion for the 4.8 million cruelly excluded  from the coverage.   It combats inequity in health coverage faced by communities of color,  expands more affordable coverage to vulnerable populations, and fights  the maternal mortality epidemic.   And it cracks down on junk plans which are such a rip--let me just  pay you all the time for my health insurance but you won't be there for  me when I need care. So it cracks down on those junk plans and  strengthens protections for people with preexisting conditions.   What is interesting in this whole debate is to hear the President and  Members on the other side of the side say that, oh, they are all for  protecting preexisting conditions.   Oh, really?   Then why are you in the Supreme Court of the United States to  overturn them?   Now, just back to this bill. According to analysis from the Center  for Budget and Policy Priorities, our legislation that we have on the  floor today will help lower the costs for well over 17 million more  Americans and safeguard the Affordable Care Act's lifesaving  protections for 130 million Americans with preexisting conditions.   When they say they are for allowing people with preexisting  conditions to get coverage, they don't say at what cost. This is one of  the biggest differences--well, with stiff competition--but one of the  biggest differences between Democrats and Republicans on healthcare for  Americans. We guarantee affordability and protect the preexisting  medical condition as not being an obstacle to access. They are in Court  trying to overturn it.   Sadly--and this is a stark contrast, as I point out--as Democrats  unveiled our lifesaving legislation last week, President Trump went to  the Court doubling down on his lawsuit to tear down the ACA and  dismantle every one of its protections, including the preexisting  medical condition benefit. At a time when families need healthcare more  than ever, the President is trying to strip protections from about 130  million Americans with preexisting conditions and take coverage away  from 23 million Americans. That does not even go into what he is trying  to do to the enhanced benefits that all Americans with healthcare  enjoy.   We need to build on the progress of the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act to lower health costs and prescription drug prices,  not rip away American healthcare in the middle of a pandemic.   What sense does that make?   On day one of this Congress led by Representative Colin Allred, the  House voted to throw our full legal  [[Page H2638]]  weight into defending this lawsuit. Yet more than 190 Republicans have  voted against that resolution, choosing to be fully complicit in the  President's attempt to tear away health protections. We continue to  call on the President to abandon his lawsuit to destroy the Affordable  Care Act and urge him instead to call on the 14 States who have refused  to expand Medicaid to do so.   Doesn't it just make sense at the time of a pandemic? It is always  important.   It would have been amusing if this were not so deadly serious to hear  Senator Cornyn say: Well, these people who have lost their jobs because  of this pandemic could always sign up for the Affordable Care Act.   Really?   But he is trying to take it down.   The administration has a responsibility to defend the law of the  land, not to tear it down. Today, Members of Congress have a choice to  strengthen America's healthcare protections and lower healthcare costs  or to be complicit--once again, I use that word--in President Trump's  campaign to dismantle families' healthcare. Make no mistake. A vote  against this bill is a vote to weaken America's health and financial  security during a pandemic.   When I was growing up, I remember my mother used to always say: If  you don't have your health, you don't have anything.   Health is so central. As you see, the American people place a high  value on it when they say they don't want to go out too soon to  jeopardize their health or the health of those they have at home.   So, in every language when people salute each other they salute  people to their health. The Spanish say salud, the Dutch say proost,  the French say sante, the Germans say prost, the Irish say--now, this  is hard because Gaelic is a hard language--slainte, the Italian I can  say better, salute, and in Hebrew it is l'chaim.   It is all about life and health. That is the salute. Everybody knows  it is centrally important. With this bill Democrats in the House are  offering our salute to good health to the American people, and we hope  the Republicans will join us in that salute to good health to the  American people.   Madam Speaker, I urge a strong vote for the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Enhancement Act for the people, for the children, and  for the future.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for  her exceptional leadership on behalf of America's working families. I  especially salute her now for bringing the Emergency Housing  Protections and Relief Act to the floor. It is urgently needed, and I  rise in support of it because it is, as I said, an urgently needed  lifeline for working families as COVID-19 exacts its devastating impact  on millions of lives and livelihoods across America.   I salute Chairwoman Maxine Waters, who, as the chair of the Financial  Services Committee, is a relentless, persistent, and dissatisfied  [[Page H2659]]  force for good on behalf of America's working families, and she is  especially focused on their financial security, housing being central  to that.   I thank Denny Heck for his leadership on this important legislation  as well.   As we know, Mr. Speaker, there had been an affordable housing crisis  in America long before this pandemic which challenges the conscience of  our country and now has been exacerbated by COVID-19.   Before the crisis, one-quarter of America's 44 million renters paid  over half their income on rent, putting them just one financial  emergency away from eviction and homelessness. For many, COVID-19 is  that one emergency.   Tens of millions of Americans have lost jobs, with rental households  disproportionately affected. We cannot accept a situation in which  millions of families are forced to make the devastating choice between  paying the rent or paying for groceries, prescriptions, and other  essentials, but even before COVID that was the challenge.   That is why earlier today we brought legislation to the floor to  lower the cost of prescription drugs, because it had such an impact on  the financial security of families, and now helping with the rent.   Thirty percent of renters could not make rent in June, exposing them  to the threat of eviction, particularly as eviction bans that Democrats  secured in the CARES Act end. Evictions are devastating, dismantling  financial security, and exposing children and families to situations of  financial instability that harm their health and well-being.   Children who experience evictions are already vulnerable. They are  more likely to live in families earning low incomes, belong to  communities of color which have a disproportionate impact here, and  have more special education needs than children who don't face  eviction.   I say this issue carefully because when I was a girl, my father was  the mayor of Baltimore and my mother as first lady had, as her mission,  affordable housing. She said: How can we teach children love and  respect when we don't even show them that love and respect by giving  them a decent place to live?   I was so proud because when she passed away many years after that,  The Baltimore Sun used that statement in her obituary. But this has  always been important.   When we did our Summit on Children, talking about their health, their  education, and their financial security, health leaders told us that we  must include housing in that because it has such an impact on the  psychological well-being of children. So think of the children when you  think of this, Mr. Speaker.   Again, in May, the House passed the HEROES Act, which secured $100  billion in emergency assistance to help 44 million rental households  remain stably housed, along with another $100 billion for additional  housing support and homelessness prevention initiatives, all of this  under the leadership of Madam Chair Maxine Waters.   Again, she has been fighting this fight for a long time, reaching  down into existing law and statute to find ways to take us forward.   Yet after we passed the HEROES Act, Leader McConnell said that we had  to take a pause--take a pause. The virus is not pausing, the rent  demands are not pausing, and so we cannot pause. While McConnell is  denying these families relief, the House will pass this bill to promote  housing security.   We continue to call on the Senate to pass the HEROES Act to secure  lifesaving housing and homelessness prevention measures which include,  as I said, the $100 billion, the $75 billion, and the $11.5 billion for  assistance to people experiencing homelessness and for homelessness  prevention, building on the $4 billion provided in the CARES Act. We  need more now. It includes:   The freezing of evictions and foreclosures, including expanding the  moratorium in the CARES Act to cover all renters until March 2021.   Rental assistance support for the most vulnerable in urban and rural  areas, including seniors, persons with HIV/AIDS, people with  disabilities, and people living in Tribes.   I am so pleased that Madam Chair put the special rural housing  initiative in here. It includes rural emergency vouchers to support  people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, including those  fleeing domestic violence and assault.   This COVID is a vicious and insidious virus. It is resourceful. It  just is out there, and it attacks people, not only their lives, but  their livelihood, their housing, their psychological well-being, and  everything else. So there are other reasons we should be passing the  HEROES Act, but right now I will stay focused on this.   I thank Madam Chair also for having the provisions that relate to  staving off foreclosures for those who will not be able to pay the  mortgage.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong bipartisan vote for the Emergency  Housing Protections and Relief Act to safeguard America's housing and  financial security during this time of crisis.   Mr. Speaker, we are asking people to shelter in place, to shelter at  home, and they should do that. But because of COVID they may be  evicted, but not if Madam Chair Maxine Waters has her way. I urge a  strong bipartisan vote for financial security for America's working  families.                                time  1515
