 Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and let me  say, through the Chair, thank you to the Senator from New York and the  Senator from Vermont, the Senator from Illinois, and others here for  the opportunity to spend New Year's with them. I know that has always  been something that has been on my bucket list--maybe not on top of the  bucket list. But, nevertheless, thank you for that opportunity. It does  feel like a long time ago, but it was, actually, only--if you can  believe this--the beginning of last week when both sides of the aisle  and both sides of the Capitol came together to pass a targeted,  responsible, and necessary relief package, which became law with  overwhelming bipartisan support. It passed here in the Senate 92 to 6.  Members on both sides of the aisle, myself included, have demonstrated  that we are willing to dedicate resources to those who are struggling  during this pandemic.    The problem with what is being put forward--the House-passed CASH  Act--is that it is not targeted to help those who are the most in need.  I will just point out that it is not just our saying that; even the  Washington Post editorial board called it ``one last bad idea'' for  2020. It singled out as ``especially wrongheaded'' the efforts of the  progressive left to depict this ``as aid to `desperate' Americans  despite the huge amounts''--this is the Washington Post's term-- ``destined for perfectly comfortable families.''  [[Page S7997]]    As others here on the floor have noted, the bill would provide a  payment to a family of five making up to $350,000. A family of five  making $250,000 would receive a $5,000 benefit. Just to put that in  perspective, that is more than was paid to a middle-class family of  five under the CARES Act that we passed back in March. In addition, the  bill would add an additional $463 billion--nearly half a trillion  dollars--to the annual debt.   Again, it is all money we have to borrow. All of this is money we  have to borrow, and that is more than the first two economic impact  payments combined. Put that in perspective, and think of other ways you  could use that amount of money. The truth is that those types of sums  could potentially be spent in many more targeted ways, but our  colleagues on the Democratic side don't even want to debate some of  those alternatives.   Allowing small businesses a second draw from the Paycheck Protection  Program would cost, approximately, $285 billion. For the cost of the  CASH Act, we could do another round of assistance to help small  businesses keep their employees on the payrolls and still have almost  $200 billion left over. The expanded unemployment benefits--signed into  law last week--will cost approximately $120 billion for 11 additional  weeks. That means, for the same cost as this proposal, we could provide  an additional 40 weeks--10 months--of enhanced unemployment insurance  benefits to those who have lost their jobs.   This is simply not targeted relief for the people who need it the  most, and those who say that we should just vote on this flawed House  bill conveniently leave out the fact that they do not want us to amend  it to make it better in order to deliver more assistance to the people  who are hurting the most.   Again, I will just point out one last time that it has been less than  a week, really, since the Senate voted and the President signed into  law a proposal negotiated, literally, over months. Every fine point of  that proposal was negotiated, and it was signed into law to provide  targeted, fiscally responsible assistance to the people of this country  who need it the most. This proposal is a shotgun approach, where a  rifle makes a lot more sense.   If you really want to help people who need this the most, at a time  when we are running a $26 trillion debt and are borrowing every penny  that we are making available to do this, we ought to sit down and  figure out how to do it in the most efficient, effective, targeted way  possible. This, absolutely, does not do that. When you have a family  who is making $350,000 a year in this country getting up to thousands  of dollars of payments and a family making $250,000 a year in this  country getting, under this proposal, a $5,000 check, I would argue  that it is not targeted, that it is not fiscally responsible, that it  is not efficient, and that it is not an effective way to spend the  American taxpayers' dollars.   Let's help the people who need it the most. We just passed and signed  into law a proposal that does that. I think many of us on this side of  the aisle are willing to look at other ideas and things that we could  do that would help these people more, but this is certainly not it, so  I object.    The Senator from Illinois makes a good point.   Would the Senator yield for a question?    So if the same formula is used, and you are increasing the  amount by $1,400 per person--so you are going from, basically, for a  family of four, what would be a $2,400 payment to an $8,000 payment,  and you phase that down using the same formula, does the Senator from  Illinois understand the math and why that skews toward people who make  a lot more money than they would under the other formula?    Well, I just think that you are making a point in the  statement which is not accurate because you are saying the formula is  the same. The formula is the same, but the inputs change, and so the  way it ramps down means that somebody who makes $350,000 gets a payment  under the Sanders-Hawley proposal that they wouldn't--but they  wouldn't--no, and it phases out a lot sooner, as you know.   So let's be clear about how that formula works. You are  misrepresenting the way that formula works.    I have not seen the Tax Policy Center, but I know math,  and I know as a basic principle that when you stick bigger numbers in  there and you are using the same formula to phase something out, you  are going to make it available to people who make a lot more money.  That is a mathematical fact.   And what you are saying, when you talk about the same formula, it  skews entirely different in the income scale, and you know that.   And all I am saying is don't misrepresent the facts.    Will the Senator from Vermont allow me to respond to that  question?    Well, very simply, what you are suggesting--what you are  saying here is that the owner of the Washington Post, who said this is  really bad policy and shouldn't be done in this way at the end of this  year--is that what you are saying? That because he is a wealthy person,  that somehow that is why he is making that statement?  [[Page S7999]]         I think the Washington Post editorial board, in most  cases, has been very sympathetic to the argument of the Senator from  Vermont.    In fact, they take a liberal point of view on almost every  issue.   My point, very simply, is that we have a limited amount of resources.  This is borrowed money, as the Senator from Vermont knows. And when we  spent months--literally months--and you ask: Why can't you guys just  come down here, why can't you just come down here and debate this, we  tried for months to get the Democrats down here to debate a bill. We  put a bill on the floor in September, we put a bill on the floor in  October, a coronavirus relief bill, and you guys blocked it. You didn't  even want to talk about it. You didn't want to have an opportunity to  amend it.   We have been working at this for months, and we finally arrived,  after months, at a proposal that helps people who need it the most,  including nutrition assistance, including rental assistance, and  including checks to people--    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arkansas (Mr. Cotton), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the  Senator from Colorado (Mr. Gardner), the Senator from South Carolina  (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Georgia (Mrs. Loeffler), the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Perdue), and the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Sasse).
