 Mr. Speaker, just moments ago the distinguished  gentlewoman from California made the statement and asked why  Republicans don't want clean air and clean water. I reject that premise  because this administration would rather mine in the Congo where they  use child slave labor, zero environmental standards, and zero labor  standards to get to these EV vehicles.   This administration has stopped mining in the biggest copper-nickel  mine in the world, which is in northeastern Minnesota, and my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle and this administration has  stopped it.   Don't come here and ask me why my Republican colleagues and I have  the stance we have. We are environmentalists, and we want clean air and  clean water. That is an excuse.   We can mine in this country. We do not have to sign memorandums of  understanding with the Congo who use child slave labor, and that is a  fact. We can mine in northeastern Minnesota using union labor with the  best environmental standards and the best labor standards in the world,  but my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refuse to allow it to  happen along with this administration.   Don't stand on this House floor and say this about the Republican  Party and my colleagues. We are environmentalists, as well. We mine in  the United States of America. We mine in northeastern Minnesota. We can  show the world. Because when we allow China to meet the demands for  critical minerals, those pollutants get in the jet stream and affects  us all, as the gentlewoman from California says. We breathe that  disgusting air that comes from the communist country of China. So let  us mine here, Mr. Speaker. Allow this administration to let us mine  here.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this rule so we can  consider H.R. 1435, the Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act.   This week, we read about the horrific cross-country road trip  President Biden's Secretary of Energy faced as she tried to travel the  country in her electric vehicle.   At every stop, Secretary Granholm struggled to charge her government- paid EV. She had to send staffers in gas-powered vehicles ahead of her  to stand in line at the EV charging station, going so far as to block  families from charging their own vehicles on hot summer days.   Her gas-powered vehicle was used by her staff so they could go sit in  front of a charging station waiting for her to come so she could charge  her vehicle to make a statement and let that family suffer waiting for  the charging station to be open.                                time  1300    Now, just imagine if Secretary Granholm tried driving across northern  Minnesota in the middle of winter when it was 20 below, 37 below, or 50  below. By the way, that cold in Minnesota, we still go to work and we  still mine and we still weld, in the coldest of temperatures. Can you  imagine her trying to do that? I am not even sure her EV would even  start.   My constituents do not have the luxury of having government-paid  staffers to advance their road trips and access EV charging stations  ahead of time.   My constituents cannot afford to pay an extra $17,000, on average,  for an electric vehicle, especially as Bidenomics destroys the  pocketbooks of my constituents who have had to pay an average of  $10,000 more a year.   If Americans want to drive EVs, they can, but they shouldn't be  forced to. It should be their choice. Today, nearly 95 percent of  Americans drive an internal combustion engine, a vehicle powered by  gasoline or some form of ethanol or biofuels.   If liberal elitists from California want to drive electric vehicles,  so be it. My constituents should not be forced to do the same. I  believe in choice, not mandates by the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this rule  and supporting H.R. 1435, because it is time that Congress steps up and  protects our constituents from ridiculous mandates that affect our way  of life.
