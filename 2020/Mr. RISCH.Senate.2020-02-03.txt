 Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor Moss Greenhouses located in Jerome as the  Idaho Small Business of the Month for February 2020.   Moss Greenhouses is the largest wholesale plant producer and  distributor in Idaho. Founded in 1952 by Ed and Ruth Adams, their hobby  of growing orchids in their small greenhouse quickly became a budding  business as they provided flowers, orchids, and flowering crops to  their local grocery stores and flower shops. The family-run business  quickly developed a reputation for its outstanding service and quality  products.   Today, Moss Greenhouses is owned and operated by the family's third  generation, Kevin and his wife Dana. Their 300,000 square feet of  covered greenhouse and three acres of growing space allow them to serve  customers from throughout the Mountain West. Their success and growth  has created dozens of jobs for the Jerome community. As the company  continues to serve the Jerome area, they hope to eventually welcome the  family's fourth generation into the business.   Congratulations to Kevin, Dana, and all of the employees at Moss  Greenhouses for being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the Month  for February 2020. You make our great State proud, and I look forward  to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
