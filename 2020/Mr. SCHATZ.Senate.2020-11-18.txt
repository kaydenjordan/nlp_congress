 Mr. President, today, I rise to pay tribute to MAJ  Catherine ``Catie'' Shutters Sundin and her service as an officer in  the U.S. Army. I am especially grateful for her support to my office as  an Army congressional fellow from January to December 2017 and, later,  as the Army congressional budget liaison, where she supported my  responsibilities as the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations  Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. Major  Shutters Sundin will complete her military service in November after  more than 12 years of honorable service.   A native of Muskegon, MI, Major Shutters Sundin entered the military  as a paralegal in the Indiana Army National Guard. After completing her  initial military training, she attended Wentworth Military Academy and  Junior College in Lexington, MO, where she commissioned as a second  lieutenant. She completed her undergraduate degree in sociology at the  University of Central Missouri and accessed nto Active-Duty status as  an aviation officer. She attended flight school at Fort Rucker, AL, in  2008, graduating as a UH-60 Blackhawk pilot. She also has a master's  degree in legislative affairs from the George Washington University.   Major Shutters Sundin has served in a number of assignments during  her Army career. Her first assignment as an aviation officer was with  the 5th Battalion, 101st Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne  Division at Fort Campbell, KY. As a small unit leader in Alpha Company,  she deployed her platoon to multiple joint training exercises and  ultimately to Khost Province in eastern Afghanistan in support of  Operation Enduring Freedom 12-13. While in combat, she served as task  force intelligence officer, where she was charged with leading an  intelligence unit that provided threat analysis, briefings to aircrews  and leadership, and assisted military decision making.   Upon redeployment, Major Shutters Sundin attended the Maneuver  Captains Career Course at Fort Benning, GA, in preparation for her  company command at Hunter Army Airfield, GA. There, she commanded Bravo  Company, 4th Battalion, 3rd Combat Aviation Brigade from January 2014  to February 2016. Major Shutters Sundin's team of 42 personnel and 10  UH-60M assault helicopters supported a number of training exercises to  include a 9-month deployment in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve.  Bravo Company was the first aviation unit to be a  [[Page S7073]]  persistent presence in Eastern Europe, where they flew across the  Baltic States and Poland to strengthen NATO relationships while  deterring against the threat of Russian aggression.   In 2017, as an Army congressional fellow, I had the privilege of  working with Major Shutters Sundin in my office for a year and during  her subsequent assignment as the Army congressional budget liaison. She  worked tirelessly with Members of Congress and their staff to  accurately represent the Army's budget positions to the Senate and  House Appropriations Committees. Her professionalism, diligence, and  commitment to the mission are unmatched, and her work as a fellow and  as a liaison well represented the U.S. Army and the Department of  Defense to the U.S. Congress.   The foundation of Major Shutter Sundin's military success is her  family. Raised in the Midwest as one of five children, her family  established particular values early on: service, sacrifice, and  compassion. She is a devoted wife to her husband Carl, who also serves  as an officer in the U.S. Army. Their commitment to service and care  for others infuses every organization to which they belong. Together,  they are examples of servant leaders in the U.S. Army and to their  communities.   Throughout her career, Major Shutters Sundin has positively impacted  soldiers, peers, and superiors. Our country has benefited tremendously  from her extraordinary leadership, judgment, and passion. I join my  colleagues today in honoring her dedication to our Nation and  invaluable service to the U.S. Congress as an Army congressional  liaison.   Mr. President, it has been a pleasure to have worked with a talented  officer. On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in  recognizing and commending MAJ Catherine ``Catie'' Shutters Sundin for  her service to our country and wish her all the best as she explores  new ways to continue her service.                            ____________________
