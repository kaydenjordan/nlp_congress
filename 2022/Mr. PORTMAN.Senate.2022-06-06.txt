 Mr. President, today is a very important day in American  history, June 6, the anniversary of D-day. One of the most important  and consequential battles of World War II occurred on that day.   Every year I have served in this body, I have a practice of coming to  the floor and reciting the famous D-day Prayer that Franklin D.  Roosevelt delivered to the Nation on the morning of June 6, 1944. It  was a consequential battle in the sense that it really marks the  beginning of the end of World War II, the beginning of the end of  Hitler. It is my favorite Presidential statement.   Seventy-eight years ago, as the American people slept in their beds,  the greatest naval invasion in history began and the Greatest  Generation was born. On that fateful day, tens of thousands of American  soldiers, sailors, and airmen joined our allies from around the world  to begin what General Eisenhower called the ``Great Crusade,'' one that  sought to free a continent and liberate millions from the grip of  tyranny. They came by amphibious landing craft, by gliders laden with  men and material, by parachutes deployed deep behind enemy lines. And  on the beaches called places like Omaha and Utah and at the cliffs of  Pointe du Hoc, they struck a mortal blow to the Nazi regime.   Thousands would give their lives for this cause--over 2,500 Americans  alone. Like many in this Chamber, I have seen the American cemeteries  there, the rows of white crosses and the stars of David that go on and  on are a stark reminder of the price those brave heroes paid for all of  us.   These men did not go into battle alone. As General Eisenhower said to  the Allied Expeditionary Force on the eve of this risky battle: ``The  hopes and prayers of liberty loving people everywhere march with you.''   As the battle was engaged, President Franklin Roosevelt spoke to the  Nation. He did not choose to address the American people with one of  his trademark fireside chats, nor did he choose to use a speech;  instead, he delivered words of prayer by radio address, as the fate of  Europe and indeed the entire free world hung in the balance.   It was a powerful prayer that transcended all faiths. I think it  captures, perhaps better than anything else I have ever seen, what we  as Americans should be most proud of. We are liberators, not  conquerors, and it also talks about the righteousness of that cause.   This prayer must never be forgotten, and that is why I come to the  floor, and that is why I would like to recite it now.   This is what he said:         My fellow Americans:        Last night, when I spoke to you about the fall of Rome, I       knew at that moment that troops of the United States and our       allies were crossing the Channel in another and [yet] greater       operation. It has come to pass with success thus far.        And so, in this poignant hour, I ask you to join with me in       prayer:        Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our nation, this day have       set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our       Republic,  [[Page S2793]]       our religion, and our civilization, and to set free a       suffering humanity.        Lead them straight and true; give strength to their arms,       stoutness to their hearts, steadfastness in their faith.        They will need Thy blessings. Their road will be long and       hard. For the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces.       Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return       again and again; and we know that by Thy grace, and by the       righteousness of our cause, our sons will triumph.        They will be sore tried, by night and by day, without       rest--until . . . victory is won. The darkness will be rent       by noise and flame. Men's souls will be shaken with the       violences of war.        For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They       fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end       conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice       arise, and tolerance and good will among all Thy people. They       yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the       haven of home.        Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive       them, Thy heroic servants into Thy kingdom.        And for us at home--fathers, mothers, children, wives,       sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas, whose thoughts       and prayers are ever with them--help us, Almighty God, to       rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this hour of       great sacrifice.        Many people have urged that I call the nation into a single       day of [special] prayer. But because the road is long and the       desire is great, I ask that our people devote themselves in a       continuance of prayer. As we rise to each new day, and again       when each day is spent, let the words of prayer be on our       lips, invoking Thy help to our efforts.        Give us strength, too--strength in our daily tasks, to       redouble the contributions we make in the physical and the       material support of our armed forces.        And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the long travail,       to bear sorrows that may come, to impart our courage unto our       sons wheresoever they may be.        And, O Lord, give us faith. Give us faith in Thee; faith in       our sons; faith in each other, faith in our united crusade.       Let not the keenness of our spirit ever be dulled. Let not       the impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters of but       fleeting moment--let not these deter us in our unconquerable       purpose.        With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over the unholy forces       of our enemy. Help us to conquer the apostles of greed and       racial arrogances. Lead us to the saving of our country, and       with our sister nations into a world unity that will spell a       sure peace--a peace invulnerable to the schemings of unworthy       men. And a peace that will let all of men live in freedom,       reaping the just rewards of their honest toil.        Thy will be done, Almighty God.        Amen.    Yes, amen. What a powerful statement--one that deserves to be  remembered for generations to come.   By the way, to ensure its place in history, back in 2013, shortly  after I was elected to this body, I introduced legislation called the  World War II Memorial Prayer Act with former Senator Mary Landrieu and  then after her, Senator Joe Lieberman. Representative Bill Johnson took  the lead in the House of Representatives.   This was legislation that directed the Secretary of the Interior to  install a plaque at or near the World War II Memorial on the National  Mall here in Washington with these words, the words of FDR's D-day  prayer. And we said no Federal funding would be used for this; we would  raise the funding privately.   It was the Ohio Christian Alliance president, Chris Long, who first  came to me with the idea of a plaque displaying this historic prayer.  Since that legislation was signed into law in 2014, which kicked off  the lengthy Commemorative Works Act process for siting and installing  the plaque at the Memorial, the Friends of the National World War II  Memorial and the National Park Service have worked to develop and  refine the final plaque design and receive a variety of approvals from  the National Park Service, the Commission of Fine Arts, the National  Capital Planning Commission, and others.   In the meantime, we have gone ahead with a beautiful temporary plaque  that has been in place since 2019 at what is called the Circle of  Remembrance, which is just north of the World War II Memorial.   So if you are here in Washington, go to the Mall, see the World War  II Memorial, which is spectacular. Then look to the north and go to the  Circle of Remembrance, and you will see the prayer on display there. By  the way, it is the only prayer on display on the National Mall.   We hope that the final version of this plaque and the Circle of  Remembrance being remodeled will be done by the end of this year.   The process has been going on for 8 years, longer than World War II  itself actually, so we are eager to see that final plaque installed,  and I know it will be. The temporary plaque, by the way, was generously  donated to the Friends of the National World War II Memorial with the  help of John Nau, from Houston, TX, a great patriot, and also the Ohio  Christian Alliance and others who provided funding for this.   In October 2020, the Lilly Endowment provided a $2 million grant for  the construction and installation of the final plaque, and it is this  committed financial support that will allow the project to get across  the finish line, even with some hurdles. So I thank the Lilly Endowment  for their support.   I also want to recognize the tireless efforts of the Friends group,  especially Holly Rotondi, who has led the effort in fundraising and  coordinating the project over the past several years. Thank you, Holly.   D-day was a day of tremendous loss and also monumental triumph. Those  who lost their lives that day did not die in vain. The fate of the free  world rested on their shoulders. Those brave young men, many Americans,  charging the beaches of Normandy, and President Roosevelt's prayer that  day helped to comfort a nation in a time of great uncertainty. I am  glad that his words will soon take their proper place in our memorial  to the war that changed the course of history.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
