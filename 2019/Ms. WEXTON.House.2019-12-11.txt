 Mr. Speaker, a constituent of mine named Josh aged out of  his parent's health insurance when he turned 26. Josh was a Type 1  diabetic and by then, his insulin cost was nearly $1,200 per month.   So he switched to over-the-counter insulin because, like so many  others, he couldn't afford the prescription brand recommended by his  doctors. Already on a tight budget, Josh was engaged and wanted to save  up some money for his wedding and building a new life with his fiancee.   His mother knew that he had changed his medication and when she would  check on him, his blood sugar would be high, but he assured her that he  was all right and the insulin was working.   He was alone at work in June of this year when he suffered a series  of strokes that would prove fatal, and it was his fiancee who found  him.   We have miracle drugs that can save lives, but they don't do any good  when the American people can't afford them.   In April, I hosted a roundtable with constituents and healthcare  providers about the skyrocketing price of diabetes medication. Nurses  and pharmacists shared stories about patients who had no option but to  ration their insulin, putting their lives and their health in serious  jeopardy.   One, who ran a free clinic, spoke about how refugees were absolutely  stunned at how much more Americans were paying for their prescription  drugs than they had in the countries that they were fleeing from.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support H.R. 3, the Elijah Cummings Lower  Drug Costs Now Act because the inability to afford necessary drugs  should not be a death sentence in the United States of America.   We are going to give HHS the power to negotiate lower drug prices for  the American people. And those lower prices will be available not only  to Medicare beneficiaries, but also to Americans with private health  insurance.   With the projected savings from this bill, nearly half a trillion  dollars, we will provide vision, dental, and hearing benefits for all  Medicare beneficiaries and invest in new medical research.   American families and seniors should not pay more for their  medications than what the drug companies charge people in other  countries.   This bill is a win for the American people. It represents a historic  investment in Medicare and historic savings on the cost of prescription  drugs. Without this legislation, the rising price of prescription drugs  will continue to take a toll on the finances of American families, and  in worst cases, cost lives.   What happened to Josh should never happen to anyone in this country.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  lifesaving legislation.                            ____________________
