 Mr. Speaker, I will be voting for this bill for the  children who are forgoing their school and for the millions of children  for whom that means that they are losing the stability and the  nutritional support that comes with it.   I will be voting for this bill for my family members and my friends  and constituents who have lost their jobs in the past 2 weeks because  of this pandemic.   I will be voting for this bill so that we may deliver support to the  small business owners and restaurateurs throughout central Virginia who  have closed their doors in order to stop this pandemic and keep their  neighbors safe.   I will be voting for this bill for the healthcare workers in my  district who are risking their lives to make our communities safer.   I am grateful to the sanitation workers, the mail carriers, the UPS  workers, the FedEx workers, the grocery store workers, and those who  work in our nursing homes and facilities across our districts and  across our country. I thank them for adding a bit of stability to our  country during this extremely difficult time.
