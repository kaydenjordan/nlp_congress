 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a legendary  Arizonan, Frank Kush, who passed away last week at age 88.   Frank is best known for his career as coach of the Arizona State  University Sun Devils football program. He won 176 games over 21\1/2\  seasons, the most ever in Sun Devil history. He was named national  Coach of the Year after the 1975 season and was elected to the College  Football Hall of Fame in 1995.   Coach Frank Kush was not only concerned with wins and losses, he was  a mentor for young men and ensured that their professional and academic  development rose above their athletic prowess. Coach Kush influenced  hundreds of young men during his career at Arizona State. His impact is  ever-present in the lives of his former players, and his legacy will  never be forgotten.                            ____________________
