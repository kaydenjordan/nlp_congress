 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute as in morning business.    Madam President, Governor Reynolds designated this week  as ``Severe Weather Awareness Week'' in Iowa. That goes beyond just a  flooding situation; it is because of the catastrophic flooding  throughout our State and to tell everybody that it is not over. The  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned of  significant spring flooding yet to come.   We are seeing increased flows in the Missouri River, the Mississippi  River, and their tributaries. Iowans should review their insurance  policies for gaps and consider flood insurance. That is one of the  things Governor Reynolds is suggesting. Also, it would be good to have  a plan in case it is necessary to evacuate, including important  personal belongings and pets. FEMA's website, ready.gov, can help you  with that information.   Iowans know severe weather, including massive snowstorms, flooding,  tornadoes, and heavy winds. The key is that we prepare, help our  neighbors, and stay vigilant.   I thank Governor Reynolds for alerting people to the future, as well  as worrying about the past.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, another thing that I shouldn't have to  come to the floor to talk about--and it will only take me about 3 or 4  minutes--is that I am still hearing questions about my intent to object  to the nomination of William Evanina. These are the same questions I  heard last year when I initially placed my hold on Evanina.   By the way, my hold is printed in the Record, and the rules of this  Senate require all Members who put a hold on a nomination or a bill,  within 2 days after doing that, to put something in the Record, and  most Senators aren't following that rule of the Senate. So if you have  some disagreement about something and you put a secret hold on and  somebody wants to sit down and talk with you to see what is wrong, how  are they going to know who it is? That is why, in 2011, on a vote of 96  to 4, Senator Wyden and I got these rules, so there should be no secret  holds in the U.S. Senate.   So I am back here again. This statement will be the fourth time since  June 4, 2018, that I have publicly expressed my reason for this hold  here on the Senate floor. It seems to me no one has been listening to  what I have been saying, but what is unusual about that?   As I have said repeatedly, the Judiciary Committee has experienced  difficulty in obtaining relevant documents and briefings from the  Justice Department and the Office of the Director of National  Intelligence.   Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein personally--I want to  emphasize--personally assured me that the Judiciary Committee would  receive equal access to information provided to the House Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence with regard to negotiations about the  pending subpoenas from that committee related to the 2016 election  controversies.   I haven't received equal access, as promised.   On August 7, 2018, I wrote to the Justice Department and pointed out  that the House Intelligence Committee received documents related to  Bruce Ohr on May 8, 2018, that the Judiciary Committee did not receive.  [[Page S2069]]    I ask unanimous consent to have that letter inserted in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                        U.S. Senate,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, August 7, 2018.      Hon. Rod J. Rosenstein,      Deputy Attorney General,      U.S. Department of Justice.        Dear Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein: As we have       discussed on several occasions, you agreed to provide the       Judiciary Committee equal access to documents produced to the       U.S. House of Representatives, including those pursuant to       requests and subpoenas from the Select Committee on       Intelligence related to 2016 election controversies.        Unfortunately, even though you gave me your word that the       Committee would receive equal access, the Department has       failed to deliver. On July 12, 2018, the New York Times       reported that the Trump Administration ordered ``more       lawmakers be given access to classified information about an       informant the F.B.I. used in 2016 to investigate possible       ties between the Trump campaign and Russia . . .'' The       article also reported that, ``[t]he F.B.I. files about the       informant will now be available to all members of the Senate       and House Intelligence Committees, instead of to just a group       of congressional leaders known as the Gang of Eight.''        As you are aware, in the authorizing resolution that       created the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Senate       explicitly reserved for other standing Committees, such as       the Senate Judiciary Committee, the independent authority to       ``study and review any intelligence activity'' and ``to       obtain full and prompt access to the product of the       intelligence activities of any department or agency,'' when       such a matter ``directly affects a matter otherwise within       the jurisdiction of such committee.''        This Committee has jurisdiction over all federal courts,       including the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).       Based on public reporting, the new information provided to       the Intelligence Committees appears to be relevant to an       application to the FISC, which is an issue that has already       been subject to extensive oversight by this Committee. Some       of that oversight has been public, when possible. However, as       you know, the Committee has also conducted its oversight       responsibilities through classified letters, briefings, and       document reviews. We have respected the limitations necessary       to protect national security information. The Department has       been responsive to the Committee's previous oversight       requests and has provided access to the FISA application and       some of the relevant background materials on more than one       occasion, which is appreciated.        Yet, my Committee staff have attempted to informally work       with the Department's Office of Legislative Affairs to obtain       the equal access you promised to all of the relevant       materials, but to no avail. For example, on March 23, 2018,       the House Intelligence Committee requested the records of       nine individuals related to Steele, his dossier, or campaign-      related applications to the FISC. The nine individuals are:        1. James Comey,        2. Andrew McCabe,        3. Peter Strzok,        4. Lisa Page,        5. Sally Moyer,        6. Bill Priestap,        7. Greg Brower,        8. James Baker,        9. Bruce Ohr.        The Department produced records to HPSCI related to Bruce       Ohr on May 8, 2018, but initially withheld them from this       Committee and denied that any records relevant to these       topics had been provided to HPSCI. Only after Committee staff       confronted Department staff with the misrepresentation were       the Ohr documents finally produced to this Committee on May       21, 2018.        Accordingly, no later than August 14, please produce all       records previously produced to HPSCI pursuant to its request       and answer the following questions:        1. Are the 63 pages of Ohr-related records produced to this       Committee on May 21, 2018, the sum total of all responsive       Ohr documents in the possession of the DOJ or the FBI? If       not, when will production of records responsive to this       request be complete?        2. When will DOJ and FBI begin producing documents to this       Committee pursuant to this request from the other eight       individuals?        3. When will the Department provide in camera review on       equal terms for the material referenced in the New York Times       article?        Please send all unclassified material directly to the       Committee. In keeping with the requirements of Executive       Order 13526, if any of the responsive documents do contain       classified information, please segregate all unclassified       material within the classified documents, provide all       unclassified information directly to the Committee, and       provide a classified addendum to the Office of Senate       Security. Although the Committee complies with all laws and       regulations governing the handling of classified information,       it is not bound, absent its prior agreement, by any handling       restrictions.        Thank you in advance for your cooperation with this       request. If you have questions, please contact Jason Foster       of my Committee staff.            Sincerely,                                               Charles E. Grassley,                              Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary.     Mr. President, the Department flatout denied that those  records had been provided to the House Intelligence Committee.   That wasn't the truth.   After my staff confronted the Department, we eventually received some  documents.   There is no reason for stonewalling; there is no reason for lack of  cooperation--plain and simple.   In that August 2018 letter, I asked for additional documents based on  my equal access agreement with Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein. To  date, the Department still hasn't provided a response.   I later learned that the Justice Department has taken the position  that Director Coats has prohibited them from sharing the requested  records with the committee.   Then, in addition to the outstanding records request, in May 2018,  the Director of National Intelligence and the Justice Department  provided a briefing in connection with the pending House Intelligence  subpoena, to which no Senate Judiciary Committee member was invited.   The Judiciary Committee's attempt to schedule an equivalent briefing  has been ignored.   The lack of cooperation, then, obviously, as any one of the 100  Senators would do--the bureaucracy, the faceless bureaucrats, are  forcing our hand. Congressional oversight is a constitutional  requirement. It seems that in every administration--Republican or  Democratic--I am forced to remind them of that constitutional  responsibility of oversight, and that responsibility cuts both ways.   The executive branch can't hide documents from one congressional  committee, especially one that clearly has oversight jurisdiction over  the matter, and at the same time provide those very same documents to  another committee.   In this case, my colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee have  received these documents. I don't blame them at all for getting that  information. I say to them: full speed ahead with whatever you need to  do.   However, that doesn't mean this Senator has to stand down. It is  quite the opposite. I am going to fight until I get what has been  promised to me but, more importantly, promised to 21 members of the  Judiciary Committee.   I think it is worthy of note that the authorizing resolution that  created the Senate Intelligence Committee made clear that other  committees still have authority to review intelligence documents.   For example, S. Res. 400 explicitly reserves for other standing  committees, such as the Judiciary Committee, independent authority to  ``study and review any intelligence activity to the extent that such  activity directly affects a matter otherwise within the jurisdiction of  such committee'' and ``to obtain full and prompt access to the product  of the intelligence activities of any department or any agency'' within  that jurisdiction.   The information I seek is connected to the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Court. That court is within the jurisdiction of the  Judiciary Committee.   Now, to be fair, the Justice Department has provided access to FISA  applications and some of the relevant background materials on more than  one occasion. One must give credit where credit is due. However, if  they have provided the Judiciary Committee access to that information,  what is holding them back from showing us the rest? The secrecy just  doesn't make any sense, and it is secrecy that often prevents  accountability.   I will not release my hold until the Justice Department upholds its  equal access agreement with me and the Judiciary Committee.   In no way am I questioning Mr. Evanina's credentials. Director Coats  and others have spoken highly of him. The fact is, if they really do  believe in his credentials, then they should produce the requested  documents they have promised me more than once.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am pleased that my colleague, Finance  Committee Ranking Member Wyden, will be joining me in introducing the  Taxpayer First Act of 2019 later today. This legislation seeks to  modernize the Internal Revenue Service, improve taxpayers' services,  and strengthen taxpayer protections.   The package of IRS reforms we will introduce today is the culmination  of years of work by both the Senate Finance Committee and the House  Ways and Means Committee. It is truly a bipartisan package that adopts  provisions authored by committee members on both sides of the aisle of  the House and the Senate.   Former Chairman Hatch of Utah deserves a lot of credit for working to  reach a bipartisan, bicameral agreement at the end of the last  Congress, which is reflected in the legislation we will be introducing  this afternoon.   I know Senator Hatch put a lot of work into trying to get this  legislation across the finish line last year. Unfortunately, it wasn't  meant to be, due to both political realities and, maybe, time  constraints--even more so.   However, his work helped us get to where we are today. In other  words, we are advancing a great deal of what Senator Hatch worked on,  and our hope is that it will allow us to move quickly this year and  finally get these commonsense reforms of the Internal Revenue Service  enacted into law.   Some of the IRS reforms in this legislation include establishing a  truly independent Office of Appeals within the Internal Revenue  Service. This will help ensure the playing field is not tilted against  taxpayers when those taxpayers are in dispute with the Internal Revenue  Service.   To help bring the Internal Revenue Service into the 21st century, the  legislation also would require the IRS to submit to Congress a plan to  redesign the structure of the Agency to improve efficiency, enhance  cyber security, and better meet taxpayer needs.   It also includes a number of provisions to protect the taxpayers  better from tax ID theft and improve taxpayer interaction with the IRS,  should they become a victim of that crime. This includes creating a  single point of contact in the IRS to help the taxpayers navigate the  bureaucracy and resolve their issues as quickly as possible.   To provide taxpayers with better protection against becoming such a  victim in the first place, the legislation will expand to all taxpayers  an IRS program that currently allows victims--and only victims--of tax  ID theft to obtain a personalized PIN that better secures the identity  of any taxpayer who asks for it.   The legislation also puts in place new safeguards to protect  taxpayers against recent IRS enforcement abuses of so-called  structuring laws. On several occasions, the IRS used these laws to  seize bank accounts of small business owners when no underlying  criminal activity was present. This includes seizing $33,000 from a  small business owner who operated a small restaurant in Arnolds Park,  IA, for nearly 40 years. The IRS--on a whim, taking $33,000 from that  small business--caused the business to close, and the owner did nothing  wrong in the end. Provisions in our bill will help ensure these types  of abuses never occur again.   I would also like to note the improvements to the IRS whistleblower  program that are contained in the bill.  [[Page S2091]]    In 2006, I authored legislation establishing a mandatory Internal  Revenue Service whistleblower program. Since it was established, the  IRS whistleblower program has turned into one of the most effective  programs addressing tax evasion, leading to the recovery of more than  $5 billion in taxes that otherwise would have been lost to fraud.   Unfortunately, too many IRS whistleblowers continue to be treated  like a skunk at a picnic. They often wait for years, and while they are  waiting for years, it is in the dark, with no indication of whether the  information they provided to the IRS would ever lead to a successful  recovery or whether their reward is even being processed.   Moreover, they are often putting their careers on the line, exposing  corporate tax shelters with no protection should their employer decide  to retaliate.   Provisions in our bill will help to address these issues by  authorizing the IRS to communicate with whistleblowers, in certain  instances, while protecting taxpayer privacy.   What we are really saying is this: You ought to let these  whistleblowers, who are patriotic people, trying to help the Federal  Government collect money that wouldn't otherwise be collected--treat  them like the patriotic citizens they are.   The bill would also extend anti-retaliation provisions to IRS  whistleblowers that are presently afforded to whistleblowers under  other whistleblower laws--the False Claims Act, which I authored in  1986, as well as the more recent Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which came out of  another committee that I didn't serve on.   Finally, the bill includes modifications to the private debt  collection program. I have long been a proponent of this program as a  way to tackle the tax gap and to promote tax fairness. It works by  assigning certain tax debts, which the IRS otherwise would not attempt  to collect, to an outside contractor to pursue.   In other words, if the IRS isn't going to go after all the money that  is owed to the taxpayers--and we don't want $1 more than what people  owe, but we want every dollar that people do owe--if they aren't going  to go after it, we ought to find some way to go after it. That is why  we have outside contractors pursuing some of these issues that the IRS  isn't going to pursue.   Recent quarterly revenue reports demonstrate the program has the  potential to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue on an  annual basis.   I understand some of my colleagues, particularly on the House Ways  and Means Committee, have been concerned that the program has been too  heavily focused on lower income taxpayers. We listened to these  concerns, and we worked to develop a sensible compromise while yet  strengthening the long-term viability of this program.   These are just a few of the provisions in this bill. There are many  others that will go a long way toward making the IRS work better for  taxpayers.   I also know that some of my colleagues have additional ideas that we  were unable to include in this package. I want them to know that I see  this legislation as a first step toward reforming the IRS and  strengthening taxpayers' protections.   I agree there is more that we can do. I am committed to evaluating  additional proposals with input from all of our colleagues on reforms  that could be included in a package of additional IRS reforms later  this Congress.   But first things first. Companion legislation is being introduced in  the House, which I hope the Senate will receive in the near future.   I ask all of my colleagues to join me and Ranking Member Wyden in  supporting this bipartisan bill.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Gillibrand,          Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Bennet, Ms. Smith, Ms. Hirono, Ms. Cortez          Masto, Ms. Harris, and Ms. Rosen):   S. 923. A bill to fight homelessness in the United States by  authorizing a grant program within the Health Resources and Services  Administration for housing programs that offer comprehensive services  and intensive case management for homeless individuals and families; to  the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
