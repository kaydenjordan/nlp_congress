 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Florida for her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I am sorry to report to my friends on the other side  that we are not voting today on whether or not to censure President  Trump, but one Adam Schiff.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this censure resolution. Adam  Schiff has denigrated the office which he holds, and the standards of  this very body. The American people, when they elect their  Representatives, place trust in them that they will act with honesty  and integrity.   Adam Schiff had access to our Nation's secrets and then intentionally  created a web of lies, falsely alleging his tales of foreign  interference and Russia collusion. He perpetrated blatant falsehoods,  publicly, loudly, and repeatedly to the American people.                                time  1445    How many times did we hear him claim that he had seen evidence of  Russian collusion?   He betrayed the trust of the American people. This resolution will  censure Schiff for his gross abuse of power using his position as  chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to  access our Nation's most sensitive information to then mislead the  American people and his colleagues here in this Congress.   The other side often speaks of decorum and holding up the integrity  of this body. Now it is time for them to put their actions to their  words.   Will they continue to support the lies promoted by the Congressman  from California, or will they vote in favor of maintaining the  integrity of this distinguished body?   I challenge them to vote today for integrity, to vote for truth, and  to vote to censure Adam Schiff in this House.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of the CHOICE  Arrangement Act because it charts a course for Americans to take charge  of their healthcare.   This bill includes several important provisions, including one of my  bills, the Self-Insurance Protection Act. Self-insured healthcare plans  give employers more choices to build and tailor health plans that best  meet the needs of their employees.   Self-insured plans are popular. In fact, in 2022, 65 percent of  workers were enrolled in self-insured plans. Small and midsize  businesses are turning to self-insured plans because of the  flexibilities they provide in offering high-quality healthcare coverage  at an affordable cost to employees.   Stop-loss insurance is a critical component of an employer's ability  to successfully self-insure in a way that best suits their needs. Most  employers choose to purchase stop-loss insurance to manage financial  risk, shielding them from potentially catastrophic medical claims that  could sink their businesses.   Unfortunately, Washington bureaucrats have tried to regulate stop- loss insurance into nonexistence. The Obama administration threatened  to regulate stop-loss as traditional health insurance, a move that  would make self-insurance inaccessible, and force individuals onto the  ObamaCare exchange and drive up costs.   My bill would make sure the Biden administration can't mandate the  decision of small business owners and weaponize regulations to prevent  access to stop-loss policies for small business owners.   Additionally, some State laws unfairly limit small businesses from  accessing the self-insured market solely based on the size of their  operations. My legislation would protect the ability for businesses to  self-insure and ensure that no government entity can prevent them from  making the best possible decision for their business and their  employees.   Another key provision of the CHOICE Arrangement Act would make  Association Health Plans more accessible for small businesses and self- employed workers.   This policy is a big win for my home State of Virginia. Last year,  Virginia passed a law allowing realtors to form Association Health  Plans. Sadly, the Biden administration has threatened to block  implementation of the State law because it doesn't comply with  ObamaCare.   Voting for the legislation today would allow for the Virginia law to  flourish without Federal Government intervention. The Medicare for All  mentality thinks that businessowners aren't equipped to provide quality  health coverage for their employees. That simply is not the case.   A majority of Americans, 159 million, in fact, have health benefits  through their jobs, and they like their plans. Madam Chair, 78 percent  of employers decide to enroll in employer-sponsored insurance when  given the option.   The CHOICE Arrangement Act responds to the needs of the American  people, and I hope all of my colleagues can support this effort to  empower small business owners across America.    Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, President Biden  ignored the will of this Congress and issued a veto message of my  resolution, which would have nullified his reckless, unconstitutional,  immoral student loan transfer scheme.   As others have said, he is not trying to forgive student loans, he is  trying to saddle unsuspecting taxpayers with the burden of paying for  others' student loan debt.   Republicans and Democrats should come together, as they have already  done on a bipartisan basis, and send a strong message on congressional  authority to the executive branch.   Again, President Biden simply does not have the authority to forgive  student loans, and thus, spend hundreds of billions of dollars,  taxpayer dollars, hard-earned taxpayer dollars, as he transfers debt to  those who did not incur it.   The power of the purse belongs to the legislative branch. It belongs  to the House of Representatives. I suspect the Supreme Court will  confirm that if we don't override this veto.   The President seems to even know this himself. When talking about  student loan forgiveness on CNN just about a year ago, he said, ``I  don't think I have the authority to do it by signing with a pen.''   Student loan cancellation, again, doesn't make the debt go away. It  transfers the costs from the borrowers to the taxpayers, those who  never went to college, those who worked hard and paid off their student  loans, or those who worked their way through school to avoid student  loan debt.   In fact, 60 percent of the constituents in my district do not have a  college degree. Yet, the Biden administration wants them to have to pay  for the college education of others, even those earning up to $250,000  in a typical family, or a nontypical family, I should say.   So we are going to make plumbers and welders and carpenters pay for  the student loan debt for the high-income earners.   There were a handful of Democrats in the House and the Senate who  supported my resolution when it was first sent to the President's desk.  I urge more of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to act  today to stop the unilateral actions of President Biden that are  worsening the higher education financial crisis, unfairly transferring  debt to those who didn't borrow it, and usurping the constitutional  congressional authority of this House.    Mr. Speaker, that won't take very long.   I thank my good friend from Colorado, Mr. Buck, for his leadership on  this Special Order on this critical issue tonight.   One of the key responsibilities, if not the number one  responsibility, of the House of Representatives is to protect the  fiscal and economic health of the country and the government, at least  our ability to meet our obligations, our ability to fund our  priorities, our ability to borrow when necessary--not to the degree  that we do today--in times of crisis.   I want to make a couple of key points, if I may. Before the pandemic  hit, before the China virus reached our shores, our annual spending was  about $4.4 trillion. Spending this year is projected to be about $6.2  trillion, so an increase of $1.8 trillion, or about 40 percent, over 4  years.   The most ambitious of the somewhat serious proposals in this majority  Conference to deal with the spending or to cut spending this year in  this Congress is to cut about $130 billion. That is the most ambitious  of what I would say is serious that is getting any traction in this  Congress--in other words, to cut from a projected $1.6 trillion of  nonmandatory, discretionary spending to $1.47 trillion.                                time  2120    Think about that $130 billion, which is the ambitious plan. That is  the stretch goal. It represents less than 10 percent of the increase in  spending from pre-COVID to today over 4 years.   We have grown our spending in the discretionary spending by $1.8  trillion in 4 years, and yet we are only projecting to cut it or even  suggesting to cut it by $130 billion.   Said another way, we are on track to have a deficit this year of  somewhere between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion. Revenues are down,  spending is up. Again, the most ambitious, the stretch goal of the  somewhat serious plans in this Congress is to cut spending by $130  billion. Less than 10 percent of the projected deficit.   If we got through the $1.47, we would retain 90 percent of the  projected deficit this year. In addition to it crushing us from a  fiscal future standpoint, it is unsustainable. As you know better than  I, we are on track to hit some $53 trillion in national debt in 10  years, if we don't have any new emergency exceptional special spending,  but just on the current track--unsustainable.   Our friend from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert) talked about the interest on  the debt and how that is growing, and it is just unsustainable. Even in  the immediacy, the American people are getting crushed today by this  spending.   The massive inflation we haven't seen in 40 years, a diminishing  purchasing power by some 15-16 percent on average over the last 2  years. In other words, $1,000 2 years ago is worth $850 today. It is  even worse in the essentials. Groceries are up much higher. Everybody  needs to buy groceries. Utility costs are much higher. Energy costs in  terms of gasoline at the pump, which is probably the biggest factor  that impacts senior citizens, low-income, fixed-income, middle-income  Americans, or anybody else. Housing costs are through the roof.   We have inflation crushing the American people. How have we responded  to the inflationary costs?   We are crushing them with the massive increase in interest rates  historically utilized to combat a hot economy to try to head off  inflation, to cool the economy--that is the theory. I never really  agreed with that theory, but that is the theory.   Instead, what we are doing, we caused the inflation, not from a hot  economy, but we caused the inflation from the massive spending. What we  are doing is this futile attempt to combat inflation by raising  interest rates. We went from an average mortgage rate being about 3  percent a year ago to now 7 percent. That extra 4 percent--figure an  average mortgage is $300,000 in today's prices. So, 4 percent of  $300,000 is $12,000, divide that by monthly. The average mortgage is  $1,000 a month more than it was a year ago. That doesn't even account  for the higher costs in housing, utility costs, and the grocery costs.  All of that is primarily a result of the massive spending that is just  crushing the American people. It is crushing their purchasing power. It  is crushing their ability for their kids or their grandkids to make a  start, buy a home, establish themselves in their young career. It is a  result of the disastrous policies by this administration.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Buck for his leadership on this all  important issue and keeping the attention where it belongs.    No tough ones.    Mr. Speaker, we work for the American people,  the GAO works for us, and by extension the American people. So 77,000  buildings approximately, as you mentioned, it costs a couple billion  dollars a year to sustain those buildings, the maintenance of those  buildings, operate those buildings, maintain them, staff them, whatever  it might be.   What about the value of the 77,000 buildings?   Why wouldn't we sell those buildings and realize the revenue to the  Treasury?   Not just the $2 billion a year of not having to maintain those  buildings. Let's just say that the average value of that building is  $100,000. Let's be real conservative, let's say it is a million  dollars--77,000. What is that?  [[Page H3065]]    That is $77 billion worth of assets if the average building was worth  a million dollars. If it is only worth $100,000 on average, that is  $7.7 billion. That would be not much more than a rounding error, the  way that we spend money in the trillions here. When you take that over  time, it ends up to be a few billion here, a few billion there, and  before long you are talking about real money.
