 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of one of  Riverside's finest citizens, Robert ``Bob'' Melsh.   Bob dedicated his life to community, to activism, and to making our  society more just and equal for everyone. His commitment to the  political process and to our democracy has been integral to the growth  and political involvement in Riverside.   Through his work, he found a way to get everyone engaged and make  everybody know their value in our democracy. He encouraged people to  raise their voices and make sure elected officials listened.   Bob was an organizer. He knew what our community cared about; he  fought for what we needed; and he was a force to be reckoned with. For  Bob, social progress was inevitable but not without effort.   I had the honor to know Bob beyond the world of politics, and I will  always remember him recounting his story of organizing a concert for  the iconic Louis Armstrong, otherwise known as Satchmo, in Riverside.   Bob, I am going to really miss you. Riverside is going to miss you.                            ____________________
