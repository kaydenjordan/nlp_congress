 HORN of Oklahoma asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn  the tragic death of Dustin Parker.   At 25 years old, Dustin was a loving father, a hard worker, and a  generous member of his community in McAlester, Oklahoma. As a man who  happened to be transgender, Dustin helped found the McAlester chapter  of Oklahomans for Equality.   Sadly, Dustin was shot and killed on New Year's Day. While we do not  know who is responsible for Dustin's death, we do know that transgender  Americans are disproportionately the victims of violent crimes. Last  year, more than two dozen trans and gender nonconforming people were  violently killed, that we know of. Every death underscores the Nation's  need for urgent action to address this epidemic.   Mr. Speaker, our country lost a champion for equality. As we continue  to search for answers following Dustin's death, we must continue to  fight to ensure that all Americans are treated with dignity and  respect.   My prayers are with Dustin's entire family for their loss, and my  heart goes out to our communities bearing this pain.                            ____________________
