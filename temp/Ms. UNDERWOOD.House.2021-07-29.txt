 Madam Speaker, since day one in Congress, bringing  Federal resources to help the 14th District of Illinois thrive has been  one of my top priorities.   As a new member of the House Appropriations Committee, I am so proud  of how much we have accomplished in just 7 short months. Just last  week, I was pleased to announce that over $10.5 million in Federal  funding for community projects was included in the House's  appropriations legislation.   These projects will improve the quality of life and economic  opportunity in northern Illinois. In Joliet, Pingree Grove, and  Richmond the resources will improve water infrastructure to give each  community a reliable water source for years to come.   In McHenry, the resources will help expand access to higher education  through dual credit programs at McHenry County College.   In Kendall County, the resources will help foster youth and their  advocates by developing a permanent advocacy office for CASA of Kendall  County.   These investments are critical, and I will continue to work with my  colleagues in Congress until these resources are seen and felt in our  community.                            ____________________
