 Mr. President, I rise today to remember and honor  Judge James M. Munley and Judge A. Richard Caputo, who collectively  served the Middle District of Pennsylvania as Federal district judges  for over 40 years.   Judge Munley was a native of Archibald, PA. After graduating from the  University of Scranton in 1958, he joined the U.S. Army and served  until 1960. After his military service, Judge Munley enrolled at the  Temple University School of Law and graduated in 1963. He clerked for  the Honorable Michael J. Eagen on the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania  before practicing law in Scranton from 1964 to 1978. From 1978 to 1998,  Judge Munley served with distinction as a judge on the Lackawanna  County Court of Common Pleas. In 1998, Judge Munley was nominated to a  seat on the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania  by President Bill Clinton. He was confirmed by the Senate and went on  to serve the Middle District honorably for over two decades.   As a Federal judge, Judge Munley continued his family's tremendous  legacy of public service and dedication to Pennsylvania. Both of his  parents, Robert W. Munley and Marion L. Munley, and his grandfather,  William J. Munley, served in the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Judge  Munley has been remembered by members of the Pennsylvania legal  community as a skilled, good-natured, and fair jurist who approached  life with a sense of optimism that ``was contagious in the best sense  of the word.'' In his courtroom and in his life, he was known to treat  everyone with the same dignity, respect, and kindness. U.S. District  Judge Malachy E. Mannion remembered Judge Munley by noting: ``What  defined him most was just his sense of humanity. He was a great judge,  but he was a greater human being.''   Judge Caputo was born in Port Chester, NY, and raised in Rye, NY. He  graduated from Brown University in 1960. After Brown, Judge Caputo  enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania Law School and graduated in  1963. He went on to join the U.S. Air Force as an officer in the Judge  Advocate General's Corps and served until  [[Page S2062]]  1967. After his military service, Judge Caputo worked as a public  defender in Luzerne County for 1 year before joining the law firm of  Shea & Shea. In 1973, the firm was renamed Shea, Shea & Caputo, and  after nearly 30 years in private practice, Judge Caputo was nominated  to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of  Pennsylvania by President Bill Clinton in 1997. After being confirmed  by the Senate, he honorably served on the Federal bench in the Middle  District for over two decades.   Judge Caputo was known as a strong and fair jurist who treated  everyone with deep respect in his courtroom. He strongly believed in  balancing individual rights with the needs of a well-ordered society,  and some in the Pennsylvania legal community have remembered him as a  judge who was not afraid to depart from Federal sentencing guidelines  when he found them to be too harsh. He was deeply committed to the  judiciary, as evidenced by the fact that he continued to hear cases up  until just a few months prior to his death. He believed that the  judiciary was the heart of our democracy. Chief U.S. District Judge  Christopher Conner remembered Judge Caputo as a `` `judge's judge'--a  strong, direct and erudite jurist,'' who made ``extraordinary  contributions to the Wilkes-Barre vicinage, to our entire court, and to  our country.''   At a time when our Nation faces unprecedented challenges in  responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, Judge Munley and Judge Caputo are  important reminders of the intellect, compassion, and fairness that  have guided our Nation since its founding. They will be missed  tremendously, but their legacy will continue to inspire countless  Pennsylvanians and individuals throughout our country.                            ____________________
