 Madam Speaker, today I wish to recognize the treasured  life and significant contributions of Judge Michael W. Kwan, a pillar  of our community, who passed away on July 21, 2020.   Judge Kwan was a trailblazer in my State, known for leading on  innovative judicial programs that respect the rights of the accused and  improve public safety for Utahns.   A pioneer in his field through offering a drug court, Judge Kwan's  forward-thinking approach emphasized rehabilitation. This has served as  a model for other courts across the United States.   Judge Kwan stood as an example to many of those dedicated to public  service, holding fast to our common ideal of justice for all.   Judge Kwan was a stalwart voice in Utah's Asian-American community,  fighting for the full story and to recognize the significant  contribution of Chinese workers to the completion of the  transcontinental railroad over 150 years ago.   As the great-grandson of one of those workers, Judge Kwan helped  found the Chinese Railroad Workers Descendants Association.   I was privileged to have known Judge Kwan. I mourn the loss of this  extraordinary public servant together with his  [[Page H3842]]  family, loved ones, and our entire community. I am certain that his  impact will be felt for decades to come.                            ____________________
