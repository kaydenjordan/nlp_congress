 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R.  1862.   While I support the underlying goal of punishing sex offenders, the  existing Federal statutes already severely punish these offenses. This  legislation, unfortunately, will impose a mandatory sentence of life  imprisonment.   This expansion of mandatory minimum sentences of life without parole  comes on the heels of Attorney General Sessions' memorandum of May 12,  2017, which has been roundly criticized for rescinding the Holder memo.  The Sessions memo directs all Federal prosecutors to pursue the most  serious charges and the maximum sentence to include mandatory minimum  sentences. This directive takes away from Federal prosecutors and  judges the ability to individually assess unique circumstances of each  case, including any factors that may mitigate against imposing a life  sentence in every case.   A life sentence is a most severe form of punishment, second only to  the death penalty. Careful consideration should be given when our  society imposes a life sentence, and judges should have the discretion  in determining when this severe punishment should be imposed.   Now, I point out that this punishment would be imposed not only on  the ringleader, but on anyone involved in a conspiracy. We have seen  how that works in drug conspiracies where a girlfriend who takes a  phone message or drives her boyfriend to a deal would be included in  the boyfriend's conspiracy and subject to the same draconian mandatory  minimum the boyfriend is subjected to.    In this case, the defendant would have to have a prior conviction.  But life without parole would be the penalty upon a conviction, with no  consideration being given to how long ago the conviction occurred or  how serious a conviction was or what role the defendant played in the  instant case.   For decades now, extensive research and evidence has demonstrated  that mandatory minimums fail to reduce crime, they waste the taxpayers'  money, they discriminate against minorities, and often require a judge  to impose a sentence so bizarre as to violate common sense.  Unfortunately, there are already too many mandatory minimums in the  Federal code. If we ever expect to do anything about that problem and  address this major driver of mass incarceration, the first step we have  to take is to stop passing new mandatory minimums or bills that expand  mandatory minimums.   Mandatory minimums did not get in the Federal code all at once--they  got there one at a time, each one part of a larger bill, which, on  balance, might have been a good idea. The only way to stop passing new  mandatory minimums is to stop passing bills that contain mandatory  minimums.   Giving lip service to a suggestion that you would have preferred that  the mandatory minimum not have been in the bill and then voting for it  anyway, just creates another mandatory minimum, and guarantees that  those who support mandatory minimums will include them in the next  bill. That is how we became number one in the world on incarceration.   Recent studies have shown that we lock up so many people that our  incarceration rate is actually counterproductive. There are so many  people in jail, so many people being raised with parents in prison, so  many people with felony records, and so much of the Justice Department  budget being used on prisons that aren't doing any good, that could  have been used for constructive activities. We lock up so many people  that the incarceration rate is actually counterproductive.   Mr. Speaker, I support the underlying goals of H.R. 1862 to punish  sex offenders against children, but I do not support expanding  mandatory minimums, in this case, life without parole.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would not be controversial if it had not  included mandatory minimums, but, unfortunately, it does. So I,  therefore, urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1862.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R.  1842.   While I support the underlying goal of punishing sex offenders, the  existing sentencing laws already provide serious punishment for this  conduct. Unfortunately, this legislation expands nonmandatory minimums  to additional offenders.   This expansion of mandatory of minimums comes at the heels of  Attorney General Sessions' memo, which has been roundly criticized for  rescinding the Holder memo and directing all Federal prosecutors to  pursue the most serious charges and the maximum sentence, to include  mandatory minimum sentences.   The Sessions memo takes away, from Federal prosecutors, the ability  to individually assess the unique circumstances of their cases and any  factors which would mitigate against seeking the harshest sentence in  every case. Once that offense triggers a mandatory minimum and once  that is charged, the sentencing judge loses any discretion to assess  the unique circumstances of the case and, upon conviction, must impose  the mandatory minimum provided in the code.    This legislation is remarkable in that it extends a number of  exceptionally high mandatory minimums to most defendants. The mandatory  sentence of life without parole is expanded to apply to more cases. The  mandatory sentence of 35 years is expanded. In other cases, the  mandatory minimum would triple from 5 years to 15 years.   These are grave sentences, and the judge should have discretion in  determining when they should be imposed. And these sentences would  apply not only to the ring leader, but to everyone who may be involved  in the activity and subject to a conspiracy conviction. The mandatory  minimum eliminates the ability of the judge to consider the individual  circumstances of the case or the culpability or the role of the  defendant in that case.   For decades now, extensive research has been done on mandatory  minimums, and the conclusions are: they do not reduce crime; they do  not protect anybody; they waste the taxpayers' money; they discriminate  against minorities; and they often require judges to impose sentences  so bizarre that they violate common sense.   When you see how these are worked in drug cases, you can be reminded  of President Obama's policy to consider full commutation. Those who  are, essentially, first offenders who have been convicted of  nonviolent, low-level activity in a drug case would be considered for  commutation after 10 years.   Now, that seems reasonable, but what you ought to ask is the  question: How did a low-level, nonviolent first offender get so much  time that, after 10 years, they still need help from the President? The  answer is: mandatory minimums. The judge had no choice but to impose  that bizarre sentence.   Unfortunately, there are already too many mandatory minimums in the  Federal code. If we ever expect to do anything about the problem and  address that driver of mass incarceration, the first step we have to  take is to stop passing new mandatory minimums or bills that expand  existing mandatory minimums.   Mandatory minimums in the code did not get there all at once; they  got there one at a time, each, part of a larger bill which, on balance,  seemed like a good idea. Therefore, the first step we have to take in  reducing mandatory minimums is to stop passing new ones or to stop  passing bills that expand mandatory minimums.   For these reasons, while I support the underlying goals of H.R. 1842,  to punish sex offenses against children, I oppose expanding the  application of severe mandatory minimum sentences such as the 15 and 35  and life imprisonment.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would not be controversial without the  mandatory minimums; but, unfortunately, they are in the bill, and I,  therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.
