Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for  supporting the Defending Elections against Trolls from Enemy Regimes  Act, aka the DETER Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation I introduced  with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Lindsey Graham,  Senator Blumenthal, and Senator Grassley.   This legislation would prevent foreign regimes from exploiting U.S.  immigration laws to undermine U.S. elections. Specifically, it would  make ``improper interference in U.S. elections'' a violation of  immigration law.   Given the ongoing threat to the United States in terms of the  integrity of our electoral process from Russian interference, we need  to ensure that we are denying--and, if necessary, revoking--any visas  to foreign nationals who seek to improperly interfere in our elections.   One of the most important takeaways from the Mueller report is that  Russia successfully attacked America in 2016 by doing everything it  could to undermine our election process.   Page 1 of the Mueller report says: ``The Russian government  interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic  fashion.''   The report detailed numerous examples of Russian interference,  including an ``intelligence-gathering mission'' that employees of the  Internet Research Agency--also known as the IRA--took in June of 2014.  The IRA was the Russian troll farm that waged information warfare  against the 2016 election with stolen identities, fake social media  accounts, fake campaign events, and even attacking the voter list for  the State of Illinois.   The report and the earlier indictment of several IRA employees noted  that two of the Russians arrived in the United States for a 3-week trip  ``for the purpose of collecting intelligence to inform [IRA's]  operations.''   The DETER Act would respond to threats like this, barring foreign  actors from traveling to our country to interfere in our elections. I  thank my colleagues for supporting this important legislation which was  approved on Monday night. I hope the U.S. House of Representatives will  quickly pass it and send it to the President's desk for his signature.   This should be the first of many steps Congress takes to deter and  punish future election interference by the Russians or by any foreign  power.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand), the Senator from  Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and  the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand), the Senator from  Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and  the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand), the Senator from  Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and  the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand), the Senator from Minnesota  (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the  Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Massachusetts  (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, every day, the American farmer works hard  to keep the faith and survive unknowns--from changes in the marketplace  or the unpredictability of the weather, to changes in public policy. We  saw that in the 1980s with disruptions in our export markets, depressed  prices, creeping debt, and high production costs. We see that same  today. Just like then, Illinois farm families have a trusted person  fighting to keep their operations strong and to help pave the way for a  stronger future for farming--his name is Steve Scates.   I am here today to honor my friend Steve, who was recently named one  of this year's Southern Illinois University Distinguished Alumni. He  has more than earned this prestigious recognition.   A native of Shawneetown in southern Illinois, Steve has worked his  entire life in agriculture, from production agriculture with his  grandfather, who founded Pat Scates and Sons Farm, to developing public  policy that supports our farmers. Ever since he earned his bachelor's  degree from Southern Illinois University in 1959 in animal sciences,  Steve has been actively involved in a wide range of professional  agricultural organizations, including in several leadership posts, like  chair of the Illinois Soybean Association board of directors.   President Bill Clinton recognized Steve's experience and hard work  supporting the Illinois farming community by appointing him the State  Executive Director for the Illinois offices of the USDA Farm Service  Agency, where he served for 8 years and played a critical role in the  implementation of the 1996 farm bill programs.   He went on to serve as chairperson of the Illinois Council for Food  and Agricultural Research. During his time there, he received more  awards than can be counted, including the Farm Bureau Eagle Award, the  USDA Secretary's Award, and the SIU College of Agricultural Sciences  2008 Outstanding Alumni Award.   With all the awards and recognition, Steve's career has really been  about helping people. While he is part of one of the largest farming  operations in Illinois, he has always worked to look out for the  interests of the smallest of farming operations to ensure they received  a fair shake.   Although today they say that Steve has retired from farming, I know  that he is still actively involved and serves as a senior partner at  Pat Scates and Sons Farms and on the board of directors for Scates  Gardens, Inc. Steve is never far from his partner and wife, Kappy, and  his heart is always with his fabulous family.   Illinois agriculture is lucky to have a champion like Steve and his  family still going strong in the farming community. America and  Illinois need leaders like Steve now more than ever.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
