 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize John O. Brown as the  Tennessee Second District's November 2019 Veteran of the Month.   A Vietnam war veteran, Sergeant Brown served in the U.S. Army for  almost 13 years before medically retiring in 1971.   John Brown was born on January 17, 1936, in the metropolis of Kettle  Hollow, Tennessee. He graduated from Horace Maynard High School in  1951, joined the Army in 1958, and deployed to Vietnam as part of the  Ninth Infantry Division in 1966. During his 12 months in Vietnam, Brown  rose to the rank of sergeant first class before returning stateside.   In 1969, Sergeant Brown received orders to return to Vietnam. On June  20 of that year, he was wounded in action and medically evacuated. The  injury resulted in the amputation of one of his legs.   For his bravery and service throughout his military career, Sergeant  Brown was awarded the Purple Heart, the Silver Star, the Combat  Infantry Badge, the Bronze Star, and the Army Commendation Medal.   Despite living with a service-related disability, Sergeant Brown  enthusiastically reentered civilian life. He earned degrees from  Tennessee State Regional Vocational School and the Tennessee Institute  of Electronics. Upon his graduation, he worked in sales for Sony and  then became JVC's director of government overseas sales. He retired  after a 27-year career with JVC.   I am proud to recognize John O. Brown as the Tennessee Second  District's November 2019 Veteran of the Month.  [[Page H9042]]                                ____________________
