 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  50th anniversary of Gulfstream Aerospace, the largest private sector  employer in Georgia's First Congressional District.   Gulfstream's origins as an aerospace company are steeped in American  history. During World War II, Roy Grumman built war planes for the  United States during the war. After the war ended, he sought a new use  for his resources and, in 1958, founded Gulfstream to build business  airliners instead.   Mr. Grumman's first project, the Gulfstream I, made its first flight  on August 14, 1958. This purpose-built business aircraft was the first  of its kind and revolutionized general aviation. Gulfstream produced  more than 200 of the original aircraft, many of which are still  operating today. The first project spawned more aircraft models and  helped exciting innovations take off.   On September 29, 1967, Gulfstream landed in Savannah, Georgia, where  it remains headquartered to this day. Savannah offers optimal land  availability, labor supply, transportation facilities, and weather  conditions, making it the perfect location to operate.   We have gladly welcomed Gulfstream in our district for the last 50  years, and this impressive company has greatly contributed to the  community by employing nearly 10,000 people.   Congratulations to Gulfstream Aerospace on reaching its 50th  anniversary, a milestone I am confident it will continue to build on.                            ____________________
