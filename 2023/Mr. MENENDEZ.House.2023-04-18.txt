 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition to  H.R. 734, a bill that chooses politics over protecting our children,  specifically our trans children.   With all the challenges we are facing as a country, with all the  challenges so many working and middle-class families are facing, it is  astonishing that we are here debating legislation that seeks to target  our children.   I intentionally say ``our children'' because I do believe as  legislators we should be concerned about every child in America,  whether they live in a red or blue State, urban or rural community, and  however they choose to identify.   Yet, Republicans, not just in this body but in legislatures across  the country, have set their mark on trans children. When we speak of  trans children, by most estimates, we are talking about 300,000 people  in a country of 331 million, and even fewer who participate in school  sports.   Just think about that. With all the power bestowed upon us, upon this  august institution, Republicans are choosing to use that might to  prevent trans children from participating in sports. They do so instead  of working with Democrats to provide tangible solutions to the  challenges that so many Americans are facing.    Why are we not voting today to make permanent the expanded child tax  credit, which lifted 2.9 million children out of poverty?   Why are we not voting today on legislation that would make pre-K  available to all families and, in doing so, alleviate one of the most  significant burdens that working parents face each and every day?   Why are Republicans not focusing on these issues, debating and voting  on real change for the majority of American families?   This week, Republicans will constantly talk about protecting our  children, yet they won't work to solve the  [[Page H1768]]  gun violence epidemic that we have in our country, an epidemic that  continues to be a stain on each and every one of us.   We have to acknowledge the complete absurdity that Republicans are  more comfortable sending their children to school to participate in  active shooter trainings than they are having their children play  alongside a trans teammate.   The leading cause of death of children in this country, in our  country, is gun violence. Yet, Republicans are here trying to prevent  trans children from participating in sports.   The GOP's title of this bill is Protection of Women and Girls in  Sports Act of 2023, but have we not asked ourselves about the children  that this bill seeks to target? Who is protecting them?   When will we remember that we show our true strength by concerning  ourselves with the most vulnerable amongst us?   We are supposed to be the ones who are guided by President Lincoln's  encouragement to have faith that right makes might. Being on the side  of those who others seek to marginalize is the right side of history  and shows true strength.   Mr. Speaker, on the topic of strength, let me be clear about one  thing. Every single trans individual in this country who continues to  be their true and authentic self in the face of constant bigotry and  hate has more strength and courage than anyone who chooses to vote for  this bill.   As the Book of John reminds us: ``If anyone has material possessions  and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can  the love of God be in that person? Dear children, let us not love with  words or speech but with actions and in truth.''   As a father, I know that the single greatest gift that we can give  our children is the love, support, and encouragement they need to be  the truest and most authentic versions of who they are because we as  adults know that this life is hard and that giving our kids that  support is the least we can do.   Instead of trying to make life just a little easier, especially for  those individuals who have found the bravery to be open about who they  are, Republicans are trying to put out their inner light by making them  feel different, by ostracizing them from their peers.   As I have said before and will say so long as it needs to be said, I  love every single trans individual in this country because they are my  brothers, my sisters, my neighbors, and my fellow Americans.   This bill is wrong. Targeting the trans community is wrong, and I  won't stand for it.   Mr. Speaker, I am a ``no'' on H.R. 734, and I urge my colleagues to  do the same.                            ____________________
