 Mr. Speaker, what an honor it is to be on this House  floor with you here today in representation of the 700,000 constituents  I serve from Michigan's 11th District. We are here for the activity of  this House floor. We are here for the grand deliberation of our  democracy and for the discourse that makes our Nation's laws.   It is clear, Mr. Speaker, that this pandemic is continuing to pose a  serious threat to our communities and to our Nation. As the global  death toll has crossed 500,000 this week alone, the World Health  Organization has warned that the worst is yet to come. The suffering  and loss of life that we have already endured in Michigan and  throughout this Nation is unfathomable.   We must recommit to saving lives by listening to the guidance of the  public health experts who are telling us to wear a mask and to socially  distance as much as possible. We must recommit to the science that  stands before us.   As a result of this pandemic, Mr. Speaker, we must look at the battle  before us in terms of what our States are facing with budget  shortfalls. You see, Mr. Speaker, this is what we do as appropriators,  as individuals who conduct oversight and who authorize the activity and  the efforts of our Federal agencies and for the Nation's purse strings.   Without additional Federal funding for Michigan's public schools, a  typical school district in Michigan is looking at a $750-per-pupil cut  to our State's budget shortfall.   The White House recently signed an executive order saying, we are  going to look for the skills in an individual. How do you obtain the  skills if you are not in a fully funded school? When first robotics  doesn't exist, when the skills training doesn't exist, and when the  guidance counselors who are going to be there to shepherd our students  through this trauma they endured cannot do their jobs?   When we are cutting, cutting, cutting. And then we say: Guess what?  The Federal taxpayer dollars that you pay and the State taxpayer  dollars that you pay are not enough.   Who pays again?   Who pays again?   It is the middle class. It is the individual.   Mr. Speaker, I am tired of it. I am tired of the tax cuts for the  wealthiest corporations at the expense of our middle class. I am here  to deliver for my constituents. I am here to give them a return on  their investment that they make every year. They are looking at us.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, this is something that this House majority has  already done in the HEROES Act. We have already taken these steps to  address these budget shortfalls. We are here today to vote on an  infrastructure bill to rebuild America's schools, to put people back to  work, and to stand for the best this Nation has to offer.   I did this work in the halls of government on the other side of  Pennsylvania Avenue during another time of crisis, during another time  of choppy waters, and I am a believer in these institutions, Mr.  Speaker. I saw what happens when Democrats and Republicans come  together for the best outcomes, when we rescued the auto industry and  millions of auto worker jobs, saying, we will not let you fail, picking  up from where the Bush administration left off and where the Obama  administration finished it.   We will not let you fail. That is what I say from this House floor  today on behalf of the 700,000 constituents from Michigan's 11th  District I proudly represent.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, it is an honor to join you in the Chamber  this evening. I thank all of our professional staff, as well; our  parliamentarian, our readers, our clerks, our typists for their  continued commitment to this institution in this climate.   It certainly feels different. We recognize that the well is no longer  open for this time period, that we speak from the desk and from the  chairs, and yet, we still speak. We still deliberate. We still conduct  the dialogue and the discourse of democracy, for that is what we do in  this institution, we erect and pass the Nation's laws.   And oftentimes we hear from the public that it feels so polarized,  that it feels too heated, that it feels stagnant because of the  polarization. Why can't you just work together? You hear that all the  time. I hear that from my district that is comprised of so many  Independents, people who are not registered as Democrat or Republican.  They are registered to vote, and they are good Americans in Michigan's  11th district, but they are looking for us to work together.   And in part, Madam Speaker, it is because I represent so many  manufacturers, so many individuals who are engineers, who are dedicated  makers and creators, so many educators, people passing those technical  skills down to the next generation, Madam Speaker. I know you have many  of those in your district in eastern Iowa. That is something us  midwestern ladies have in common, the districts we represent are full  of the people who make things. And they go to work every day not under  a partisan circumstance, right, they go to work to produce, to give a  good day's effort for that on-time delivery. That is the privilege I  have representing the largest concentration of suppliers in America.   The world changed very quickly in 2020, this new decade in this still  fledgling century. It changed so quickly with the coronavirus pandemic.  Almost overnight schools stopped, work stopped. Health and safety  paramount. The listening and the engagement with the science, the  patience that we had to provide for the science with a new virus that  swept the globe in a fiscal quarter, less than a fiscal quarter. Many  infected, many perished tragically and unfortunately, and yet, our  economy changed as a result.   And I think it is worth noting where our economy is today and what I  am seeing out of my incredible district, a manufacturing district. We  have some sayings in Michigan, the metro Detroit area. We call  ourselves ``metro Detroit.'' It is southeastern Michigan. It is just an  absolutely remarkable place. And we say, you know, Detroit hustles  harder, that Detroit hustles harder. And I like to say that Detroit  always rises, that we rise when times are steady, and we certainly rise  when times are tough. And we have done it before, Madam Speaker.   There is a fly in here, but I don't mind having a little fly buzzing  around the floor. Who'd a thunk? But the words continue.   Detroit always rises. And we say that because 10 years ago we were  staring at the edge of another cliff. Our auto industry was looking at  bankruptcy, true liquidation, in the face. And it wasn't just a  nameplate company, it wasn't just General Motors and Chrysler and Ford,  but it was the thousands of suppliers with the hundreds of thousands of  jobs, 900,000 jobs on the line.   And Democrats and Republicans together said, We are not going to let  Main Street fail. We are going to continue to be a first world Nation  with industrial assets. And that is what we did with the CARES Act.  Overwhelming support passed by a Republican Senate, a Democratic House,  signed by a Republican President standing up for the hardworking  American and for our industrial assets that we will continue to make  cars in America.   Little known fact about southeastern Michigan, we have an incredible  aerospace sector, a diversified supply chain. We just launched a  rocket, SpaceX, into outer space. So many of the suppliers in my  region, so many of the incredible workers helped produce the parts and  components that go into those rockets. It is absolutely remarkable what  we continue to do and the workforce that bests all the expectations.   So what did we do when this pandemic hit and we had to say, Guess  what? For the health and safety of everyone, auto manufacturing is  ceased for the time being. It had to shelter, it had to hibernate. But  then they stood up and said, We are going to make protective personal  equipment. Ford with their respirators. General Motors with the  ventilators. Chrysler with a million-masks source and on and on down  the supply chain.   The hand sanitizer coming from Michigan Enterprises. It has been  unbelievable having those conversations.   AlphaUSA located right in Livonia, Michigan, right where our  incredible district office is located. I saw them shortly before we  went into the shutdown, a UAW-run supplier company and they were making  the PPE. Now, we keep our fingers on the pulse of this manufacturing  sector.   And we, by the way, recognize that today it is an incredibly special  day, not only because it is America's birthday coming up and we salute  all of our good men and women, our veterans, our current members of our  Armed Forces, and those who, throughout our communities, are going to  safely engage in recognizing America's birthday.   But we are also going to recognize what July 1st is, which is, it is  the new day of our competitive framework as a North American continent.  The USMCA. What the freshman class, with so many of us, came here to  see done right, not for some, you know, bad action for the prescription  drugs or anything along those lines, but to say, We are going to make  things in America. We are going to increase Buy American content. We  are going to make and produce and sell to the world, and by golly, we  got this trade deal done.   And so now we can go and win, and we can compete more effectively  [[Page H3047]]  against China. We know they are a problem. We know they are not good  actors. We know they manipulate their currency. We know that they dump.  But yet, it is a new dynamic here with this trade deal, and it begins  today.   And I am on the phone with the trade ambassador and the deputy trade  ambassador and all our manufacturers working on an effective and fair  implementation, recognizing that given this pandemic, given the low  demand, that sales are down. It is on the front page of our Detroit  newspapers today, the free press and the news, the projected almost-40- percent decline in auto sales.   Remember my friends, Detroit hustles harder. Detroit always rises. We  rise to the industrial call in this Nation. That is what we did in  World War II. And we don't say those things because they are cliches.  We don't hearken to the Greatest Generation because it is trite. It is  because we can do big things in this Nation collectively and together.  We can fight common enemies. We can protect the health and safety of  everyone together.   Look at what is manifesting in the neighborhoods around this country.  Certainly, in the incredible neighborhoods that I represent. Right  across the street from me is an industrial park right off of Auburn  Road. And then you go on down and there is a nursing home. Heroes work  here.   We value work in America. And there is no better time than this era  that we have found ourselves in with the respect and dignity for the  value of work and organized labor and a 21st century labor movement  that is going to protect enforceable standards and make sure that no  one has to go to work afraid, but that they can successfully go to work  and produce that outcome. Everyone matters. No one should be left  behind.   Our schools, the envy, frankly, in my opinion, in my district, the  envy of the world because of our training programs. We have more first  robotics teams in Michigan than in any other State in the country.   Now, I was looking forward to going to Worlds, okay, it is located in  Michigan. It has teams from all over the world competing, not just  because they are making amazing robotic machines and pieces of  equipment, but they are doing strategy, they are doing communications,  they are doing sales, they are doing diplomacy. These students give me  hope, and we owe them all a debt, not just of gratitude but of  responsibility.   We talked a lot about the class of 2020. We talked a lot about the  class. They didn't get to go through their traditional sayonaras, the  traditional graduations, the proms, the engagements. Some of them have  senioritis to begin with. They are ready for that next step. They are  ready for that training program, that engineering degree.   Oakland University, located in my district, an amazing engineering  school leading in cybersecurity. We are a hub for cybersecurity in  Michigan's 11th District in partnership with Automation Alley. And yet  we think about our students who are still coming through the pipeline  who missed out on a sports season, who missed out on a computer science  class, and yet they are not even seniors. And we have got to think very  carefully and effectively and collectively as a government, not just  exclusively as the House of Representatives as one Chamber, but in  partnership with our government actors.   This is why I talk to the dozens of mayors from Michigan's 11th  District every week. My friends, from Commerce, to Canton, to Plymouth,  to Troy. We are on the phone with one another working, deliberating,  identifying, and engaging. How do we get the best results possible for  the most amount of people who we represent and work for in the given  time? And that is what we are doing for our students.   So I want to remind every student from the Chamber of which I am  delivering this address, the House of Representatives, we work for you  and we will continue to be accountable to you and for you. We will  listen to you, and we are so proud of you.   For the recently graduated seniors who are going to go off to that  freshman year or to that new job or to join our military, we salute  you. We are grateful for you.   And for those of you still making your way through, we are not going  to leave you behind, and we are going to continue to listen to you and  see all the ways in which you use the tools before you to succeed. It  is absolutely remarkable.   And we are going to continue with your intellect, your talent, your  brilliance to be leaders in Michigan of the manufacturing economy.   Where the world looks to us leading on electric vehicle technology,  companies like soulbrain that make the chemicals, the electrolytes that  go into the lithium-ion batteries. They are the only one in the region,  and they are one of two in the United States.   So we talk a lot about Buy American. Buy American. American jobs. Of  course, we do. We are the country that makes things that the entire  world wants to buy. And when we look at the complexity of supply chains  and sourcing Buy American and who chooses to expand their business, we  love when they come to Michigan. We do that because we have the right  policies in place, and we have the right tapestry here.                                time  1800    We are looking at our countless downtowns, small communities. I  represent the suburbs, the downtown areas, the sole proprietors, the  individual companies that are not reliant on a brand name, but they are  reliant on themselves. They are entrepreneurs. It is really quite  remarkable the leadership that they have shown.   We are going to continue to listen to them and compete on fair and  level playing fields. That is certainly a big part of it.   We are going to recognize what a diverse workforce gets us, what the  competition for talent gives us, and we are certainly going to talk  with our community stakeholders.   We did so much in the CARES Act, Madam Speaker, to make sure that we  stood up for the small businesses of America, the small businesses in  our district. It is absolutely imperative to make sure that our small  businesses can compete.   Now that some of our companies are back online and we are seeing our  auto manufacturing go back--I was just at a great company, Clips &  Clamps, a tool and die company. They bought a brand-new stamping  machine, just gleaming, absolutely beautiful. They turned on the  stamper; I cheered. Just amazing, the humming of making things in this  country.   You have to understand the supply chain. You have to understand the  complexity that goes into the payment cycles and the receivables and  the need for fair and proper assurance.   We only have to bat our eyes a couple of times and then we remember  what we were looking at when we had the largest drop in automotive  sales in recent history. In 2008, credit dried up, and our suppliers  were left wondering, ``Am I going to get paid? Am I going to continue  to be able to do the on-time delivery?'' We have to do that today,  right?   Liquidity in the supply chain is a real thing, and boy, is it complex  to talk about. It certainly doesn't fit into a nice hashtag or a 140- character sound bite.   We wrote the Secretary of the Treasury about this, Senator Gary  Peters and I, along with the Michigan delegation.   This is a great coming together of our government if we can get this  done and make sure that our suppliers can continue to supply the  original equipment manufacturers. That is all they are asking for. That  is all we are looking for in that.   I believe, with the right wherewithal in the Treasury, you can bring  the banks together, you can listen to the workforce, you can make sure  people still have jobs and that we continue to make things and compete  as effectively as possible.   OPS Solutions is located in Wixom. I invite everyone to come over to  Wixom, Michigan, home of the shuttered Ford Lincoln plant from 2007, a  rebuilt area.   There were people who were singing the swan song of my region not too  long ago. We know what they were saying. We stood up and said something  different.   OPS Solutions is run by Paul Ryznar and his incredible team of people  doing light-guided parts assembly. You can do it from home. You can do  it with a  [[Page H3048]]  disability. It is something for all workers.   We talk about education and the need for equal funding in education.  We talk about educating students of all abilities and jobs for people  with all abilities. OPS Solutions was formed in the downturn in  Ryznar's basement, a furloughed auto engineer creating this incredible  new enterprise.   OPS Solutions just today joined the World Economic Forum, one of 50  companies in the advanced manufacturing and technology space.   The quiet humming that comes out of Michigan's 11th District is the  determination for where the world is going to go with how we make  things, how we sell things, and how we operate in a digital economy.   When we think about the plight of these last 20 years--I was talking  to another small business owner in my district in the retail sector.  ``Oh, boy,'' he was saying, ``these last 20 years have really been a  whopper. We had  9/11. We had a recession. Now, we have a global pandemic. And every  day, I am going into work, and I am working to sell, and I am working  to connect with customers. And now, it is really different, connecting  with customers.''   You look at us as a Nation, and so many of these students today,  these young adults, were just being born when our Twin Towers fell down  and when our Pentagon was attacked.   I was a young freshman myself at American University, dropped off for  school, a kid from the Midwest who got a chance to study political  science at an incredible school just a few miles from the Pentagon. My  mom and my brother dropped me off, and they left.   I had been talking to my mom about my new Government 101 political  science course. I said, ``Mom, I am so excited. This is such an amazing  class. It is four credits, and that extra credit is experiential  learning, and we get to go to the Pentagon.'' That was the last  conversation I had with my mom before 9/11/2001.   She was calling my dorm room. She was calling my dorm room, and she  was trying to get in touch with me. Everyone was trying to get in touch  with their loved ones, before the smartphone. She couldn't get through.   I signed on to AOL Instant Messenger: ``Hey, mom.''   What happened next, as a Nation? It is a long story, but  economically, we were the ones who proliferated the internet in  Industry 4.0, as some people like to describe it, the industrial  Internet of Things, making faster, better, closer together, re- localizing manufacturing, re-shoring the production of things.   I believe that device, those flat-screen devices, came from the great  innovation of America.   That is what we celebrate. That is what we work toward. That is the  tapestry that we are working to put together in this Chamber.   Come visit us at the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee  under Eddie Bernice Johnson's fabulous leadership, Chair Eddie Bernice  Johnson, an incredible leader.    Shortly before this pandemic was declared, we passed a bipartisan  energy and R&D package through the committee.  Jim Baird and I, my  ranking member, as I have the privilege of serving as the chair for the  Research and Technology Subcommittee, passed the Building Blocks of  STEM Act, investing in our next generation through the National Science  Foundation.   We can do these things with a return on the taxpayer dollar, by the  way. We can have the conversation about effective and efficient  spending. Just as this institution made money from the auto rescue, the  taxpayer made money.   I am optimistic about what is ahead. I am committed to what is ahead  because of the stories and the people whom I have the privilege of  working alongside in Michigan's 11th District.   I thank you, Madam Speaker, for your time and your diligence this  evening, and all the people who continue to make our House of  Representatives hum.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
