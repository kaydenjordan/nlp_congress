 Madam President, I thank the chairman.   I wanted to speak for a minute to thank Senator Blunt for his work on  the bill. This is a bill that fundamentally changes the way sexual  harassment cases are handled in the Senate and in the House. The  process we have will now protect victims of harassment instead of  protecting politicians.   This was the work of many people. I thank Leader McConnell and  Senator Schumer, as well as the House leaders. I thank Senators  Gillibrand, Murray, Cortez Masto, Capito, and Fischer from the  Committee on Rules. And there are so many staff members I will thank  later when we do additional speeches.   This was something we had to get done by the end of the year. Getting  rid of that cooling-off period, getting rid of a lot of the Byzantine  way these cases were being handled--this is going to be better for  victims. I am proud the Senate has come together on a bipartisan basis  to get this bill done.    Mr. President, I rise today in support of the pending  resolution to end U.S support for the Saudi-led coalition's military  action in Yemen and to reiterate my previous calls for our country to  respond more clearly, more forcefully, and with moral purpose to the  murder of Jamal Khashoggi by holding the Saudi Government accountable  at the highest levels.                     Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act    Mr. President, before my remarks on this resolution, I want to speak  about another important matter before the Senate, and that is the Blue  Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, which I urge my colleagues to take up  and pass in this Congress. I thank Senator Gillibrand and a number of  other leaders for their work on this bill. I have cosponsored it, along  with more than 50 of my Senate colleagues.   This important legislation would ensure that thousands of Navy  veterans exposed to Agent Orange during the Vietnam war, and their  families, are able to receive the benefits they have earned.   When our soldiers signed up to serve, we made a promise to provide  them  [[Page S7554]]  with the healthcare and benefits they deserve when they return home.  The men and women who have served our country on the frontlines should  not return home to find themselves left waiting at the end of the line  and left waiting to get the healthcare they need or the benefits they  have earned.   This bipartisan legislation has already passed the House of  Representatives. It is time for us in the Senate to do the same and  maintain our commitment to our veterans.   I do want to thank the Presiding Officer for the work we are doing  together in a somewhat related area, and that is the area of burn  pits--a modern-day version of what many of our soldiers experienced  during the Vietnam war with Agent Orange. We have something going on  right now where our soldiers who were stationed next to these major,  expansive burn pits have come home sick. It is the same principle as  Agent Orange.   I thank the Presiding Officer for his support for the bipartisan bill  we are leading given that we have many good veterans from both Alaska  and Minnesota who have come home with health problems.                                 S.J. Res. 54    Mr. President, turning to the pending matter, I would like to join  those of my colleagues who have spoken in support of this bipartisan  resolution. I have come to the floor before on this issue because it is  so important.   It is time for Congress to speak with a clear voice in opposition to  U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition's operations in Yemen. We must  make clear that we will not turn a blind eye to civilian casualties, as  well as the ongoing humanitarian crisis that continues to devastate the  country of Yemen and its people.   With this resolution, we can end U.S. support for the Saudi-led  military action in Yemen. This is an important step. It demonstrates  that Congress will perform its constitutional duty in authorizing  military action and demanding that our policies and actions are  consistent with our values.   In light of the bipartisan support for this resolution, which, of  course, includes Senator Sanders and Senator Lee--I would also mention  that former Senator Franken from Minnesota had been involved in this as  a leader when he served in the Senate--the administration should more  forcefully advocate for a meaningful political process to end the  fighting.   Following the war in Yemen and the horrific murder of Mr. Jamal  Khashoggi, I am concerned that this administration lacks a  comprehensive strategy for dealing with Saudi Arabia.   I have also been deeply concerned that the President continues to  ignore human rights violations, the suppression of dissent, and the  deaths of thousands of civilians in Yemen in order to maintain good  relations with the Saudis. Yes, we have an important alliance with  Saudi Arabia and an important trade relationship, but that doesn't mean  that you don't stand up when you see the kind of horror we have seen in  Yemen and when you see the kinds of human rights violations we have  seen in the death of Mr. Khashoggi.   Look no further than how the President has repeatedly dismissed his  own intelligence community's assessment of the murder. This is after  reports have made clear that the CIA believes with high confidence that  this murder was called for at the highest levels of the Saudi  Government, by the Crown Prince. His response stands in stark contrast  to the founding principles of our democracy. If the President refuses  to defend these values, then Congress must.   This is not who we are as a country. So I call on my colleagues to  join me--and I am so glad we have bipartisan support for this  resolution--in defending our values. But this is not all we should do.  I support the comprehensive, bipartisan legislation introduced to  ensure effective oversight of the U.S. policy on Yemen and demand  meaningful accountability from the Saudi Government. This legislation  includes provisions to suspend weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and impose  mandatory sanctions on people involved in the death of Mr. Khashoggi.   While I support the recent decision to support U.S. aerial  refueling--a decision of the administration--for Saudi coalition  aircraft, as well as the sanctions that the administration imposed on  17 Saudi officials, this falls far short of the forceful response that  our democratic values require.   In addition, I have previously voted to limit arms sales to Saudi  Arabia, and I will continue to oppose the sale of certain weapons-- particularly offensive weapons--to the Kingdom.   These are steps that we can and should take. While there is no  question that we have common interests with Saudi Arabia and that Saudi  Arabia has been our partner, these facts do not require our country to  completely sacrifice our values.   The civil war in Yemen has now raged on for almost 4 years, resulting  in widespread destruction in the country and one of the worst  humanitarian crises in the world. More than 22 million people--half of  them children--are in need of assistance, and 8 million people in the  country are on the brink of starvation. The country's sanitation  system, electrical system, and other critical infrastructure have been  destroyed, leading to the most serious cholera outbreak in half a  century. The ongoing violence has hindered the delivery of lifesaving  humanitarian aid, including food and medicine.   Finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict is both a humanitarian  imperative and critical to stability on the Arabian Peninsula.   The United States has a long history of being a global leader in  providing humanitarian aid, and we cannot just stand by and put our  heads in the sand as this crisis continues. Our response to the  fighting and the humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen must demonstrate  that U.S. foreign policy and global leadership will always be rooted in  our values. It must show that we will not overlook violations of human  rights, whether by Saudi Arabia or by Houthi rebels in Yemen.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this very important  resolution and to really show the administration, to show the country,  and to show the world that this Congress is actually fulfilling its  obligations and constitutional duties. This is a very important moment  for the U.S. Senate.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I first wanted to thank Senator Roberts  and Senator Stabenow for their fine leadership on this farm bill, as  well as their staffs. I had a great opportunity to thank them.   This was something that was universally well accepted and exciting  for our State and, really, for every State in the country--the way we  got 87 votes. As I noted, at home, we don't get that many votes for a  volleyball resolution. It really put the bill in a good place to get  this done. I thank them for their leadership.   I also want to thank Brian Werner from my own staff, who has long  worked on these issues, as well as at home, Andy Martin and Chuck  Ackman, who have done ag work for us in Minnesota. I thank them for  their work on this bill as well.                         Tribute to Claire McCaskill    Mr. President, I am here to make some brief remarks about two of my  favorite colleagues who are leaving us. They are both good friends of  mine, both from the middle of the country, and both extraordinary  leaders.   I will start with my friend, Senator Claire McCaskill. Senator  McCaskill and I were first elected at the same time, so we came in  together.   During our years of serving together, I have seen this strong,  incredible woman stand up for the people of Missouri and stand up for  the people of this country.   We were the only two women in our Senate class when we came in. One  of my first memories of Claire, which occurred near the beginning of  our time in the Senate, was that we were driving out of the Capitol  together to go speak  [[Page S7570]]  at an event. I looked out the window, and there was my husband John  walking across the lawn with a pink box. She sees him, and she looks at  me, and she says: What is John doing, walking across the Capitol lawn  with a pink gift-wrapped box?   I yelled out the car window, and I said: What are you doing with the  pink box?   He yelled back: It is the Senate spouse club event. I am going to Jim  Webb's wife's baby shower.   Claire looked at my husband and said, in her typical, blunt way: That  is the sexiest thing I have ever seen.   That is Claire.   We were rejoicing together in the car at that moment, as we thought  we were witnessing a milestone in Senate spouse history but also in our  own histories and in the journey of having more women in the Senate.   Claire is someone who never keeps quiet, who always speaks her mind,  and that is so refreshing.   When she found out about the substandard care for our veterans at  Walter Reed, she took it on. She was a freshman Senator, but she wasn't  quiet, and she took it on.   Her dad was a veteran, and she felt that the veterans of today  deserve the same quality care that he got. That is the kind of  leadership she has always shown.   She never backs down, especially in the face of corruption. I think a  lot of that was because of her work as a prosecutor. We shared that in  common.   If there were rights that needed to be respected--great. If there  were wrongs that needed to be righted, she was right there. She is  never afraid to speak truth to power.   By the way, in her own words, she is now unleashed, and I know that  will continue in a big way.   Whether she is at a hearing or writing one of her famous tweets, she  does it in a voice that is 100 percent authentic and 100 percent Claire  McCaskill.   I will never forget when she was grilling Wall Street executives at a  Senate hearing for their role in the financial crisis, and she said:  ``You guys have less oversight than a pit boss in Las Vegas.'' That is  one example.   As Missouri's former State auditor and as someone who worked her way  through school as a waitress, Senator McCaskill has always rightfully  demanded accountability for those in positions of power.   We saw it again when she stood up to opioid manufacturers and  distributors, investigating suspicious shipments of these dangerous  drugs in communities across the country.   We saw it with her leadership in the fight against sex assault and  online sex trafficking, where she worked to take on backpage.   We saw it in her fight to strengthen the role of independent  watchdogs at our Federal Agencies and to expand protections for  whistleblowers.   We saw it every time she stood up for American consumers,  highlighting the challenges that consumers often face when they get  errors on their credit reports or when they have fraudulent robocalls.   I would always think of how she would challenge the commonsense  wisdom of her beloved mom, Betty, who is no longer with us. I had the  honor to meet Betty. So whenever I would watch Claire take on these  crimes--especially crimes against seniors--and speak out about them, I  would always think of her mom and how her mom was such an early,  powerful feminist and a woman who stood up and spoke truth to power.   Perhaps most of all, as I mentioned earlier, we saw it her work with  Walter Reed on behalf of our Nation's veterans. In addition to the work  she did in calling out what was happening at Walter Reed, it was Claire  who found out that contracting failures had led to thousands of graves  at Arlington National Cemetery being unmarked or improperly marked.   It was Claire whose legislation overhauled the IT systems at  Arlington and ultimately held the Secretary of the Army accountable.   That was trademark Claire: seeing an injustice, uncovering it,  speaking out, and then never giving up until it is fixed. That is what  she has done time and again.   What is cool about Claire, despite what I wish had not happened--that  she didn't win her election--is, she is the most resilient person I  know, and she will continue to serve and continue to do that work in  her way.   After a former political opponent once accused her of being  unladylike, she once told an Iowa audience that the traits needed to  excel in leadership--to speak out, be strong, take charge, change the  world--are traits she sees as very, very ladylike.   Claire has shown us how to be both strong and ladylike. It has been  my privilege to serve with her. I am so honored to call her friend, and  I am excited about what is to come for Claire McCaskill.                           Tribute to Joe Donnelly    Mr. President, I am going to talk about my friend, Senator Donnelly-- also someone who made extraordinary contributions to his State, the  State of Indiana, as well as to our country.   Indiana holds a special place in my heart. My husband, John, was born  there. His parents met in a ballroom dance class at Ball State, of all  places.   Our States share a lot of confusion because people always seem to not  be able to tell the difference between Indianapolis and Minneapolis.  There is a difference. We share some thriving metropolitan areas and a  lot of tech jobs, things like that, in our two major metropolitan  areas, but we also share rural areas.   Whenever I visited Indiana--and you know how much Indiana loves  cars--well, Joe Donnelly loves driving. I have been with him in South  Bend, where he went to school at Notre Dame, close to where he lives in  Granger. Actually, I will never forget one time when I was in  Indianapolis for something, and Joe drove all the way just to accompany  me on this trip. He was by himself, drove down there, and drove me  around to these campaign events. He always had his lunch bag with him  just in case he needed some lunch--a paper bag--but then he decided he  would treat me to his favorite lunch stop, Panera Bread.   He also believes in a simple idea about public service; that is, you  don't just go where it is comfortable, you go where it is  uncomfortable. Joe Donnelly exhibits that kind of leadership by taking  on the tough issues every time he can. For Joe, that has meant going to  factories that have been shut down to meet with the employees or  standing with former Indianapolis United Steelworkers leader Chuck  Jones, who took on the President over jobs at an Indiana plant that  were being sent to Mexico.   Later, at his retirement party, Chuck Jones said of Joe Donnelly's  efforts on behalf of the workers: He got it done and he didn't get the  fanfare, but people benefited all the same.   That is what is so special, so powerful about Joe Donnelly's  leadership. He doesn't always get all the attention he deserves, but he  has this incredible, understated strength and conviction. He has this  great sense of humor that I wish everyone could see.   Mostly, he has been a champion for the people of his State, whether  it was farmers when he served on the Agriculture Committee--he recently  worked with Senator Stabenow and others to get that farm bill done-- whether it is the work he has done in the Armed Services Committee on  behalf of our military, or whether it is working with our  servicemembers to make sure they get the mental health care they need  and deserve. Because of Joe's convictions, his very first bill as a  Senator was the Jacob Sexton Military Suicide Prevention Act, which  required annual mental health assessments for all servicemembers.  Because of his leadership, that legislation became the law of the land.  He also teamed up with Senator Young on a bill to improve mental health  services for the law enforcement officers who sacrifice so much to keep  our communities safe.   Joe has stood up in the fight against the opioid epidemic, passing  legislation to help ensure that nonaddictive medications are developed  and that substance abuse and treatment providers work in areas that  have high overdose rates, like our rural communities.   Joe stood up against high rates on student loans by helping our  students pay for school with our Empowering Student Borrowers Act.   Whenever you are lucky enough to work with Joe Donnelly, you see his  heart, his effectiveness, that twinkle in his eye, and you also see his  caring work that he does every single day.  [[Page S7571]]    One of my funniest moments with Joe is I called him once when a  report came out that showed how much money people have when they are in  Congress, and they always have the richest Members at the top, and you  keep looking down to see where you end up. I called Joe Donnelly once  and said: Guess what. We are tied. We have the same amount of money.   Joe Donnelly, without missing a beat, said: I am sorry. I am sorry  for you.   In any case, that was him.   Earlier this year, Senator Donnelly was at a practice for the  Democrats on the congressional baseball team. He was chatting with  Congressman Steve Scalise, who had been a victim of that horrific  shooting at a practice the year before. When asked about the majority  whip's return to the field, Joe said: It is great to see him. You know,  in the end, we are all brothers and sisters.   It is very sad to be losing one of my favorite brothers here in the  Senate, but what I know is this: Joe Donnelly will never stop. He is  going to be doing great work. He will always do great work, and we look  forward to seeing him again.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
