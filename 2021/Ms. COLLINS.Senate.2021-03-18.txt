 Mr. President, I rise to introduce School Food  Modernization Act to assist our schools in updating outdated kitchen  equipment, allowing them to provide healthier meals to students. I also  thank my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Smith, for cosponsoring this  bill.   School meals play a vital role in the lives of so many of our  children. As one school nutrition director from Maine recently told me,  school meals are the ``foundation for student success.'' Nearly 100,000  schools participate in the National School Lunch program, serving 30  million children each day, helping to prevent hunger. Many children  consume up to half their daily caloric intake at school, and some get  their most nutritious meals of the day at school instead of at home.  Because school meals are a significant source of daily nutrition for so  many, we must consistently aim to improve the program to best serve  students.   The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of  school meals for many families. Across the country, schools and  nutrition programs were adapted to remote and hybrid learning models  during the pandemic. Nutrition programs in Maine and other states have  tirelessly continued to support the nutritional needs of students  despite school closures, with many schools offering as many as four or  five meal delivery options to ensure families can continue to access  food seven days a week. I met recently with school nutrition directors  from Maine who said lack of equipment, including access to cold  storage, has forced them to be even more creative in continuing to  serve children across Maine during COVID-19. Many schools are using  stoves from the 1960s and others lack adequate storage facilities to  store the large amount of food needed to provide multi-day bulk meal  bags for children and families who are learning remotely or attending  school only part-time.   The fact is schools built decades ago often lack the equipment and  infrastructure necessary to do more than reheat and serve one or two  meal options each day. Even before the pandemic, nearly 90 percent of  schools needed at least one piece of updated school kitchen equipment.  It is estimated that Maine schools alone would need $58.8 million for  equipment infrastructure upgrades needed to serve healthy meals to all  of our students. The Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, on which  I serve, has consistently recognized this need and appropriated $30  million for School Equipment Assistance Grants last year. The School  Food Modernization Act would codify and improve this successful grant  program to better meet the growing need nationwide.   The School Food Modernization Act seeks to help school food service  personnel offer a wide variety of nutritious and appealing meals to all  students. First, the bill would provide targeted grant assistance to  supply the seed funding needed to upgrade kitchen infrastructure or to  purchase high-quality equipment. Second, it would establish a loan  guarantee assistance program within USDA to help schools acquire new  equipment. Finally, to aid school food services personnel in running  successful, healthy programs, the legislation would authorize grants to  support training and technical assistance for food service personnel.   Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to continue supporting  school kitchen equipment needs as the Child Nutrition Reauthorization  process takes shape. If our children are going to be able to learn and  meet their full potential, they need their minds and bodies to be fully  nourished. This bill would help us achieve that goal.                            ____________________
