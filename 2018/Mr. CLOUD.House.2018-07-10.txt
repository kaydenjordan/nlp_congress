 Mr. Speaker, I do want to extend my sincerest appreciation  and gratitude for the generosity and professionalism that you have  shown to us as we have made this very quick transition. Thank you very  much.   All right, there we go. This is Ean over there, my 12-year-old Zoe,  and Kent. Kent's birthday is tomorrow. And my sister, Sara. I am also  happy to be joined by my wife, Rosel. I have learned to keep this  short.   You know, there are three words that set us apart from every other  nation: ``We, the people.'' It is those three words that set us apart  in history and the three words that allow someone like me and people  like us to serve in an elected body like this.   So to the people of District 27 in Texas who elected me to serve, I  take this responsibility seriously, and I ask for your continued  prayers in serving well.   And to the people of this body, I look forward to working with you as  we work toward this more perfect union and continue this experiment in  self-government that has been handed to us from our Founders, and I  pray that we have the courage and we have the strength to do what is  right and to serve the people of this Nation well.    God bless you so much. Thank you for being here.                            ____________________
