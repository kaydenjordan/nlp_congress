 Madam Speaker, from day one, House Democrats have  worked for the people and passed historic legislation to address the  challenges facing our country, and clearly, the American people  resoundingly supported our efforts.   Democrats passed the CHIPS and Science Act that makes significant  investments in American manufacturing, which is the backbone of our  economy and drives job creation.   Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act to lower costs at the  pharmacy counter, in the grocery aisles, and at the gas pump. This  landmark legislation also delivers the most significant action on  climate in history, while reducing the deficit.   Democrats passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to fix  our roads and public transit systems. This is one of the largest  Federal investments in our Nation's infrastructure and is laying the  foundation for strong economic growth by creating millions of good- paying jobs.   While congressional Republicans play politics at the expense of our  democracy, Democrats remain steadfast in putting people over politics,  and we will continue to deliver transformational investments for  America's working families.                            ____________________
