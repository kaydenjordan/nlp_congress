 Mr. Speaker, last week, President Trump came to  California to be briefed on the horrific fires now raging in that  State. Instead, he got a lecture from Governor Newsom and his staff on  climate change.   Well, if Gavin Newsom actually believes that if we all just ride our  bikes to work and set our thermostats to 80 degrees that these  wildfires will go away, then he is completely delusional.   Excess timber comes out of the forest in only two ways: It is either  carried out or it burns out. For most of the 20th century, we carried  it out. It is called logging.   Every year, the U.S. Forest Service foresters would mark off excess  timber, and then we auctioned it off to lumber companies that paid us  to remove it, funding both local communities and the forest service. We  auctioned grazing contracts on our grasslands. The result was healthy  forests, fewer fires, and a thriving economy.   But beginning in the 1970s, we began imposing environmental laws that  have made the management of our lands all but impossible. Draconian  restrictions on logging, grazing, prescriptive burning, and herbicide  use on public lands have made modern land management endlessly time  consuming and, ultimately, cost prohibitive. A single tree thinning  plan typically requires 4 years and more than 800 pages of analysis.  The costs of this process exceed the value of timber, turning land  maintenance from a revenue-generating activity to a revenue-consuming  one.   Since 1980, these laws have produced an 80 percent decline in timber  harvested off of the Federal forests and a concomitant increase in  acreage destroyed by fire. In California, the number of sawmills has  declined from 149 to just 27.   Now, these laws were passed with the promise they would improve the  forests. Well, after more than four decades, I think we are entitled to  ask: How are the forests doing?   An untended forest is just like an untended garden. It will grow and  grow until it chokes itself to death. In a morbidly overcrowded State,  stressed trees fall victim to disease, pestilence, drought, and,  ultimately, catastrophic wildfire. In many regions of the Sierra,  timber density is now four times greater than the land can support.   We have been trying for years to reform these laws, resume active  forest management, and restore our forests to health; yet the  environmental leftists have blocked us every year. Instead, politicians  use the excuse of climate change.   Really? These environmental laws generally apply only to public  lands. Today, you can easily tell the boundaries between private and  public lands solely on the condition of the forests. How clever of the  climate only to decimate the public lands.   The climate has changed much over the centuries, but the problem has  not. When Juan Cabrillo dropped anchor in Santa Monica Bay in October  of 1542, the height of the Santa Ana fire season, he named it the Bay  of Smoke. Before western civilization, paleontologists tell us that we  lost between 4 and 12 million acres a year to wildfire in California.   Modern forests and land management brought that destruction down to  just a quarter of a million acres during the 20th century. That annual  destruction is now back up to 3 million acres a year.   That is not a new normal; that is the old normal reasserting itself.  That is not climate change; that is how nature deals with overgrown  lands. And once destroyed, it can take centuries for our forests to  regrow.   We began active forest management to break that cycle. We decided we  wanted every generation to enjoy our forests. So we introduced  scientific forest management to do a little gardening and keep our  forests healthy by suppressing brush and harvesting excess timber so it  couldn't crowd itself to death. And it worked, until the environmental  laws abandoned science for ideology.  [[Page H4720]]    The planet has been warming and cooling for millennia. Warmer  temperatures make it all the more important to match tree density to  the ability of the land to support it. That means more logging, not  less.   California has taken draconian measures to reduce carbon dioxide  emissions, at a terrible cost for the quality of life of Californians.  We now suffer some of the highest costs for energy in the country; we  have destroyed our manufacturing base; and we can't guarantee enough  electricity to keep our refrigerators running. Yet a single  catastrophic fire makes a mockery of all of these laws and the  sacrifices they impose on our people.   Governor Newsom says he has no patience for such views. Well, that is  a tragedy for all Californians and for all of California's forests.                            ____________________
