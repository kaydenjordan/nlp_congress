 Still I rise, Mr. Speaker, because I love my  country and I love the people in this country. I love them because we  are all created from a common Creator. I love the people of this  country.   Not all of the people in the United States, those who are citizens,  live within the continental United States. A good many of them live in  Puerto Rico. I rise today to speak on behalf of the people of Puerto  Rico who are suffering because moneys that have been appropriated by  the Congress of the United States of America have not been given to the  people of Puerto Rico and have not been delivered to the people of  Puerto Rico.   I cannot understand how Congress can appropriate--bills signed, money  available--yet we cannot get it to the people who need it. I am told  that hospitals are closed. I am told that some people are sleeping in  the street. I am told that there is suffering. I haven't been there to  see it myself, but the reports are available for all of us.   There is suffering taking place in Puerto Rico, and we in this House  would allow what we have signed, sealed, not to be delivered?   What is wrong with us?   People are suffering. We can help. At some point we will have to pay  for this, and we are not going to have to pay for it by losing a  congressional office. That is easy. That is not the kind of punishment  we are going to get for the way we are treating people. There is going  to be a day of reckoning for all of this, knowing that people are  suffering and you withhold the money.   The chief executive officer of this country knows what is going on,  and we who are here in Congress are aware of what is being denied. All  it takes is for the chief executive officer to send it, and it will be  done. But it is not taking place.   So I appear today, and I rise because I love my country. I love the  people of Puerto Rico. They are Americans by the way, citizens by the  way. I love them and I refuse to allow this to happen on my watch  without my at least standing here and calling it to the attention of  the American public.   I have a duty, a responsibility, and an obligation to say something  about this type of behavior, especially when there are 435 of us who  could do something about it and have done something about it, but there  is one person who declines to allow justice to be done.   Mr. President, what is wrong with you?    Madam Speaker, and still I rise.   I rise because I love my country, and I rise today to talk about  impeachment and the trial thereof, the trial associated with  impeachment.   Madam Speaker, there is much to be said. However, I assure all that I  will not say it all.   I do want to call to the attention of those who are paying attention  that we are now about to embark upon a trial in the Senate.   Impeachment was a function of the House of Representatives pursuant  to Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, and the trial is a  function of the Senate pursuant to Article I, Section 3 of the  Constitution. The trial is to take place in the Senate. The House has  done its job.   The House acts similar, not the same, but it behaves in a fashion  similar to that of a grand jury--similar but not the same. The House  determines whether there is enough evidence for a trial to take place,  simply put--similar but not the same as a grand jury.   Then it becomes a function of the Senate to have a trial. The Senate  is the only place on planet Earth where a President can be tried.   The President will not be punished at this trial, assuming that the  President is found guilty. There is no punishment. The President can be  removed from office, but there won't be any punishment similar to what  we call punishment, as it were, with a court, for example, wherein you  might be fined or accorded some sort of incarceration. None of that has  to do with removal from office.   There was a big debate about this trial of the President. In  Federalist Paper No. 65, Alexander Hamilton speaks at great length  about the trial of the President.   It was contemplated in making a final decision that perhaps the  Supreme Court would be the place to try the President. With much  debate, without going into the nuances, the details, this was not  concluded to be the appropriate place for a trial of the President.   It was finally concluded that the trial would take place in the  Senate but that, in doing this, there would be a presiding officer, and  this person would be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The Senate  tries the case with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presiding.   In Federalist Paper No. 65, there was much talk about this trial and  how it might move forward. Clearly, the Framers of the Constitution  contemplated that the trial would receive evidence, that there would be  evidence received. Clearly, a fair reading of Federalist Paper No. 65  would cause one to conclude that.   Of course, the Federalist Papers, as it were, there was a conclusion  drawn that in this trial, there would be evidence presented. The  evidence would be presented, of course, by the House. We call the  persons presenting the evidence managers. They will act as lawyers. The  Senate will receive this evidence.   It was anticipated, in my opinion, after perusing Federalist Paper  No. 65, that the trial could consist of evidence beyond what the House  might present because at a trial, it is expected that one might call  witnesses and present documents, present additional evidence.   It is my opinion that this is especially true, and I believe a good  many constitutional scholars agree with me, this is especially true if  it is known that there are witnesses who have evidence that would be of  great value, witnesses who have evidence, material evidence that is  relevant, would be of great value in coming to a just conclusion, a  trial that would have a just conclusion, a trial that would afford not  only the accused to have witnesses to testify but also the managers to  have witnesses to testify.   You see, the country, the United States of America, is entitled to a  fair trial. The President should have a fair trial, but the people  should have a fair trial.   If the trial is to be fair in the Senate and there are witnesses  available, then those witnesses ought to be called. If the witnesses  are not called, and it is known that there are witnesses, then the  question becomes: What are we doing? What is the Senate doing? I say  ``we''; I mean as a country. I am not a Senator, obviously.   What is the Senate doing? If there are witnesses who are available  and are willing to testify, and the Senate decides to simply dismiss  the case, what is the Senate doing?   Before I answer that question, let me just share this with you. The  truth be told, not only will the President be on trial but also the  Senate would be on trial. I will answer what the Senate is doing, but I  must say first that the Senate is on trial.   People are watching not only here in the United States of America but  across the globe. The world wants to see the kind of justice that the  United States of America accords. The world wants to know whether the  United States of America will pursue justice such that witnesses who  are material and relevant will have the opportunity to testify.                                time  1500    What is the Senate doing if the Senate declines to hear from these  relevant witnesses? The Senate is having something less than a trial.  No question, because a trial contemplates witnesses and evidence.   If the Senate is going to have what may amount to a briefing, then  there is no need to have Chief Justice Roberts. The Framers constituted  a trial. They contemplated a trial with the Chief Justice of the  Supreme Court presiding.   If we are going to have only a briefing, why have the Chief Justice  of the Supreme Court present? This would be tantamount to a briefing,  to simply call the Senate to order, receive some comments, some  statements, and perhaps whatever the House has sent over. But knowing  that a witness is available--multiple witnesses, I might add--and not  call any of the multiple witnesses would be tantamount to a briefing.   If the Senate but engages in a briefing, what would we call the  results of a briefing? In my opinion, justice delayed, if not denied-- justice delayed, if not denied.   The Framers of the Constitution contemplated a trial. Federalist  Paper No. 65 contemplates a trial.   The Senate acts as the triers of fact. They conclude with their  findings with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presiding.   One can easily conclude that the simple dismissal of a case, wherein  others are available to give testimony, would cause something less than  a trial and, quite frankly, will be an embarrassment to the Senate, to  the country, and to our sense of justice. It would be an embarrassment  to do such a thing.   As I have read in various publications, this is being contemplated,  to simply dismiss the case knowing that there are additional witnesses  to be heard.   Could it be that in so doing, whether by accident or with intent,  whether by accident or design, if this occurs, could it be that we are  now seeing a coverup, a coverup if you know that there are witnesses  who are available and who would testify but you denied them the  opportunity to testify by simply dismissing the case? Are you  participating in a coverup?   I pray that there are enough Senators who will say: ``I will not  participate in what appears to be a coverup,'' and will ask for  witnesses to testify. If a majority of the Senators should so ask,  there will be testimony presented.   We live in a world where it is not enough for things to be right.  They must also look right. It would not and will not look right if the  Senate knows that there are witnesses available and declines to call  them. It won't look right.   Some would say it is right because the Constitution doesn't have  strict guidelines, in terms of how the Senate is to perform. But I  assure you, the Framers contemplated a trial.   If there is no trial, a simple dismissal, there are many people who  will say that the Senate has engaged in a coverup because evidence that  should be revealed has been concealed, has been covered, has been  pushed aside.   The Senate, in my opinion, will do our country a disservice if it  simply dismisses this cause.   It is my belief that the Senate will not dismiss the cause summarily.  It is my belief that the Senate consists of honorable people who are  going to take  [[Page H231]]  an oath, and they are going to abide by the oath that they will take.   I was a judge of a small claims justice court. I will tell you that I  marveled at how people, after taking the oath as jurors, would rise  above the many things that would ordinarily influence them and see to  it that justice was done. It is a wonderful thing to see how people  take an oath and take that oath seriously.   I believe that a majority of the Senators will take the oath  seriously, and I believe that there will be witnesses, or at least one,  called to testify.   I believe that this will happen because I think that the Senators who  will do this will understand that justice is in their hands and that  this justice has much to do with what the witness will say, but it also  has much to do with the balance of power that they are there to  protect.   The Senators are there to protect the balance of power as it relates  to the cause that has been presented to them. The Senators will have to  decide whether or not the House of Representatives is going to become  less than a coequal branch of government because one of the articles  deals with the fact that the President has blocked the appearance of  witnesses in the House and has blocked the presentation of certain  evidence, documents, if you will, in the House.   Now it is left up to the Senate to determine whether or not they are  going to allow a President to block the presentation of evidence and  walk away without some consequence.   Blocking evidence without consequence, that is going to be one of the  considerations before the Senate. Will you protect the balance of  power? Will you assure this country that no one is above the law?   Madam Speaker, I assure you that if the Senators do not take this  cause seriously and simply dismiss it out of hand, they are simply  saying that the President is above the law.   The President deserves a trial. The country deserves a trial. We  ought to have witnesses presented.   There ought to be some degree of deliberation. The Senate acts as the  trial jury, the petit jury, if you will, similar to a petit jury, a  trial jury, but not the same. It is not the same because they can make  decisions about whether evidence will be presented.   I had a constituent ask me whether or not the Chief Justice could  decide to receive the evidence, and I had to tell the truth. The  response is that the ultimate judge of whether evidence will be  received will be 51 Senators. The Chief Justice can make rulings, but  the Senators can overrule the Chief Justice with a vote.   The world is watching, and the House of Representatives hangs in the  balance, as it relates to the balance of power.   If this Senate simply dismisses out of hand, we will have a President  with no guardrails. There will be no guardrails. It doesn't matter how  you feel about the President. The question is: How do you feel about  the country that we love? How do you feel about the notion that no one  is above the law, a very bedrock principle in this country? How do you  feel about this?   What happens once can happen twice, and what happens twice can happen  multiple times.   We should not allow this to take place. My clarion call to my  brethren, my friends, the ladies and gentlepersons of the Senate, is:  Do more than have a briefing. Do more than simply dismiss the cause out  of hand.   There will have to be 51 who will conclude that there will be more  than a briefing, that there will be a trial.   I assure you that there are many of us who are waiting to see what  will happen. Some of us will traverse great distances across the  country to be in Washington, D.C., to make it clear that they want to  be a part of this history for various and sundry reasons.   The world is watching. We have a duty, a responsibility, and an  obligation to the country to have a fair trial, a trial where witnesses  are called and witnesses are examined.   This is not unusual. This is what every person in this country  anticipates if he or she is charged with an offense. Why would we have  the President be above this basic premise of calling witnesses to have  a fair trial? Why would we have one person in the country who is above  this, above the law? Every person is subjected to the law in this  country.   Madam Speaker, I will close with these words: It is not enough for  things to be right. They must also look right.   If the Senate does this simply because it has the power, meaning if  the Senate simply dismisses because it has the power and doesn't call  witnesses, that won't look right, and in my opinion, it won't be right.   The Senate has a responsibility to have a trial, and witnesses must  be called. I do believe that witnesses will be called.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
