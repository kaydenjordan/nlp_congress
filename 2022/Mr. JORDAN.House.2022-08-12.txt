 Madam Speaker, who are they going to harass? Who are  these thousands of IRS bureaucrats, leftwing bureaucrats, Lois Lerners  at the IRS, who are they going to harass? Middle-class families.   We know who it is going to be. It is that assistant football coach at  the local high school who teaches history and who has this side  business. He mows lawns in the summer. He paints houses in the summer.  He pays his taxes, but he is going to get harassed.   We know how this works. We have seen it before.   This bill raises taxes. It creates a whole new bureaucracy to go  after taxpayers. Such a deal, using your tax money to come after you,  the taxpayer. Such a deal for the taxpayer.   My guess is they will all be working remotely. They won't have to pay  the $5 to drive to work like people in our districts do. They will be  working remotely, drinking their fancy coffee, going after the guy who  is helping kids and has this side business in the summer. That is who  this is going to come after, and we all know it. Everyone knows it. The  country knows it.   This is disgusting. I hope y'all vote ``no.''
