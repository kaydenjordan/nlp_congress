 Mr. Speaker, my wife, Cheryl, and I were married 14 years  ago when one of the first States in our country allowed us to do so. It  took years and a Supreme Court ruling to acknowledge and grant the  legal protections that come with marriage across this great land. In  the ensuing years, we raised our four sons, and we expanded our family  of six to nine, adding two daughters-in-law and a grandson to that mix.   I am standing here today because in the year 2022, families like mine  are, once again, concerned that an activist, out-of-step Supreme Court  is going to take those rights away. Just so we are clear, that Supreme  Court and the Members in opposition of this legislation today are out  of step with the American people.   Today, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Respect for  Marriage Act, a bill that takes the longstanding and overdue step of  repealing DOMA and ensures that same-sex and interracial marriage is  recognized in every State, no matter who is sitting on the Supreme  Court.   We have made progress. Mr. Speaker, let's not go back.
