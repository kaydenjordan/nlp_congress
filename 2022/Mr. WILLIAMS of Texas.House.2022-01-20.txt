 Mr. Speaker, this week marks 1 year of  President Biden's out-of-touch, reckless, and disastrous Presidency.   The past 12 months have been filled with failure after failure, and  Americans are dealing with the consequences at every corner.   From skyrocketing inflation, increased crime rates, a disastrous  Afghanistan exit, an open border agenda, concerned parents labeled as  domestic terrorists, and more, this administration has failed the  American people.   Amidst all the crises, President Biden has spent a quarter of his  first year in his Delaware basement, avoiding all responsibilities.  This is unacceptable from anyone.   I came to Congress to serve the people of Texas' 25th Congressional  District, and when I am back home, I hear firsthand how Texans are  worse off under President Biden than ever before.   The bottom line is, a year of the Biden administration's socialist  and far-left agenda has dragged our country backward, not forward.   It is time America has leaders that put America first. President Joe  Biden is not that leader. He has 33 percent approval.   In God we trust.
