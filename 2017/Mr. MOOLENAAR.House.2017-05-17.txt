 Mr. Speaker, I also thank Chairman Royce and Ranking  Member Engel for supporting this bipartisan resolution and moving it  through the Foreign Affairs Committee.   I especially want to thank Congresswoman Torres for her leadership as  a true champion on this issue and helping us all understand the  importance of this.   This resolution makes it clear that the United States strongly  supports the anticorruption efforts in the Northern Triangle of Central  America. Already, officials across the region are making headway. The  attorney general of Guatemala, in particular, has made progress in  taking on corruption at the highest levels of government.    This resolution will reinforce support for these efforts in the  region and will send a clear message to the millions of people who live  in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras that the United States wants  them to have a safe country, free of corrupt officials who steal from  them.   By supporting the efforts of our allies to fight corruption, it is my  hope that these governments will continue to promote respect for the  rule of law, thereby making it better for residents to live, work, and  raise a family in their homelands.
