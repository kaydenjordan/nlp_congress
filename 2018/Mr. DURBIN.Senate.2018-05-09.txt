I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Donnelly)  and the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Duckworth) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor today to discuss an  issue that impacts consumers, small businesses, our general economy,  and most families. It is the issue of net neutrality. The concept  behind this is pretty simple. It ensures that all content on the  internet is treated equally so that the internet can remain an openly  accessible platform for users and an equal playing field for everyone.   Unfortunately, some leaders at the Federal Communications Commission  disagreed. Despite being given the responsibility to make sure they  operate in the public interest when it comes to our Nation's  communications networks, in December, the FCC walked away from this  important responsibility and decided to put the needs of companies  ahead of customers.   It appears with this administration that everything is for sale. That  means public lands, our privacy, and, in this case, the pathway  American families use every single day to get on the internet. Led by  Chairman Pai, the FCC voted for a radical plan in December to dismantle  net neutrality rules and threaten the existence of a free and open  internet as we know it today. This new plan will allow large internet  providers the power to freely block, throttle, or manipulate consumers'  access to the internet in ways that profit the provider.   Think about your access to apps and the internet today, and compare  it to your access to cable channels. If you want more channels, you put  in more money. Today the internet is open to us, and we have access to  it. The Trump administration, through the Federal Communications  Commission, wants to change that. If you want fast internet service,  you pay more money. If you want access to certain apps, you pay more  money. That changes the nature of the internet as we have known it. It  is a dramatic change in the way we communicate and gather information.  It is just another bill.   Many people are now facing the prospect of cable TV shows and other  things they have to pay more money for on a pretty substantial monthly  bill. Now comes the FCC to say: We have another monthly bill for you if  you want the same access to the internet today that you had before. Not  only does this mean less choice and higher cost for consumers whose  access to content could be determined by what is in the best financial  interest of  [[Page S2569]]  their provider, but small businesses will no longer be able to compete  on a level playing field.   For many small businesses and entrepreneurs in my State of Illinois  and across the country, the internet has given them the ability to  reach consumers across the globe and compete against large companies.  The innovation and healthy competition that a free and open internet  allows are essential to continue pushing our economy forward. If the  FCC has its way, they are going to create internet fast lanes and slow  lanes, where winners and losers are no longer determined by how good a  business's product is but by whether a small business can afford to pay  in. That is wrong. It is not good for the economy, and it is not good  for our democracy.   I have heard from hundreds of thousands of Illinoisans who are  concerned, and there is concern all across the country, across party  lines. We filed a discharge petition today to take up this issue of net  neutrality on the floor of the Senate.   We have considered a lot of rules and regulations from the Obama  administration. Now we are going to consider one from the Trump  administration. We are going to see if there is bipartisan support for  net neutrality.   Senator Collins, Republican of Maine, has joined us. Will there be  more? Are there a number of Republican Senators who want to stand up  for net neutrality and for open access for America to the internet or  do they want to sell off this opportunity to the highest bidders?   Keeping the internet a place where content is shared freely and  accessed equally by everyone is important to our small businesses,  educators, and consumers. We are pleading with America in the hours  before we take up this measure to log on and tell the Trump  administration to lay off. When it comes to net neutrality, it is too  important a value across America to sell at the FCC.   Madam President, before the Senate left for last week's recess, the  Republican leader, Senator McConnell, filed cloture on six circuit  court nominees.   I supported three of these nominees in the Judiciary Committee--Amy  St. Eve, Michael Scudder, and Joel Carson--and I opposed three of  them--Michael Brennan, Kurt Engelhardt, and John Nalbandian. I  carefully consider each nominee's qualifications and record when I cast  my votes.   I want to speak today, though, about the process that Senate  Republicans are using to move judicial nominations under President  Trump. I fear the Republican majority is diminishing the advice and  consent role of the Senate in an effort to rush through President  Trump's nominees. That troubles me. Just look at what Republicans are  doing to the blue slip when it comes to circuit court nominations.   For the last century, the blue-slip process has worked well. It has  encouraged negotiation and meaningful consultation between the White  House and Senate when it comes to making lifetime appointments to the  federal bench. The blue slip serves as a check and a balance, helping  to steer the judicial selection process toward the center stripe, and  it ensures Senators are meaningfully consulted on judicial nominations  in their State.   Many Senators have established expert screening commissions to help  evaluate and vet nominees in their States. When blue slips and  screening commissions are respected, it leads to consensus and high- quality nominees.   Look at the way the White House worked with Senator Duckworth and me  on filling the two current 7th Circuit vacancies from Illinois. We had  good-faith consultation and a substantive back-and-forth, and the White  House respected our Illinois tradition of having an expert screening  committee review and vet candidates.   This process resulted in a pair of excellent Illinois 7th Circuit  nominees--Amy St. Eve and Michael Scudder, whom all sides could agree  upon. That is the way it should work.   We know that blue slips and screening commissions can help build  consensus and lead to good outcomes. Yet this week the Senate is taking  major steps to abandon these processes.   Senator McConnell is calling a vote on the floor this week on 7th  Circuit Wisconsin nominee Michael Brennan. Mr. Brennan is a  controversial nominee with a history of troubling statements. In  particular, I am concerned by his 2001 National Review op-ed in which  he argued that judges need only follow ``correct precedent''--which  suggests judges can disregard precedent they don't agree with. I am  also concerned by his 2004 Marquette Law Review article on personal  responsibility, in which he was disdainful of criminal defendants who  said they had a difficult upbringing.   The Brennan nomination is controversial on substance, but even more  controversial is the way this nomination has been pushed forward. Both  Senator Baldwin and Wisconsin's bipartisan screening commission were  effectively cut out of the process of selecting this nominee.   Mr. Brennan failed to meet the threshold vote of the screening  commission that Wisconsin's senators had set up, but President Trump  nominated him anyway. Senator Baldwin has raised serious concerns about  Mr. Brennan and has not submitted a blue slip for his nomination, yet  Republicans are pressing ahead. This is taking us down a troubling  path.   I know that Senators in both parties like to quibble over precedents  and point fingers at each other when it comes to judicial nominations,  but I think all Senators understand that we have a fundamental  responsibility to our constituents when it comes to federal judges in  our home States. We must exercise a vigorous advice and consent role  for these judges who will sit in our States' courthouses.   It should concern all of us if any Senator is cut out of the judicial  selection process in that Senator's State. None of us want that to  happen to us.   If the Senate votes to confirm Mr. Brennan, we will be sending a  clear signal that home State senators don't matter anymore in the  judicial selection process. That is the wrong path to go down, but  Senate Republicans appear to be doubling down on this path.   Today, in the Judiciary Committee, Chairman Grassley called a hearing  on a 9th Circuit nominee from Oregon, Ryan Bounds. This nominee has not  received a blue slip from either home State senator, nor does he have  the approval of Oregon's judicial selection committee.   I hope my Republican colleagues stop and think about how they would  feel if this happened to them in their home States. I hope our example  in Illinois shows that there is a better way--a path of good faith  negotiations that can lead to compromise while respecting the Senate's  important traditions and home-State practices.   There are other troubling nomination trends besides the bypassing of  blue slips and home State screening commissions. Republicans also have  been moving very quickly to confirm President Trump's picks for Federal  judges. For example, last year the Senate confirmed 12 circuit court  judges, a record for a President's first year in office. President  Trump's first 15 circuit court nominees have been confirmed in an  average of 131 days, including just 20 days pending on the Senate  floor. This is a very fast pace. By comparison, President Obama's first  15 circuit court nominees took an average of 254 days to be confirmed,  including 167 days pending on the floor.   This fast pace carries risks. Senators who do not serve on the  Judiciary Committee need time to review the records of judicial  nominees before voting on whether to confirm them to lifetime positions  on the Federal bench.   This scrutiny is even more important in the Trump era, when nominees  are often not carefully vetted before they are nominated. Just look at  nominees like Brett Talley, who was rushed through the Judiciary  Committee and reported on a party line vote before many Senators  realized his utter lack of qualifications to be a Federal judge.   I understand the need to fill vacancies in the Federal Judiciary, but  we must not do so at the expense of careful vetting.   I also want to briefly respond to the argument that somehow Democrats  are being obstructionist when it comes to judicial nominees. It is  wildly hypocritical for Republicans to make this argument.   Remember, my Republican colleagues retired the trophy for judicial  obstruction during the Obama Administration: Republicans forced cloture  filings on 36 of President Obama's judicial nominees in his first 5  years-the  [[Page S2570]]  same number of judicial cloture filings as in the previous 40 years  combined; Republicans used the tactic of withholding blue slips to  block 18 of President Obama's nominees; Republicans refused to support  any Obama nominee for three D.C. Circuit vacancies, no matter how  qualified; Republicans allowed only 22 Obama nominees to be confirmed  in his last two years--the fewest judicial confirmations in a Congress  since President Truman; and Republicans blocked Supreme Court nominee  Merrick Garland from even having a hearing.   Senate Republicans often opposed President Obama's nominees simply  because it was President Obama who nominated them. In contrast, Senate  Democrats simply want to ensure that nominees are adequately vetted,  well-qualified, non-ideological, and in the judicial mainstream.   We have the ability to make the nominations process work in a  consensus way. We have done it in Illinois. I hope we can do it across  the country.   Let's start by keeping the blue slip. Sometimes it can be  frustrating-we saw that when Republicans used blue slips to block 18 of  President Obama's nominees. But it is a tool that compels us to find  consensus. Let's keep that tool.   I urge my Republican colleagues to vote no on the nomination of  Michael Brennan, both because of his troubling record and because of  what his confirmation would mean for the future of the blue slip. I  urge my colleagues to vote for nominees like Amy St. Eve and Michael  Scudder whose qualifications are outstanding, who were selected through  a good process, and who have both home State Senators' support.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to  discuss the Illinois Veteran's Home at Quincy, which houses nearly 400  residents, and has provided quality long-term care to veterans and  their spouses since its founding in 1886.   Sadly, for the past 3 years, IVH Quincy has struggled with recurring  Legionnaires' disease outbreaks. This tragic issue is nothing short of  a scandal.   Legionnaires' disease is a pneumonia-like illness caused by the  legionella bacteria and spread through water droplets in the air. At  IVH Quincy, residents are elderly and suffer from other medical  conditions, making them more likely to get Legionnaires' disease. IVH  Quincy has had outbreaks every year since 2015, most recently in  February. In total, more than 65 people have been sickened, and 13  people have tragically died.   After every outbreak, Senator Duckworth and I reached out to the  State asking Governor Rauner what he needed and offering help. We urged  his administration to request assistance from the CDC and the VA, and  we committed funds through annual appropriations to help State Veterans  Homes like IVH Quincy. We pressed the State to upgrade the plumbing  across the IVH Quincy campus and undertake renovations--particularly in  those buildings where the bacteria has been most prevalent. We reached  out to the CDC and VA ourselves, to help make sure that even though  this is a State facility--owned, operated, and managed by Illinois--we  were doing everything we could at the Federal level to help support  them.   Both agencies assured us they were available to help at any time and  have made that clear to State officials as well. In fact, the VA is due  to schedule a site visit to provide additional expert assistance any  day now.   I have visited IVH Quincy many times in my years representing  Illinois, most recently in January and then again on April 30. I had  the opportunity to meet with the veterans who reside in the facility,  as well as the staff that provide such exceptional care.   While I acknowledge that the legionella bacteria exists in the  environment, it was important that the State of Illinois do more to  help prevent any future outbreaks.   In 2016, the State finally invested $6.4 million in upgrades to  improve the home's water treatment and delivery infrastructure; 65  percent of these funds will soon be reimbursed by the VA.   Governor Rauner visited IVH Quincy on July 27, 2016, and claimed  mission accomplished, but clearly it was not enough.   There are also serious discrepancies about the State's handling of  these outbreaks. Some families have claimed they were told belatedly  about the outbreak or that their loved ones weren't diagnosed or given  antibiotics quickly enough to fend off the disease. There are concerns  that staff first heard of problems at IVH Quincy through the news or  even on Facebook. It is unclear when the Governor himself was notified  about the outbreaks or whether his administration requested Federal  assistance in a timely fashion. The Governor's office may have also sat  for years on formal engineering proposals to renovate older buildings  or construct new ones on campus. Now there are outrageous reports that  the Governor's staff tried to pin the blame for these outbreaks onto  Senator Tammy Duckworth. Can you believe it?   Now, 3 years after the first outbreak, the Governor has finally  released a detailed plan of action, and he has finally hired a  dedicated staffer to handle the Quincy project. I guess all Governor  Rauner needed was an election year to get into gear.   Now I am pleased that Illinois General Assembly officials have been  holding hearings in the general assembly on the Quincy Legionnaires'  outbreaks. They have committed to providing funds to help prevent these  outbreaks from recurring and called for an audit of the State's  handling of the outbreaks because, 3 years and 13 deaths later, we  still need accountability from this Governor.   At least now we have a plan of action from him, and Senator Duckworth  and I will continue to be here, ready to help, because it is about time  our veterans at IVH Quincy finally get the respect and care they  deserve.                            ____________________     Mr. President, a few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to  visit a mounting crisis in our immediate neighborhood, specifically in  Venezuela.   What I saw were in fact three overlapping crises: economic,  humanitarian, and political.   Hyperinflation, malnutrition, confounding refugee flows into  neighboring countries, political repression, and staggering  mismanagement and corruption are all endemic.   Some of you may have seen the front page of Tuesday's New York Times  with the heartbreaking photo of Venezuela's indigenous Warao people who  are suffering an AIDS epidemic because of the collapse of the country's  healthcare system, just one of many such tragedies unfolding in a  country without basic vaccinations or adequate food.   The situation and suffering are only getting worse as the government  continues to deny the obvious problems or simply blames them all on  other countries.   We have heard this canard before, most notably in Cuba where the  regime blames the mismanagement and repression under its corrupt  leadership on everyone but itself.   Also as in Cuba, the regime is cruelly detaining an innocent  American--in this case Josh Holt--who by all accounts is a political  hostage.   It didn't have to be this way.   Venezuela used to be a wealthy country with an imperfect but  functioning democracy. It also had deep and unaddressed chasms of  poverty, a gulf neglected by many ruling parties of the region that led  to their ouster at the ballot box, including in the case of Hugo  Chavez's initial victories.   But like so many autocrats at heart, Chavez used his position of  power to dismantle the country's democracy and democratic institutions.  He mismanaged the economy and allowed corruption at a scale that made a  mockery of what he initially campaigned against. His successor,  President Maduro, has doubled down on this approach. Political  opponents are jailed or run out of the country, political opposition  parties are arbitrarily banned or disqualified, and the reign of  corruption on the backs of the Venezuelan people has only expanded.   Tragically, Maduro had a choice to avoid what appears to be the  inevitable collapse of his once proud nation. He could have seized the  opportunities offered by the Vatican and other regional powers to  mediate a peaceful political path forward in Venezuela. He could have  taken obvious steps to restore confidence and abide by basic democratic  norms.   Sadly, his government repeatedly rejected such negotiations with the  opposition and is recklessly moving ahead with a snap and discredited  election on May 20; yet this election does not come close to meeting  international democratic standards and will likely only plunge the  country into further isolation and crisis.  [[Page S2591]]    When I met with Maduro and others in his regime in Caracas last  month, I pointed out that Republicans and Democrats don't agree on much  in Washington these days, but they do agree on Venezuela. The Trump  administration is correct this week in urging a suspension of this  election under such absurd conditions.   Let me give you just one example, that of leading opposition figure  and former mayor of a district of Caracas Leopoldo Lopez who remains  under house arrest and disqualified from competing in the upcoming  election. I was able to meet with his brave wife, Lilian Tintori, in  Venezuela--whose passport has been taken by the government--and speak  with him by phone. We were not allowed to visit him in person.   Why was Lopez jailed, kept in solitary confinement, and now put under  house arrest? Because, according to the government, he was using  subliminal messages to direct protesters to act unlawfully.   That is right. One of the country's leading opposition candidates is  in jail for sending ``subliminal messages.''   One of the prosecutors who led the case against Lopez later fled the  country and said the trial was a farce based on false evidence and that  Lopez is innocent. This tells you the nature of the outrageous  political disgrace at play in Venezuela.   Senator Menendez, I, and 10 other Democrats made the same point as  the Trump administration in a resolution introduced earlier this year,  specifically that the results of this rushed election will not be  considered legitimate if basic conditions are not met.   Let me repeat them here as they are so obvious: All political  prisoners and jailed candidates, including Leopoldo Lopez, should be  immediately released and free to participate in the election process;  all parties should be free to peacefully participate in the election;  the discredited election commission must be reformed into a credible  nonpartisan body to administer the election; there must be no linking  of government food to one's political participation or support of the  ruling party, a particularly cruel tactic when many are suffering from  severe malnutrition; local and international election monitors must be  allowed, accredited, and given genuine access in the pre and actual  election periods; and there must be at least 6 months to allow for a  legitimate campaign under these conditions.   I believe the Venezuelan Government provided me a visa to visit  because it was looking for a way out of its increasing and deserved  international isolation.   Well, the path forward is actually quite clear and entirely in the  Venezuelan Government's control, and it begins with running a clean and  fair election as just described. Quite simply, have the courage and  decency to allow the Venezuelan people the same fair and open process  afforded Hugo Chavez when he first won at the ballot box. Have the  courage to allow the world, including the American people, to help your  people who are suffering and fleeing in desperation.   In terms of the relationship with the United States, also let Josh  Holt and his Venezuelan wife come home. Don't continue down the path of  a hostage-taker.                            ____________________
