 Madam President, I am proud to recognize Mark  Hagopian of Auburn and Jay Anderson of Sandown as November's Granite  Staters of the Month. Mark and Jay partnered together to raise COVID-19  relief money for Granite Staters by designing and selling their own  special IPA, which they named ``Brain Fog.''   In March of 2020, Mark Hagopian was rushed to Elliot Hospital in  Manchester and was immediately admitted to the ICU to be treated for  COVID-19. After 3 weeks on a ventilator, Mark miraculously recovered  thanks to the hard work of the nurses and medical staff--or ``super  heroes,'' as he calls them.   After his recuperation, Mark wanted to help others, which led him to  partner with Elliot Hospital to set up the NH COVID-19 Family Relief  Fund. Proceeds go to Granite Staters who continue to feel the impacts  of the COVID-19 pandemic and can help these individuals with healthcare  copays, rehabilitation, groceries, and other costs.   When Mark asked his friend Jay Anderson, owner of From the Barrel  Brewing Company in Derry, about teaming up, Jay said it was a ``no- brainer.'' They got to work designing a special IPA with the proceeds  going to the NH COVID-19 Family Relief Fund. Since Mark had been a  regular customer, Jay knew exactly what type of beer Mark would like,  and together, they named the final product ``Brain Fog.''   At the launch event for ``Brain Fog,'' Granite Staters mingled and  heard from Mark and Jay about the NH COVID-19 Family Relief Fund. The  beer itself was wildly successful, as evidenced by the fact that Mark  and Jay sold out of all the cases of ``Brain Fog'' that first weekend.  The duo plans to revive the brew and continue fundraising for the  Elliot Hospital in the future.   Mark and Jay are shining examples of what it means to be Granite  Staters. After undergoing intense medical hardship, Mark turned around  and started giving back to his community, and Jay was more than ready  to help. Not only did they show impressive innovation and  entrepreneurship, but they also brought people together during an  especially hard time as our State and country continue to feel the  effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. I am honored to name them as Granite  Staters of the Month, and I look forward to seeing how their future  endeavors continue to make our communities stronger.                            ____________________
