 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of H.R. 2, an ultra-partisan  bill that puts urban centers above my rural communities.   I was frankly stunned at how few people showed up here in Washington,  D.C., for the markup of a $500 billion bill. My colleagues who were  physically able and did not show up gives new meaning to the phrase  ``phoning it in'' and now we can call it ``Zooming it in.'' They Zoomed  it in in T-shirts, shorts, on golf carts, and now we will continue to  Zoom it in for 45 more days.   Mr. Speaker, I authored 12 amendments at the markup of this bill.  While many of them were bipartisan, they were still rejected along  party lines.   My amendment to keep rail safety grants merit-based and open to all,  failed.   My amendment to improve government efficiency and bring internet  connection to rural communities, failed.   Mr. Speaker, commonsense bipartisan proposals fail because this is  not a serious effort.  [[Page H2927]]     Mr. Speaker, this is a Nancy Pelosi power grab again.   I remind my colleagues that there is no challenge too great when we  unite as Americans, yet here we are. House Democrats choose to bring  this bill which is nothing more than the latest progressive wish list  to the floor without any Republican input again.   I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2.
