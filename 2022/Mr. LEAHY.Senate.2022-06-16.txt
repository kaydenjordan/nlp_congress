 I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, the passage of the Sergeant First Class  Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act  of 2022, or PACT Act, is an example of what can happen when the  Congress puts aside partisanship and comes together for the good of the  country and, importantly, our veterans.   Each of us, in every State and in every congressional district across  the country, has a friend, a neighbor, or a constituent, a veteran, or  an Active-Duty servicemember, who has become sick or died from exposure  to toxics while serving in the military. And for too many of those  people, recognition of the connection between their illnesses and toxic  exposures came too late.   Early in my time in the Senate, I heard from Vietnam veterans who  were sickened by exposure to herbicides such as Agent Orange. Too many  of these veterans died before Congress pushed the Department of  Veterans Affairs to recognize and treat their illnesses or compensate  them for the disability caused by our own government's use of such a  toxic substance throughout Vietnam and in other parts of Southeast  Asia.   I hoped we would have learned from our mistakes there. I hoped we  would learn from the veterans and civilians who suffered from radiation  exposure when we tested the atomic bomb. I hoped we would learn from  the veterans who came home from the first Gulf War with unexplained  illnesses.   But just a few years ago, I watched my dear friend, BG Mike Heston,  ravaged by pancreatic cancer, fight for the VA and the Department of  Defense to acknowledge that his cancer was caused by exposure to the  burn pits that had been used during his tours in Afghanistan.   Mike served as a Vermont State trooper for 26 years and for 33 years  in the military, including in the Marine Corps Reserve and the Vermont  National Guard. He served his State and his country without question.  When he got sick, he should not have had to spend his precious  remaining time fighting for the government to acknowledge what caused  his illness.   But Mike did fight. Mike fought to ensure that his family, his two  wonderful children, Kelsey and Keegan, would be cared for if he  succumbed to his illness. He and his wife June also fought to make sure  that other veterans would not have to endure what they did, that they  might get an earlier diagnosis, that they might not have to spend any  of their precious moments fighting for the benefits they earned.   After Mike passed away in 2018, June continued and expanded the  fight. Joining her in Vermont were Staff Sergeant Wesley Black, who  died last year of colon cancer at the age of 36, leaving behind his  wife Laura and son Ronan; Pat Cram, widow of Sergeant Major Mike Cram,  who died of prostate cancer at the age of 47; and many others who  through their experience with friends or loved ones were determined to  make sure that things would be better for those who followed.   As we stand here today prepared to enact one of the most sweeping  packages of veterans benefits and healthcare measures in modern  history, I am thinking of Mike and June, of Kelsey and Keegan, of Mike  and Pat, and of Wesley and Laura and Ronan. And I know that each  Senator voting yes today is thinking of people in their States and  districts who are sick or who have died as a result of exposure to  toxics while serving our country.   Their stories are meaningful, and they, themselves, ensured that  their sacrifice is meaningful, too. And I hope that this time we will  learn from our experiences with toxic substances and hold the  Department of Defense to a higher standard in the future.                            ____________________     Madam President, first, let me say that I am glad to see  the successful discharge of Steven Dettelbach's nomination. I have  known him since he was a detailee for the Department of Justice to the  Judiciary Committee. I found him one of the hardest working, most  talented, honest, and evenhanded people I knew. I was happy to support  him for U.S. attorney in Ohio. I can understand why so many law  enforcement organizations backed him because of his values there. I  will have more to say when he is confirmed, but it is a good move.                         Nomination of Beth Robinson    Madam President, Vermonters are no strangers to making history, and  in November 2021, one Vermonter in particular made history again: the  U.S. Senate confirmed Beth Robinson to a seat on the Second Circuit  Court of Appeals. She assumed her seat on that bench days later. I  could not be more proud. Vermont has one seat on the Second Circuit  Court of Appeals, so we always try to send our best.   Judge Robinson embodies Vermont's values: her commitment to justice  and equality and her compassion for her fellow human beings. She has  also proven to be an exceptional jurist, one dedicated to the rule of  law above all else. There should be no doubt that she brings that same  excellence to Vermont's single seat on the Second Circuit, as a  successor to my dear friend, the late Judge Peter Hall.   Since Vermonters first elected me to the U.S. Senate, I have worked  hard to ensure that Vermont's best and brightest represent our State on  the Federal judiciary. In 2004, I recommended Judge Hall, then  Vermont's U.S. Attorney and a Republican, to serve on the Second  Circuit because he was the most qualified. During his 17-year tenure on  the panel, Judge Hall was a fine jurist. He was fair and kind to all  litigants before him, and was always humble. His passing, at just age  72, was a loss to not just Vermont, but also to the Federal judiciary  at large.   In 2009, I proudly recommended Christina Reiss to be a judge for the  District Court of Vermont. We have a very small district court with a  State of our size. With her confirmation, Judge Reiss became the first  woman to serve on the District Court of Vermont. And, like Judge Hall,  she has served as a model of fairness and impartiality on the bench  ever since.   Judge Robinson is a trailblazer herself. As a tireless champion for  LGBTQ rights, she successfully litigated the landmark Baker v. Vermont  decision, which led to Vermont becoming the first ever State to enact  civil unions in the United States. Beth's advocacy served as a  blueprint for the successful advancement of LGBTQ rights across the  country, securing her place as one of the first pioneers in the  national movement for LGBTQ rights.   Her smart and steady approach and her unimpeachable reputation won  her  [[Page S2996]]  allies across the political spectrum in Vermont. In 2011, she was  appointed by Governor Peter Shumlin to serve as a justice on the  Vermont Supreme Court--that is a five-member court--a position to which  she was confirmed unanimously by the Vermont Senate. She became the  first openly gay Vermont Supreme Court justice, breaking yet another  barrier. Now, today, Judge Robinson is the first openly gay female  judge to serve in our Federal circuit courts.   While on the Vermont Supreme Court, Judge Robinson seamlessly traded  her advocate's cap for that of an impartial jurist. She is a consensus  builder. Her unwavering commitment to the neutral application of the  law was second-to-none on the Vermont Supreme Court; it is a commitment  I know she brings with her to the Second Circuit.   When I recommended to President Biden that he nominate Beth Robinson  to the Second Circuit, there was such an outpouring of support from all  corners of Vermont. The membership of the Vermont Supreme Court-- justices appointed by both Democratic and Republican Governors--signed  a strong letter of support for her nomination. They were joined by  prominent Republicans and Democrats from all around the State,  underscoring just how widely respected she was for her reputation as an  impartial and independent jurist.   When Judge Robinson was confirmed in the Senate with bipartisan  support, I celebrated. Judge Robinson is a Vermonter who has dedicated  her life to the causes of justice and equality. She is a Vermonter who  embodies our State's highest ideals, who brings fairness, independence,  and integrity on the Second Circuit.   Next week, along the shores of Lake Champlain, friends, family, State  leaders, fellow lawyers, and many more Vermonters will gather to  celebrate the investiture of Vermont's newest judge on the Second  Circuit. Vermonters can be assured that Judge Robinson will continue to  be guided by the same principles that have brought her this far.  Marcelle and I are two Vermonters who are proud that, once again, we  are breaking barriers and making history, now with the investiture of  Judge Beth Robinson on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.   I yield the floor.
