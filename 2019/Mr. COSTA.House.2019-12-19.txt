 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize all the hard work it  took to reach this agreement for the United States-Mexico-Canada  Agreement: Chairman Neal, Chairman Brady, Chairman Blumenauer, the good  work of Ambassador Lighthizer, the working groups the Speaker put  together, and the Speaker's desire to see this get across the finish  line.   It is important to update NAFTA for the sake of the American workers  and our agricultural economy.   This agreement will improve opportunities for good-paying jobs in  America by updating labor protections and standards in Mexico that can  be enforced.   The agreement goes a long way to improve environmental standards and  clean up cross-border pollution between California and Mexico and other  border   With nearly half of California's agricultural products destined for  foreign markets, the certainty this deal brings to relations between  our two largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico, cannot be  overstated.   I was glad to be a part of this bipartisan effort to bring people  together for today's vote.   I congratulate the President. The fact of the matter is, this is good  for America, good for working people, and good for agriculture.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to supporting USMCA, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
