 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise today to talk about not the Mueller  investigation as much as I want to talk about Robert Mueller himself  because of the substantial responsibility that he has, and I think it  is important for us to remind ourselves, as well as to remind our  country, about his service at a time when he has often been attacked by  folks in Washington.   When I think of an individual like Robert Mueller, I think of two  words: ``public service''--or maybe just one word: ``service.'' He was  inspired, as many people know, to become a marine by one of his friends  from the college lacrosse team he was on. This man's name was David  Hackett, and he later died on the battlefield of Vietnam.   Mr. Mueller said in a speech:         One would have thought that the life of a Marine, and       David's death in Vietnam, would argue strongly against       following in his footsteps. But many of us saw in him the       person we wanted to be. And a number of his friends,       teammates, and associates joined the Marine Corps because of       him, as did I.    So said Robert Mueller about his friend David Hackett.   To paraphrase the words of President Kennedy, Robert Mueller didn't  join the Marine Corps because it was easy; he joined because it was  hard. While many of his peers were seeking to avoid the horrors of the  Vietnam conflict and the combat in Vietnam, Robert Mueller volunteered  to face those horrors. That sense of duty is the essence of public  service.   Robert Mueller enlisted in the Marines just a few weeks after  graduating from Princeton in 1966 and went through the demanding  programs of the Army's Ranger School and Airborne School. He then spent  a year in combat on the ground in the jungles of Vietnam, leading an  infantry platoon. The Washington Post described the conditions the  regiment faced as a ``hellscape'' of ``bloody jungle warfare.'' It was  under these difficult circumstances that Mr. Mueller received the  Bronze Star for ``heroic achievement'' after leading his fellow marines  through an 8-hour battle where, under enemy fire, ``Second Lieutenant  Mueller fearlessly moved from one position to another, directing the  accurate counterfire of his men and shouting words of encouragement to  them. . . . [H]e then skillfully supervised the evacuation of  casualties from the hazardous fire area.''   Just 4 months later, he was shot in the leg when he responded to an  ambush by enemy forces. He received the Navy Commendation Medal with a  citation praising him for rushing to save his fellow marines while  ``completely disregarding his own safety.''   That sense of serving a cause larger than himself is what led Robert  Mueller to enlist in the Marines and what led him later to apply to law  school so he could continue serving the country through our system of  justice. He served in the U.S. States Attorney's Offices and the  Justice Department for years, working his way up the chain of command  and earning a reputation as a dogged and fair prosecutor committed to  enforcing the rule of law.   In 2001, he was confirmed unanimously by this body to serve as FBI  Director and subsequently led the FBI's response to the September 11  attacks. In 2011, as his 10-year term was set to end, we in the Senate  at that time voted 100 to 0 to extend his term until 2013.   Mr. Mueller has not only earned the respect of public officials he  has worked with, he has maintained that  [[Page S7341]]  respect throughout decades of public service. There is no one better  qualified to lead this Russia investigation in terms of intellect,  experience, or character than Robert Mueller. A lot of Americans are  glad he is leading this effort to find out what happened, how the  Russians were able to interfere in our election. Robert Mueller and his  team have already produced results, and their work has sent a powerful  message to Russia--and to any other foreign or domestic entity that  would interfere with our elections--that the United States will not  tolerate any attack on our democracy.   Mr. Mueller's investigation is critical to our national security, and  it must be protected from interference by the President or anyone else.  It is now more important than ever that the Senate pass legislation to  protect the investigation and Mr. Mueller's job from interference of  any kind. I call on the Senate once again to take a vote on the Special  Council Independence and Integrity Act.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
