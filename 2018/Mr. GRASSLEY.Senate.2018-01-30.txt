 Mr. President, I want to take a moment to discuss the  Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act. This legislation, which  Senator Feinstein sponsored and I cosponsored, would promote mandatory  reporting of suspected abuse of young athletes and give survivors new  tools to hold perpetrators accountable.   As Senate Judiciary chairman, I last year convened a hearing on this  legislation, which helped build momentum for its committee approval and  passage. I am proud to have helped shepherd this bill through our  committee and the Senate, and I am delighted that we are about to send  this bill to the President for his signature.   Our congressional hearing illustrated just how bad the problem of  sexual abuse in youth sports has become, how long it went on, how many  athletes were affected, and, in some cases, how slow the response was  from those charged with ensuring these young athletes' safety. To say  that I was alarmed by what we learned at that March 28 hearing would be  a huge understatement.   Abuse that occurs by someone in a position of trust, in what should  be a safe environment, such as youth athletics programs, is simply  outrageous. Sadly, however, sports officials adopted policies that may  have allowed predators to victimize children long after they had good  reason to suspect sexual abuse.   Recently, we have heard reports that gymnastics officials took as  long as 5 weeks to report suspected abuse to the FBI. We have also  heard allegations that gymnasts were pressured to remain silent after  they brought the  [[Page S591]]  abuse to gymnastics officials' attention. It is imperative that we  uncover whatever systemic failures that allowed a predator to  singlehandedly target hundreds of girls and young women for so long.   Sexual abuse is a heinous crime, so we must continue to seek justice  for these victims. We also need to understand why allegations of sexual  abuse so often remain hidden, instead of being immediately reported to  law enforcement. The average perpetrator strikes multiple times before  being caught, which is why it is so important that these crimes be  promptly reported and investigated. I intend to continue to do  oversight in this area and champion policies to protect the innocent  from sexual abuse.   I thank each of the athletes who came forward to report abuse. Their  courage helped make passage of this bill possible.   Mr. McCONNELL. I move to concur in the House amendment, and I know of  no further debate on the motion.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?   If not, the question is on agreeing to the motion to concur.   The motion was agreed to.   Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
