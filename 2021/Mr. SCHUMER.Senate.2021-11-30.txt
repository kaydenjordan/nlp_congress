 Mr. President, after spending--this is on NDAA. After  spending months insisting that the Senate should take swift action on  our annual Defense bill, last night, Republicans mounted a partisan  filibuster, blocking this Chamber from moving forward on the NDAA.   For the information of all, before the vote closed last night, I  changed my vote to ``no'' and then entered a motion to reconsider the  cloture vote so we could find a path forward on this important bill.   Now, we have heard over and over and over again from Republicans, in  some form or another, that the Senate must act on NDAA and must act  quickly. One Republican colleague called it a core duty, a bare  minimum. Yet another colleague said it was ``the best way to thank our  soldiers and sailors for their service.''   But, last evening, Republicans blocked legislation to support our  troops, support their families, keep Americans safe, and support jobs  across the entire country. Republican dysfunction has again derailed  even bipartisan progress on our annual defense bill--an outrageous  outcome that shows how the Senate and Republican leadership have  changed in recent years.   Previous leaders, knowing that Democrats had offered Republicans a  whole lot of amendments, would have said: ``Let's vote cloture''--but  not this leader, not yet.   And there should be no mistake: The process that Democrats, and  particularly my colleague Chairman Reed, have offered Republicans on  NDAA has been more than fair and reasonable. For months, my colleagues  in the Armed Services Committee have been working to produce a  bipartisan product that could come to the floor for a vote.   The bipartisan Reed-Inhofe agreement--a Reed-Inhofe agreement--was  what we brought to the floor yesterday to vote on.   During the markup, Members considered 321 amendments and adopted 143  [[Page S8806]]  bipartisan ones before reporting the bill out of committee by a vote of  23 to 3--23 to 3, bipartisan.   In preparation for the Senate floor, the managers worked on a  substitute amendment, which had at least 50 amendments--27 of them, the  majority, from Republicans. Senator Inhofe, the ranking member of the  Armed Services Committee, worked with Democrats and had agreed to this.   And on top of all that, Senators Reed and Inhofe also reached a  bipartisan agreement to hold votes on 19 amendments here on the floor  before Republicans blocked that proposal 2 weeks ago.   Nineteen amendment votes--19--that is more than the total number of  amendments to NDAA that received votes under the Republican majority  and under Leader McConnell when we debated this bill in 2017, 2018,  2019, and 2020--not more than in each year, more than all of them put  together.   We just had 2 amendments on NDAA in 2017, when McConnell was majority  leader. We had 5 in 2018, when Mitch McConnell was majority leader; 3  in 2019; and 7 in 2020. Adding that up, that is a total of 17. That is  over 4 years.   This year, we offered 19 amendment votes, including bipartisan  measures to combat ransomware, repeal the 2020 Iraq AUMF, and support  improved cyber defense of our critical infrastructure. But when we  tried to get consent to move on this package of amendments, our  Republican colleagues came down to the floor and objected not once but  seven times.   So we have had ample debate. This has been a fair and reasonable  process that has showed respect to the other side. But this is a new  Republican Party, unfortunately, and it was not good enough for them  even on the Defense bill.   Passing the annual Defense bill should not be in question, and  Republicans' blocking this legislation is harmful to our troops, to  their families who sacrifice so much, and to our efforts to keep  Americans around the world safe.   Now, we Democrats are not going to let Republican intransigence stop  us. We are going to keep working forward on a path forward, and we hope  our Republican colleagues, as they discuss this among themselves, will  see the light and come up with a fair proposal to allow this bill to go  forward.   Nineteen amendments--a total of 17 on all the other NDAA bills--to  say that we are being unfair, to say that we are not giving enough  amendments is poppycock, and they know it.   Let's move forward. Let's move forward.                              Government Funding    Mr. President, now on government funding, there is another critical  priority that the Senate must also address before the week's end:  passing a continuing resolution that will keep the government funded  beyond the December 3 deadline.   As soon as tomorrow, the House is expected to take action to pass a  CR that will fund the government into next year. Senate Democrats are  ready to pass this legislation and get it done as quickly as possible.   To avoid a needless shutdown, Republicans will have to cooperate and  approve the government funding legislation without delay. If  Republicans choose obstruction, there will be a shutdown entirely  because of their own dysfunction.   We cannot afford to go down that road. As winter begins, the last  thing Americans need right now is an avoidable, Republican-manufactured  shutdown that will potentially harm millions of Federal workers, harm  their families, and harm local communities that rely on an open and  functioning Federal Government.   Democrats are going to work all week to make sure no government  shutdown comes to pass, and we urge our Republican colleagues to work  with us.                                  Debt Limit    Mr. President, on debt limit, also, soon the Senate must take action  to assure that the United States does not--does not--default on its  sovereign debt for the first time in history. I recently had a good  conversation with the Republican leader about this issue, and I expect  to continue those talks on achieving a bipartisan solution to  addressing the debt limit.   By now we know the dangers of an unprecedented default. Secretary  Yellen has warned that failure to extend the debt ceiling would  ``eviscerate'' our economic recovery and says our country could yet  again slip into ``a deep recession.''   Both parties know that this is simply unacceptable, and so I look  forward to achieving a bipartisan solution to addressing the debt limit  soon.                              Build Back Better    Mr. President, finally, on Build Back Better, before we hit Christmas  Day, it is my goal to have the Senate take action to debate and pass  President Biden's Build Back Better legislation.   This week, Senate Democrats will focus on continuing to meet with the  Parliamentarian so we can finish making the technical and procedural  fixes necessary for reconciliation. Once that is complete, it will be  time to bring Build Back Better here to the floor of the Senate.   I have said many times before that nobody should expect legislation  of this magnitude to be easy. We have been at the task for several  months, but we need to take a step back and recognize that we are,  hopefully, less than a month away from acting on the largest investment  the American people have seen in generations.   Here is what we are going to do in this bill: lower the cost of  childcare, make pre-K universally accessible, cut taxes for parents and  working and middle-class families, and take the next bold step in our  fight against the climate crisis.   All this we want to tackle before the Christmas break. So we will  keep working this week and until we get it done.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from  further consideration and that the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 437.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to; that the preamble be agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions, which were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 462, S. Res.  463, and S. Res. 464.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed  to; that the preambles be agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Madam President, finally, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 12 noon,  Wednesday, December 1; that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; and that upon the  conclusion of morning business, the Senate resume consideration of H.R.  4350, the National Defense Authorization Act.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:08 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, December 1, 2021, at 12 noon.                            ____________________
