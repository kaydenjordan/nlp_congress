 Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, June 5, the Dickinson High  School girls softball team capped off an extraordinary season by  winning the North Dakota Class A State Championship.   Dickinson had 13 hits, and Mataya Mortensen's dominant pitching  performance led to the team's first-ever State title. Dickinson's 10-0  win was their 30th in 33 games. Mortensen surrendered only two hits in  the shutout. And senior Paige Balliet ended the game with a walk-off  double to trigger the 10-run rule.   Dickinson finished the season with 30 and 3. They had 487 hits, 110  doubles, 19 triples, and 51 home runs. Their team batting average was  .464, and they averaged 14.5 runs a game, contrasted with a team ERA of  1.42 and 250 strikeouts in 196 innings.   Both Taya Hopfauf and Jenna Decker were named to the all-State team,  and Coach Amanda Mickey was named coach of the year.   Congratulations to the entire team on a great year, especially Paige  Balliet and Madison McChesney.                            ____________________
