 Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of  Congressman Mick Mulvaney and ask my colleagues to vote to confirm him  as the next Director of the Office of Management and Budget.   It may not surprise folks that I have a markedly different viewpoint  than the Senator from New Hampshire. Congressman Mulvaney wants to save  Social Security and Medicare. Congressman Mulvaney wants to prevent,  stop the mortgaging of our children's future, the bankrupting of  America.   One thing on which I do agree with the good Senator from New  Hampshire is that we need to concentrate on economic growth. It is the  primary component of the solution. But this Nation faces many, many  challenges. From the standpoint of foreign policy, take a look at what  is happening around the world, the turmoil in so much of the world. We  are in a generational struggle against Islamic terror, against ISIS,  al-Qaida. Iran--that nuclear agreement was horrible. It modified the  behavior for the worse. We have just witnessed North Korea test-fire  another missile. Combined with their nuclear capability at some point  in time--probably not in the too distant future--they will threaten  America. China has been emboldened. Russia has become more aggressive.  Why? Because in so many instances, these nations perceive America as  weaker than we once were, lacking the strength and resolve to provide  the leadership, project our values around the world.   With all these threats that America faces, at the same time our  military is being hollowed out. We won't have the resources militarily  to fight back if they strike first.   Domestically, we also face many perils, many challenges. ObamaCare  didn't work. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act did not  protect the patients. It is not affordable. In my State, Wisconsin,  premiums on the individual market have doubled and tripled. A young  mother working a part-time job so she could stay home with her children  had to quit that job to take full-time work to pay her $8,000 per year  increase in premiums. Wages have stagnated for years. Our  infrastructure is old and in many cases, crumbling. Our borders are  porous. We are not winning the War on Drugs because of porous borders  in many respects. Unfortunately, the War on Poverty has also not been  won. In many cases, it has created perverse incentives that have  trapped generations in a cycle of poverty and dependency and despair.  It has resulted in the national debt rapidly approaching $20 trillion.  Again, that is that mortgaging our children's future that Congressman  Mulvaney wants to prevent.   As the chart nearby shows, we are on a completely unsustainable path  that Congressman Mulvaney also understands must be stopped. If you take  a look at this chart, according to the Congressional Budget Office,  over the next 30 years, our projected deficit will total $103 trillion.  That would be put on top of that $20 trillion in debt. It will be $10  trillion over the next 10 years, $28 trillion in the second decade, $66  trillion in the third decade. That is completely unsustainable.   By the way, the components of that $103 trillion deficit--$14  trillion in Social Security. In other words, Social Security will pay  out $14 trillion more in benefits than it takes in from the payroll tax  over the next 30 years; Medicare, $34 trillion. The remainder of that  $103 trillion is interest on the debt. If we want to avoid paying  creditors more than $50 trillion in interest on our debt over the next  30 years, we need to address Social Security and Medicare. Congressman  Mulvaney wants to do that. He wants to save Social Security and  Medicare--not demagogue it; save it.   As the Senator from New Hampshire was pointing out, we need economic  growth. That is the No. 1 component of the solution. I don't care what  problem I just mentioned above, economic growth is the primary  component of the solution.   What is hampering our economy from growing? The fact is, since the  Great Depression, our economy has averaged 3.2 percent annual real  growth. Since the great recession, we have only been growing about 2  percent. I would argue that there are a number factors causing that  tepid growth: overregulation, an uncompetitive tax system. We are not  fully utilizing our energy resources. The Presiding Officer certainly  understands that from his State. We are not utilizing our abundant  energy resources. And of course there is this: our unsustained fiscal  path, our $20 trillion in debt.   I oftentimes make the analogy between our national debt and a family  in debt over their head. It is just a nation-state; it is just many,  many, many  [[Page S1200]]  orders of magnitude larger. But the fact is, if you are a family in  debt over your head, how can you grow your personal economy? All your  disposable income is spent on the basics and servicing the debt. The  same thing is true of a nation-state. Again, our enemies perceive that  weakness caused by our indebtedness.   So when you take a look at the role of the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget, what we need to do to grow our economy comes  under his jurisdiction basically. He has to address this deficit. He  has to put forward a budget that is sustainable. Mick Mulvaney is  dedicated to doing that.   Then, of course, the other thing the Office of Management and Budget  is really designed to combat is overregulation. They are all about  taking a look at cost-benefit and making sure the regulations that are  implemented by this Federal Government are reasonable from a cost- benefit relationship. That has not been the case recently.   Just a couple of examples of how economic growth really is going to  help solve this problem. If you go from 2 to 3 percent annual growth,  that is $14 trillion in added economic benefit in just over a decade.  If you go from 2 to 4 percent, that is $29 trillion. And even with the  meager economic growth we have had since 2009, revenue to the Federal  Government has increased by more than $1.1 trillion per year with  meager economic growth. Just think of what would happen if we could  reduce the regulatory burden, have a competitive tax system, and put  our Federal Government on a sustainable fiscal path. Revenue would be  flowing to the Federal Government, we could stop hollowing out our  military, and we could start addressing these threats.   As to the regulatory burden, when we held hearings on this in my  committee, the numbers showed that regulatory burden at $2 trillion per  year. Just put that into perspective because I know we are getting  immune to these massive numbers: $2 trillion is larger than all but 10  economies in the entire world. That is a self-imposed, self-inflicted  wound on our economy. If you take that $2 trillion and divide it by the  number of households in America, it is $14,800 per household. No  American writes a check to the Federal Government to pay their share of  the regulatory burden; instead, they realize that burden in reduced  opportunities.   Why are wages stagnated? That is a good part of it--increased prices,  and of course, again, those lower wages. It is a massive problem. One  Wisconsin paper manufacturer I was talking to--and by the way, I can't  tell you who because he fears retaliation by the government, which is a  different subject--did a cost calculation of just four recently issued  regulations and came up with a total cost of $12,000 per year per  employee. There you go. That is money that could have been available  for increasing wages or for investing in business to create better  opportunities and better paying jobs. The regulatory burden is massive.   I had the chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison come into  my office during the last 2 years with the primary complaint--the  primary ask--being to reduce that regulatory burden. Last year, she  came in armed with a study commissioned by research universities that  said that 42 percent of researcher time on Federal grants was spent  complying with Federal regulations. Think of the opportunity cost of  that overregulation. Those Federal grants are meant to pay for studies  and doing research on curing diseases, not filling out Federal  paperwork. So again, the Director of the Office of Management and  Budget will take a look at those regulations, particularly now under  this President, who has issued an Executive order to make sure that for  every one regulation issued by a new agency, they have to remove two.  That is a very good start. I would have gone with one-in, ten-out, but  I will settle for one-in, two-out. I will certainly be supportive of an  Office of Management and Budget that understands the incredible burden  of overregulation on our economy.   During our committee markup--I heard earlier the Senator from  Arkansas, who knows Congressman Mulvaney, served with him in the House,  and understands how dedicated and serious Congressman Mulvaney is to  stopping this mortgage of our children's future. Senator Lankford also  had the opportunity to serve 4 years in the House with Representative  Mulvaney. This is what Senator Lankford had to say about his friend and  colleague at the nomination hearing:         You were a serious student. You looked hard at difficult       issues. You understood that there were difficult decisions       that needed to be made and made proposals to do that.    In testimony before our committee, Congressman Mulvaney told my  committee:         When President-elect Trump announced my nomination, he       noted that our nation was nearly $20 trillion in debt and       stated that I have the skills and convictions to responsibly       manage our nation's finances. I believe that is why he       nominated me for this position.    He went on to state:         For the first time in America's history, the next       generation could be less prosperous than the generation that       preceded it.    That is a very sad possibility. We need to prevent that.   He went on to say:         To me and to the people in this room, that is simply       unacceptable. We CAN turn this economy, and this country       around . . . but it will take tough decisions today in order       to avoid impossible ones tomorrow.    Congressman Mulvaney went on:         I believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a       problem that must be addressed sooner, rather than later. I       also know that fundamental changes are needed in the way       Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy       economy.    Again, he fully understands the connection between our unsustainable  fiscal path, our deficit, our debt, and economic growth. He said we  ``must include changing our government's long-term fiscal path--which  is unsustainable.''   Finally, he said:         I recognize that good public service--whether in a state       legislature, Congress, or OMB--takes both courage and wisdom.       The courage to lead, and the wisdom to listen. I have learned       that I do not have a monopoly on good ideas. Facts--and the       cogent arguments of others--matter. I will be loyal to the       facts and to the American people whom I serve.        My commitment to you today is to take a fact-based approach       to get our financial house in order.    This is exactly the type of person--Congressman Mick Mulvaney-- somebody who is dedicated to solving these problems, who has the  courage and the wisdom to stop mortgaging our children's future, to put  America's budget on a sustainable fiscal path, to grow our economy, to  make sure that future generations inherit a stronger, more prosperous  America.   I am proud to support and I urge all my colleagues to support and  vote for the confirmation of Congressman Mick Mulvaney to be the next  Director of the Office of Management and Budget.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.
