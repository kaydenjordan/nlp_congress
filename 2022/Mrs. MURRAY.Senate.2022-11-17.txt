 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me  just say at the start, title 42 is a public health tool, and how it is  used should be guided by public health experts, looking at data,  looking at science--not politicians looking to score political points.   And let's be clear, drug trafficking is a serious problem and one we  do have law enforcement agencies responsible for. We should leave that  work to them and support their efforts. But instead of proposing real  legislative solutions to address drug trafficking based on what will  keep people safe, Republicans want to use title 42 now as the means to  keep out anyone seeking asylum and create a political talking point.   And while I welcome the opportunity to work with my Republican  colleague on serious bipartisan solutions to address drug trafficking,  I object to this at this time.
