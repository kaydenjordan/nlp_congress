 Mr. President, I came to the floor today to make  remarks in support of the bipartisan infrastructure modernization plan.  But before I do that, I do want to take a moment to remember a real  giant of the American working people, and that is Richard Trumka, the  head of the AFL-CIO, who is somebody who got up every single morning  thinking about how to make life better for working people in America.   He was passionate about it. He was a fellow Marylander. We are going  to miss him, but I know that we will continue to be inspired by his  example and his understanding that when working people ban together to  form a union, that is the best way for them to be able to bargain for  better wages and better benefits and a better retirement and a better  life.   So I know that we will all carry on in his memory. And as we take up  this bill to modernize our infrastructure, it was something that he  worked with us on to ensure that as we modernize our infrastructure, we  also create good-paying jobs. And I do think that this bill will  modernize our infrastructure and generate millions of good-paying jobs  for the American people.                                Infrastructure    Mr. President, it was just about 6 months ago that I came to the  floor to urge my Senate colleagues to heed the call of the American  people and pass the American Rescue Plan. At that time, the country was  being ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic. The economy was in a slump. The  country was hurting, and the American people were hurting.   The American Rescue Plan was designed to accelerate the deployment of  vaccines to defeat the pandemic, to extend a hand to those who have  been hardest hit, and to boost an economic comeback. We knew we had to  be bold, we had to be quick, and we had to be decisive in our actions  or risk a drawn out recovery and a weakened public health response.   That legislation, the American Rescue Plan, promised immediate action  to meet the urgency of the moment, and that is exactly what it did.  Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we jump-started the deployment of  the coronavirus vaccines in faster and fairer ways, distributed around  the country. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, millions of American  households received a new round of direct payments, bringing their  total relief payment--including the December relief bill--up to $2,000  per person.   The American Rescue Plan also expanded the child tax credit to cut  child poverty nearly in half this year, with millions of American  families receiving up to $300 each month for each child. And because of  the American Rescue Plan, State and local governments are receiving the  direct funding they need to keep frontline workers on the job and  continue essential benefits to lift up our communities.   And thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we secured Federal funds to  keep restaurants and small businesses afloat, assist children with  disabilities, get our kids back in school more quickly and more safely,  bolster childcare, and help more people get connected to the internet  during this time when we had to experience so much social distancing,  and much more.   That plan was a victory. It was a victory for our families, for our  workers, for small businesses, for communities, and for the country.  And while we know we have more work to do to defeat the Delta variant  of the virus, today, more than 70 percent of the adult population has  gotten at least one shot of the COVID-19 vaccine. And last quarter, our  economy grew at an annualized rate of 6\1/2\ percent, and our gross  domestic product rose for the first time from the beginning of the  pandemic to the point where it had been before that started.   Thanks to the American Rescue Plan and the resilience of the American  people, we are building back from this crisis. But while building back  is good, it is not good enough. As President Biden has said, we need to  not just build back but build back better. And building back better  means not only growing our economy bigger and faster but providing for  more inclusive growth and more shared prosperity. We cannot accept an  economy where the already-rich grow ever richer while everyone else is  running in place or falling behind. A rising tide must lift all boats,  not just the yachts.    President Biden has laid out two important pieces to advance the  better part of the Build Back Better agenda. One is the American Jobs  Plan, and the other is the American Families Plan. Both of these plans,  and more, are key to building an economy that works for everyone and  not just those who are already at the top.   The bipartisan infrastructure plan that we are considering now  contains many elements of the Biden American Jobs Plan. And while I  wish it included even more, it is a very important start, and I  strongly support it.   And I appreciate the bipartisan cooperation that helped advance this  plan, including the efforts of the Presiding Officer. These combined  efforts have produced a plan that will make key investments in  virtually every part of our infrastructure.   It will include investments in our transit systems and railways and  help repair our roads and bridges and tunnels and more. It makes the  largest investment in clean drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure in American history. And, very importantly, this  legislation includes essential investments to build the backbone of the  modern 21st century economy, including funds to expand broadband so we  can bridge the digital divide and funds to start building out our clean  energy grid and the deployment of electric charging stations.   I was proud to work with my colleague and friend from Maryland,  Senator Cardin, to secure some key elements that will directly support  our home State of Maryland and the people  [[Page S5907]]  who live there. I would like to take a moment to discuss the impact of  this legislation here in Maryland, starting with the funds that it  provides to repair and restore our roads, our bridges, and our tunnels.   Under this plan, the State of Maryland will receive $4.1 billion for  Federal highways and $409 million for bridge replacement and repairs  over the next 5 years. These funds will be absolutely vital as we work  to restore 273 bridges and over 2,000 miles of Maryland highways that  are in poor condition and in desperate need of repair.   This plan also makes a historic investment in public transit and rail  systems in Maryland and the DMV area. Maryland will receive $1.7  billion over 5 years to improve public transportation options across  our entire State.   And this legislation will make an important down payment on our  Amtrak passenger rail systems by addressing the big repair backlog  along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and by supporting projects like the  B&P Tunnel in Baltimore, which is used by 9 million travelers every  year but has faced challenges of structural deterioration and fire  safety concerns for far too long. Restoring this tunnel could slash the  time it takes to get from Baltimore to Washington down to just 30  minutes and create 30,000 jobs. And it is a shining example of the type  of projects that could be funded by this bill and we expect will be  funded by this bill.   As you know, we are not just talking about heavy rail. This plan also  authorizes transit monies and, importantly, it continues the $150  million annual Federal contribution to the Washington area Metro  system, known as WMATA. We call it the Nation's Metro system.   This bill will extend the Federal authorization of $150 million for  another 8 years. This is especially important since that authorization  has now expired. It is also important because this new version includes  provisions to strengthen WMATA's inspector general's authority in order  to improve oversight and passenger safety. It is a big win for  passengers and transit employees alike, and I am delighted to see that  8-year authorization in this bill.   That is good news for this part of the region and for this part of  Maryland that is covered by WMATA, but in the Baltimore area, many  residents don't have easy access to accessible, affordable transit that  can get them where they need to go around the city or the region when  they need to go there. That is why we also secured a provision in this  bill to keep alive future Federal funding for the Baltimore Red Line  Metro system.    This is a project that had been years in the making, and, if  completed, would boost jobs and economic growth, reduce travel times in  the Baltimore region, alleviate congestion, and reduce air pollution.  The Maryland delegation fought for years to get this project to the  front of the line, and, in 2015, we were pleased to secure $900 million  in Federal funds for the Baltimore Red Line project.   But then something happened. The Maryland Governor pulled the plug on  the entire Red Line project, turning down the jobs and improved  transportation network for the Baltimore area. Other cities and regions  around the country were celebrating when they got those funds instead  of Baltimore. Senator Cardin and I have not given up. And while the  Federal Government cannot, by itself, bring this project online, this  bill states that the Federal Government is still a willing partner on  the Red Line when State and local officials signal that they are ready  and willing to move forward again.   At the end of the day, the transportation investments made in this  bill will facilitate people and products moving more quickly throughout  their regions and throughout the country. It invests in airports and  ports, including $17 billion in ports like the Port of Baltimore and  others around the country.   This funding will benefit our port, the Port of Baltimore, which is a  key asset in our State and a powerful engine for economic and job  growth. It is currently a hub for 15,000 jobs, with room for growth  that can be fueled by this bill.   I was pleased to join others in welcoming our Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg, to Baltimore just last week where he  underscored the Department's commitment to investing in our ports and  the men and women who work there. This legislation helps us make good  on that commitment.   I partnered with colleagues over the years to secure over $500  million in Federal funds for that port, including funds to dredge  channels in the Chesapeake Bay and the Baltimore Harbor so that they  are deep enough to accommodate the biggest ships.   Speaking of the Chesapeake Bay, every Marylander knows that the  health of the bay is deeply bound to Maryland's local economy and  Maryland's environmental well-being, and I am pleased that we secured  $238 million in funding for the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program to help us  meet the pollution reduction targets that are spelled out in the most  recent multistate Chesapeake Bay agreement as part of this legislation.   While this legislation provides important investments to modernize  the infrastructure for this century, we, the Federal Government, should  also take responsibility to help eliminate some of the past projects  that, rather than helping unite communities, divide them and harm them.  And there is no clearer example of such a project than what is known as  the ``highway to nowhere'' in West Baltimore.   As many Marylanders know, the ``highway to nowhere'' was a project  conceived in the 1960s as a way to link Baltimore with the growing U.S.  Interstate Highway System. Instead, it tore West Baltimore apart.  Developers started dividing up the community to make room for the  highway, residents were evicted from their homes, businesses were shut  down, and a Black community was split down the middle by that ``highway  to nowhere.'' It is estimated that 971 houses and 62 businesses were  destroyed, and over 1,500 residents were displaced.   And that has been the story of several other Federal infrastructure  projects from the 1960s, projects that too often place pavement over  people. I am pleased that this bipartisan plan makes at least an  initial down payment for the first time to put Federal dollars toward  removing harmful infrastructure projects like the ``highway to  nowhere'' so we can reconnect these communities and make them whole.   This provision was based off a pilot program I authored in 2019. I  want to thank my colleagues, Senator Cardin and Senator Carper, for  helping make this vision a reality, and President Biden for including  it as part of his American Jobs Plan. While we didn't get the full  amount of funds that we would like, this is a very important first  step.   As we dismantle some of the harmful legacy from the 1960s and 20th  century projects, we must build out and meet the new needs for the 21st  century, like universal, affordable access to high-speed internet.   I am very pleased that Maryland will receive a minimum of $100  million from this legislation to help provide broadband coverage across  the State, including providing access to the at least 148,000  Marylanders who currently lack it--they are not connected--and it would  provide over 1 million Marylanders access to the affordability  connectivity benefit plan to help lower income families afford internet  access. It doesn't do you much good to be connected to the internet if  you can't afford to use it.   This bill also will make important progress, a first step, toward  building out clean energy grid and a network of charging stations to  facilitate long-distance travel and provide convenient charging options  for electric vehicles.   In short, and for all of these reasons, this bipartisan bill is an  important step to helping us build back better and stronger than before  the pandemic.   That work starts here with this bill, and I strongly support it. But  while that work starts here, it does not stop or end here.   To pass this legislation and then call it quits would be to leave a  big part of our job undone. We still have urgent work to do in our  mission to enact all of President Biden's Build Back Better agenda and  address the profound challenges facing our communities that have been  exacerbated by this pandemic.   While this bill provides important downpayments in many areas, it  does not do everything we need to do. That  [[Page S5908]]  is especially true when it comes to infrastructure in the area of clean  energy. We need to make sure we take up the other big pieces of the  clean energy agenda in President Biden's American Jobs Plan and other  proposals that many of us have put forward here in this body, including  the clean energy standard, including a clean energy accelerator  financing system, and many other provisions, in order for us to be true  to the science and really confront the climate crisis that is upon us.   And as we take those next steps to fully modernized our physical  infrastructure, we also have to dramatically expand opportunities for  every child and every family and every worker in America. Much of that  is laid out in President Biden's American Families Plan, including  universal access to early education so every single child, regardless  of ZIP Code, has a chance and a good start in life; making workforce  training more affordable and college more affordable, whether it is 2  years of community colleges or more.   And we also have to make sure that we continue to provide support for  families in the form of affordable childcare and, very importantly,  extend the child tax credit payments that so many families are now  receiving up to $300 a month. That ends at the end of this year if we  don't extend it.   While it is always a good thing to reduce child poverty in America-- and that reduces it by about half--that would only be true to the end  of this year. We need to finish the job and keep going.   We also need to reduce the costs that are squeezing the pocketbooks  of every American family. We need to reduce the skyrocketing costs of  prescription drugs. We need to reduce the costs of childcare. We need  to make sure that families don't have to spend more than 8.5 percent of  their budget on their annual healthcare premiums. And we need to  provide more security for everybody, including our seniors, by  expanding Medicare coverage to cover dental and vision and hearing  needs.   Those are just some of the additional things that we need to do as  part of the American Families Plan and as part of passing the overall  Build Back Better agenda.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to do all of that. But  every journey begins with a big step, and this is a very important big  step forward on that Build Back Better agenda.   So I am pleased to join many of my colleagues, and I urge my  colleagues to support this bipartisan infrastructure modernization bill  as part of a very important first step to implement the Build Back  Better agenda and make sure that we truly build an economy that works  for every American.   I yield the floor
