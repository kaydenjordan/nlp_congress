 Mr. President I ask unanimous consent to be able to  complete my remarks before the vote occurs.    Mr. President, listening to my friend, the Democratic  whip, reminds me that there is one type of business that my Democratic  friends always support, and that is the lawsuit business. As he pointed  out, about half of the States have taken steps to protect their  citizens from frivolous litigation and other litigation that would  arise out of their good-faith following of the guidelines laid down by  the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control. That is what we proposed here  in the Senate.   And my friend's, the Senator from Illinois's view did prevail because  I found out that there is one--the most powerful lobby here in  Washington, DC, is the trial bar, and, unfortunately, it is not just  big corporations. I am sure big companies can take care of themselves.  They have got lawyers; they have got compliance officers; and they have  got people who can help them figure out how to deal with the pandemic.  It is the mom-and-pop businesses, the music venues, the houses of  worship, the schools, and the universities--those were the ones that  were reluctant to reopen, even complying with the CDC guidelines,  because they were afraid of being sued into oblivion.   So my colleague's views did prevail here in the Senate,  unfortunately, but, thankfully, States like mine--Texas is currently in  legislative session taking appropriate steps to avoid this sort of  frivolous litigation, which will be like a wet blanket on our economic  recovery and on job creation. Again, this is not a get-out-of-jail free  card. These are citizens--American citizens--trying to do the best they  can under very difficult circumstances who have, in good faith,  complied with the Centers for Disease Control guidelines.   I would like to rewind just a little bit to 2019, before the pandemic  hit, and recall that the American people were reaping the benefits of  one of the strongest economies in American history. The driving force  behind that economic boom, I think, was, in significant part, the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act, which we passed in 2017, which sought to help  American families and the economy thrive by keeping more of what they  earned and turning over less to the Federal Government. In my opinion,  there is no question that it was one of the biggest contributors to our  booming economy.   Our national unemployment rate had reached a 50-year low, and we saw  record unemployment rates for Hispanics, African Americans, and Asian  Americans. Unemployment among women fell to the lowest rate since the  early 1950s. That was prepandemic.   The benefits did not stop there, though. Wages were on the rise. The  poverty rate hit an alltime low, and millions of new jobs were being  added to our economy. Families were bringing home more of their hard- earned paychecks, and median household income reached a record high.   But then the pandemic hit, as we know, and things took a very sharp  turn downward. Businesses closed their doors; workers lost their jobs;  and the unemployment rate skyrocketed from 3.5 percent to nearly 15  percent in April.   Fortunately, this dark economic picture is gradually brightening.  Thanks to the investment we have made in therapeutics and vaccines in a  historically short period of time, thanks to the ingenuity and  perseverance of workers and business owners, combined with the  assistance that Congress has given them and, like I said, advancements  in modern science, we have made steady progress.   The unemployment rate has steadily declined over the last year,  reaching 6 percent in March, but the new data from April is a cause for  concern. The unemployment rate increased by a tenth of a percentage  point. It didn't go down. It went up. It is a bump that wouldn't have  raised any red flags before the pandemic. But this single data point is  not the only indication of how our economy is faring. Last month, only  266,000 new jobs were added to the economy. That is a quarter--25  percent--of what economists had predicted. Now, again, 266,000 new jobs  would not have been a bad jobs report before the pandemic because we  were literally at nearly full employment, but we aren't currently in a  build mode. We are currently digging our way out of a hole, a  recession, to be specific.   We are still missing 8 million jobs that existed prior to the  pandemic. I don't think anyone expected all those jobs to come back  overnight, but we did expect to be faring far better than this. As I  said, the economists said this is a quarter of what they anticipated.   Well, this is the first full month of data since our Democratic  colleagues passed their $2 trillion so-called rescue plan on top of the  trillions of dollars that we spent in 2020. If things continue to go  the rate we are on now, we are in for an extremely long recovery. In  other words, sometimes policies that emanate from Washington actually  make the recovery harder, not easier.   Unfortunately, the administration is doing more to slow down the  recovery than they are to solve it. Last year, Republicans and  Democrats worked together to provide unprecedented assistance to  workers and their families hit by this economic downturn. Bolstered  unemployment benefits were intended to provide laid-off workers with  the money they needed to support their families until they could return  to work, and over the last year, many of those workers have,  fortunately, gotten back on the job.   These benefits were a lifeline for millions of families and, today,  there are still workers unable to find a new job. But there are,  unfortunately, also people abusing the system, the generosity of the  American people, the American taxpayer. The partisan relief bill our  Democratic colleagues pushed through earlier this year extended  supplemental unemployment benefits through September of this year, far  beyond the amount of time anyone would have expected that those  benefits, the supplemental benefits to the State unemployment benefits,  would be needed.   Even as vaccinations were on the rise, our Democratic colleagues  insisted on extending these benefits through September, and many of us  predicted the outcome. Last spring, workers couldn't find jobs. Now,  businesses can't find workers.   Between bolstered unemployment benefits and a steady stream of  stimulus checks, many people who lost their jobs can't be convinced to  return to the workforce. One restaurant owner in Texas said he had had  plenty of applicants; people just won't show up for the interviews. One  day, when he had scheduled eight interviews for potential employment,  only one applicant showed up. The next day, the same thing happened-- five scheduled interviews; one person showed up. He said: It makes you  wonder, are they just filling these applications out to collect  unemployment? Because, of course, most unemployment benefits require  you to apply for work and accept it if it is offered. But apparently  here, whatever the incentives are, they are simply persuading some  people to fill out applications but then not to seriously pursue work.   In a year's time, we have gone from the strongest economy in a  generation to the government paying people to stay home. This reminds  me of the discussion we had a couple of years ago when the Green New  Deal was launched. An overview of the bill was listed on the website of  one of its authors and said that the government would foot the bill for  any person who is ``unable or unwilling to work.'' ``Unable or  unwilling to work,'' that the  [[Page S2428]]  government would foot the bill--that was the proposal initially when  the Green New Deal was rolled out. ``Unwilling to work.'' Don't like  the job? Don't want to get out of bed in the morning? Don't worry;  hard-working Americans who are getting up and going to work every day  will foot the bill so you can stay home. I am sure it comes as no  surprise that this received a great deal of criticism and even ridicule  2 years ago.   Unfortunately for the taxpayers who actually do get up every morning  and go to work, we are seeing this play out in real time. Folks who  lost their jobs and who are now able but unwilling to return to work  can continue to reap the bolstered unemployment benefits that our  Democratic colleagues provided for them through September.   Another restaurant owner in Texas said that between the stimulus  checks and the enhanced unemployment benefits, it is tough to find  people who want to work at all. He said:         I believe our biggest competition in the job market is the       government.    This isn't an isolated problem. In Texas, the average unemployment  benefits equal more than $36,000 a year. In Washington State, you can  receive $39,000 a year in unemployment benefits. In Massachusetts, it  is $41,000 a year.   A few Governors have said their States will stop offering the  bolstered benefits because it is a disincentive for workers to get back  on the job. If you are able to stay home and bring in as much money or  maybe even more than you were earning while you were actually working,  what is the incentive to go back?   This poor job report isn't a surprise to anyone who has spoken to  employers, as I have, who have said repeatedly that no one wants to  return to work when they can get paid to stay home.   Another factor that has likely contributed to the slow recovery is  the slow reopening of schools. Despite the fact that in many States,  teachers are among the first individuals to get vaccinated, the return  to classrooms has been incredibly slow. Less than half the school  districts throughout the country are operating fully in person.   The nearly $2 trillion that our Democratic colleagues rammed through  Congress in March did little to get us back on track. It sent more than  $120 billion more to K-12 schools that were already flush with cash but  attached no requirement that the money be used to actually get children  back in the classroom, where we know they will learn best.   If at least one parent has to be home with their children for even  part of the week, that makes it incredibly difficult for them to return  to work. For single parents, it is virtually impossible.   If we are ever going to get our economy back on track, we need to get  our children safely back in school. We need to get people who are able  but who are currently unwilling to work to get back on the job. And we  need to supply the businesses that managed to survive this past year  with a reliable workforce.   Right now, the biggest hurdle to our economic recovery is the  government itself. That needs to change. If you asked the President or  a number of our Democratic colleagues in the Senate, they would say the  solution is easy--the American Jobs Plan. Let's spend more money.   This proposal is part social safety net, part infrastructure, and  part taxpayer-funded spending spree. It is really designed to transform  America into Europe--a social safety net economy.   It spends more than $2.5 trillion on things like electric vehicle  chargers and home healthcare, which we are happy to debate in any other  context, but what we really need is a jobs plan to get America back to  work, not another Trojan horse like we saw passed earlier this year and  is currently being advertised, for example, under the guise of being an  infrastructure bill.   In order to finance this plan, along with the President's American  Families Plan, our Democratic colleagues want to enact the largest tax  hike in a generation. So contrary to what we did in 2017 by lowering  the tax burden and giving people more of what they earned--and we have  seen those tremendous economic results as a consequence--our Democratic  colleagues want to, while we are still at 6 percent unemployment, raise  taxes, which will further retard the economic recovery.   So to recap, the plan for economic recovery is to make it more  expensive for businesses to operate and nearly impossible for them to  find workers. No wonder the economy isn't rebounding like we had hoped.  That is what happened to the million jobs that were projected to be in  the latest jobs report, but it was unfortunately a disappointing 25  percent of those million jobs.   So instead of building on the successes of 2017 and the prepandemic  economy, the administration wants to double down on the old, tired  belief that America can tax and spend and regulate itself to  prosperity. We don't need dramatic tax increases for sweeping social  safety programs to get our economy back on track. We need to replicate  the same factors that led to our banner prepandemic recovery. We need  to get our children safely back in the classroom so their parents can  return to the workforce. We need to stop paying workers to sit on the  sidelines, and we need to give the job creators the ability to drive  our economy forward.   Democrats don't have an ``American Something Plan'' for every  problem. Sometimes all the government has to do is get out of the way   I yield the floor.
