 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  dedication with which Jason Graham serves the First District of Georgia  as director of pharmacy for St. Joseph's/Candler Health System.   He was recently selected to be the director of pharmacy, overseeing  the day-to-day pharmaceutical needs of two anchor hospitals, dozens of  other care locations, and thousands of patients.   He has built a career over two decades with the St. Joseph's/Candler  Health System, starting in 2001 as a pharmacy technician.   When he was getting his undergraduate degree in biology, Jason worked  with us at my pharmacy. His bright mind and desire to help others were  quickly apparent to me. Since working for us, he has earned a master's  degree in health services administration and a doctor of pharmacy  degree.   After beginning his career as a pharmacy technician, he served as a  clinical pharmacist and as a pharmacy manager.   He is an active member of the American Society of Health-System  Pharmacists and is the southeast regional director for the Georgia  Society of Health-System Pharmacists.   On top of all this, he oversees the training of medical and pharmacy  school students, ensuring the next generation of medicine is in good  hands.   He lives in Savannah with his wife, Shannon, who also worked with us,  twin sons Conner and Jackson, and his daughter Hayden.   I am proud of the work that Jason has done on behalf of the entire  First District. I thank him for his dedication to promoting the health  of southeast Georgia.            Congratulating the University of Georgia School of Law     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  University of Georgia School of Law for being named the best value in  legal education by The National Jurist magazine.   We need well-educated, ethical, and competent employees in all  sectors, but especially law. As lawyers combat the challenges facing  our legal system, the University of Georgia School of Law is helping  answer that need by providing an exceptional legal education at an  affordable price.   I am particularly impressed by UGA School of Law's proactive efforts  to keep it that way. Dean Bo Rutledge and his team have worked  tirelessly to reduce the annual indebtedness for students by over $5  million. In 2019, almost 40 percent of the juris doctor student body  did not borrow funds for their education.   UGA School of Law continues to top national rankings in  postgraduation employment, bar passage rates, and income level  postgrad. This success is a testament to the outstanding education  students receive at the University of Georgia for whatever degree they  are pursuing.   Congratulations again to UGA School of Law and Dean Bo Rutledge. I  have no doubt that your graduates will continue to make a positive  impact on our legal system and for the Georgia community.                                time  1030                 Recognizing Chatham County Police Department     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  persistence and the dedication of the Chatham County Police Department  along with Chief Jeff Hadley in investigating one of the toughest, most  tragic cases I have ever heard of.   The case surrounded the disappearance of Quinton Simon, a 20-month- old boy who was reported missing from his home on the morning of  October 5. The case surrounded the parents of Quinton, and immediately  the Chatham County Police Department launched a no-expense-spared  search for the Savannah child with detectives regularly working 18 to  20 hours a day to find Quinton and bring him home.   For weeks, the Chatham County Police Department, in tandem with the  [[Page H9695]]  FBI, searched for evidence that could lead them to Quinton.  Investigators successfully uncovered Quinton's remains along with other  evidence that led them to arrest his mother for the disappearance and  murder of her son.   It is cases like these that exemplify the thankless nature of life in  law enforcement. Day in and day out, police and first responders  grapple with tragedies of a magnitude most of us can't even imagine,  let alone handle ourselves.   I want to take this opportunity to thank Chief Hadley and the Chatham  County Police Department for the work that they do because I don't know  how they do it. This is one of the hardest jobs in the world, and our  officers deserve more recognition for handling situations like these  gracefully and professionally as they so often do.                            ____________________
