 Mr. President, I would like to give an update to all of  our colleagues about where we are on S. 2155.   We continue to be open and ready for amendments on our side. We have  a number that we are ready to proceed forward with, and we so far have  not received agreement from the other side to move forward. We hope  that we can avoid this slowdown and start moving forward by setting  votes on amendments as soon as we can, and we will continue to work to  try to achieve that.   It is my hope that we will be able to get heavily engaged in and  resolve the amendment stage of this legislation soon so that we can  continue to move forward expeditiously.   I thank the Chair.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise again today to speak further on S.  2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection  Act.   We have had a lot of discussion on the floor about this bill in the  last few days. Anybody who took the opportunity to watch all of that  debate sees that there is a strong bipartisan support for this bill and  a strong debate coming from some quarters trying to say that the bill  creates greater risk in our financial community. I would like to  address exactly what this bill does and then respond to some of those  charges, which I consider to be completely unfounded.   The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act  is aimed at rightsizing regulation for financial institutions-- including community banks and credit unions--making it easier for  consumers to get mortgages and to obtain credit.   I have said a number of times, and I will repeat, back when we were  debating the Dodd-Frank legislation about 10 years ago, it was marketed  to the public as a bill to address excesses and problems on Wall Street  by the big megabanks of our country, but its provisions hit hardest on  Main Street.   As I have said, I actually held a news conference in Boise, ID--in my  home State--on Main Street. I said the crosshairs of this bill and the  bulls-eye are on Main Street, not Wall Street.   What has happened in the last 10 years? The Wall Street banks have  been phenomenally profitable. They have been very successful, and the  smaller banks--the credit unions, the community banks, even the  regional banks--have been hammered.   We are losing credit unions and, more specifically, community banks  across this Nation at an alarming pace, and the reason--the primary  reason--is the phenomenally significant increased regulatory burden  they face.   I have heard colleagues of mine on the floor in the last couple of  days talking about specific community banks and credit unions in their  States that have had so much pressure put on them, so much burden and  financial costs put on them by the excessive regulations that they have  either gone out of business or stopped issuing mortgages, just stopped  doing mortgage business or stopped doing loans of certain types that  are beneficial to our small businesses. So the real victims aren't even  just the community banks and credit unions; they are the people--the  people who want to get a loan in their local communities and who are  entirely worthy of getting a loan to buy a house, but their credit  unions and community banks are no longer in that business or they are  no longer in existence. That is what this bill is addressing.   The bill also increases important consumer protections for veterans,  senior citizens, victims of fraud, and those who fall on tough  financial times. The provisions in this bill will directly address some  of the problems I frequently hear about from financial institutions.  Let me explain in a little more detail just what that is. I have  already discussed some.  [[Page S1571]]    Community banks and credit unions are simple institutions, focused on  relationship lending and have special relationships with the people in  their communities. The bankers and their customers go to church, play  ball, or their kids go to school with each other. They know their  customers, and they are willing to work with them to help them be  successful. They provide credit to traditionally underserved and rural  communities, where it may be harder to access banking products and  services or to get a loan.   Dodd-Frank instituted numerous new mortgage rules and complex capital  requirements on community banks and credit unions that have hindered  consumers' access to mortgage credit and lending more broadly.   I guess I will just insert here, this phenomenon we often see in  Washington of one-size-fits-all or cookie-cutter solutions to a problem  is directly the kind of problem we are seeing here.   Our smaller financial institutions are treated as though they were  large megabanks and as though their business models and their  portfolios contain the same kind of risk as the larger banks. Yet they  don't have the same business models; they don't have the same risk  footprint, but they are forced to go through phenomenally expensive  regulatory burdens for no good reason.   I can't tell you how many of these small bank and credit union folks  have said to me: Our industry did not cause or have any part in the  financial crisis, but we are being asked to pay the price. That is what  this bill deals with.   In July of 2016, the American Action Forum attempted to estimate the  number of paperwork hours and final costs associated with these rules  and regulations that I am talking about. In total, the forum estimated  that the law had imposed more than $36 billion in final rule costs and  73 million paperwork hours as of July 2016. What does that mean? To put  these figures into perspective, the costs are nearly $112 per person or  $310 per household.   Additionally, it would take 36,950 employees--that is 36,950  employees--working full time to complete a single year of the law's  paperwork based on the agency's calculations themselves.   Our bill is focused on providing meaningful relief to our community  banks and credit unions, helping them to prudently lend to consumers,  home buyers, and small businesses--small businesses that we all  acknowledge are the engines of our economy, yet lack credit and lack  access to capital because of these unnecessary rules. That is why the  first part of the name of this bill is ``economic growth.'' This bill  will provide a needed shot in the arm for our economy across this  country.    By responsibly expanding the qualified mortgage safe harbor,  addressing severe appraiser shortages in rural areas, reducing  superfluous HMDA reporting requirements, and exempting certain loans  from escrow requirements, our bill will ease the compliance and  regulatory reporting requirements borne by many of these small  financial institutions and free up scarce resources for their  communities, enabling more individuals to find a home loan or get the  funding to start a business. And this does not increase financial risk.   A number of local credit unions have weighed in on the positive  impact our bill will have on increasing access to affordable mortgage  credit.   Additionally, had our bill's provisions on a rule called TRID--a 3- day waiting period--had they been in place in 2017, it would have  helped over 1.5 million credit union members at over 3,800 credit  unions throughout the Nation, enabling them to take advantage of a  lower interest rate and to avoid potential delays in the mortgage  origination process. I will tell my colleagues, anybody who has had to  go through the mortgage origination process today knows the paperwork I  am talking about.   Our bill also drastically simplifies the capital regime for certain  highly capitalized community banks compared to the current Basel III  requirements that are more appropriate for larger, sophisticated  financial institutions.   Rebecca Romero Rainey, the former chairman and CEO of Centinel Bank  of Taos and CEO-elect of the Community Bankers of America, made a  commonsense observation. She said:         Under Basel III, community bank capital regulation has       become significantly more punitive and complex. Do we really       need four definitions of regulatory capital, a capital       conservation buffer, and impossibly complex rules governing       capital deductions and adjustments?        Applying the rule to community banks in a one-size-fits-all       manner harms the consumers and businesses we serve.    She added:         I seriously doubt that my grandfather would have founded       Centinel if he had to comply with Basel III and the other new       regulations that exist today.    We want to encourage people to bank in their communities.   Dodd-Frank also dealt with midsized and regional banks, and our bill  does too. Dodd-Frank swept many simple midsized and regional banks into  its enhanced prudential standards, but it was meant for the largest and  most complex institutions. Each new regulation poses a tradeoff between  hiring new employees to help comply with those standards versus  employees to provide customers the products and services they want and  need.   Deron Smithy, executive vice president and treasurer for Regions  Bank, a regional bank based in Alabama, described the implications of  this on his institution, saying, ``We now have more people in our  organization devoted to compliance-related matters than we do for  commercial lending'' and that ``the direct cost, as well as  management's time and attention to meeting these rules, creates a  disproportionate burden on regional banks. Collectively, the  incremental cost of regulatory compliance exceeds $2 billion  annually.'' The $2 billion in costs that Mr. Smithy mentioned were just  the direct costs. Indirect costs include management and other business  units' time being diverted from fully serving their clients.   These are not just empty numbers; behind these numbers are real  economic consequences. That is a fact Mr. Smithy noted in his testimony  before the Banking Committee.         For a company like Regions, that standard being lifted       would likely liberate as much as 10 percent additional       capacity for lending, which--    In his bank's case--       would be $8 billion to $10 billion.        That is capital and access that are not available to       individuals, families, and small businesses in this Nation.       That is one bank.    During another Banking Committee hearing, Robert Hill, CEO of South  State Corporation, a midsized bank, noted that when their institution  crossed the $10 billion threshold, ``South State was impacted by over  $20 million per year, a significant sum for a bank our size. What  impact does that have on our local communities? For us, that equates to  300 jobs. Approximately 10 percent of our branches were closed, and  even more jobs diverted away from lending to regulatory compliance.''   Section 401 of our bill raises the SIFI threshold for applying  enhanced prudential standards from $50 billion to $250 billion--a level  that many, many financial experts have encouraged for years--and the  $10 billion threshold for applying an annual, company-run stress test  to midsized banks while maintaining important safeguards against risks  to the U.S. financial system. This will free up valuable financial and  human resources to help keep more branches open, increase lending to  consumers and small businesses, and lower the cost of borrowing for  consumers.   The bill also deals with housing policy. Our bill provides some  important improvements to HUD programs, making them more effective and  efficient and enabling public housing authorities across the country to  better address the housing needs of their local community.   Our bill enhances HUD's Family Self-Sufficiency Program, which will  enable a greater number of families currently assisted by HUD to obtain  job training, education, childcare, and ultimately achieve financial  independence. Specifically, the bill would broaden the scope of  supportive services that can be offered to these participants,  including home ownership assistance, training in asset management,  obtaining a GED, and education in pursuit of a postsecondary degree or  certification. It would also streamline the administration of the  program, making it easy for local public housing authorities to deliver  it in their communities.  [[Page S1572]]    For the first time ever, our bill will enable many families who live  in privately owned apartments backed by project-based rental assistance  to also participate in the FSS Program.   Our bill would also provide targeted regulatory relief to small  public housing agencies operating in rural communities. While smaller  public housing authorities typically have far fewer staff and resources  than larger urban agencies, they, too, are currently held to many of  the same burdensome regulatory requirements as some of the largest ones  in the country. As a result, this means that more of their time and  money are spent completing paperwork and less are able to be dedicated  to promoting access to affordable housing in these communities.   Our bill would provide tailored regulatory relief that recognizes the  unique challenges faced by smaller public housing authorities in rural  areas. Specifically, it would provide a simpler option for calculating  utilities, simplify environmental review requirements for new  developments, streamline inspection requirements, and make it easier to  coordinate efforts, such as enabling shared waiting lists with  neighboring agencies and enabling neighboring agencies to pool their  resources to develop larger projects.   These changes will set up these small agencies for success and enable  them to direct a greater amount of time, effort, and resources toward  their core mission: promoting access to affordable housing.   The bill is also a consumer protection bill. It ensures that key  consumer protections remain in place and increases protections for  consumers who have fallen on hard financial times or become victims of  fraud.   Following the Equifax data breach, we held two credit bureau  hearings. These hearings demonstrated bipartisan support for some  important measures. The bill provides 1 free year of fraud alerts for  consumers potentially impacted by the Equifax breach or other instances  of fraud. It gives consumers unlimited free credit freezes and  unfreezes during the year. It allows parents to turn on and off credit  reporting for children under 16.   The bill also includes important protections for veterans and senior  citizens. The Department of Veterans Affairs Choice Program provides  veterans non-VA medical care if they can't access care at a VA medical  facility. Unfortunately, the VA Choice Program has been rife with  issues, including delayed payments and misassigned medical bills to  veterans. As a result, veterans have experienced negative credit items  on their reports, which unnecessarily complicates their and their  families' lives.   The largest credit reporting agencies took a step to alleviate this  problem by delaying reporting medical debt on a consumer's credit  report for 180 days, but more can still be done. Our bill goes a step  further by prohibiting medical debt arising from the Choice Program and  other non-VA healthcare providers from being reported to credit- reporting agencies for 1 year and provides veterans a process to  dispute or remove incorrect information already on their reports.   According to a study conducted by MetLife, seniors lose at least $2.9  billion annually in reported cases of financial exploitation. Despite  the prevalence of senior financial fraud, the National Adult Protective  Services Association estimated that only 1 in 44 cases of financial  abuse is ever reported.   Current bank privacy laws make it difficult for the financial  institutions and their employees to report any potential fraudulent  activity without incurring legal liability, and as a result, few cases  of financial abuse are reported. Our bill would give financial advisers  civil liability protection when reporting suspected financial abuse of  seniors. This will empower and encourage our financial service  representatives to identify warning signs of common scams and help stop  financial fraud targeting our seniors.   Now I wish to turn for just a moment--I have gone over some of the  positive benefits and provisions in this bill. I would like to turn for  a moment to the criticisms, because, if my colleagues have been  listening to the attacks, the attacks are that this is an effort to go  help the big banks in America get richer at the expense of poor people.  This is a very common type of attack on almost any proposal to fix a  regulation in the financial system.   One of the things we have heard is that it gives the regulators too  much flexibility to tailor regulations to the size of the institution  being regulated. This bill carefully balances the need to provide  regulators with the appropriate discretion at the technical level,  while imposing specific directions to ensure appropriate tailoring for  Main Street banks and maintaining core supervisory tools for the  largest banks.   Regulators will still be required to ensure that banks operate in a  safe and sound manner and still retain extensive authorities to do so.   The bill also requires regulators to do more to tailor regulations to  ensure that the level of regulation and scrutiny of banks reflects the  potential risks posed by the institutions--something that folks in my  State would say is just common sense.   In the face of all of this, we have talked to a lot of the regulators  themselves to see what they think of the idea, and they are  consistently saying: Let us have the flexibility to regulate  appropriately, and we will do the job. We will ensure that we have  safety and soundness, and we will ensure that we are not putting undue  regulatory burdens on our financial institutions, particularly the  smallest ones.   Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell said:         You know, we really want the most stringent things to be       happening at the systemically important banks--the most       stringent stress tests, in particular--and we want to tailor       or taper, as we go down into less significant, less       systemically important institutions.    Powell added: ``Those banks [below $100 billion] are not systemically  important.   What he meant by that is they don't present systemic risks to the  economy. We should analyze them and regulate them and supervise them in  a more appropriate fashion.   Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Randy Quarles has also  noted the importance of tailoring, saying:         One of the important general themes of regulation is       ensuring that the character of the regulation is adapted to       the character of the institution being regulated, what has       become the word ``tailoring.''        I fully support that, and I think that it's not only       appropriate to recognize the different levels of risk, and       types of risk that different institutions in the system pose,       but that it also makes for better and more efficient       regulation, and efficient regulation allows the financial       system to more efficiently support the real economy.    That is what we are talking about here.         So I do think that we should look very carefully . . . at       tailoring capital regulation and other types of regulation to       the particular character of the institutions that are       regulated, and that includes their size, and that includes       other aspects of the character.    Another critique I have heard is that the bill erodes the power of  stress testing as a supervisory tool. In one way or another, many have  stood on this floor and talked about the need to have this kind of  flexibility, and others have stood on this floor and said it creates a  huge threat to our economy.   We have a hearing each year called the Humphrey-Hawkins hearing when  the Chairman of the Federal Reserve comes and testifies to the Senate  and then to the House. This year, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve  came before the Senate. To ensure that people and Members understood  what this bill does, I asked Chairman Jay Powell: If this bill were to  pass, is it accurate that the Federal Reserve would still be required  to conduct a supervisory stress test for any bank with total assets  between $100 billion and $250 billion to ensure that it has enough  capital to weather economic downturns?   He replied: Yes, it is.   I asked: Is it accurate that the bill's change of the threshold from  $50 billion to $250 billion for enhanced prudential standards does not  weaken oversight of the largest, globally systemic banks?   He said: That is correct.   The Dodd-Frank Act established a $50 billion asset threshold to apply  enhanced prudential standards to banks. Applying enhanced standards  broadly to regional banks with simple business models and low-risk  profiles has had significant consequences in the marketplace. Although  there has been much debate about the appropriate  [[Page S1573]]  level for the threshold, there is bipartisan agreement that $50 billion  is too low, including among Federal Reserve Chairman Powell, former  Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Yellen, former Acting Comptroller  Noreika, and former Comptroller Curry.   Current Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell said: ``Our view has been  that that combination of raising the threshold and giving us the  ability to go below it in cases where needed gives us the tools that we  need.''   Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has said:         We've already said that we would favor some increase, if       Congress sticks with a dollar threshold--that we would       support some increase in the threshold. An approach based on       business model or factors is also a workable approach from       our point of view. Conceivably, some of the enhanced       standards should apply to more firms with lower levels of       assets, and others with higher levels. So I think either type       of approach is something that we could--we could work with       and would be supportive of.    That is the former Chair of the Federal Reserve.   Our bill rightsizes regulations by raising the $50 billion threshold  to $250 billion. Banks with total assets below $100 billion are exempt  immediately from these enhanced standards, while those with between  $100 billion and $250 billion are presumed exempt 18 months after the  bill is enacted unless the Federal Reserve Board determines that they  need to have some additional level of standard applied, and the Federal  Reserve is given full authority to do so. The provision allows the  Federal Reserve to tailor regulations to a bank's business model and  risk profile.   This provision in no way diminishes the effectiveness of prudential  regulations, and it provides the Federal Reserve sufficient regulatory  and supervisory discretion to apply these enhanced standards on any  firm it deems a threat to systemic risk or safety and soundness.   Let me restate that. If you have heard any of the attacks, you have  heard that the Federal Reserve will not be able to adequately regulate  the banks anymore. The past two Chairmen of the Federal Reserve have  said that is not correct, but the bill itself provides that the Federal  Reserve continues to have the authority to apply enhanced standards on  any firm it deems a threat to systemic risk or safety and soundness.   So, again, for those who are attacking the bill, I think their  arguments are unfounded and, frankly, based in an effort to try to  create concern about a risk that does not exist.   This provision also requires the Federal Reserve to apply a periodic  supervisory stress test to banks with between $100 billion and $200  billion in assets, something that is often overlooked by those  commenting on the bill.   I have tried to go over some of the positive aspects of this bill and  explain why its title is Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and  Consumer Protection Act and respond to some of the false, unfounded  attacks on this bill.   This bill does not create any increased risk at the level of  supervision for the megabanks, those that were intended to be the  target of Dodd-Frank when it was adopted, but it does provide increased  support for those community banks and credit unions, and those regional  banks and midsized banks that are being so badly hurt and whose  customers are being so deprived of needed and justified access to  credit and capital. That is what this debate is about.   I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation as we  move forward and help us bring economic growth, regulatory relief, and  consumer protection to all Americans.
