 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Honoring our PACT Act.   The PACT Act will finally expand benefits and comprehensive  healthcare for millions of veterans who have been exposed to toxic  substances while serving their country.   Included in this bill is the Mark Takai Atomic Veterans Healthcare  Parity Act, championed by my dear friend, the late Congressman Mark  Takai, who served his country admirably as a lieutenant colonel in the  Hawaii Army National Guard and as Hawaii's First Congressional District  Representative.   The United States conducted 43 nuclear tests on Enewetak Atoll,  located in the Marshall Islands. In the 1970s, U.S. servicemembers  risked their lives to clean radioactive material from Enewetak Atoll.   Without the PACT Act, veterans who served at Enewetak are not  eligible for much-needed benefits.   I am honored to continue Congressman Mark Takai's legacy by proudly  casting my vote for the Honoring our PACT Act to ensure that we improve  on our sacred obligation to care for our veterans and their families.                            ____________________
