 Mr. President, in January of this year, a former  Democratic  [[Page S1065]]  Senator penned an op-ed urging Democrats to do away with the Senate  tradition of blue slips. This was followed within weeks by an editorial  from the New York Times and an op-ed in the Washington Post making  similar arguments.   While the Democratic chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee has  indicated his desire to maintain the blue slip process, talk of  abandoning blue slips remains concerning, especially given Democrats'  attempt last year to do away with the legislative filibuster, a  mainstay of Senate procedure and a guarantor of minority party  representation.   Blue slips--so-called because they are literally blue slips of paper  requesting perspective on judicial nominees from their home State  Senators--are a longtime Senate tradition. They serve the important  function of ensuring that Senators are consulted about judicial  appointments from their State, and that is particularly relevant when  it comes to nominees to serve as Federal district court judges.   The Founders set up the Senate in such a way as to provide a voice  for States in the national legislature, and Senators continue to  provide a voice for a whole State in a way that a Representative in the  House of Representatives does not simply because he or she only  represents a single district.   State representation is of particular relevance when it comes to the  most numerous type of judicial nominee, and that is Federal district  court judges. Unlike circuit court judges or Supreme Court Justices,  Federal district court judges are responsible for a limited physical  jurisdiction that is entirely contained within a single State, and they  are regularly required to interpret State law as well as Federal law.  Now, given that fact, Senators, as the representatives of their States,  should have a particular say in who will receive a lifetime appointment  to interpret their State's laws.   The Constitution gives the President the power to appoint judges by  and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and the blue slip  process in the Senate encourages Presidents to seek that advice--not to  just send a nominee over to the Senate for consideration and vote but  to actually discuss a nominee with the relevant home State Senators  before sending that name over.   Blue slips also serve as a check on more extreme or problematic  nominees, first, by encouraging the President not to nominate  excessively controversial candidates, and second, by providing a way  for home State Senators to block a nomination for their State if the  President does nominate someone problematic.   Senators of both parties regularly return blue slips for judicial  nominees; in other words, they sign off on the nomination of judicial  nominees who would not be their first choice but whom they recognize as  suitable to sit on the bench. When the nominee in question has problems  beyond just not being a home State Senator's preference, blue slips  have provided a way for Senators of both parties to stop the  nomination.   In the pieces that have come out in support of abolishing the blue  slip process, I have noticed two strands of thought in particular: one,  that things have gotten so partisan that we should just do away with  things that are meant to foster bipartisanship, and two, that doing  away with blue slips is worth it for the political goal to be achieved,  and that is getting more Democratic judicial nominees confirmed.   When it comes to the first, the idea that things have gotten so  partisan that we should just give up and embrace it, I would say that I  think the last solution--the last solution--to increased partisanship  is to abolish measures that promote collaboration and comity.   Now, we have seen a lot of virulent partisanship around here lately,  but the truth is that bipartisanship still exists even though it may  not always receive the same kind of sensational coverage that major  disputes between the parties receive. And anything that promotes  bipartisanship, that encourages Members of both parties to work  together, to listen to each other's concerns, and to compromise when  possible, is a good thing.   But while I may not agree that the solution to increased partisanship  is to just give in to it, I am really troubled by the second idea put  forward by those who want to abolish blue slips: that it is worth  abandoning a significant Senate tradition--a tradition that promotes  compromise, checks unfettered majority power, and serves as a critical  check on the President--for the sake of temporary political gain.   This, of course, is hardly the first time we have seen this attitude  during the Biden administration. We have also seen it displayed with  Democrats' attempt to abolish the legislative filibuster, the Senate  rule that today almost unquestionably does more than anything else to  preserve the Founders' vision of the Senate as a place of stability and  deliberation and a check on the power of faction.    I will be frank. The legislative filibuster can be frustrating in the  extreme. When Republicans were in control of the Senate, we took  multiple votes on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a  piece of legislation that would enshrine what should be the most  commonsense thing imaginable, and that is that a living, breathing  child born after a botched abortion should be granted protection. The  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would have passed without  the legislative filibuster.   So there is no question that the filibuster can stop good legislation  from getting passed just as a blue slip could prevent a good judge from  being confirmed, but that is not a reason to do away with either of  these Senate procedures, and above all, it is not a reason to do away  with the legislative filibuster.   Yeah, the filibuster can be frustrating, and it can certainly be used  to stop good bills, like the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection  Act, but it is a powerful protection against bad legislation. Without  the legislative filibuster, there is very little, if anything, to  prevent terrible legislation from getting passed by an extremely narrow  or even merely technical Senate majority.   The legislative filibuster offers a host of other benefits. It  encourages compromise, it discourages extremism, and it provides a  voice for Americans represented by whatever party is in the minority,  who also deserve representation. The Founders knew that tyranny didn't  just come in the form of individual despots and dictators. They knew  that majorities could be tyrants as well and trample on the rights of  Americans in the minority, and the legislative filibuster helps guard  against that.   So I believe very firmly in the Senate rules and traditions that  preserve the Founders' vision of the Senate as a place of consensus and  deliberation and that help prevent tyrannical majorities from trampling  on rights and representation for members of the minority.   While the legislative filibuster or the blue slip process may prevent  a good piece of legislation from getting passed or a good nominee from  getting confirmed, the alternative--the alternative--which is a system  without meaningful representation for the minority party and the  Americans it represents, without a meaningful check on extreme nominees  or legislation that threatens our constitutional rights is, in fact,  much, much worse.   So before Democrats think about abolishing key Senate protections  against extremism or the tyranny of the majority, I hope they will  consider what things might look like when they are once again in the  minority and they want to stop a nominee or piece of legislation that  they view as dangerous or extreme, and I hope they will decide in favor  of checks and balances in Senate institutions.
