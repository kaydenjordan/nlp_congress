 Mr. Speaker, we continue to see  appalling nursing home negligence nationwide, including my home State  of Pennsylvania.   Last week, my fellow Pennsylvania Republican Members and I joined the  Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis to send a letter to State  Attorney General Josh Shapiro demanding an explanation for Governor  Wolf's deadly decision to readmit COVID-19-positive residents back into  nursing homes.   According to the most recent data, Pennsylvania has suffered 4,539  nursing home deaths related to COVID-19. That is more than 68 percent  of the State's total COVID-19 deaths and more than 3 percent of the  State's entire nursing home population.   The families who have lost loved ones as a result of this reckless  policy deserve answers, they deserve an explanation, and they deserve  closure.   Prior to my being elected to Congress, I spent many years as a  licensed nursing home administrator specializing in long-term care, and  I have been horrified to see this avoidable crisis unfold.   In closing, I would like to thank our frontline employees in nursing  homes. They work so hard to protect the residents. And my sincerest  condolences to the families who are grieving.                            ____________________
