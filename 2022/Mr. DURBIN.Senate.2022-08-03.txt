 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5  minutes.    Mr. President, I hope that my remarks are even less.   I stand in solid support of the accession of Finland and Sweden into  NATO. Just a few weeks ago, I was fortunate enough to visit Lithuania.  It is a country that means a lot to me and my family. I met with the  former President Valdas Adamkus.   Adamkus, a Lithuanian immigrant to the United States, had a  distinguished record in our government's service here and then returned  to Lithuania after his retirement from the U.S. Federal Government and  ran successfully for President.   He had the vision to realize that the future of Lithuania and the  Baltic States was in the European Union and NATO and worked strenuously  to achieve those goals, and I was happy to be joining him in that  effort.   Now, this moment in history really complements his leadership because  the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO is a confirmation that the  Baltic Sea is safer than ever when it comes to the West. If Vladimir  Putin thought that by invading Ukraine he could somehow inhibit the  future of NATO or in some way limit its future, the opposite has  occurred.   NATO is stronger than ever. And the United States' commitment to NATO  is stronger than ever. The fact that only a handful of Senators from  either political party are even questioning the accession of Sweden and  Finland are good indications to me that we have bipartisan support for  this NATO coalition now more than ever--and we should, first, for the  Ukrainians and, secondly, for the United States and its future.   Those who are speaking against the accession of Finland and Sweden  suggest that we ought to focus our attention on Asia. Well, we cannot  ignore Asia. It is an important part of our near-term future. And we  have got to show strength throughout the world. Why don't we start  right now? With this accession of Finland and Sweden, the strengthening  of the NATO alliance says to any adversary of the United States, even  to China and its future, that this country does business with other  countries in the world on an arm's-length basis and a respectful basis  and can deal with democracies in a constructive way in building their  economies for the future.   I will gladly join in the support of the accession of Finland and  Sweden to NATO. I believe it not only strengthens that alliance when it  comes to this war in Ukraine, it prepares us for challenges in the  future, and it is the right thing for America's security.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) and  the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Merkley) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) and  the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Merkley) are necessarily absent.    Reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, I have read and reread the Senator from  Kansas's resolution. As best I can determine, it is a declaration of  war. For that reason, it should be taken very seriously. He says, in  the earliest stages of the preamble, to express the sense of the Senate  regarding the constitutional right of State Governors to repel the  dangerous ongoing invasion at the U.S. southern border.   The operative language at the end of his resolution on this  decoration of war relates to a provision in the Constitution which is  rarely quoted. It is section 10 of article I. I would like to read it  into the record. It says:         No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any       Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of       Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another       State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless       actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not       admit of delay.    I am trying to understand the thinking of the Senator from Kansas,  but here is the best I could come up with. He says that what is  happening at the southern border with our immigration issues is, in his  words, ``actual invasion of the United States.'' And then goes on to  say:         Governors of all 50 States possess the authority and power       as Commander in Chief of their respective States to repel the       invasion described in paragraph 2.    So as best I can determine, the Senator from Kansas is suggesting  that each Governor has the power to initiate military action. It  doesn't say who the enemy will be or who the target will be. But  according to this provision in the Constitution, these Governors can  enter into compacts with other States for this military action or with  a foreign power.   I don't know if the Senator from Kansas has thought this through,  this idea that the State of Kansas would team up with the State of  Arizona and declare war on Nicaragua. Is that what he is thinking  because Nicaraguans are presenting themselves to the border? I would  suggest that I have never seen a declaration of war that calls on the  States to take such action, and the only time--the only precedent in  our history was a sad one that involved the Civil War in the United  States.   I don't know if the Senator is anticipating similar State action-- State by State or combination of States--attacking a foreign power. For  that reason and many others, I object.
