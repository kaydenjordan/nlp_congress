 Mr. President, the hour is late, even though you look  like you have a lot of work there to do, sir. I think I am going to be  merciful and keep this short. I want to thank the Senator from Hawaii,  the senior Senator from Hawaii, for his remarks.   I just want to wrap up. We have had multiple speakers now driving  home a number of points. Two of them I just want to reiterate, which is  the fact that as I look at a lot of more moderate and conservative  outlets, from the American Enterprise Institute all the way to the  American Medical Association, that did not support ObamaCare in the  first place, you have this chorus growing of responsible, thoughtful  people who said: Hey, we may want to repeal ObamaCare, but to do it  without putting up a plan and showing the American public what you are  going to replace it with is not only contrary, obviously, to a lot of  the political rhetoric we heard during the campaign season, but it is  against the logic, it is not prudent, it is actually reckless, and it  is going to hurt a lot of people.   This is what we have to understand. I say it is akin to pushing  someone off a ledge and telling them, as they are falling down, that,  hey, we are going to get a plan, don't worry. The problem is, people  are going to get hurt in the interim. The cost of medical care, not  having that kind of business certainty that you need, it is going to  spike markets and make things very difficult.   I just want to say that this body, which I respect--and I am happy to  hear voices like Senator Rand Paul and others on the Republican side  begin to come out and say that we should not be repealing this without  replacing it. I want to offer my gratitude to them because I think  there are a lot of people--I even heard Chuck  [[Page S179]]  Schumer say himself that he is ready to roll up his sleeves and talk  about ways to improve this.   We have heard from the President-elect, saying that he is going to  have a health care system that is better and that costs less. I think  he used the word ``terrific'' to describe what he is going to bring to  the American people.   Well, where is it? Where is the plan? What is the idea? Because there  are too many people right now in our country who are fearful of what  might happen. When I say ``fearful,'' it is a base fear; for example,  some people from my State of New Jersey. This is Martha, who lives in a  town called Montclair--not quite the same town that the Senator from  Hawaii was speaking of before, which I cannot pronounce yet. I hope he  will help me with that. Mahalo; is that right? I am doing all right.   But this young lady from Montclair very dramatically writes:         I want to take a moment to thank you for fighting as hard       as you have to protect those of us who are disabled and       vulnerable to financial ruin, medical crisis, and debt if the       ACA is repealed. I am a psychotherapist in private practice       for over 20 years. I have served my community by keeping one-      third of my caseload no fee or low fee for those who have had       no insurance.        For over 20 years, I have purchased my insurance privately       and paid dearly for my medical coverage. Two months ago, I       was diagnosed with an extremely rare cancer in my central       nervous system. I am fortunate that doctors believe that it       can be controlled, but not cured, by my taking a low dose of       oral chemotherapy for life. I now, as a result of this       condition, have zero chance of being able to afford       reasonable medical coverage purchased from an unregulated       open market.        My life, literally without hyperbole, depends on my being       able to maintain continuity of care and insurance regulations       that eliminate exclusions for preexisting conditions. My       energies are limited due to my illness. So I thank you for       doing all you can to fight for my life and my family. The       idea that people with preexisting conditions aren't       contributing to the economic health of our country is a       distortion. I personally address gaps in our health care       system as a provider by sliding my scale.        The safety net is us, and if I lose my health coverage and       can no longer afford it, I will no longer be able to afford       to devote one-third of my caseload to those who cannot afford       it. It becomes a profound domino effect.    That is where we are right now. I have heard so many of my  colleagues, Republican and Democratic, speak to the things they like  about ObamaCare or at least they like in the abstract, not giving  ObamaCare any credit. They like the fact that people with preexisting  conditions can get insurance. They like this idea that there will be no  lifetime caps. That means that a child who might have leukemia and  beats it and then becomes an adult can't find insurance because nobody  wants to insure him because they have exceeded these ideas of lifetime  caps. They have gotten rid of this idea that you cannot stay on your  parent's insurance just because you have turned 23, 24. Now you can do  it until you are 26. There are so many aspects of ObamaCare that people  say they like. One thing that even Republican Governors talk about  liking is just the idea of Medicaid expansions that have occurred in 32  States and have enabled millions of Americans, hard-working families,  their children, people living in nursing homes, those who suffer from  addiction, and the poor and the underserved, to get access to quality  health care.   That is what is incredible. We have people who are coal miners and  sick who have benefited from this. We have folks who are in nursing  homes who have benefited from this. We have folks who are suffering in  this opioid crisis with addictions who have been able to get access to  coverage and access to care. More than this, we have now created a  system that equates and understands that mental illness and physical  illness is in parity--that insurance companies have to offer that as  well.   In addition to all of that, we now have a system that says to anybody  that you cannot be denied for the kind of reasons you were denied  before and find yourself falling into the trap that so many Americans  did; that the No. 1 reason--or at least one of the top reasons people  were declaring bankruptcy was because they could not afford their  medical bills. These are all things that are universally--or at least  the overwhelming majority of Americans want.   So we all agree on many of the basic goals. The question is, How do  get there? It has been indicated by the President-elect and others that  they have a plan to get there, to preserve all of these things that are  now being savored by Americans, that are literally, as Martha from  Montclair points out, saving people's lives. The question is, How are  you going to get there? By the way, if you try to shortcut it and don't  tell us how you are going to get there and just repeal ObamaCare, then  you introduce uncertainty to the market. Insurance companies are  speaking up. The American Medical Association is speaking up. The  American Diabetes Association is speaking up. The American Cancer  Society is speaking up. All of these nonpartisan or maybe even  conservative folks are speaking up, saying: You can't do the repeal  unless you put forward what you are going to replace it with.    Free market folks know you don't introduce uncertainty into the  markets without consequences, and those consequences would be a  disruption to the individual marketplace, the spiking of prices, people  pulling out, and that death spiral.   I believe in the prudence of this body. I have seen it from people on  both sides of the aisle--the thoughtfulness that they won't rush to  embrace a pure political victory at the expense of real people. Well,  this is one of those moments.   What are we going to do as a body? Are we going to repeal and not  replace? Or are we going to have a great discussion about what that  replacement will be?   So tonight we have heard from a lot of my colleagues. I am really  proud that folks have taken to the floor. I am even more proud that,  from my office, we are hearing from people on both sides of the  political aisle. Not everybody likes ObamaCare. Not everybody voted  Democratic. It is people from both sides of the aisle. They do not  understand why we would rush forward doing the repeal without the  replace.   I want to thank everybody who has spoken tonight. The hour is late,  and I just want to thank a lot of the folks who don't normally keep  these kinds of hours. There are some pretty incredible people who work  up around the President's desk.   We have a lot of pages here who do not get enough thanks on both  sides--Republican pages and Democratic pages. I want to thank them, as  well, for staying late, even though, technically--and I hate to call  them out on this--if they have to stay up past 10 p.m., they don't have  to necessarily do their homework and show up for school the next day.  That is what I hear. So we might have done you a favor. But either way,  I want to thank everybody tonight.   Mr. President, I want to suggest the absence of a quorum.   Oh, I am sorry. I want to--what do I want to do? I want to just drop  the mic.
