 Madam Speaker, I stand today and rise in the  strongest support for the Build Back Better Act, the most  transformational investment in everyday Americans in generations.   I rise in support of the largest effort to combat climate change in  American history.   I rise in support of the largest expansion of affordable health  coverage for Americans as well as the highest investment in housing.   I rise in support of women, who will be able to go back to work  because they will have childcare, and their children will be able to  have universal preschool.   I rise in support of the American people and seniors, who have been  waiting for too long for more home care, and the workers will be able  to see an increase in wages for caregiving.   I am so proud to stand today for the American people, the middle  class, who have been waiting so long for finally getting to see the  Build Back Better Act.
