 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate two incredible  teams whose hard work, determination, and teamwork have made their mark  in Boston's storied championship history.   For the first time in the program's history, the Dorchester Eagles  14U team are Pop Warner national champions. Not to be outdone, the  Boston Lady Raiders won the Bantam Division Cheer National  Championship.   These young men and women have been playing and cheering together for  years, and this hard-won championship is all the more sweeter after  coming up just short in last year's tournament.   They rallied around their teammates, recommitted to their sport, put  in the work day in and day out, no matter what the New England weather  could throw at them, and proved themselves to be the best of the best.   Your Congresswoman is proud of you.   Congratulations to the entire Metropolitan Pop Warner League, Coach  Terry Cousins, the families and friends, and most of all, the athletes  who were already champions in our community but now have the trophy and  national recognition they so richly deserve.   Let the Congressional Record reflect the Dorchester Eagles and Boston  Lady Raiders are the 2023 national champions. Congratulations.                            ____________________
