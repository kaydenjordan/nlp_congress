 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R.  2726, the VA FOIA Reform Act.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chair Takano and Ranking Member Bost for  bringing this bill to the floor and Representative Murphy for co- leading this important legislation with me.   The bill is a simple, bipartisan measure to improve efficiency and  transparency at the VA.   As we all know, transparency is critical in ensuring that the VA is  serving our veterans as effectively as possible. Veterans, their  caregivers, VSOs, and the public all deserve easy and timely access to  information about veteran care, VA performance, and other data when  requested.   Unfortunately, VA currently has among the worst backlogs of Freedom  of Information Act requests across Federal agencies. Among these  backlogged requests are inquiries about VA performance and decisions,  as well as requests from veterans for their own personal records.   My bill will ensure that the VA takes concrete steps to reduce its  FOIA backlogs so that these veterans get answers. It also calls for the  National Archives and Records Administration to review VA's FOIA  process.   Finally, the bill requires the VA to analyze the root causes of its  FOIA backlog and to identify technology needs and procedural  improvements that will increase efficiency in responding to requests.   This straightforward bill is a commonsense step toward improving the  flow of information from the VA to all the stakeholders it serves.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support it today, and I  look forward to working to get it signed into law.
