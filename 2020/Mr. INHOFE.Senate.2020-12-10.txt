 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I sound a little redundant here because we  have been talking about this bill for a long time now, for several  months. People don't realize how long it takes to get a defense  authorization bill all the way through the system. There is no doubt in  my mind that this is the most important bill of the year, every year,  and the importance, I think, is pretty well demonstrated by the fact  that we have successfully passed a defense authorization bill every  year for 60 years. And I feel we will do the same thing. It could be  today, it could be tomorrow, but nonetheless, it is a bill that has to  pass.   Now, when President Trump came into office 4 years ago, we had a  problem. He inherited a military that had serious problems. In fact,  during the last 4 years of the previous administration--that would have  been 2010 to 2015--the President depleted the budget or reduced the  budget for military by 25 percent.   I don't say that really critically of President Obama because he had  different priorities. He was up-front about it and didn't consider this  to be high enough of a priority. Now, the sad thing about this is that  at the same time that he was reducing our military spending by 25  percent, Russia was increasing theirs threefold and China's was  increased by 83 percent. So we dropped ours by 25 percent, and at the  same time, China increased theirs 83 percent. That is really serious.  [[Page S7389]]    People have this assumption that America has the best of everything  and that we don't have any problem out there, but we do, and we found  several systems where they were actually getting ahead of us. So,  working with Congress, we passed the NDAA appropriations bill. We  secured nearly $3 trillion in funding for our Nation's defense. This  year alone, the administration will provide more than $740 billion for  resources our military needs to keep our country and our troops safe.   The fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act cements  President Trump's hard work to restore our military to be the best  fighting force. That is what we are supposed to be doing in America.  The NDAA authorizes critical investments to protect our military  advantage across all domains, from the skies to the seas and even now  through space, a whole new program.   With the President's leadership last year, the NDAA created the Space  Force. It is the first time there has been a new branch since 1947, and  that happened this year. This year's NDAA makes sure that it is set up  successfully.   One of the things about the Space Force that I think people who are  somewhat critical of--we were doing a good job in space before without  the Space Force, but the fact that we can concentrate all those efforts  in one force and be on equal footing--because that is exactly what our  primary problem is out there with China and Russia. They both have what  would be in their interpretation a space force, so it was important  that we did, too, and that was the right thing to do.   This also authorizes the procurement of 93 F-35s, the Joint Strike  Fighters, to continue the rebuilding of our overworked combat aircraft.  It also includes authorizations for C-130J aircraft, which will  modernize our fleet, used for transportation of personnel and also for  refuelers and things that we have to do in the military. That is an  upgrade of the old version. The J model of the C-130 is a great  vehicle. We have to have it authorized and all of the priorities set.  That is what this bill does.   We also have authorized the procurement of nine new battle force  ships, including the Virginia-class submarines. We talked about that  for a long time, and now we are finally doing that.   Another area that we have been doing is our nuclear forces. Our  President has been a champion for our nuclear modernization efforts-- and for good reason. Our nuclear deterrent is the cornerstone of our  national security. The NDAA ensures that our Nation wields a safe and  reliable nuclear deterrent by authorizing the resources needed to  modernize.   Now, we didn't do this for a long period of time. We fell behind.  This bill is reversing that, and we are getting back into the  competition--the nuclear competition. That is where the real threat is.  Everybody knows that.   I think having the best weapons and equipment is critical, to be  sure, but we also need the infrastructure and manpower to support it.  Over the past several years, Congress has provided the military with  significant funding increases and authorizations to begin and continue  critical military construction projects overseas, as well as in our  country.   These military construction projects can be found everywhere--from  Arkansas to South Carolina, Oklahoma to California, and Missouri to  Massachusetts, and all across the country. These investments will also  build on our improvements to family housing.   I have heard people complain about what we do for the military in  this country, and they try to say that we are spending more on our  military than both China and Russia put together. Yeah, that is true,  but there is a reason for that, and the reason for that is that the  most expensive thing in building a military is individuals--what we are  spending on individuals, on housing, and on all these things.   Now, when you are dealing with it, and looking at Communist  countries, and you look at Russia and you look at China, they don't  take care of their people. They don't have that expense, and that is  why we spend more than they do. You know, just in the last 2 years,  what we have done to improve housing for our troops--troops and their  families--other people don't do that, but we do it. So that is why it  is so significant that we do this.   I have a concern that I would like to share, and I hesitate to do  this because it will take a little bit of time. People out there don't  realize, in a bill like this, what all goes into it. I looked at the  people who are heading this thing up, and, yesterday, Senator Reed  talked about the Democrats and the Republicans and their staff people,  who worked so hard. Let me say this: We could not have done this  without the cooperation and the love that we have for each other, with  Senator Reed. I mean, he heads up the minority, and I head up the  majority, and we want, together, to make sure we have the best product  in the world and that we get the best of everything for our troops in  the field.   So I want to really single out Senator Reed for all the work that he  has done. He has been a great partner and friend throughout this  process. And we want to thank our colleagues in the House also-- Congressman Smith and Congressman Thornberry. We all worked together.   You know, I have been involved in a lot of these things, and they  always end up in the Big 4. That is where you have the leading Democrat  and Republican in the House and Democrat and Republican in the Senate,  insofar as defense is concerned, and we iron these things out. But in  the meantime, this long bill is one that has taken just a lot of work.  And I know that, yesterday, Senator Reed got a chance to mention the  names of and show his appreciation for the Democrats that worked in the  minority, and I want us to do the same thing for the Republicans in the  majority.   John Bonsell--I don't think there is a person in Washington, DC, who  knows more about the military than John Bonsell does. And he put  together a group of people. These are all experts. They all work--you  know, people don't understand this, but I am talking about weekends,  Sundays, times that they have to work to get these things done and to  get that bill into position, because you have to pass it through the  Senate, and you have to go onto the Senate floor. Then you have to go  to the House and the House committee and the House floor, and then you  have to have a conference.   There are some things in this bill that we avoided having--and I am  thankful that we did, quite frankly--that the House wanted and the  Senate didn't want. We were able to iron out these differences and get  them done. But to do that, we had to work long hours. I can assure you  that the staff worked a lot longer hours than I did.   So I single these people out as really experts, and I want to show  them appreciation, and I am just going to read them off to you here:  John Bonsell. We know about John Bonsell. We know what he has done. He  has been with me since he was, years ago, stationed at Fort Sill in my  State of Oklahoma. He has been with me, and he has been heading up this  group and putting the group together.   This group consists of: John Wason, Tom Goffus, Stephanie Barna, Greg  Lilly, Marta Hernandez, Rick Berger, Jennie Wright, Adam Barker, Adam  Trull, Al Edwards, Sean O'Keefe, Brad Patout, Jason Potter, Katie  Sutton, Eric Trager, TC Williams, Otis Winkler, Gwyneth Woolwine, Katie  Magnus, Leah Brewer, Debbie Chiarello, Gary Howard, Tyler Wilkinson,  John Bryant, Griffin Cannon, Keri-Lyn Michalke, Soleil Sykes, Brittany  Amador, and Jillian Schofield   Now, these people, they are just names to a lot of other people, but  each one has just really performed long and hard hours. There has been  more staff work go into this bill than any other bill that is before  us, than anytime year round.   So I just appreciate so much the hard work that has gone there, and  we will pass this bill. It is one that if we don't pass it, we are not  going to give the resources necessary for our kids in the field to have  the safety that we can provide them and to have the equipment.   We want to get to the point where we have the very best of everything  out there, and right now, we don't. China and Russia are knocking at  our door. We have to do a better job than we have done in the past, and  I am going to be working with the administration to do everything we  can for the coming  [[Page S7390]]  year. But right now, we need to get caught up and go ahead and pass  this.   This bill is the roadmap for the next year, and that is why this is  important. So I encourage all of us to do what we have to do to get  this bill done--hopefully, today, but definitely by tomorrow. I believe  that will happen because people do care about our troops. There is no  one more deserving in America than our troops who are out there in  harm's way, and we are going to make sure that we do the right thing  for them.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the  remarks of the next speaker, I may be recognized for such time as I may  consume.    Mr. President, I have already asked unanimous consent  that I be recognized for such time as I may consume.   This is what I want to do. Something happened today that is deeply  troubling to me, and I have a written response to what happened today.  I am going to go ahead and read that written response. Then, I want to  talk about it.   My written response is--and I will take it so everybody will have the  benefit of this. I am talking about people here in this country, people  in Africa, people all around the world who are interested in this  issue.   OK, this is the written response:         I think that all countries should recognize Israel, and       applaud the president's unprecedented efforts to foster       recognition between Israel and Arab nations through the       Abraham Accords.        Today's White House announcement alleging Morocco's       sovereignty over Western Sahara is shocking and deeply       disappointing. I am saddened that the rights of the Western       Saharan people have been traded away.        In 1966, as West Africa was being decolonized, the UN       General Assembly agreed--    This is 1966--agreed the Sahara deserves a referendum of self- determination for its own future.       The United States has supported this policy for decades and       has worked to accomplish a referendum of self-determination.       Until today, this Administration had continued our long       history, one that has remained consistent across       administrations--    Democrat and Republican--       We're not alone in this position: the African Union, the       United Nations, the International Court of Justice and the       European Union have all agreed--the Sahrawi people have the       right to decide [what] their own future [is going to be].        The president has been poorly advised by his team; he could       have made this deal without trading [away] the rights of a       voiceless people.        During my most recent visit to the Sahrawi refugee camps, I       visited with the children that live there. They were joyous,       happy, ordinary children who didn't know yet that they were       part of a frozen, forgotten conflict where their hopes and       freedoms were dying a cruel death.        I'm thinking about them and all the Sahrawians today. I       won't stop fighting for them. I won't let the world forget       them.        Today's announcement does not change the United Nations or       the EU positions, nor the charter of the African Union nor       the opinion of the [International Court of Justice]--a       referendum must still happen.        I urge these organizations to stand strong to support       Western Sahara's right to self-determination and am confident       the [United States] will be able to return to the policy       we've held since 1966.    Let me tell you what this is all about. During the colonization  period in Africa, when different countries had colonies there, Spain  had the colony of the land that is in question today. It was called the  Spanish Sahara area at that time.   Now, if you remember your history, Franco was President at that time,  and this was back when things were falling apart for Spain. Franco was  losing a lot of the control, and they were not in a position to hold  onto their colonies--not just in Africa but anyplace else in the world.   So at that time, the U.N. came in, in 1966. This goes all the way  back to 1966. The U.N. asked for a referendum for self-determination  for those people. So they recognized all the way back--that is, the  United Nations recognized--the sovereignty of the Western Saharan  people. That has been consistent since then.   That was 1966. Now, in 1975, when there were a lot of people kind of  lining up to see who could get control, Morocco jumped in with all of  their resources and did all they could at that  [[Page S7409]]  time to capture that area and to absorb that within Morocco--in other  words, to take away from the free people of Western Sahara their land.  And they did that.   So the International Court of Justice went on to say: Well, if the  United Nations couldn't do it, let's at least give them the right for a  referendum for self-determination. That was 1975. Immediately after  that, Morocco invaded Western Sahara.   Now, you have to keep in mind that this is Morocco, with all of the  resources and all the wealth that they had, taking on a country that  was armed with crude instruments. These are the people who rightfully  owned and have lived in Western Sahara.   Western Sahara, if you look--if I had time, if I had known about  this, I would have brought the charts down to show where this land was  and where it is today.   But, in 1975, the International Court of Justice made it very clear  that they had the right to the territory--that Morocco had no right to  the territory of Western Sahara. Now, they invaded Western Sahara.  Spain and France were complicit at that time. Spain had already  colonized that area, and France had desires to do that.   But today--today, as we speak today--there is not a country out there  that recognizes the right of Morocco over Western Sahara--until today,  when this statement came out that we are trying to recognize those  rights.   Nobody--now, I am talking about what I have already listed, all of  the people: the African Union, the United Nations, the International  Court of Justice, the European Union--all of them--they recognize  Sahrawi as the people who have the right to decide their own future.  Everyone is in agreement.   I can remember talking, at one time, to Netanyahu over in Israel and  explaining to them why Morocco should not be able to trade and somehow  get control of land that they are not entitled to in order just to say:  We recognize Israel.   Yes, we want all Arab nations to recognize Israel, and this is  something this President has done. But this is the area that involves  not just two countries, Morocco and Israel. It is all of the countries  in Africa, virtually everybody in East and West Africa and all the  surrounding area. They all agree that that is the territory of Western  Sahara and that they should have a referendum of self-determination.    We all have agreed with that for years. We are talking about back to  1966. Everyone is in agreement that they are the ones who are entitled  to that.   So in 1991 they had a ceasefire, and a mission began to provide a  referendum for self-determination. That was the United Nations and  virtually everybody else. Everyone was in agreement on that. Certainly,  it was initiated from the United Nations, and that was to have a  ceasefire in 1991, by the U.N., and work toward a self-determination.   Then, in 2004, the United States and Morocco signed a free-trade  agreement. Now, this is kind of interesting, because this is a joint  effort between our country, the United States, and Morocco for a free- trade agreement. In that free-trade agreement, they agreed to  explicitly exclude Western Sahara because Morocco does not have  sovereignty over it. Now, that was in the agreement in 2004 that was  signed by both the United States and Morocco. So they agreed at that  time, as everyone else did, that that should be an independent country  with the right of self-determination.   Then the African Union came along. So far, you have the United  Nations. You have the United States and Morocco in a signed free-trade  agreement. But then you also had Morocco, when it joined the AU,  signing a document. This is when it came from the African Union. They  recognized Western Sahara as its own country. This is the African  Union.   Now, we are talking about 52 nations in the African Union that all  agree on this. No one is in disagreement on this.   And then Morocco, when it joined the AU, signed a document. When they  joined the African Union--we are talking about Morocco now, up on the  northeast edge of that territory. When they joined the AU, or the  African Union, they signed a document acknowledging all member states  and their borders; that is, acknowledging the Western Sahara area as  not a part of Morocco. Now, this is Morocco agreeing to this.   So you have the United Nations in 1991. You have the United States  and Morocco in the free-trade agreement in 2004. You have an agreement  explicitly stating where the lines should be. Then you have the African  Union coming along and recognizing. This is all of the countries, 52  nations in the African Union. So we have all of them in agreement with  this.   South Africa is the present chair of the AU, and one of their  priorities is to resolve the Western Sahara issue.   Now, all of that happened prior to today. And, as I say in my written  statement, I really believe--I know our President has a big heart. I  have argued for him and to benefit him. The various times that we have  had conflicts out there--and one of them was when they came out with a  statement that they were going to immediately--this was a couple of  years ago--move the people out of Germany and move them back to the  United States; that that was going to be done before the end of the  year. And I made the public statement. That was not the President  talking. That was a policy that came out of the White House, and I  seriously doubted that he even knew about it and certainly would not  agree with it.   If there is one thing the President is compassionate about, it is the  families. You can't just uproot the families who were stationed in  Germany and move them back to the United States--kids in school and all  these things. He is a compassionate person. He is the first one in line  to take care of our troops every time there is a problem.   This is the same situation. In this case, he is not the type of  person that would bag the freedom-loving people of Western Sahara to  Morocco.   So that is what happened. This is an old issue. It dates back to  1966. I can remember--and this is highly unusual--as a Member of the  U.S. Senate, there was a hearing in the House--this is about maybe 5 or  6 years ago--and I served. I asked to be a witness in that hearing.   The hearing was about Western Sahara and Morocco. Now, keep in mind  that Morocco is a very wealthy country. Virtually every lobbyist in  Washington is paid by them. At that time, I could remember standing  there in that hearing, in the House of Representatives, and listening  to all the lobbyists that they had hired against a country that didn't  have any money.   They don't have, really, any formal armaments. They are heroic  people. They are fighters. They want to continue to fight for their  freedom, but they don't have the resources.   So this is way back then, and I pointed out that Morocco has used all  of their wealth to try to get the land that justly belongs to Western  Saharan people. So that is not anything new. That has been happening  for a long time.   At that time, I remember I took the transcript at that time--I think  it was 6 or 7 years ago--in that hearing. I said that Morocco owns  every lobbyist in Washington, DC, and it is kind of the giant out there  against this small group of people who are being thrown out of their  land that they justly own.   It is self-determination. Who can fight and argue against self- determination? Certainly, our President is not the type of person who  would fight against self-determination. He would be for self- determination. That is the kind of person he is. That is why this  thing--I just think it is some poor advice from some advisers that  threw in that thing.   As I said in my formal statement, he could have done that with them  without giving away the rights and the land of the Western Saharan  people.   So I just want to make sure that everyone knows that this is--I  strongly support everything that this President has successfully been  doing in bringing the Arab world into the Israeli world and doing  something for peace in the Middle East.   Everybody else has tried. Every Democrat and Republican President I  can think of, in memory, has tried to do this and has not been  successful, until this President did it.   It is just, in this case, I don't think it was necessary to give  away--to stand up the people, the just people in an area where they  don't have any resources. They have been living in the  [[Page S7410]]  desert. Three generations now have come and gone, and all of them know  that at one time there was peace and they owned their land and that day  would come that they would get their land back. That hasn't happened  yet.   I think with this mistake that was made, it is certainly not in the  interest of all of our friends. I say that without any exceptions. They  are all on our side on this thing. Our policy has been clear since  1966, and we have been committed.   Some time ago, 1994, I came from the House to the Senate, and I had a  long visit at that time with Jim Baker, who had been the Secretary of  State in the previous administrations. I called him up, and I said: You  know, this is such a huge injustice, what has happened, what Morocco  has done to these people of Western Sahara.   He said: You are right, and we have done everything.   I said: We have got to change that, and I am going to make that  commitment.   This was back in 1994.   He said: Well, I admire you for doing it. I will do all I can to  cooperate with you.   This is Jim Baker talking.   He said: I don't think you will be able to do it because they have  too many resources, too much money, and the Western Saharan people  don't have any money. They don't have any resources. And they are the  ones who have been abused in this.   He said: Good luck. I will do everything I can to help you.   That was back when Jim Baker was Secretary of State. That was a long  time ago. Since that time, every administration--and not just  Republican administrations but Democratic administrations--have all  been lined up saying: This is a sense of fairness. It is something that  has to be corrected. We can't allow that giant to take over the  righteous people.   And that is what has happened. So it is not over yet. I can assure  you that I will make every effort I can to make sure that we go back to  the policy that we had and that ultimately we will achieve. Maybe this  will be just the thing. This shock treatment for the American people  and for people around the world might be just the thing that is going  to offer them an opportunity for a referendum for self-determination.  Who can be against a referendum for self-determination? Certainly no  Americans whom I know of.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
