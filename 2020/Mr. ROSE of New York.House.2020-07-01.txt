 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.   And, quite frankly, I am dumbfounded. You are aware that this  conversation is in public. So I won't put words in your mouth, but I  will use your own words.   You say today you don't want to consolidate wealth amongst the few.  What do you think your tax scam did?   This is about workers.   You say you are worried about deficit spending. Hallelujah. Suddenly  you are worried about it. You weren't worried about deficit spending  when it came to endless wars. You weren't worried about deficit  spending when it came to a tax scam.   This conversation is in public. You don't get to go back to your  districts now and say you are on the side of workers.   But whose side are you on? Because there is one thing this amendment  will do. It will boost corporate profits, it will put money in the  hands of billionaires, and it will rip off workers.   So today out in public, you reveal yourselves * * *. We are going to  make sure that people remember this.    * * * .    I would like to say that my colleagues across  the aisle----    No. * * *.    I did not mean any disrespect if I caused that.  All right?    Yes, of course.    I am sorry I offended anybody and I withdraw.   Thank you again.
