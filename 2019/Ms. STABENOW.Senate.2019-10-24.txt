 Mr. President, today I wish to pay special  tribute to the more than 580,000 Michigan residents who have proudly  served in our Nation's Armed Forces.   For as long as Michigan has been a State and even before, our people  have heard the call to serve and bravely stepped up. From the War of  1812 to Vietnam, from the Civil War to today's fight against terrorism,  time and again the people of Michigan have proudly worn the uniform and  proven their deep sense of patriotism.   Sergeant Don Burgett of Howell was one of these people. His story  really could be a major motion picture.   Imagine landing in Normandy on D-day as a 19-year-old, parachuting  into the Netherlands for Operation Market Garden, fighting behind  German lines for 72 days, surviving the Battle of the Bulge, and  helping to capture Hitler's retreat in Germany.   Sergeant Burgett lost two rifles when they were shot out of his  hands, was wounded three times, and wrote four highly acclaimed books  about his experience, one of which received rave reviews from both  President Dwight D. Eisenhower and historian and author Stephen E.  Ambrose.   Of 200 soldiers in his original company, only 11 made it home.  Sergeant Burgett was very lucky--and so was Michigan. He returned to  Howell and kept on serving his fellow veterans and his community as an  active member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion,  Disabled American Veterans, and the Military Order of the Cooties. He  passed away in 2017 at age 91.   I was so honored to champion the legislation that renamed the Howell  Post Office after Sergeant Burgett and to be there during the renaming  ceremony this past June. It was touching to see just how big of an  impact one veteran can have on an entire community.   Sergeant Burgett isn't alone. His story is just one of so many  examples all across Michigan of veterans serving their communities.   Whether it is North Oakland VFW Post 334 donating more than $13,000  to the VFW National Home for Children in Eaton Rapids, which serves the  children and families of veterans; or the Grand Haven American Legion  Squadron 28's annual Salmon Boil Dinner, which supports local charities  and events, including Boys and Girls State; or Amvets members hiking 22  miles from Howard City to Big Rapids to bring awareness to veterans  suicide and to connect veterans with services and support  organizations; or Disabled American Veterans in Detroit hosting a job  fair to help veterans and their spouses find jobs with employers who  understand their sacrifice; or the Student Veterans of America  University of Michigan chapter's dedication to volunteering, including  at Food Gatherers Community Kitchen in Ann Arbor, when Michigan  veterans hang up their military uniform, they often put on another,  whether as coach, teacher, police officer, paramedic, firefighter,  elected official, or community volunteer. These patriots understand  that service isn't something you do just once. Instead, it is a way of  living, and this way of living benefits us all.   Today and every day, we salute Michigan's veterans and thank them for  their service, both in our military and in our communities. They truly  are what makes America great. Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to  someone who spent his career in service to others, from his Flint  neighbors, to communities across the country, to people around the  world, someone whom I was proud to call my friend.   William S. White may not have been a native of Michigan--he was born  in Cincinnati in 1937--but he was Michigan through and through, and his  devotion to serving the people of his adoptive State was truly  inspiring.   Bill earned his bachelor of arts from Dartmouth University in 1959,  his master's degree in business administration from the Tuck School of  Business the next year, and then spent 2 years in the Army. During that  time, he also had the good sense to fall in love with and marry a  Michigander, Claire Mott of Flint, whose grandfather, Charles Stewart  Mott, cofounded General Motors and created the Charles Stewart Mott  Foundation.   Claire's father, C.S. Harding Mott, was impressed by Bill's hard work  and business skills. He brought him on as a consultant to help  modernize the foundation in the wake of the Tax Reform Act of 1969.  Bill did that job so well that, by 1971, he was named vice president  and secretary of the foundation and elected to its board of trustees.   Over the years, Bill's role grew and so did the foundation. What  started out as a small organization that mainly supported local causes  in southeastern Michigan became a philanthropic powerhouse, a $3  billion foundation that is internationally recognized for its good work  around the globe.   That's not all Bill's doing, of course; he was fortunate to be  supported by his wonderful family and an amazing team. However, Bill  possessed a number of qualities of leadership that helped make the Mott  Foundation what it is today.   Bill was creative. He was willing to think big and take big risks to  solve big problems. Offering $5 million to help launch the Federal  Government's 21st Century Community Learning Centers initiative sounded  crazy at the time, but Bill saw a need and a way to meet it. Today,  this program provides 1.7 million children every year with activities  that strengthen their academic skills to help them succeed in the  classroom and beyond.   Bill was compassionate. I know just how hard the Flint water crisis  hit him and how hard he worked to help his hometown recover. He showed  that same heart whether providing families with access to clean  drinking water, promoting peace and reconciliation in post-apartheid  South Africa, supporting our Nation's Historically Black Colleges and  Universities, protecting our Great Lakes, or helping Gulf Coast  communities rebuild after Hurricane Katrina.   Above all, Bill was dedicated. He served as chairman of Mott's board  of trustees until the day he died. And just 2 days before, he gave an  emotional speech at the Council of Michigan Foundations' annual  conference inspiring philanthropic leaders to keep doing good works and  sharing their successes.  [[Page S6155]]    ``Tell your stories,'' he implored them. ``Tell people what your  passion is. Tell them what your results are. Tell your stories. Get out  there, and tell them.''   Bill had passion, and Bill got results. His story will live on in the  foundation he built, the lives he touched, and all of the good he did.   My deepest condolences go out to everyone who loved him, including  his wife Louise Hartwell, his children and grandchildren, and his many  friends across Michigan and around the world.   Thank you, Bill.                            ____________________
