 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Andy Henry of Prairie County for his impact on the Terry  community while working at the Roy Rogers Saloon.   Andy has spent the last 17 years of his life in Terry. After Andy  graduated high school in Terry, his mom Amelia and her husband, John,  bought the Roy Rogers Saloon. Following that, he began working at the  Saloon. He has been working there since his family took it over, just  under 6 years.   Andy's work at the Saloon brings the community together. Whether it  be a friend or an old elementary school teacher of his, folks from all  over the community come together at the Saloon. He enjoys spending time  with their regulars and making sure the experience at the Saloon is as  pleasant as it can be.   I congratulate Andy on his role in growing and contributing to the  Roy Rogers Saloon. I look forward to seeing that success continue to  grow and enjoying the hometown bar soon.
