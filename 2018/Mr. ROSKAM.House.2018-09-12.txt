 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6690) to establish a smart card pilot program to combat  fraud, waste, and abuse and to protect beneficiary identity under the  Medicare program, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6690         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fighting Fraud to Protect       Care for Seniors Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. MEDICARE SMART CARD PILOT PROGRAM.         Part E of title XVIII of the Social Security Act is amended       by inserting after section 1866E the following new section:       ``SEC. 1866F. SMART CARD PILOT PROGRAM.         ``(a) Implementation.--        ``(1) In general.--Not later than 36 months after the date       of the enactment of this section, the Secretary shall       establish a pilot program (in this section referred to as the       `pilot program') to evaluate the feasibility of using smart       card technology under this title.        ``(2) Smart card technology defined.--In this section, the       term `smart card technology' means the following:        ``(A) Beneficiary smart card.--A machine readable, tamper-      resistant card (in this section referred to as a `smart       card') that includes an embedded integrated circuit chip with       a secure micro-controller (as defined by the National       Institute on Standards and Technology) that enables the       verification and secure, electronic authentication of the       identity of a Medicare beneficiary at the point of service       through a combination of the smart card and a personal       identification number known by or associated with such       beneficiary.        ``(B) Card reader technology.--Information technology that       enables a supplier and provider to authenticate the identity       of a Medicare beneficiary through presentation of such a       smart card and such components, with such authentication to       be reflected through the use of a modifier or in another       appropriate manner, as determined by the Secretary, in the       claims adjudication process.        ``(3) Program design elements.--The pilot program shall be       conducted for a period of 3 years consistent with the       following:        ``(A) Selection of area.--In consultation with the       Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human       Services, the Secretary shall select at least 3 geographic       areas in which the pilot program will operate.        ``(B) Selection of supplier and provider types.--In       consultation with the Inspector General of the Department of       Health and Human Services, the Secretary shall select       supplier and provider types that will be required to       participate in the pilot program (referred to in this section       as `participating suppliers and providers'). In selecting       such supplier and provider types, the Secretary shall--        ``(i) take into account the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse       (as described in section 1866(j)(2)(B)) with respect to the       category of provider or supplier) and other factors as       determined appropriate by the Secretary; and        ``(ii) limit the pilot program to no more than 2,000       suppliers and providers.        ``(C) Supplier and provider hardship exemptions.--The       Secretary shall exempt from participation in the pilot       program a supplier or provider that either--        ``(i) does not have access to card reader technology (as       described in paragraph (2)(B));        ``(ii) does not have sufficient internet access; or        ``(iii) has a low volume (as determined by the Secretary)       of Medicare claims for which payment is made under this       title.        ``(D) Smart card and smart card reader issuance.--        ``(i) Beneficiary smart card issuance.--The Secretary shall       provide for, at no cost, the issuance (and, if necessary,       replacement) of beneficiary smart cards described in       paragraph (2)(A) to all Medicare beneficiaries residing in a       geographic area in which the pilot program is conducted under       subparagraph (A). Information that appears on Medicare cards       used outside the pilot program may appear on the face of the       beneficiary smart card.        ``(ii) Supplier and provider smart card reader issuance.--      At the request of a participating supplier or provider, the       Secretary shall provide for, at no cost, the issuance to such       supplier or provider of smart card hardware and  [[Page H8119]]       software necessary to participate in the pilot program.        ``(E) Information on operation of pilot program.--The       Secretary shall provide participating suppliers and providers       and Medicare beneficiaries who are furnished items and       services by such suppliers and providers, with information on       the operation of the pilot program, including privacy       protections described in subparagraph (I).        ``(F) Access to services outside the pilot program.--        ``(i) Beneficiaries.--Medicare beneficiaries who receive       beneficiary smart cards may receive items and services from       suppliers and providers not participating in the pilot       program.        ``(ii) Suppliers and provider claims.--         ``(I) Suppliers and providers not participating in pilot.--      Suppliers and providers not participating in the pilot       program may submit claims under this title for items and       services furnished without use of smart card technology to       Medicare beneficiaries who receive beneficiary smart cards.        ``(II) Participating suppliers and providers furnishing       services to non-participating beneficiaries.--Supplier and       providers participating in the pilot program may submit       claims under this title for items and services furnished to       Medicare beneficiaries who do not receive beneficiary smart       cards.         ``(G) Clarification on access to services without smart       cards.--In the case of a Medicare beneficiary who receives a       beneficiary smart card and does not present such card at the       time of receipt of items or services from a participating       supplier or provider, the participating supplier or       provider--        ``(i) shall furnish such items or services to such Medicare       beneficiary as if such beneficiary does present such card;        ``(ii) may submit claims under this title for such items or       services; and        ``(iii) shall provide, in accordance with such manner,       process, and timing as specified by the Secretary,       information to the Secretary (through the contractor       described in subparagraph (H)) that such beneficiary received       such a smart card but did not have the smart card at the time       the items or services were furnished.        ``(H) Private sector implementation.--The Secretary shall       select, by using a competitive procurement process in       accordance with the provisions of chapter 1 of title 48, Code       of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations), a       private sector contractor to implement and operate the pilot       program.        ``(I) Privacy protections.--The Secretary shall ensure that       the pilot program complies with applicable Federal laws and       regulations concerning individually identifiable health       information, including the Privacy Act of 1974 and       regulations promulgated under section 264(c) of the Health       Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and such       individually identifiable information shall be exempt from       disclosure under section 552(b)(3) of title 5, United States       Code.        ``(J) Mandatory participation.--Subject to subparagraph       (C), in the case of items or services furnished by a provider       or supplier included in a supplier or provider type selected       under subparagraph (B) in a geographic area selected under       subparagraph (A), payment may only be made under this title       for such items or services during the period of the pilot       program if the provider or supplier is participating in the       pilot program.        ``(K) Prohibition of smart card fees.--No transaction,       utilization, or other fees may be imposed on Medicare       beneficiaries or participating suppliers and providers with       respect to the use of smart cards under the pilot program.        ``(4) Stakeholder input.--        ``(A) In general.--Not later than 6 months after the date       of the enactment of this section, the Secretary shall convene       a panel consisting of stakeholders (including representatives       of providers, suppliers, technology vendors, Medicare       beneficiaries, and claims processing contractors) selected by       the Secretary for purposes of providing input to the       Secretary on the implementation of the pilot program       (including on the selection of areas and participants under       subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (3) and the       development of exemptions and requirements described in such       paragraph).        ``(B) Nonapplicability of faca.--The Federal Advisory       Committee Act shall not apply to the panel convened pursuant       to subparagraph (A).        ``(5) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(A) The terms `supplier' and `provider' have the meanings       given the terms `supplier' and `provider of services' in       subsections (d) and (u), respectively, of section 1861.        ``(B) The term `Medicare beneficiary' means an individual       who is enrolled in the original Medicare fee-for-service       program under parts A and B and is not enrolled in an MA plan       under part C, an eligible organization under section 1876, or       a PACE program under section 1894.        ``(b) Reports to Congress.--The Secretary shall submit to       Congress the following reports:        ``(1) Interim performance report.--Not later than 2 years       after the date the pilot program is implemented, an interim       report on the performance of such program.        ``(2) Final performance report.--Not later than 18 months       after the date of the completion of the pilot program, a       final evaluation on the effectiveness of the pilot program.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 6690, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity to do something together on a  bipartisan basis that can bring a level of confidence to a program that  all of us cherish and all of us want to defend, and that is Medicare.  Medicare is an incredibly popular program. It is a necessary program,  and it is a program that needs all of us to defend it, particularly on  the integrity side.   If Medicare were to ask CMS today what their fraudulent or erroneous  payment rate is, those two numbers together, they would come back and  they would tell them it is about 10 percent. So, in other words, about  $40 billion a year, Mr. Speaker, is going out the door not to benefit  seniors, but it is going out the door either fraudulently or  erroneously.   I thank Mr. Blumenauer from Oregon because, together, we have been  working on this concept which would apply the same type of technology  that we see in so many other parts of the economy right now, and that  is smart card technology, and use it in a Medicare setting. The  proposal is this: Let's try it. Let's see how it works. Let's have a  pilot program.   Toward that end, what we are hoping and the expectation is that the  same types of savings that we have seen in the private sector we will  see in this sector to make sure that seniors are protected, not only  the funds that seniors have come to rely on, but their identities and  so forth.   This is a concept, again, that Mr. Blumenauer and I have worked on.   I thank Chairman Brady for his work on this bill and the attention  that this has gotten on a bipartisan basis.                                time  1500    I think it is particularly interesting to note that AARP has weighed  in very strongly in favor of it. Let me just read one quick snapshot  from a letter that they sent to Mr. Blumenauer and me at the end of  August, and I will just give you a couple of sentences.   ``While the new cards are more secure than before, `smart cards'  could provide even greater security, and have the potential to contain  useful health information and facilitate care. If enacted, this pilot  program would also help Medicare learn more about the beneficiary  engagement and education. This technology deserves to be tested and  evaluated.''   Mr. Speaker, in a nutshell, this is a proposal to create a pilot  program. I urge its passage, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                        Committee on Ways and Means,                                        House of Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, September 7, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: I write to you regarding several       health bills the Committee on Ways and Means ordered       favorably reported to the House. The following bills were       also referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce.        I ask that the Committee on Energy and Commerce waive       formal consideration of the following bills so that they may       proceed expeditiously to the House Floor:        H.R. 6662, Empowering Seniors' Enrollment Decision Act of       2018;        H.R. 6690, Fighting Fraud to Protect Care for Seniors Act       of 2018;        H.R. 6561, Comprehensive Care for Seniors Act of 2018; and        H.R. 3635, Local Coverage Determination Clarification Act       of 2018.        I acknowledge that by waiving formal consideration of the       bills, the Committee on Energy and Commerce is in no way       waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       those provisions of the bills that fall within your Rule X       jurisdiction. I would support your effort to seek appointment       of  [[Page H8120]]       an appropriate number of conferees on any House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.        I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this legislation on the House       floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                  Washington, DC, September 7, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 3635, Local Coverage Determination Clarification Act of       2018; H.R. 6561, Comprehensive Care for Seniors Act of 2018;       H.R. 6662, Empowering Seniors' Enrollment Decision Act of       2018; and H.R. 6690, Fighting Fraud to Protect Care for       Seniors Act of 2018.        The Committee on Energy and Commerce will forgo       consideration of both bills so that they may proceed       expeditiously to the House Floor.        I appreciate your assurance that by forgoing action on       these bills, the Committee is in no way waiving its       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in the bills.       I also appreciate your offer of support for the appointment       of conferees from the Committee to any House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Levin for his  observations about this bill, that it is created in a spirit of  bipartisanship, and I appreciate his support for it.   I think it is interesting, just a little bit of a point of  clarification, because we were able to discuss in the committee the GAO  report. There are two facets of it. There are two numbers, and those  people who are tracking this closely will care about it. There is one 2  percent representation and then a 22 percent representation.   Here is the story. The GAO said only 2 percent of cases that they  evaluated would have been completely changed by this. I think if we  were talking about any other thing in Medicare as it relates to 2  percent, we would be chasing it. Be that as it may, 2 percent would be  completely changed. Twenty-two percent of the cases they evaluated,  however, would be impacted in some way.   So the bottom line here is that we have an opportunity to adopt  technology at a cost of about $40 million, we are told, to pursue $40  billion in fraud and error. That is good math any day of the week. Both  sides of the aisle recognize it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, there is a quotation that is familiar that  is brought to my attention this afternoon as we are debating this, and  it has echoes for today. It is by Martin Niemoller, who was a Lutheran  pastor in Germany; and this is what he said:   ``First they came for the socialists and I did not speak out because  I was not a socialist.   Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out  because I was not a trade unionist.   Then they came for the Jews and I did not speak out because I was not  a Jew.   Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.''   Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity to do something good today, to  build on the work that Congressman Smith has initiated and that has  been shepherded through this process by Chairman Royce and by Ranking  Member Engel; and that is to recognize the  [[Page H8153]]  growing rise of anti-Semitism around the world and to say, we are not  only not going to be complicit in it, we are going to speak out about  it, and we are going to bring attention to it, and we are going to  bring the full force and power of the United States Government and its  moral authority and its imprimatur on this issue. There is real power  in that.   You have heard both sides going back and forth sort of being reminded  of this responsibility that we have because we have seen anti-Semitism,  Mr. Speaker, arise within the last year alone in Germany, in Brazil, in  France, in Hungary, and in New Zealand.   In closing, the Anti-Defamation League has pointed out that in the  last year alone there have been over 4 million English language tweets  that are anti-Semitic. This is upon us.   So what Congressman Smith has initiated now is to raise the status of  this person to make sure they are not just a Special Envoy, but to  raise that to ambassadorial status for all the obvious reasons; to get  this person appointed quickly; and to have this post filled and brought  with real authority.   I urge its passage, and I thank the gentleman for yielding.
