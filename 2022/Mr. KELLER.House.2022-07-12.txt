 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, over 2 years ago, committee Republicans opened an  investigation into the veterans' records requests backlog at the  National Personnel Records Center.   Pennsylvania veterans and their families were frustrated and  concerned with the lengthy delays they were experiencing as they tried  to access their own documents outlining military service.   American veterans and families rely on these records to prove  eligibility for medical care and the benefits they are entitled to.   What we found was deeply disturbing. The records at the NPRC are on  paper. They cannot be accessed remotely.   When the NPRC shut down in-person operations and told its workforce  to go home, the backlog piled up to more than 500,000 military service  records requests.   Veterans put their lives on the line for our country. The least we  can do for them is to ensure they have access to the care and benefits  they have earned.   Based on our findings, we urged the chairwoman to hold hearings. We  pressed the NPRC to get staff back to work in person. But under the  current administration, the backlog has grown to over 600,000 pending  requests, with more added daily.   That is why, in June of last year, I introduced the RECORDS Act to  require the NPRC to get back to work in person. Finally, after  significant pressure from congressional Republicans, the NPRC returned  to full in-person staffing on March 7 of this year.   I am pleased that this legislation has finally reached the House  floor.   The Access for Veterans to Records Act incorporates improvements  Republicans made to ensure the backlog is fixed. This bipartisan  legislation requires the NPRC to maintain in-person staffing levels.   The bill also authorizes the funds necessary to speed up the digital  preservation of records, so we will not face this problem in the  future.   Finally, the bill contains reporting requirements to ensure proper  accountability for addressing the current backlog and preventing future  issues.   The Access for Veterans to Records Act is a bipartisan bill that  demonstrates how Congress can work together to advance legislative  reforms that are truly responsive to the needs of the American people  and those who have given so much for our country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7337 is a bipartisan bill directly addressing a  current problem facing America's veterans. I am thankful that the  chairwoman and her staff worked with me to bring this necessary  legislation to the House floor.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as an emerging technology, quantum computing holds great  promise and potential peril for our Nation. It has the potential to  exponentially increase computing power and processing speeds, which  will mean technological leaps for American research activities and  business sectors.   While such major advances are likely decades away, there is a clear  risk that foreign adversaries like China are using early developments  in quantum computing technology for malicious purposes.   One immediate risk is that our foreign adversaries may use the first  quantum computers to unlock data that has already been stolen from U.S.  Federal agencies.   Current data encryption methods protect the privacy, security, and  integrity of underlying data and are nearly impossible to decrypt with  today's computing capabilities. The computations required to unlock  encrypted data require computing resources that we do not currently  possess. However, as quantum computing matures, so does the possibility  that sensitive information could be unlocked. This is a clear national  security threat.   The Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act will require a  governmentwide strategy to better secure valuable government data.   While the Federal Government already has initiatives underway to  address such emerging threats, including the development of post- quantum cryptography standards and a recent Presidential national  security directive, H.R. 7535 makes this a clear congressional  priority.   The bill requires a governmentwide review of vulnerable agency  information systems and consistent guidance to Federal agencies, and it  seeks to ensure proper congressional oversight.   Advancing a strategic approach to evaluating quantum computing risks  to Federal IT and network cybersecurity is important given the  significant potential risk to our public-sector data.                                time  1445    And since this bill only requires centralized guidance and reporting,  the Congressional Budget Office found it would cost American taxpayers  less than $1 million over 5 years. This is a reasonable investment.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my House Oversight and Reform Committee  colleagues, Representatives Ro Khanna and Nancy Mace for their work on  this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  South Carolina (Ms. Mace).    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bipartisan bill that addresses an emerging national security issue.  [[Page H5955]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Government Accountability Office serves a vital role  in examining agency spending and advising lawmakers and Federal  agencies how to make government work better for the American people.   GAO makes many recommendations regarding specific actions executive  branch agencies should take to save taxpayer dollars. It also suggests  legislative actions Congress could take to improve government  performance.   Despite GAO's successes, there are more than 100 actions executive  branch agencies could take to be more effective and achieve greater  efficiency.   H.R. 7331 will consolidate open GAO recommendations for review by  congressional leadership and the appropriate committees of  jurisdiction. It will annually highlight the congressional oversight  and legislative actions suggested to address these recommendations.   In doing so, the bill will help ensure that Congress has the tools it  needs to pass needed legislation and spur executive agencies to  implement needed reforms.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7331 will help Congress address  specific--but fixable--issues across our sprawling Federal Government  which are causing waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.   This bipartisan legislation will help improve the functioning of the  American people's government and ultimately save taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, our Federal law enforcement and safety officers should  not have to risk losing their retirement benefits if they are disabled  in the line of duty. Likewise, Federal agencies should not lose  talented employees who could otherwise continue their service in an  alternative capacity.   Fortunately, this narrowly tailored bill fixes a technological flaw  for Federal law enforcement officers who are injured on the job. The  First Responder Fair RETIRE Act gives disabled public safety officers  the option to continue serving their country in a different capacity.  This bill covers first responders, including special agents, Customs  and Border Protection officers, firefighters, air traffic controllers,  nuclear materials couriers, CIA agents, and members of the Capitol  Police and Supreme Court Police.   To be clear, H.R. 521 only applies to injuries sustained while on  duty and as a direct result of the performance of such duties.  Moreover, it only applies to officers who choose to continue Federal  service and continue to pay into the accelerated annuity system as they  did prior to their injury. If they leave Federal service, they are not  eligible for this benefit.   In conclusion, the First Responder Fair RETIRE Act ensures that our  Federal law enforcement officers are not penalized when they make  sacrifices in service to our Nation. H.R. 521 will also ensure the  Federal Government agencies who employ these American heroes are able  to retain their talent and skills for continued public service.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to support this bill, I urge my colleagues  to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to help advance the First Responder Fair  RETIRE Act through the House. This legislation ensures that our Federal  law enforcement and public safety officers can continue their service  to our Nation after being injured in the line of duty.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 203, which names a Houston  post office for Benny Martinez.   Mr. Martinez was a native Texan and attended segregated schools in  his hometown of Goliad before moving to Houston with his family in the  pursuit of greater opportunities. He served in the U.S. Army and was  deployed during the Korean war.   After he was honorably discharged, Mr. Martinez went back to school  at Houston Community College and the University of Houston. He  recognized the importance of education and became an associate teacher  in the Houston School District and raised money for student  scholarships.   Most famously, Mr. Martinez worked with the League of United Latin  American Citizens to organize a gala for President Kennedy held the  night before his assassination during his trip to Texas in 1963. This  was the first time a sitting President met with a Latino civil rights  group. Mr. Martinez was a leader in the civil rights movement and is  deserving of this honor.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of  technology to all Americans. Access to computers and computer  technology is necessary for success in the modern world. This became  even more critical during the height of the pandemic when many  Americans struggled to juggle Zoom meetings and help their children  with remote school.   That is why this bill is important. It will help Americans get the  access they need.   H.R. 3544, the Computers for Veterans and Students Act, will  repurpose surplus Federal IT equipment to help American veterans,  students, disabled individuals, low-income households, seniors in need,  and educational institutions of all kinds.   H.R. 3544 requires the General Services Administration to transfer  computers and tech equipment in need of repair to nonprofit computer  refurbishers. These third-party refurbishers will then repair and  distribute the IT equipment directly to veterans, students, and others  in need.   The bill also obligates these third-party refurbishers to offer  training programs on the use of the technology being distributed.   Those with access to computers and an understanding of how to use  technology can enjoy many benefits, but a lack of such access and  understanding presents significant challenges. Americans need to be  able to conduct online research for a school project, connect with  loved ones, or find and keep a steady job.   I appreciate Representatives Abigail Spanberger and  Rob Wittman for  their leadership on this legislation. I encourage my colleagues to help  our Nation's veterans and students by supporting H.R. 3544.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I note that Congress is expected to pay tribute to veterans when we  honor retired Chief Warrant Officer 4 Hershel ``Woody'' Williams.  Woody, the last surviving World War II veteran who received a Medal of  Honor, will lie in honor this week in the U.S. Capitol.   In the spirit of that event, let us pay tribute to all those who have  served our Nation and all those who will serve our Nation in the  future.   Instead of letting technology that American taxpayers have already  invested in go to waste, the bipartisan Computers for Veterans and  Students Act will get such repairable government technology into the  lives of Americans in need.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5794 which honors Sergeant  Leonard Funk.   Sergeant Funk was a paratrooper who served in some of the most  critical campaigns during World War II, including the invasion of  Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge.   He became one of World War II's most decorated paratroopers. Notably,  he was awarded the Medal of Honor, the government's highest and most  prestigious military decoration, as well as the Distinguished Service  Cross.   Sergeant Funk exemplified what it means to be an American patriot. I  am proud to say that following his military service, Sergeant Funk  returned to the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania where he continued  his public service with the Department of Veterans Affairs in the  Pittsburgh area.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1095, which names a Compton,  California, Post Office for Private First Class James Anderson, Jr.   PFC Anderson grew up in Compton where he attended Centennial High  School and later Los Angeles Harbor College. During college, he decided  to enlist in the Marine Corps and serve the United States in the  Vietnam war.   While deployed, his platoon was ambushed, and an enemy grenade landed  near him and his fellow soldiers. Without hesitation, PFC Anderson  threw himself on the grenade, sacrificing his own life to save those of  his fellow marines. For this action, he was awarded the Medal of Honor.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this bill  which honors an American war hero, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5659, which honors John R.  Hatcher III.   Mr. Hatcher was born in Birmingham, Alabama, during the Jim Crow era.  He spent his lifetime fighting for equality.   He was a longtime member of the NAACP and spent nearly 40 years as  president of the Ventura County Chapter and an additional 6 years as  the NAACP southern area president.   Mr. Hatcher was also a United States Air Force veteran and served  more than 22 years in the military before working as a civil servant  for the Department of the Navy. He was honored with the African- American Achievement Award at California State University, Channel  Islands.   He also aided in the establishment of the Ventura County African  American Chamber of Commerce, the Tri County Sentry newspaper, and the  naming of the Thurgood Marshall School in the Oxnard School District.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5271, which honors former  Tennessee State Senator Thelma Harper. Senator Harper was the first  African-American female elected to the State senate and the longest- serving female State senator in Tennessee history.   Prior to this, she served as the grand jury foreman for the Davidson  County Fifth Circuit Court as a representative of the Metropolitan  Nashville Council.   Throughout her time in public service, Senator Harper championed  children's issues and has been recognized with numerous awards for her  public service.   She worked to create a safe haven law to save abandoned babies and  establish a fee waiver to provide low-income students with school  supplies and lunches.   Senator Harper was a dedicated public servant, and I encourage my  colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5809, which honors marine  Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui.   Lance Corporal Nikoui was born in 2001, the same year that the war in  Afghanistan began.   Last year, he was killed by a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport  during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. He had gone back inside  the Kabul airport to guide children to safety when a suicide bomb went  off.   While only 20 years old, Lance Corporal Nikoui served America with  dignity and courage while fighting to protect those seeking refuge and  freedom in our great Nation.   I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this bill honoring a  true American hero, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.

He received  the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions during the war. While acting  as a forward observer in an artillery unit in a region known as the  Iron Triangle, his unit came under heavy fire.   Mr. Rosser led the charge forward up a hill when he suddenly realized  he was alone. His colleagues had all been injured or shot, but Mr.  Rosser kept assaulting enemy positions. When he ran out of ammunition,  he exposed himself to enemy fire to obtain more and resumed the fight.   When he ran out of ammunition again, and despite being injured, Mr.  Rosser made several trips across open terrain to help other wounded  soldiers get to safety.   He passed away in August of 2020, leaving a legacy of bravery. He was  a true American war hero, and I strongly encourage my colleagues to  support this bill.
