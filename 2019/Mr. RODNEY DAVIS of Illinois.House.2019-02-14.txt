 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the important and irreplaceable work done by our court reporters during  National Court Reporting and Captioning Week, which is February 9  through 16.   As guardians of the record, court reporters have had and do have a  large impact on capturing history for posterity.   During our nearly 250 years of American history, court reporters have  been a cornerstone of our American justice system. From George  Washington's farewell address to Lincoln's ``House Divided'' speech,  these noble servants have transcribed some of the most important pieces  of American history.   Today, with the help of new technology like that utilized by CART  captioners, reporters have been able to expand beyond the courtroom to  provide accessibility for millions of Americans who are deaf and hard  of hearing by providing captioning in real time for live sporting and  theater events, church services, movie theaters, and many other venues.   As I speak to you now, a stenographer, Julia, is seated next to me,  quietly but promptly recording my every word.   So, on behalf of myself and all Members of Congress, thank you for  all the hard work you do in support of this House.                            ____________________
