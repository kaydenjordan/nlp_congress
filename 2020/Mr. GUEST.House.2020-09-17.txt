 Madam Speaker, no matter your political affiliations in  2001, there were no greater heroes than our first responders who risked  their own lives to save their fellow citizens on 9/11. Republicans and  Democrats thanked our first responders, while children across our  Nation looked up to them as examples of what it meant to be heroes, to  risk their own well-being in service to their fellow citizens.   Now, across the Nation, we see a stark contrast to that scene from  almost 20 years ago. Radicals now seek to defund the police. They  threaten the men and women who risk their lives in service to our  community, and, at times, they target our officers with violence,  which, in the most tragic of cases, means these officers who are also  fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters never return home to their  family.   I am calling on Members of Congress who have remained silent in  recent months to now publicly oppose the violence against our law  enforcement community so that we can put an end to the basic attacks  against our first responders.                            ____________________
