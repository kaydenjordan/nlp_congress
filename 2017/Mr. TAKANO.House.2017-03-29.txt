 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate 20 years of the  Gluck Fellows Program of the Arts at the University of California,  Riverside.   Since 1996, the Max H. Gluck Foundation has supported undergraduate  and graduate students as they bring innovative arts programming to  schools, libraries, and community centers in my district.   The Gluck Fellows Program of the Arts has provided students,  families, and other community members with the opportunity to  experience art, music, dance, theater, and art history through  workshops and performances. Over the past 20 years, more than 300,000  Inland Empire residents have benefited from this program.   I congratulate UCR's Chancellor Kim Wilcox; Dean of Humanities, Arts  and Social Sciences Milagros Pena; Gluck Fellows Director Erika  Suderburg; and especially the Max H. Gluck Foundation and its chair,  Dr. Jon Kaswick.   I wish continued success to the Gluck Fellows Program of the Arts at  the University of California, Riverside.                            ____________________
