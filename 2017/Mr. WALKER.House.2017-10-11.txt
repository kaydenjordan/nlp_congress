 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to announce the introduction of  the Universal Charitable Giving Act. Many Americans believe that  people, not the government, offer the best solutions to solve the  ailments that face our society. Strong families, strong churches, and  strong communities are the foundations of our Nation. By supporting  charities, we can make our communities and our country a better place  for Americans from all walks of life.   Giving to charity is crucial for economic prosperity, happiness, and  the success of our people, but for too long only the most wealthy have  been incentivized to give to the causes they believe in.   The Universal Charitable Giving Act incentivizes charitable giving  for low- and middle-income taxpayers. It would allow everyone to deduct  charitable giving, regardless of itemizing status.   With tax reform, our aim is to increase take-home pay for middle  America. With my bill, our goal is to increase support for all  charities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the great work of our  faith-based and charitable organizations by supporting this bill.  [[Page H7960]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, we are here today because, almost 11 months  ago, the American people voted to give Republicans control of unified  government. They were tired of being crushed by rising healthcare costs  due to ObamaCare. They wanted America's economy to prosper again. They  wanted a secure border.   During the months that followed, Congress worked with President Trump  to sign over 50 bills into law. On top of that, the House passed over  270 laws that now sit in the Senate awaiting action.   Despite this legislation, there is a unified voice that is loud and  clear arriving daily from our base, saying, ``Get something done.'' The  reason for that call is because Americans continue to be crushed by  government policies, something that is very evident. These are the same  policies that drove them to vote for us in the first place.   Americans are scarred by the broken promises of the former  administration. They could not keep their doctor, even though they were  told by the former President they could. Their premiums did not go down  $2,500, and their exchanges did not work.   ObamaCare resulted in fewer options and increased costs for many  Americans. Out-of-pocket costs continue to soar, with overage  deductibles for bronze plans topping $6,000 in 2017.   Some States, like Arizona, faced premium increases of 116 percent;  Oklahoma, 69 percent. Tennessee faced a 63 percent increase. And one- third of counties have only one insurer offering coverage on the  exchange. Some entire States like Wyoming, right below me, South  Carolina, Oklahoma, and Alaska only have one insurer.   Think about that. This trend is predicted to worsen, with half of  American counties only having one insurer in 2018.   As we have come to almost 8 years with the ACA, or ObamaCare, we run  a risk of thinking that it is normal. Our healthcare system was not  perfect before. We are not making that case. But ObamaCare made what  was already bad even worse.   We cannot think of these stats as mere numbers. Americans are really  suffering under this law. Just because Senate Majority Leader McConnell  gave up on repealing ObamaCare in the Senate does not mean Americans  will give Congress and Republicans a pass. We cannot and we must not  give up on this important promise.   The burden of ObamaCare is only made worse by the lackluster growth  of the economy in recent years. During the Obama administration years,  the economy failed to grow even once at the historic goal of 3 percent  a year, something we just saw in our last quarter.   Americans are as industrious and innovative as ever. Americans' work  ethic is not the problem. It is our antiquated tax system that has been  bogged down over the years by regulators and lobbyists.   Since our last major rewrite of the Tax Code 31 years ago, the same  year that ``Top Gun'' was number one in the box office, 1986, our Tax  Code has added over 35,000 pages. Think about that--35,000 pages. That  is about three changes per day. Each page is another carve-out or a  loophole for the well connected, leaving the rest of the economy  behind.   Our companies are at a disadvantage internationally, as our tax rate  stands at 35 percent, the highest, as we know now, in the  industrialized world.   Families continue to be punished with a marriage penalty.   Our Tax Code should be a competitive advantage for our companies  competing with the world. It should encourage innovators to push the  boundaries and find success.   The call to get something done that we hear loud and clear from  Americans is also coupled with a call to make sure that we are doing  our very best to secure the border. Perhaps there is no more vocal call  from the past year than to build that wall.   In 2016, the United States saw a surge in illegal border crossings,  with 46,000 illegals apprehended in that October alone. This is both a  fiscal and a security issue.   Border security is more than just the border, though. Visa overstays  are responsible for up to 40 percent of illegal immigration. We need a  solution, and we need an action to this problem if we are truly to  secure the border.   To add to these problems, more than 100 sanctuary jurisdictions have  enacted policies which restrict cooperation with ICE, allowing  potentially dangerous illegal immigrant criminals to remain in our  country.   I am confident that the American people will deliver their final  grade on Republicans over the next 3 months simply based on the three  issues, the three promises that I am speaking about today: number one,  continuing to work and replace and repeal ObamaCare; number two,  reforming the Tax Code; and, number three, securing the border. In  short, repeal, reform, secure; repeal, reform, secure. We need to  fulfill these promises in the next 3 months. The urgency and the time  is now.   As I said before, the status quo on these policies is literally  crushing Americans, and this is why they elected Republicans. In fact,  since 1913, when Republicans expanded, or when the House expanded the  387 Members to 435, this is the only time in history when back-to-back  Congresses, the Americans have elected 240 or more Republicans, and it  is time we did our job. We need to keep our promises to the American  people.   I am pleased to be joined by members of the Republican Study  Committee today to talk about the importance of keeping these promises.  That is why it is my privilege to introduce one of our newer members  from Kansas, Representative Ron Estes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Estes. Perhaps no one  knows more and has had more experience than the chairman of our  Judiciary Committee, a former immigration attorney who has spent years  working on resolving these issues.   Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte and appreciate  those powerful words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis), a  colleague and one of the sharpest, most intellectual Members of  Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. I  always appreciate the contribution that the gentleman makes to the  House and to the American people.   I could not agree more. For those who may be listening or watching,  you may have seen, in the last few months, a heightened energy, or an  urgency when it comes to calling out our partners in the Senate to  begin to move and to begin to act--not just on things like repealing  the healthcare, ObamaCare, but also moving, getting ready to move,  hopefully, on tax reform.   I know there has been some agreement on the framework, but, as the  details continue to be more and more clear, we hope our colleagues on  the Senate are ready to move quickly and swiftly for the American  people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Norman), a brand-new Member who came in from a special election to  replace OMB Director Mick Mulvaney when he took the position with  President Trump's administration. He has gotten up to speed quickly and  is a huge asset to the Republican Study Committee and to the House  Republicans as a whole.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. As  you see, three promises, 3 months; October, November, December, three  promises, 3 months: repeal, reform, and secure. That is the promise  from the Republican Study Committee, making up 157 members, 17 of the  20 chairmen.                                time  1745    Now it is in our ability to make sure this gets through the Senate  and passed into law by the President. We can't force all that, but what  we are committed to is doing our part and doing our job to get these  pieces of legislation through regular order to the House for a vote to  fulfill the promises that most of us ran on over the last several  elections.   It is also a wonderful privilege tonight to introduce our House  veterinarian--the gentleman can define that as he would need if we need  a House veterinarian--but the great Representative from central Florida  who does fine work in the House, Dr. Ted Yoho.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Yoho, and we  appreciate the gentleman's work in the United States House.   Mr. Speaker, one of the most accomplished men, sometimes a person  whom we refer to as ``Governor'' around here when it comes to political  minds, is the gentleman from South Carolina, Representative Mark  Sanford. Week in and week out, he is a very diligent and great leader  in this House.   Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield to the fine gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Sanford).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Sanford; I appreciate  the gentleman's good words, experience, and knowledge.   Mr. Speaker, speaking of Congress as a whole, it is well past time to  make sure that tax reform and tax relief gets across to the American  people.   A lot of times we talk about classes. The truth is it is probably  better terminology to talk about income levels, lower, middle and  higher income levels. That is one of the reasons that we are pushing  forward the Charitable Giving Act, which is something that impacts both  the lower and middle income levels.   We believe that is something that needs to be connected to tax reform  to make sure that those folks who come from a background of teachers  and truck drivers as we just heard about, but also other areas of the  middle class and maybe lower income levels, something that they have a  way where they are able to make sure that every dollar and every  sacrifice they give back to a charitable organization--whether it is a  local church or whether it is to the United Way--to make sure that  every dollar is counted.   This is something that has been going on way too long. As we know,  there are 75,000 pages right now of IRS Tax Code regulations. If the  IRS wants to come after a private citizen, the private citizen doesn't  have much of a resource ability to fight back whether it is in the  legal or whether it is extended wealth. This is a machine that has been  building, and the bureaucracy has been growing well past time.   It is time to neuter the IRS. One of the ways we can do that is  reducing it from seven tax brackets down to three. It was erroneously  shared by somebody across the aisle recently that we are driving up the  lowest bracket from 10 percent to 12 percent. The truth is this: we are  condensing it right now to three tax brackets--35 percent, 25 percent,  and 12 percent--and doubling the standard deduction from $12,000 to  $24,000. This is something that we are looking forward to doing to  benefit the American people.   We talk much in these Halls about bipartisan support or bipartisan  this or that. When did it become an issue, when did it become a  problem, and when did it become a point of contention to allow the  American people to keep more of the money from the hard work they put  in day in and day out, week in and week out? That is something that we  must do. That is something that should not even be a place of argument  or a place of debate when it comes back allowing these folks to  continue.   For some, we can get past the tax credit language. We can move on  beyond the charitable deductions and all the different political and  accounting words. What about just the family of four that needs another  car, that needs to be able to afford a car payment to get a mom or a  dad back and forth to work, or maybe a teenager in the house? We have  been through that twice now. We had more claims than we probably  should, but we get it. But also, maybe it is a few more times out to  eat or to the movies, the things that  [[Page H7965]]  make you want to get up every day and continue to pursue that American  Dream.   But not only from the individual side of this--certainly very  important--but what about this corporate tax rate, this business rate  that we talk constantly about that almost has become Washington jargon  talking points? Why is that so important?   Over the years since the 1930s and 1940s, our corporate business rate  has climbed to the highest in the industrial world.   Why is that? Why would we make it tougher on our manufacturers and  our companies to have a higher tax rate? What incentive is it to stay  here? We could track company after company.   I come from the State of North Carolina where textiles and furniture  used to be two of our top three job providers. A lot of those companies  now you will find in Vietnam or other places.   That corporate tax rate that literally has gone through the roof, why  wouldn't we want to reduce that business rate? Why wouldn't we want to  incentivize companies to begin to bring those jobs back to the United  States?   I think it is crucial, and I think it is something that all of us  should have the energy and the ability to be able to get behind and  really push forward.   We have been promising this for how long? Since 1986? I was a junior  in high school. Thirty-one years this has been on the docket, and the  moment is now for us to deliver. If it is not now, as Reagan used to  say, then when? Then how?   What should we be doing if it is not fulfilling the very promise that  we have made to the American people, and that is that we are going to  provide genuine--not some kind of phony legislation, not some kind of  showboat, but genuine tax reform and tax relief for the American  people?   Now, you may hear sometimes that, hey, the Republican plan is only  for the most wealthy. Let's look at the numbers. Let's put a little  math equation up, if we could, please.   Let's say that the most wealthy--if you are talking about somebody  who makes $1 million, let's say we reduce their taxes by 1 percent. My  math that I am doing here in my mind, that comes to about $10,000.   Let's say, if you go to that middle-income family, two parents  working as hard as they can, they are bringing about $50,000 a year  annually, yet their tax break, their tax benefit is 10 percent. Now,  math tells me that is only $5,000 compared to the $10,000.   So you may hear the spin from time to time, well, the wealthier are  getting the higher tax break, the wealthier are getting the higher tax  credit. Listen, when it comes to dollar for dollar, the impact that  that makes to the middle and lower income families is drastic. I will  tell you this. Every time we turn around, every time that each Member  goes back and forth to his district, he is hearing the same message:  ``Get something done.''   Tax reform is one of those areas where, specifically, we are being  compelled, we are being urged, and we are being called. My fellow  Members in the House, please hear those urgent voices right now. Even  if Members want to move past the tax relief and the humanitarian  component, is it not politically strategic for us to do what we have  promised to do on behalf of the American people?   As I said in my opening, I am confident that the American people will  deliver the final grade over the next 3 months. The 115th Congress,  what kind of grade will we have over the next 3 months if we do not  deliver on these three promises?   I am hoping that that urgency is resonating. Repealing and replacing,  continuing to fight to repeal and replace ObamaCare, to make sure that  we are continuing to reform and do everything that we can to reform the  Tax Code. Finally, the promise that we have been making year after year  is to make sure that we are protecting the American people by securing  our border.   I understand that each of these items is a major legislative item in  its own right. To be frank, we should have been delivering on them  throughout the year. It is October, the 10th month of year. It is high  past time. We only have such a busy agenda this late in the game  because we haven't delivered on our promises.                                time  1800    I want to thank my colleagues and fellow Republican Study Committee  members tonight for joining us this evening.   I would ask the American people to continue to support and continue  to urge their Members of Congress to deliver on these promises.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
