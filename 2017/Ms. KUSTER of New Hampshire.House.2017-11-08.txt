 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the  need for tax policy that benefits hardworking families in New Hampshire  and all across this country.   We are long overdue for real tax reform, but, unfortunately, the plan  unveiled by my Republican colleagues is more of a giveaway to  millionaires, billionaires, and corporate special interests.   In fact, consider this: 80 percent of the tax breaks in their bill go  to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. This is while cutting $500  billion from Medicare and $1 trillion from Medicaid. That trade is,  frankly, unconscionable. This bill is a bad deal for Granite Staters  and a bad deal for the American people.   The Republican tax plan eliminates important deductions for  hardworking middle class families. It caps property tax deductions,  eliminates student loan interest deductions and the medical deduction  tax credit. The plan even ends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit that  encourages employers to hire veterans.   House Democrats are offering a better deal. I urge my Republican  colleagues to work with us to support working families.                            ____________________
