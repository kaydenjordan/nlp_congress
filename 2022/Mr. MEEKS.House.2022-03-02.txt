 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 956) to support the People of Ukraine.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 956         Whereas, on January 21, 1990, more than 300,000 Ukrainians       called for unity and independence from the Soviet Union by       forming a human chain between the cities of Kyiv and Ivano-      Frankivsk;        Whereas, on December 1, 1991, more than 90 percent of       Ukrainian citizens voted in a national referendum in support       of independence, with majorities in every region;        Whereas, on November 21, 2013, the Euromaidan protests       began in favor of signing the European Union-Ukraine       Association Agreement, resulting in the Revolution of Dignity       and the removal of President Viktor Yanukovych by the       Verkhovna Rada;        Whereas, in February and March of 2014, the Russian       Federation invaded the peninsula of Crimea, illegally annexed       the region, held a sham referendum, and claimed the territory       to be a part of Russia;        Whereas, beginning in April 2014, the Russian Federation       invaded the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Eastern Ukraine       instigating violence, stoking conflict, arming separatists,       and spreading disinformation on Ukrainian soil;        Whereas, on July 17, 2014, Russian soldiers or Russian       separatist fighters shot down the passenger flight MH17       flying over the Donbas with a Buk surface-to-air missile       provided by the Russian Federation, killing all 298 innocent       passengers on board;        Whereas, since February 2015, Russia has continued to fail       to live up to its agreements under the Minsk agreements and       the Russian-backed war in the Donbas has claimed       approximately 14,000 lives;        Whereas the Russian military conducted a large-scale       buildup in and around Ukraine in March and April 2021 under       the guise of military exercises, leaving significant military       equipment behind;        Whereas the Russian military initiated its most recent much       larger military buildup in October 2021 that culminated in       approximately 190,000 forces by the time of Russia's renewed       full-scale incursion on February 24, 2022;        Whereas, on February 21, 2022, the State Duma of Russia       passed a bill, approved by President Vladimir Putin, to       officially recognize the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's       Republic and Donetsk People's Republic as independent;        Whereas, on February 21, 2022, Vladimir Putin ordered       Russian troops into the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's       Republic and Donetsk People's Republic after recognizing       their independence;        Whereas the decision to recognize the self-proclaimed       Luhansk People's Republic and Donetsk People's Republic as       independent and order Russian troops into that territory was       not only in violation of international law, Ukraine's       sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the Minsk       agreements, but also tantamount to a declaration of war;        Whereas, on February 24, 2022, Russian forces, enabled by       Belarus, launched its unprovoked full-scale renewed invasion       of a peaceful, independent country, Ukraine;        Whereas, since 2014, the United States has provided       $3,100,000,000 in security assistance to Ukraine, including       over $1,000,000,000 over the course of the last year,       $200,000,000 of which was approved on December 27, 2021, and       $350,000,000 of which was approved on February 26, 2022;        Whereas it is the right of all countries to decide their       own future, foreign policy, and security arrangements free       from outside interference or coercion;        Whereas the Russian Federation repeatedly lied about their       massive buildup of military forces around Ukraine and claimed       that reports Russia would invade Ukraine were hysteria;        Whereas, on February 24, 2022, the G7 issued a statement       condemning the ``large-scale military aggression by the       Russian Federation against the territorial integrity,       sovereignty and independence of Ukraine'';        Whereas, on February 25, 2022, the North Atlantic Treaty       Organization condemned ``in the strongest possible terms       Russia's horrifying attack on Ukraine'', called on Russia       ``to turn back from the path of violence and aggression'',       and reaffirmed an ``iron-clad'' commitment to Article 5;        Whereas the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy,       the United Kingdom, and Canada joined with the United States,       committed to coordinated economic sanctions, including severe       restrictions, against Russia's Central Bank and full blocking       sanctions against Vladimir Putin;        Whereas United States leadership is integral to nations       around the world in condemning and imposing costs on the       Russian Federation for its illegal, full-scale, renewed       invasion;        Whereas Russian forces have targeted civilians and have       committed war crimes and crimes against humanity;        Whereas, in the days since the renewed full-scale invasion       began, Russian citizens have taken to the streets in cities       and towns across Russia to protest Putin's illegitimate and       destructive war waged against a peaceful and sovereign       Ukraine; and        Whereas the United States, along with allies in Europe, the       Indo-Pacific, and others around the world, has been actively       responding to Russia's unprovoked war of aggression against       Ukraine with critical military, humanitarian, and financial       support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people: Now, therefore,       be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) demands an immediate cease-fire and the full withdrawal       of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory;        (2) supports, unequivocally, Ukraine's sovereignty and       territorial integrity;        (3) backs the continued use of sanctions, in coordination       with United States allies and partners, to fully isolate the       Putin regime economically for its unprovoked aggression       against Ukraine;        (4) urges the United States and its allies and partners to       deliver additional and immediate defensive security       assistance to help Ukraine address the armored, airborne, and       other threats Ukraine is currently facing from Russian       forces;        (5) commits to continuing to support resistance by the       Ukrainian people as long as the Russian Federation continues       to violate Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity;        (6) promises to continue to provide significant additional       aid and humanitarian relief to Ukrainian refugees fleeing       Russia's aggression, commends European partners for their       efforts to relieve suffering on the ground, and urges the       Russian Federation alongside United States allies and       partners to guarantee safe passage out of the country;        (7) reaffirms its strong support for the security of United       States allies and ironclad commitment to Article 5 of the       North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO);        (8) emphasizes that NATO's relationship with Ukraine is a       matter only for Ukraine and the 30 NATO allies;        (9) pledges to support working with Europe and       international partners to bolster Europe's energy security       and reduce its dependence on Russian energy imports;        (10) underscores the importance of maintaining United       States energy independence for the benefit of the American       people and United States allies;        (11) reiterates that Crimea and the territories illegally       controlled by the illegitimate Russian-controlled governments       in Donetsk and Luhansk are sovereign Ukrainian territory;        (12) declares that the war in Ukraine, a democratic       country, is the frontline of democracy and freedom versus       authoritarianism represented by Putin's Russia;        (13) supports the right of the Russian people to protest,       including the current protests against Putin's unprovoked war       against Ukraine, and demands the immediate release of all       those who have been unjustly detained in Russia for       expressing their desire for peace;        (14) comprehends that strongmen, dictators, and       authoritarians are watching the world's response to Putin's       war against Ukraine and learning lessons for their own       aggressive actions domestically and abroad, thereby making a       strong and united response important to deter the expansion       of territory by the use of military force beyond this crisis;        (15) states unambiguously that it will never recognize or       support any illegitimate Russian-controlled leader or       government installed through the use of force, and that only       the people of Ukraine can choose their leadership through       free and fair democratic elections without foreign       interference, intervention, or coercion;        (16) commits to ensuring the illegitimate dictator of       Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, is held accountable for       permitting the use of Belarusian territory for, and       committing Belarusian forces to, Putin's unprovoked renewed       full-scale invasion against Ukraine; and        (17) stands steadfastly, staunchly, proudly, and fervently       behind the Ukrainian people in their fight against the       authoritarian Putin regime.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H. Res. 956.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my resolution, which I  introduced with Representative Spartz, to demonstrate bipartisan  congressional support for the Ukrainian people.   Today, we are witnessing the most devastating escalation of violence  on the European Continent in decades.  [[Page H1248]]  Vladimir Putin has launched an unjustifiable, senseless war on a  peaceful, sovereign nation, Ukraine. We are already seeing thousands of  casualties, both Ukrainians and Russians, and hundreds of thousands of  refugees fleeing to the European Union.   As we speak, Putin's army is encircling Ukrainian cities, including  the capital of Kyiv. His forces are bombing indiscriminately,  ruthlessly killing civilians, and destroying critical infrastructure.   In his despicable and utterly false claims to denazify Ukraine, he  has bombed the memorial at Babyn Yar, where, just weeks ago,  Representative Spartz and I stood with other Members of Congress at the  site where tens of thousands were killed in massacres during the  Holocaust. The streets we walked just a few weeks ago are now a  battlefield, its citizens now soldiers.   Let us be clear. This is but one person's war. This is caused by one  individual by the name of Vladimir Putin. It is his war.   Ukraine, the United States, and our allies have all actively engaged  in a historic diplomatic push since before Russia marched their troops  into the sovereign territory of Ukraine. Nevertheless, Putin chose the  path of an unprovoked war instead.   It is a peaceful Ukraine that is pleading for a cease-fire so that  diplomacy and sanity can triumph over bloodshed and madness.   Just this morning, the U.N. General Assembly held an emergency  session that voted overwhelmingly against Russia's aggression. This  vote reaffirms the values that we stand for and unequivocally  demonstrates that the world stands with Ukraine.   In this dark time, the United States has helped usher unprecedented  amounts of assistance from the United States, Europe, and our allies  and partners from all around the world, from North Africa to North  America to the Indo-Pacific, to aid Ukraine in defense of its nation. I  believe we must sustain that assistance as long as Ukrainians fight for  a democratic future free from Russian oppression.   The defensive security assistance we have provided and continue to  provide Ukraine to help fend off its autocratic invader is absolutely  critical.   Also, it is of utmost importance that we continue to surge  humanitarian aid to Ukraine and the countries in the region accepting  the growing influx of refugees. As of yesterday, nearly 700,000 had  left their homes, left their country to seek safety, unsure of whether  they will ever again see their homes. Estimates project that that  number will quickly reach into the millions, as well as those who are  displaced but remain in Ukraine.   Our allies in Europe have acted admirably, so they have been  accepting those fleeing the destruction. We must do our part to help  them as well.   Amidst all the bloodshed, we are seeing astounding courage displayed  by President Zelensky, the Ukrainian Government, and, above all, the  Ukrainian people. We are also seeing the unity of the transatlantic  alliance, more unified than ever in the face of Vladimir Putin's war.   The people of Ukraine must continue to hear a message of loud and  clear support from us, the United States Congress. They must see that  we see their suffering, that we stand with them in their fight against  an authoritarian invader, and that we will continue to usher as much  support to their cause as the United States can muster.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution outlines the plan and sheds an  indisputable light on the atrocities the Putin regime and the Russian  military are committing. It demands an immediate cease-fire and full  withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. It backs additional  coordinated economic measures to hold Putin accountable.   It reaffirms our NATO Article 5 commitments, reaffirms Ukrainian  sovereignty over Crimea and Donbas. It highlights the unprecedented  global multilateral efforts the Biden administration has helped usher.   It states our commitment in the United States Congress to support the  Ukrainian people throughout this terrifying ordeal and delivers perhaps  the most important message a resolution can deliver right now, that the  House of Representatives will never ever recognize any illegitimate  government that Putin hopes to install in Ukraine. It is up to the  Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian people alone to choose their  political leadership and their future.   I support this resolution, and I want to offer my sincerest thanks to  Representative Spartz, but also to my ranking member. We worked  diligently on this resolution, to make sure that this was a bipartisan  resolution. I appreciate Ranking Member McCaul for his friendship and  the way that we work together now, especially on this resolution.   Democrat and Republican leadership worked collectively also. For  working with me, I want to thank them. They have worked with me for  what I believe is a very strong message, a unified message, to support  the people of Ukraine.   It is also a unified message to Vladimir Putin, whose objective was  to divide us. He would have loved to have divided us from our European  allies, loved to divide us from NATO, loved to divide us from within.   But with this resolution, it becomes crystal clear: Mr. Putin, you  can't win this. We are going to stand against you, and we are going to  preserve democracy because that is what is at stake here.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Allred), who was walking the streets of Ukraine with us just a few  weeks ago.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Castro), the chair of the Subcommittee on International  Development, International Organizations, and Global Corporate Social  Impact.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the president of the NATO Parliamentary  Assembly, who has seen with his own eyes the unity that we now have  with our NATO allies.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio  (Ms. Kaptur), the cofounder and co-chair of the Ukraine Caucus, who has  worked on this her entire congressional career.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a dynamic Representative from the great State  of Texas.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Green), a dynamic Representative.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader  of the United States House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the camera of history is rolling on all of us today.  What is happening today children yet unborn will be studying and  looking at what we did, what we stood for, or did not. They will be  studying in their history books whether or not when democracy was at  stake, when sovereign nations were in peril, whether or not we stood up  and stood out to protect freedom, sovereignty of states, independence,  or not.   The fact of the matter is, if we don't stand up now, those same  children that I am talking about may not be able to live in a  democratic society. That is why this is so important.   Putin may think that he is encircling Kyiv now, but this United  Nations vote, where 141 nations said they are not going to allow that  to happen, is encircling Putin and his thugs. And we will stay there  for as long as it takes until freedom rings because that is what this  is all about.   I think of today those that I met when I was in Kyiv, those that I  had dinner with, those that worked in our U.S. Embassy, those that were  driving taxis. As I see the pictures of them walking these streets  today in front of Russian tanks, unafraid--I saw a picture of a woman  standing and pointing at a Russian soldier, saying they would die there  before she gives up. That is what this is all about.   The words that the activist told me while I was in Kyiv, that we are  ready to fight, just provide us the support that we need to protect our  country and freedom.   Slava Ukraini. Glory to Ukraine and its people.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McCaul and Congresswoman Spartz for working  with me so that we can make a bipartisan message right here on the  people's floor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
