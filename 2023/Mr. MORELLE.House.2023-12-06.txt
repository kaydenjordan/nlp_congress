 Mr. Speaker, today I stand to honor Garth Fagan, a  Rochester visionary who profoundly influenced the cultural fabric of  not only our local community but the entire world.   As we pay tribute to this extraordinary artist, I acknowledge and  celebrate the deep connection between Garth Fagan and the people and  places enriched by his vision.   Committed to Rochester's artistic growth, he established the Bottom  of the Bucket, But . . . Dance Theater in 1970, now known simply as  Garth Fagan Dance.   Since then, Garth has inspired and nurtured a new generation of  talented artists from around the globe. His innovative choreography has  earned him accolades, including a Tony award for Broadway's ``The Lion  King,'' a production masterfully blending culture and creativity, which  will remain forever a testament to his artistic brilliance.   Garth Fagan is truly a national treasure. As he transitions away from  his leadership role in the dance company, his profound impact will  undoubtedly continue to resonate--captivating audiences for generations  to come.                            ____________________
