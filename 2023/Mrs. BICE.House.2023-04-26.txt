 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Limit, Save,  Grow Act of 2023.   Like any family, Republicans are proposing living within our means,  not continuing to rack up a balance on American taxpayers' credit card.  In contrast, President Biden has unilaterally spent $1.5 trillion on  over 800 executive actions.   My colleagues want to quote the former President. Let me quote  President Biden; a direct quote from 2012. He said securing a deal with  Republicans was a ``great honor.'' He hasn't bothered to come to the  negotiating table, Mr. Speaker. What has changed?   The three main pillars of this legislation will benefit hardworking  Americans by limiting Federal spending, saving taxpayer dollars, and  growing the economy.   I am especially pleased to see key energy provisions included in this  package. The best way to lower prices is to cut spending and unleash  American energy, allowing States like Oklahoma to power our Nation.   Cutting bureaucratic red tape is especially important for energy  producers who have dealt with stifling regulations at the hands of  President Biden.    Mr. Speaker, America is $31 trillion in debt, and the  American people are demanding solutions. The White House says, show me  your proposal, and we can negotiate.   Well, Mr. President, it is time to come to the table and do so in  good faith. We must get this done.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this effort.
