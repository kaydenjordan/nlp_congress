 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I just heard Leader McConnell, my good  friend, rail on and on. First, he doesn't agree with Nancy Pelosi on  the wall. That is a surprise. Second, he doesn't like the fact that we  want to get a vote to open up the government before we move forward on  S. 1. We know that. His arguments are getting kind of old and stale.   I will say to the leader, very simply--you may disagree with us: Open  the government. Open the government. You can do it, Leader McConnell.  All your blaming and flailing isn't going to open the government. We  all know Donald Trump is the obstacle here. You know it. I know it. We  all know it. The only way to help all the folks who need help is to  open the government.   There are a good number of Republicans on your side who have  advocated that already. To hold the government hostage, you are losing  the argument. You are losing it with the public. An overwhelming  majority of Americans think the government should not be shut down over  a wall. Even a substantial number of people who support the wall say:  Don't shut down the government to get the wall.   We have problems on the border. A lot of Americans don't think it is  a crisis that demands hurting our economy and our government.   Leader McConnell, we know you disagree with Leader Pelosi and me on  what should be border security. We know you think we should pass S. 1  before we open up the government. Leader, you--you--can open the  government. That is what the American people want, and I dare say that  is what most of your colleagues want, at least if they talk to you  privately.   It seems that every day the Trump shutdown drags on, we read another  story about a new way it is hurting our economy. Eight hundred thousand  public servants have been without pay, including thousands of veterans  who work for the Federal Government. Each one of those Americans has a  different story about how the shutdown is hurting them and their  families. As nine essential Cabinet Departments remain shuttered, we  are learning that the effects of the shutdown are even more widespread  and continue to worsen. Yesterday, President Trump's own White House  Council of Economic Advisers doubled their projections of how much  economic growth is being lost each week during the shutdown.   Let me repeat that. The Trump administration's own economic advisers  have just said that the Trump shutdown will substantially hurt our  economy--twice as much as they originally  [[Page S235]]  predicted. Growth is down. Economic and consumer confidence is down.  Billions of dollars have been pulled out of our economy. Some of the  leading financial leaders in the country are now saying we might even  go into contraction in the first part of this year if this shutdown  continues.   Do you think, Leader McConnell, that is benefiting Donald Trump? Do  you think, Leader McConnell, that is benefiting the Republican Party,  who the Americans know own the shutdown? No. Let's open the government  and then debate our differences on border security and whatever else.   Why is our country suffering self-inflicted damage? Because President  Trump is using the American government as leverage in an attempt to  extract taxpayer money for a border wall he promised Mexico would pay  for.   He says: You know, I hear Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity: He promised  this in the campaign.   No, he didn't. He promised a wall that Mexico would pay for. He never  said once, that I can recall, in the campaign: But if Mexico doesn't  pay for it, we will pay for it.   Of course people voted for it--or some, not that many. This is  ridiculous. The President makes a campaign promise. He twists the  campaign promise around and now shuts down the government so he can  show he is keeping not the promise he made but a different one. It  would sound ridiculous and absurd if it weren't the reality.   The fact of the matter is that eight Cabinet Departments not named  Homeland Security have absolutely nothing--nothing--to do with our  disagreements over border security. That is why Democrats have offered,  and continue to offer, to reopen the government while we debate border  security.   Again, three words for Leader McConnell again: Open the government.   Three words to my Republican colleagues: Open the government.   Three words to President Trump: Open the government.   Then, we can have all the discussion and debating, as we are supposed  to do, on these issues where we don't agree.   Democrats have made entirely reasonable proposals. We proposed to  open the government by passing Republican spending bills from the last  Congress so there would be no controversy. These are not bills the  Democrats put together. These are bills the Republicans put together  with some Democratic input. Leader McConnell voted for every one of  them--every one of them.   As for this idea that he will not move unless Trump agrees, that may  have made sense in the first week or two. It makes no sense now because  President Trump is adamant, all over the lot, and seems unwilling and  unable to tie himself out of his own knots to get the government open.  Someone should step in. On our side, we are willing to step in. Where  is Leader McConnell? Where are the Republicans?   The American people support passing our bills--bills that we have  asked unanimous consent for by wide margins--two to one, including  nearly 40 percent of Republicans. Forty percent of Republicans support  passing our bills and then debating.   So, Mr. President, even your prized base--a good chunk of it, about a  third--is turning away from you on this issue.   When will the President and my Republican colleagues wake up to the  hardship being inflicted on so many people across the country? It is  time that the Senate act on House-passed bills to open the government.   The President, we know, is inflexible. He is ``proud,'' as he said,  to have shut down the government. He is, amazingly--never seen a  President like this--impervious to the pain and suffering of Federal  workers and the American people. He makes stuff up: Oh, the Federal  workers want the wall. Who? Two people who are on FOX News all the time  who are part of a Border Patrol union? That is it, not the average  worker.   The President has refused all entreaties to open up the government by  Democrats and Republicans, like my friend Senator Graham--one of the  President's biggest allies in this Chamber.   His deputies are hardly even empowered to negotiate with the Hill  since President Trump retracts their offers almost as soon as they are  made. Everyone--everyone--can see how fruitless it is to try and  negotiate with this President at the moment.   My friend Leader McConnell is the one who can break the impasse. He  has declared before that ``he is the guy who gets us out of  shutdowns.'' He was proud of that. I wish he were still proud of it.   I think we are all ready for that, Leader McConnell, because so long  as Leader McConnell hides behind the President and the President's  absurd and destructive shutdown strategy, the Senate will be unable to  vote on broadly popular legislation to reopen the government.   The longer Leader McConnell allows this to continue, the more he and  Republican Senators will be tied to the President and the President's  disgraceful tactic of government by extortion.                                    Russia    Mr. President, last night, the Senate voted to proceed to the  resolution to disapprove the Treasury Department's plans to relax  sanctions on Russia, and 11 Republicans--I am proud of that, proud of  them--joined with every Democrat to advance the resolution, which will  face a cloture vote today. Two or three more Republican votes will  ensure cloture is invoked and the passage of the resolution achieved.  So I would like to make a direct appeal to my Republican friends who  are wondering about this.   This resolution is about a very simple thing. Do you believe America  should take a tough line on Putin or do you think we should go easy on  Putin and his cronies? From where I am standing, that is an easy  choice.   The past half decade has seen Putin expand his malign activities  around the world, from invading Ukraine and Georgia to annexing Crimea,  to propping up the brutal Assad regime in Syria, to directing nerve  agent attacks on foreign soil.   Russian intelligence has tried to destabilize Western democracies at  every opportunity--France, England, many other European countries, and  most obviously here in the United States. As proof positive, they go  online, they try to sow dissension in America, this beautiful country.   As Leader McConnell said yesterday--confusingly, before voting  against the resolution--``We have long seen Vladimir Putin for the KGB  thug that he is.'' Those are strong words but accurate.   In the face of this global assault on Western democracies, of course  we have seen that the Trump administration has been shamefully and  suspiciously weak on President Putin. The President has avoided  criticizing Putin at every turn. When asked about President Putin's  brutal tactics against his opponents, President Trump demurs.   When this body, near unanimously, passed the Russian sanction  legislation, President Trump contemplated vetoing it.   When President Putin told President Trump he didn't interfere in our  2016 elections, the President reportedly said: I believe you.   Last weekend, we learned that President Trump has expressed a desire  to withdraw from NATO this summer--the past summer is when he expressed  the desire. That is Putin's dream--Putin's dream. All the advice of our  military and diplomatic leaders were against it. Somehow, the President  wants to do it, and who benefits the most? Putin. Who loses the most?  The West.   Now, with this proposed sanctions relief, we have another example of  President Trump trying to lighten the burden on Putin's oligarchs. We  should not allow it.   For a very long time, the Republican Party predicated its foreign  policy on taking a tougher line against Russia and Putin. In so many  campaigns for President, we Democrats were accused of not being tough  enough on the Russians. I have always felt we have to be tough on the  Russians, but it seems acquiescence to the President, a fear of  breaking with the President, has held back too many of my Republican  colleagues from supporting this resolution.   The resolution, just to repeat, is sort of--I know Treasury made an  effort, although I don't have much faith in the strength. I think the  Secretary of Treasury is an intelligent man, but he never stands up to  Trump, and I don't have any faith in his strength in standing up this  time. So if Trump wanted a  [[Page S236]]  weakened resolution because maybe Putin or the Russians wanted it, that  is what we have here.   Forty-five percent control is not--45 percent ownership, which is  what this does, takes Deripaska out of this? Forget it. Then add to his  45 percent the 7 percent the in-laws own, that the large percentage  that Russian banks--controlled by Putin--own, the control is just as  tight as it was before. The people who were put in charge have close  relationships with Russia. This is not a strong resolution. It is  slightly less than a joke--slightly less than a joke.   So I hope some of our colleagues will come around. This is all about  America, the West, the stability of our Nation, and if Putin thinks he  can manipulate our country and manipulate the President and too many of  my colleagues who have always been strong against Russia go along, what  is he going to do next? What is he going to ask President Trump to do  next, and what will President Trump do?   I yield the floor.
