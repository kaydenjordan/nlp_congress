 Madam President, a few months ago, I spoke on this floor  about Mark Swidan, who has been unjustly imprisoned by the Chinese  Communist Party for over a decade. Mark is from Luling, a small city in  my home State of Texas. His mother, Miss Katherine Swidan, still lives  in Luling. And for the last 11 years, Mark has endured a living hell,  trapped in a Chinese prison. He is exposed to extreme heat and extreme  cold. He is deprived of sleep. He is subjected to physical abuse. Mark  has also been denied access to his family and to American diplomats.   And in 2019, a Chinese court sentenced Mark to death. Mark is being  unjustly held by the Chinese Communist Party as a hostage. The CCP  tells us that China is a great power, but this is how Third World thugs  and dictators act.   I called for Mark's immediate release and called on the Biden  administration to use any and every available means to secure Mark's  freedom.   I am deeply distressed that since my speech on the floor a few months  ago, Mark's plight has deepened. Recently, a Chinese court reaffirmed  the death sentence imposed on him with a suspension for 2 years.   That is wrong, and it is outrageous. We need Mark to come home.   It is worth revealing how breathtakingly, infuriatingly unjust all of  this is. How did it happen? On November 13, 2012, Mark was abducted by  China's Public Security Bureau while he was in China on a business  trip. A witness to the abduction said that Mark was detained because  Chinese officials wanted to view the contents of his cell phone.   The Chinese officials accused Mark of being part of a criminal  conspiracy to  [[Page S1588]]  manufacture and traffic drugs with 11 other individuals--charges that  Mark has denied and which have been debunked over and over again.   Chinese officials tried to coerce Mark into confessing. Mark refused  and pleaded not guilty in a trial in November 2013. During the trial,  the prosecution didn't produce any forensic evidence to back up their  allegations, and no drugs--zero--were ever found on Mark or in his  hotel room. Mark's passport and other records show that he wasn't even  in China at the time of the alleged offenses, and the 11 other  individuals indicted in relation to this alleged drug conspiracy--none  of them could identify Mark. The charges against Mark were completely  bogus and false.   Meanwhile, Mark's mom Katherine is aching to see her son again. Her  heart is breaking. This is a mom who wants to hold and hug and care for  the son she loves.   I have been working with the Biden administration, and I have been  pushing Chinese officials at a senior level to release Mark, but more  needs to be done, and it needs to be done much more quickly.   Now, Secretary of State Blinken was planning to travel to China in  February, and we had been pressing the State Department to make Mark's  case a major priority for the Biden administration on the trip. Then  what happened? A Chinese spy balloon came over the United States, and  Secretary Blinken canceled his trip.   It is time to apply more pressure on the Chinese Communist Party to  let Mark go and let him come home to Texas.   Madam President, the Chinese Communist Government is a tyrannical  government. They don't like it when you turn up the heat. They don't  like it when you shine a light on their atrocities. There is power in  shining a light, and there is power in unity.   We need to bring Mark home. In a moment, I am going to propound a  live UC request on a resolution I have introduced with my colleague  from Texas, Senator John Cornyn. When it passes, the Senate will, with  one unanimous bipartisan voice, reiterate these declarations.   The resolution calls on the CCP to immediately release Mark. It  condemns China from withholding from Mark access to his family, to  diplomats, and to proper and independent medical care. And it calls on  the Biden administration to prioritize efforts to secure Mark's  release, both in their conversations with Chinese diplomats and in  international forums.   No opportunity should be lost in urging Chinese officials, at every  level of engagement, to release Mark. The Biden administration must use  the voice and the vote of American diplomats to highlight his case.   This resolution has already passed the House. It will now pass the  Senate. The United States Congress is with a united and unanimous voice  condemning and calling to end the unjust imprisonment of Mark Swidan by  the Chinese Communist Party. Enough is enough.   Madam President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 53, S.  Res. 23.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
