 Madam President, it has now been more than 4 months since  Daniel Ortega's police arrested and subsequently disappeared political  opposition leaders Felix Maradiaga and Juan Sebastian Chamorro in  Nicaragua. On June 8, police stopped Maradiaga's vehicle, forcibly  removed him, and took him away. Later that day, over 40 police officers  forced their way into Chamorro's home and arrested him as well. For  nearly 3 months, they were held in undisclosed locations, without  access to their lawyers, doctors, or families and without being charged  with any crime. They were reportedly kept in solitary confinement,  subjected to frequent interrogations, deprived of sleep, and they have  each lost 20 to 25 pounds.   In August, they were indicted for operating an international  conspiracy to funnel foreign resources ``to provide logistical support  and create favorable conditions to harm the supreme interests of the  nation.'' These charges, which are blatantly political, were brought  before an unnamed judge in a secret hearing in which their lawyers were  not permitted to be present. This is what is called ``justice'' in  Nicaragua today. Nothing more than a sham process intended to silence  Daniel Ortega's political opposition, and it is yet another example of  the flagrant repression and abuses of human rights that have become a  trademark of his government.   This summer alone, more than 30 other opposition leaders were  subjected to similar abuses, and the government is reportedly currently  unlawfully detaining more than 150 political prisoners, including  former Ambassador to the United States Arturo Cruz who is known to many  of us. He was kept in solitary confinement for approximately 80 days,  has reportedly lost 40 pounds, and is even denied access to reading  material so he has almost no way of learning about current events  outside the prison walls.   There is only one explanation for such blatant injustices and cruelty  inflicted on individuals who have done nothing that would remotely  amount to a crime under international law or in most countries of the  world, and that is that Daniel Ortega is afraid. He knows that if he  allows a free and fair election, he and his wife Rosario Murillo, the  Vice President, would almost certainly lose.  [[Page S7337]]    The sad reality is that it did not have to be this way. Ortega could  have chosen a different path, and won the support of the Nicaraguan  people by trusting them and treating them with respect, and allowing  those with different views to speak freely. Instead, he chose  repression and has held onto power through force and by blaming  everyone but himself for Nicaragua's chronic under-development. On  November 7, with the opposition silenced and hidden away, he and his  wife will likely be victorious in another sham election, a farce that  will fool nobody.   I join those in condemning the repressive tactics of the Ortega  government and in calling for the immediate and unconditional release  of Felix Maradiaga, Juan Sebastian Chamorro, Arturo Cruz, and the many  other political prisoners falsely accused or imprisoned without charge.  I urge the Nicaraguan Government to end the repression of dissidents,  the shootings of peaceful protestors, and the crackdown on press  freedom and voting rights.   It is no secret that the United States and Nicaragua have had a  difficult history. The United States was the primary benefactor of the  dictatorial Somoza family, which ruled the country for more than four  decades, enriching themselves and their cronies, and brutalizing their  opponents. Daniel Ortega had the opportunity to be different, but to  many Nicaraguans and international observers, he and his wife are even  worse.   The Biden administration has already responded to this summer's  arrests by imposing sanctions on four members of the Ortega government  and has denied access to visas for 169 Nicaraguans in response to the  political crackdown. The U.S. actions encouraged the EU and Canada to  also impose targeted sanctions on Nicaraguans complicit in politically  motivated crimes.   I commend the Biden administration, the EU, and the Canadian  Governments for standing up for the rule of law and the rights of the  people of Nicaragua. I urge the White House to investigate the assets  and holdings of the Nicaraguan armed forces in the U.S. and to consider  appropriate actions to hold its leadership accountable for their role  in the gross violations of human rights in that country. I encourage  President Biden to use every diplomatic tool and every form of targeted  sanctions to obtain the release of Daniel Ortega's prisoners and to  create the conditions for a genuinely free, fair, and transparent  election in Nicaragua.                            ____________________
