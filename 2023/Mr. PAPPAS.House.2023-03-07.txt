 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Takano for yielding and for his  leadership, along with Chairman Bost, in getting this legislation to  floor.   I thank Representatives McMorris Rodgers and Bergman for cosponsoring  this bill, which covers an important issue, emergency care coverage for  veterans under the Community Care program.   This would close a glaring gap in emergency care for veterans who are  transitioning from DOD to VA care. Right now, VA's failure to cover  emergency care during this transitional period can result in a  crippling amount of debt for veterans who need this kind of care.   These coverage gaps are all too common for our veterans. I have heard  about it from my own constituents. In my first month in office, I was  contacted by a veteran in Danville, New Hampshire, who put off seeking  care for a medical emergency because he was unsure that VA would cover  this care.   No veteran should ever think twice about seeking care during a  medical emergency or be faced with exorbitant medical bills as a result  of this care, so let's eliminate this gap for veterans who are recently  enrolled in VA care. This is an important step forward represented by  this legislation. There is certainly more work to do, but I urge my  colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation today.
