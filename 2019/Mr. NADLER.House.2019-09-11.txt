 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Maloney for yielding  and for all her work over the years on this issue.   It is hard to believe it has been 18 years. Like many New Yorkers, 9/ 11 seems both long ago and immediate, a memory and something I live  with every day.   I was in Washington that morning and immediately rushed back to New  York by train. I saw the smoking wreckage in Lower Manhattan from the  train window and expected chaos in the city, but, when I exited Penn  Station that evening, I was struck by the silence.   It was like a scene from out of the movie ``On the Beach.'' The city  seemed empty. No cars, no people, no vehicles, no buses, nothing on the  streets--just the strange odor that hung in the air.   Knowing the terror and confusion happening just 40 blocks south, the  silence was eerie.   But, as we recall the fear and grief of September 11, we cannot  forget the courage we saw that morning and in the days, weeks, and  months following the attack: the firefighters who ran into those  buildings, the police officers who searched for survivors, the  coworkers who carried each other down endless stairs, the strangers on  the street who guided each other to safety, the construction workers  who spent months clearing debris.   The legacy of 9/11 is not just one of tragedy and grief; it is one of  courage, self-sacrifice, and community; it is one of the American  people, through Congress, appropriating $20 billion to help New York  begin to recover from the terrorist attack.   But history would not be complete if we did not acknowledge that the  Federal Government exacerbated the massive environmental disaster  caused by the collapse of the World Trade Center by insisting, contrary  to ample evidence, that the air in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn was  safe to breathe.   Thousands of responders, from all over the country, worked on the  World Trade Center site with minimal or no protective equipment.   The Federal Government did not step in to conduct the necessary  comprehensive cleanup of the schools, offices, and residences in Lower  Manhattan. Instead, students were sent back to schools caught in a dust  cloud before the ventilation systems were cleaned. Residents and office  workers were sent back to buildings covered in asbestos.   I joined a few environmental groups in trying to warn people that  they could not believe the assurances of EPA administrator Christine  Todd Whitman and Mayor Giuliani that the air was not safe to breathe,  that people should not return to school or to work without respiratory  protection and until a proper cleanup was done.   Eventually, we forced the government to acknowledge those lies and to  provide healthcare and resources for those clearly made sick by their  exposure to those toxins.   As subcommittee chair, I held the first hearings to hold the EPA and  former EPA administrator Whitman accountable for putting hundreds of  thousands at risk. Those hearings were held in 2007.    Working with Congresswoman Maloney, Congressman King, and my  colleagues in New York and New Jersey, we finally got Congress to come  together in 2010 to pass the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation  Act, to establish a national health program, and to reopen the Victim  Compensation Fund to provide support to sick responders and survivors.   In 2015, as these programs were about to expire, we made the Health  Program permanent, but reauthorized the VCF for only 5 years.   This year, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I was incredibly  proud and moved to hold a hearing on the need for additional time and  money for the VCF.   We heard heartbreaking testimony from sick responders and survivors:  a firefighter, an FBI agent, a former high school student, the widow of  a construction worker, and the late Detective Luis Alvarez, who passed  away from a 9/11-related cancer just weeks after testifying.   The very next day, the committee unanimously passed the bill to make  the fund permanent, to restore any cuts to past awards, and to ensure  the Victim Compensation Fund had all the necessary funding going  forward.   That bill passed the full House and Senate and went straight to the  President's desk, where it was signed into law.   Creating the Health Program and the Victim Compensation Fund and  making those programs permanent count among the proudest moments of my  time as a Member of Congress. Through these programs, we are finally  living up to the challenge Abraham Lincoln laid before us in his second  inaugural address, that we must care for him who shall have borne the  battle, and for his widow and his orphan.  [[Page H7654]]                                     time  1800    We will never forget 9/11. We will never forget those who perished on  that day from the terrorist attacks, and we will never abandon those  who battled that day and still bear the scars.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Maloney for hosting this Special  Order hour with me and for being such a champion for the survivors and  responders over the years.   I thank each of our colleagues who come to the floor this evening to  remember those we lost and thank all of our colleagues who joined us in  voting for and renewing the 9/11 healthcare act.
