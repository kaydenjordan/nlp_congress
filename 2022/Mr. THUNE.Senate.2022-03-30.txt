 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, American families are currently struggling  with the worst inflation in 40 years--40 years. Food prices, gas  prices, used car prices--everywhere Americans look, they are paying  more. Wages increased on average last year, but inflation outstripped  wage growth, which means that, instead of a wage increase, a lot of  Americans got a de facto pay cut. And there is no clear end in sight.   It is no wonder that nearly two-thirds of the American people  disapprove of President Biden's handling of the economy, and they are  right to do so because Democrats bear a substantial part of the  responsibility for this inflation crisis. While it is true that supply  chain issues and the reopening of economies after COVID shutdowns  contributed somewhat to inflationary pressures, a big part of the  reason for our current inflation crisis is the Democrats' decision to  pass the American Rescue Plan last March.   The very definition of ``inflation'' is too many dollars chasing too  few goods and services, and that is exactly the situation that  Democrats helped create with their so-called American Rescue Plan.  Democrats took control mere weeks after Congress had passed a fifth-- fifth--bipartisan COVID relief bill totaling more than $900 billion and  meeting essentially all current, pressing COVID needs.   It was abundantly clear that we were not in immediate need of  trillions more in government spending, but that didn't stop Democrats.  Now that they were in charge, they were eager to take advantage of the  COVID crisis to begin implementing their Big Government vision.   So, in the name of COVID relief, they pushed through a massive,  partisan, $1.9 trillion piece of legislation filled with unnecessary  spending and handouts to Democrat interest groups, and the outcome was  entirely predictable. Democrats flooded the economy with unnecessary  government money, and the economy overheated as a result.   Unfortunately, there is no going back and undoing the American Rescue  Plan Act; although, given the inflation crisis it helped create, I  wonder if some Democrats wish they could go back and undo it.   There is no easy fix for Democrats' self-inflicted inflation crisis,  but there are things that we can do to at least lessen its effects,  starting with legislation to help ease supply chain woes.   Last week, the Senate Commerce Committee reported my bipartisan  shipping legislation out of committee by voice vote. The Ocean Shipping  Reform Act, which I introduced with Senator Klobuchar, would help ease  supply chain pressures by improving the fluidity of the supply chain.   For some time now, I have been hearing reports of ocean carriers  refusing to transport certain goods, often American agricultural  products. This would be a difficult situation at any time, as export  markets around the world are critically important to American  producers, but it is particularly painful at a time when inflation is  soaring and the supply chain is under significant strain.   The Ocean Shipping Reform Act is designed to address these kinds of  shipping problems and create a more level playing field for American  producers. Our legislation would give the Federal Maritime Commission  increased authority to respond to unfair ocean carrier practices  whether that involves a refusal to carry certain cargo, like  agricultural commodities, or discriminating against certain commodities  for export.   Our bill would also provide the FMC with tools to more quickly  resolve detention and demurrage disputes, which would bring greater  efficiency and transparency to a process that leaves many shippers  frustrated, especially agricultural producers and other small  businesses; and our legislation would take steps to improve the  movement of goods at our Nation's ports, which would help ease supply  chain bottlenecks and improve the speed at which goods reach consumers.   The Ocean Shipping Reform Act would bring long-term positive changes  to the maritime supply chain, which I hope would benefit exporters,  importers, and consumers alike.   I was very pleased that our legislation received strong bipartisan  support in the Commerce Committee, and I hope it can swiftly pass here  in the  [[Page S1844]]  Senate. This is the kind of bill that we should be working on if we  want to help alleviate our inflation situation and improve the economy.   I was dismayed to see that the President's budget, which was released  this week, would double down on the kind of excessive government  spending that helped get us into this inflation crisis in the first  place. After a year of progressively worsening inflation, you would  think Democrats would have learned their lesson, but, clearly, the  President is still intent on more reckless spending, coupled, I might  add, with job-killing tax hikes--and not just any tax hikes. According  to Bloomberg, the President's budget would add up to being the largest  tax hike in American history in dollar terms.   I hope that my Democratic colleagues here in Congress will decide to  skip the President's irresponsible tax-and-spending proposals and focus  on measures that would actually help alleviate this inflation crisis,  not make it worse.   While there is no easy fix for our inflation situation, we can start  to make things better for Americans with bipartisan legislation like  the Ocean Shipping Reform Act. I hope my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle will support the legislation Senator Klobuchar and I have  produced.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey).
