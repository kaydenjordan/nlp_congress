 Mr. President, I want to start by thanking the Senator  from Minnesota for her remarks just now.   I rise with her and to join Senator Duckworth and our colleagues in  responding to the shameful comments that President Trump reportedly  made about our servicemembers.   I want to begin by thanking Senator Duckworth for leading us in this  effort and for her service to our country, as I thank all of the  Members of the U.S. Senate and all of the staff of the U.S. Senate who  have served their country and all of their families.   One of our Nation's greatest strengths is the countless Americans  who, throughout our history, have been willing to sacrifice everything  to keep us safe and preserve our freedom.   In New Hampshire, we are proud to be home to a high percentage of  servicemembers, veterans, and their families. In my experience, people  in my State--and all across the country--revere the bravery and  sacrifices of those who serve and those who have served.   We may disagree about policy matters, including those that impact  when and where servicemembers are deployed, but the respect that we  have for servicemembers, veterans, and their families must be  undisputed.   It is the President's duty to honor the sacrifices of our troops, to  care for them, to support them and their fallen comrades. The role of  the President of the United States of America is not just limited to  being the Commander in Chief. Presidents should also lead by example  and represent the values of the American people.   Unfortunately, President Trump has, yet again, expressed his disdain  and lack of understanding of why people sacrifice for our freedom and  democracy. This is a failure of leadership, and it is a failure of  basic citizenship that is out of step with most Americans.   Last year, I joined a bipartisan group of Senators to travel to  burial grounds in both France and Belgium, as we paid our respects to  our World War II fallen servicemembers. It was the honor of a lifetime.  It was also deeply personal, as my dad served in the Battle of the  Bulge.   Standing on those hallowed grounds was a powerful reminder of the  loss of war, of those heroes who gave everything to fight against  fascism and to protect freedom.   We owe these heroes our profound gratitude and our deepest respect.  Yet, when speaking of servicemembers who were killed or captured, the  President referred to these heroes as ``suckers'' and ``losers.'' For  such words to come from the President of the United States is an  affront to all that we stand for, and it is beneath the office that he  holds. Unfortunately, these comments were not surprising given the  President's long line of denigrating comments against those who have  served, including the late Senator John McCain, Gold Star families, and  other American heroes.   The resolution that we are introducing today recognizes the  unmeasurable debt that we owe to those who have valiantly served our  country, as well as their families. This resolution condemns the  repeated disrespect that this President has bestowed upon them. My  colleagues on both sides of the aisle have seen the hurtful comments  President Trump has made about members of our military. Every single  one of us should condemn them.   I will close with this: My father didn't talk about his service in  World War II very often, but he did talk about his unit, a group of men  who came from as diverse backgrounds as our country is large. They had  their disagreements. They didn't agree on politics. But they came  together every day to win that war.   Of course, they knew that their lives depended on their unity, their  cohesion, but they knew something else too, and this is what my dad  always reminded us of. Sometimes, at the breakfast table, he would look  up at us and say: ``What are you doing for freedom today?'' It was a  question he had the right to ask because he was remembering his unit of  men from all over the country, from all different life experiences, who  knew that freedom, their country--our country--the United States of  America, is worth fighting for.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Kendra  Smith of Nashua as August's Granite Stater of the Month. At a time when  so many are facing financial uncertainty, Kendra is selflessly working  to provide substantial and popular hot meals to community members in  need amid this public health and economic crisis.   Kendra has lived in Nashua for 29 years and knows her community well.  As a food service assistant in New Hampshire's school system and an  entrepreneur who founded a soul food cuisine catering business early  last year, Kendra is exceedingly familiar with how food insecurity  affects children and teenagers in Nashua.   When schools began to shut down due to COVID-19, Kendra knew that  many students in her community were at  [[Page S5509]]  risk of going hungry without school-provided meals. Kendra, whose  background in catering and food service has given her plenty of  practice serving a lot of food on a tight budget, started a program to  help get hot meals to those in need.   Feed the Children is a nonprofit organization that Kendra started  through her catering company, Soel (Simply Offering Edible Love)  Sistas, LLC. Her organization is fueled by the generosity of people in  her community, who support the effort by, among other things, making  small donations and holding food drives.   Twice a week, Kendra and her team drive to neighborhoods around  Nashua and distribute hot meals to families in need, while following  social distancing guidance. Menu items include burgers, chicken and  rice bowls, chips, granola bars, and fruit.   Food insecurity affects communities across our State and our country,  and in times like these, it is especially important that we come  together to support those in need. I am proud to recognize Kendra's  initiative, generosity, and pragmatism in naming her August 2020's  Granite Stater of the Month. She exemplifies the best of New Hampshire  and shows what can be done when we come together as a community during  challenging times.                            ____________________
