 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  importance of teaching climate change in schools.   This Friday, on September 20, students from around the world will be  protesting the need to combat climate change. Led by Greta Thunberg, a  climate activist from Sweden who boldly skipped school to protest the  need for more climate action, her act of defiance has evolved into a  movement and set precedent for a generation of climate activism. More  than 25 percent of America's students are taking action to urge us to  address climate change.   In order to meaningfully act upon our climate change and eliminate  climate change, young people need education on its causes,  consequences, and possible solutions. That is why I am introducing a  resolution to support climate change education in American schools.   It is a fact that American students do not learn enough about climate  change. We need to teach every young person the human impacts of  climate change and how to address our warming planet before it is too  late. I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution and to  hear the voices of the students protesting in Friday's climate strikes.                            ____________________
