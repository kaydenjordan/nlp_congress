 Madam President, I call up amendment No. 5262, and I ask  that it be reported by number.    Madam President, I rise on behalf of nearly 4\1/2\  million Americans in 12 States, including 646,000 Georgians who, a  decade after the Affordable Care Act became law, still do not have  access to affordable healthcare. They are the working poor. They are  being blocked by Governors and legislatures.   But, sadly, today they are being betrayed by this body. The bill we  are about to pass will rightly strengthen healthcare access for  millions of Americans, but how do we justify doing that while leaving  the hard-working families in Georgia who gave us this power in the  first place and the other 11 nonexpansion States in the cold? My  amendment would simply extend the same subsidies to them.   If in this bill we can extend tax relief to hedge fund managers,  then, surely, we can extend tax credits as a lifeline to the working  poor.  [[Page S4191]]    This is a moral moment. The scripture says: Woe to those who crush  the poor.   I am asking my Democratic colleagues to do the right thing and close  this gap.    Madam President, pursuant to Section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and waiver provisions of applicable  budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections of that Act  and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the pending  amendment, and I ask for the yeas and the nays.
