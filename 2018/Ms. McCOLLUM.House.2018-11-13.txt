 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation  reauthorizing the President's Emergency Plan for HIV/AIDS Relief,  commonly referred to as PEPFAR, for an additional 5 years until 2023.   When this law was established in 2003, I was very proud to be a  member of the International Relations Committee. Thanks in large part  to the bipartisan leadership of Chairman Henry Hyde and Ranking Member  Tom Lantos, the original bill included dedicated funding that required  that at least 10 percent of the funds be used for orphans and  vulnerable children.                                time  1715    I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel, and I thank Chairman  Smith and Ranking Member Bass for maintaining support for the dedicated  OVC funding and ensuring this provision was restored when the Foreign  Affairs Committee marked up this bill in September.   Today, at least more than 12 million children worldwide have lost at  least one parent to HIV/AIDS, and at least 80 percent of these children  live in sub-Saharan Africa.   Of the 1.8 million children living with HIV/AIDS, only half have the  necessary antiretroviral treatment; and without this treatment, it is  expected that 80 percent will not make it to their fifth birthday.   The dedicated OVC funding in this bill ensures that these children  will continue to be a priority in our fight against HIV/AIDS in  responding directly to physical, emotional, and economic impacts HIV/ AIDS has on vulnerable children.   The OVC programs protect children from contracting HIV/AIDS, expand  access to high-quality healthcare services, work directly with families  and communities to strengthen capacity and resilience building, and  give these children a future.   We still have work to do, and these programs, we know they are  effective, and we know that they are working. As of September 2017,  PEPFAR had provided care and support to more than 6.4 million orphans  and vulnerable children and their caregivers worldwide.   I thank the Foreign Affairs Committee's leadership for ensuring this  critical funding provision was included in the final version of the  bill.
