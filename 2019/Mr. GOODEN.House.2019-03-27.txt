 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962,  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill which has the  full support of the Republican Conference and the majority of the  American people, as it would save the lives of liveborn infants that  have survived late-term abortions, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Madam Speaker, it is my understanding that the Republican  Conference is in full agreement. Is the Democratic conference not  onboard with saving lives?    Madam Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Madam Speaker, I would ask that we schedule a vote  immediately. The Republican Conference is fully onboard, and I would  encourage the Democrats to join us in protecting the infant lives that  are born.
