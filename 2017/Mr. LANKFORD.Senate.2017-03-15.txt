 Mr. President, I want to take the chance to have just a  moment to be able to reflect on what the Senate has just completed. We  have worked through a process of identifying what is called the  Congressional Review Act. Most Americans are not  [[Page S1835]]  familiar with this because it is so seldom used. In fact, it has only  been used one time before this Congress successfully.   It is a moment for the Congress to be able to look back at  regulations that have been promulgated by the administration and say:  Was that the intent of the law?   It is something that we have worked at for a long time to be able to  get as a frequent part of this national conversation. We call it the  REINS Act. It allows Congress to be able to look at each major  regulation when it comes out from the administration and ask the simple  question: When the regulations are created, are they consistent with  the statute? That is what regulations are. No administration can just  invent policy and say: We think this is a good thing to do. That is the  task of Congress. That is why the Constitution says that all  legislative powers shall reside in the Congress, because an  administration can't make up the law. It has to come from this body,  from the House of Representatives, and then be signed by the President.  After that is done, then regulations are created that have to be  consistent with the law.   The Congressional Review Act was created years ago to allow Congress  to have a second glance at regulations as they are put out and say: Is  that consistent with the statute we passed? This Congress has already  gone through multiples of those.   In the last 6 months of the Obama administration, many regulations  were created. When they were created, they were not consistent with the  statute. This Congress has already turned back billions of dollars of  regulations from the American people. One of those was done this week.  Ironically, it is an issue that deals with unemployment benefits and  drug testing.   Many States have requested the ability to be able to do drug testing  for unemployment benefits. And this is not a situation where this  Congress believes that all people on unemployment benefits need to be  drug tested or are unemployed because of drug use--far from it.   In 2012, Congress passed the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation  Act. In that, it allowed States, if they chose to--they don't have to  but if they chose to--to do drug testing for benefits eligibility, for  unemployment benefits under two circumstances. One of them is if the  applicant was terminated from their employment based on the unlawful  use of a controlled substance. In other words, if they were just fired  from a previous job because they were using drugs, they wouldn't be  able to get unemployment benefits because they had already been  certified as a drug user. The second one is that if the only available  suitable work meant that they had to be drug tested, then they could be  drug tested.   What is the design of this? The design of the policy was to encourage  people to get back to work. If they were fired from a previous job  because they used drugs, it is a natural thing to say: Before you can  get unemployment benefits, we want to make sure you have gotten off  drugs since that time period you were fired, or if you will be drug  tested for the only job that is available to you in your targeted area,  you are not available to be able to take that job if you haven't  already had some sort of drug testing.   It is a commonsense measure, and it is given to the States to say to  the States: You can choose to do this or not to do this, but if you  choose to do it, you can, because unemployment benefits are a  partnership between the Federal Government and local States.   We believe this is one tool of many to be able to help people who are  trapped in the addiction of drugs to have one more incentive to be able  to get off that addiction. Multiple different methods are also used  within States to enable them to walk alongside families and individuals  and help them get off their substance abuse habits as well.   It is a powerful motivator to say to people: If you want to get some  support into your family to help you transition back into a job, the  law says that to be on unemployment benefits, you have to be available  for work. And if this person is currently addicted to drugs and using  drugs, they are not available for work.   This measure was passed in 2012. The Obama administration took 4  years to promulgate the rules off of this commonsense measure, and once  they finally promulgated the rules, they created a set of rules so  complex, so complicated, with so many exceptions built into it, that  the rule meant nothing. It put us in the situation of saying: What  Congress passed 4 years ago, we actually wanted that to go into effect  to give those States the right to be able to do it.   So this Congress--the House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted  and this week the Senate also voted to be able to block out that last- minute regulation from the Obama administration, which they took 4  years to promulgate, and to be able to say to the States: If you choose  to do drug testing with someone who was fired from a previous job  because of drug use or because the only job available to that person  will have drug testing, if you want to help families be able to get off  substance abuse and to be able to set this standard for them, you can.   We have an epidemic of drug use in our Nation. We should do  everything we can to not only deal with the interdiction of drugs  coming into the country but to also deal with abuse of drugs in our  country. This is one of those measures, and I am glad my State and  other States will again have that opportunity to be able to use this.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on January 15, 2017, an incredible ice  storm came through my State. For some States that haven't seen ice  storms, they are beautiful, but boy are they destructive. As freezing  rain comes down, it lands on power lines, lands on trees, destroys the  trees, power lines come down, and it is incredibly difficult for  families and for regions when this happens. You can't move. You can't  function. You can't travel the streets because they are covered with  ice. It is very destructive.   The northwest part of our State experienced an ice storm like that on  January 15. That ice storm devastated the Woodward area and all over  the northwest--trees, debris, damage, power out for weeks in that area.   Then, in early March, it was starting to warm up. The forecasters  from the National Weather Service and the Forest Service saw the  forecast coming out of rapidly dropping humidity levels and very high  winds, with a lot of debris damage still in the area. It was the  perfect storm for wildfires.   They prepositioned assets in that area to be able to respond if they  broke out, but on March 6--just a week and a half ago--wildfires broke  out all across northwestern Oklahoma. Four large fires in particular  broke out simultaneously in multiple areas. Some of them were started  by some of those same power lines that were weakened by the ice storm.  Now the high winds--60 miles an hour--are taking down those weak power  lines, and they are striking the ground and starting a fire  spontaneously out in a field.   There were four individual fires across this area covering 315,000  acres just in Oklahoma. One of those fires spread straight across the  Kansas border and burned an additional 472,000 acres. To give you a  point of reference of how large these fires were, the total fire damage  that was done in acres is greater than the entire State of Rhode  Island. Twenty homes were destroyed, 3,000 cattle were killed in the  field, 6,500 hogs were killed, and 7 people died in the fire.   Let me give you a picture of what we faced in this area as I went out  last Friday with Senator Inhofe to tour the area both from the air and  on the ground and to talk to farmers and those individuals who are  trying to work through this very difficult process. Those farmers and  ranchers are facing something you can't even imagine in their fields.  For miles, there is no grass. The cattle that did survive the fire had  literally no food on their ranch for miles. Hundreds of miles of fence  line were taken down. Each mile of fence in Oklahoma, just a simple  barbed wire fence, costs about $10,000, and hundreds of miles of fence  line were destroyed.   We have animals that burned alive as they tried to escape the fire.  We had deer that, as they were running across the fields, got caught up  in the barbed wire fence and 16-mile-per-hour winds, and the 16-mile- an-hour flame caught up with the deer in the fence and burned them  alive as they tried to escape.  [[Page S1836]]    We have families who have lost absolutely everything.   We have volunteer firefighters across much of this area who would  literally be fighting the fire in one county in one area and hear on  the radio about how a fire had broken out in another county on a road  right near their own home, and literally volunteer firefighters  fighting one fire could hear on the radio about the destruction of  their home at a different fire.   In different places, the volunteer firefighters and those who were  gathered, both career and volunteers, would see a raging fire at the  home of their neighbor, of people they knew. In western Oklahoma, you  know your neighbors in that area. You know the folks in the county.  They would head out to a home as the fire was rushing at them and try  to fight it off, try to cut a fire line to be able to stop it.  Eventually, the fire would get so close, they would literally take  their fire equipment and park the equipment between the fire and the  home and spray down their equipment in hopes that the fire would jump  over the house as the firefighters just huddled behind their own  equipment hoping the fire didn't come to them. They saved several homes  by using that extreme method.   Neighbors took their own farm equipment and their own tractors and  created fire lines to be able to protect their neighbors' homes.   These small community firefighters fought fires for hours and hours.  They saved a lot of lives, and they saved a lot of structures.   I can't even begin to tell you the pain of walking through that area,  what has been described by many as walking across a moonscape of  destruction where there is literally nothing left.   What have we seen in that? I will state that what we have seen is a  tenacious spirit from people who survived an ice storm, were without  power for weeks in many areas, and then had a wildfire come right  behind it and destroy what was left. Over 20,000 bales of hay have  already been donated from farmers all over Oklahoma who are trying to  feed the cattle that are still left--20,000 bales. Understand the  expense of 20,000 bales of hay being donated but also understand the  efforts of all the truckdrivers who loaded up their vehicles and  personally paid the gas money and the travel expenses to be able to  deliver that hay over hundreds of miles to those folks. Oftentimes, the  travel of that truckdriver and the gas required are more expensive than  the hay that is in the back of it, and they are delivering as much as  they possibly can.   I have to thank the folks from the Farm Bureau; the Oklahoma  Cattlemen's Association; Western Equipment; Oklahoma Farm Credit; the  Red Cross of Oklahoma; the Salvation Army; the Oklahoma Department of  Agriculture; the Oklahoma Forestry Service; Southern Baptist Disaster  Relief; Oklahoma emergency management--first responders from all over  the State, volunteer and career firefighters who worked very long and  difficult hours. USDA and FEMA were also on site. I thank Harper County  Extension; all the emergency management folks from Beaver, Harper, and  Woodward Counties; all the folks who have donated, places like Love's  Travel Stops that have donated so much to be able to move things there;  the United Way; Cleanline Energy and their donations; and untold  numbers of civic organizations and churches from around that community.   As I looked at many of those folks in the area last week and met with  some leaders and pastors in the area, I reminded the folks that the  devastation they face is not something that will be recovered from  quickly. Springtime will come soon, and the area that is just black  earth right now will spring to life with green grass again in the weeks  ahead. But the loss of those fence lines, the loss of thousands of  animals, the loss of homes, the loss of structures, will take a very  long time for the folks--the farmers and ranchers who don't live on a  high profit margin.   I have continued to encourage the pastors and churches in that area  to walk alongside some families who will have a hard time recovering  from this for a long time. I have encouraged our Oklahoma agencies and  our Federal agencies to do what we can to be able to step in with  repairing fence lines and helping them recover from a very traumatic  event.   My wife and I stood with a rancher who talked about going out into  the field after the fire. His home was completely destroyed. As he  traveled out to the field around him checking on his cattle, he found  dead cattle but also found cattle with their faces completely burned,  blinded, with coyotes chasing them down. He said all he could do was  stand there in the field and cry. These are going to be long days.   I am grateful that there are neighbors taking care of neighbors. I am  proud of the people of Oklahoma watching out for each other. As we walk  through this, God willing, we will continue to be able to hug and take  care of our neighbors in the days ahead.   I want to tell this Senate and the people of the United States that  this was a wildfire as big as the State of Rhode Island, and many  people haven't even heard of it. But I can assure all of you that the  folks in Oklahoma have experienced it, and we will walk through it  together as a Nation.   With that, Mr. President, I yield back.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
