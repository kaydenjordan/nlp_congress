 Madam President, on May 20, 2019, the Senate voted on  the motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 201, Daniel P.  Collins, of California, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth  Circuit. Due to travel delays, I missed this vote. However, I oppose  confirming this nominee, and I would have voted against cloture if I  were present.                            ____________________
