 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs.  Rodgers) both for giving me this time, but also for her leadership on  this and other issues.   Mr. Speaker, beside me is a photograph of myself; Avi Zimmerman, who  is the head of the Judea and Samaria Chamber of Commerce, an Israeli  Jew; Sheik Ashraf Jabari, a Palestinian businessman; the gentlewoman  from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers); the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.  Wagner); and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. David P. Roe).   Mrs. Wagner and Dr. Roe joined Mrs. McMorris Rodgers and me on this  incredible trip. We are standing in the Sheik's home in Hebron. The  Sheik is a former security adviser to the Palestinian Authority, an  incredible businessman.   Now, before I get back to that meeting, I want to make sure that we  begin to make clear to everybody in America that much of what we have  learned or believed we have learned about what is going on in Israel  between Israelis and Palestinians is not true.   What we learned, both from Sheik Jabari and from others, is that  something new and exciting is happening between the Israelis and the  Palestinians in Israel.   There is this idea out there that the Israelis and the Palestinians  have been fighting one another for years. That is not true.   The truth of the matter is, after the Romans expelled most of the  Jews from Israel in the first and second century AD, there remained a  small number of Jews in what was known as Israel and then later on as  the Province of Palestine. Then over the years, some would creep back  in, but there was a relatively small number of Jews in that land, and  they lived in peace with their Arab neighbors.   It wasn't until the 20th century, when large numbers of Jews began to  move into that area from Europe and the U.S. and other places, that we  began to see some clashes between the Arabs that lived in that area and  the Jews that were moving there.   In 1948, when Israel proclaimed itself to be a State, there was an  unfortunate war between them, their Arab neighbors, and many of the  Arab countries that surrounded them.   As a result of that, a State was formed with true territories, but  there was a problem between Israel and Jordan, which was one of the  countries that they fought, and in order to decide who lived where,  they took a green pen and wrote on a map a line, and it was called the  Green Line. Jordan existed, or had control, on the east side of that  Green Line, Israel on the west.   A second unfortunate war occurred in 1967, the Six-Day War, which  many of us remember. As a result of that war, Israel was able to take  control of all of the area that is now within Israel on the east side  of the Green Line.   Those two wars and what came out of them is where a lot of the  problems between the Palestinians and the Israelis started. It is not  ancient, it is not built into their genes. It is not something that  can't be overcome.   So let me go back to this picture. Avi Zimmerman, as I said, is an  Israeli Jew, and Sheik Jabari is a Palestinian Muslim standing next to  one another in his home in Hebron.   We actually heard from them and other Israelis and other Palestinians  about their desires and their efforts to work together in business and  industry and economics. It is bringing people together.   The day before we visited the Sheik, we were in a town in the  northern part of Israel--in what Israel calls Samaria--called Ariel. In  Ariel, there are two parts, two industrial parts, that have 209  different manufacturing companies in them. Most of the people working  in those manufacturing factories are Palestinians, and they make on  average four times as much as they could make if they were working  somewhere else in what we, unfortunately, call the West Bank, but is  really not the West Bank.   It is good for those Palestinians to make that much money. It is good  for them to be able to take advantage of the miracle of the Israeli  economy. Giving them that opportunity so that they can have a better  life for themselves and their families is hope.   Sheik Jabari and what he is trying to do is hope.   What the people in Israel need more than anything else is hope.   Perhaps our struggles over the last 20 years to create a two-state  solution there has blinded us from the fact that this is really about  people. It is not about lines drawn on a piece of paper that we can't  seem to get a resolution to.                                time  1815    Those people, if they are allowed to live and work together as they  want to, maybe they will find peace on their own without some push from  the rest of us, which seems to be getting us nowhere.  [[Page H8047]]    At any rate, I hope that we, in this country, and we, in this  Congress, can do everything in our power to help these good people grow  economically in their businesses, but also find that peace that only  people-to-people actions can find for us all.   I thank the gentlewoman, and I am looking forward to hearing the rest  of this Special Order.
