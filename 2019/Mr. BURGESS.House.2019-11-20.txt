 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, today, we are considering a bill that requires the  Secretary of Labor to issue a rule on workplace violence prevention in  the healthcare and social service sectors.   According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,  workplace violence is any act or threat of physical violence,  harassment, intimidation, or other threatening disruptive behavior that  occurs at the worksite. It may be surprising to hear that acts of  violence are the third leading cause of fatal occupational injuries. Of  these incidences, approximately 8 percent were intentionally caused by  another person.   When Americans go to work each and every day, they do not expect to  face violence or other harm. The risk is especially high for healthcare  providers and social workers. These caregivers can be subject to  patients who may not be in control when under the influence of  medications, or they may have a mental disorder, upset family members,  ongoing domestic disputes, and even gang violence.    The rate of workplace violence resulting in days away from work for  healthcare providers is, on average, four times higher than other  professions. In addition, healthcare providers and social workers are  less likely to report incidents. This may partly be due to the pledge  to do no harm and the inclination to forgive patient-caused injuries as  accidental. Regardless of the situation, all workers deserve a safe  workplace.   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is responsible for  setting the standards to ensure the safety of American workers. Under  the general duty clause of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of  1970, employers must provide employees with a safe work environment.  Currently, there is no mandatory standard on workplace violence  prevention. However, in calendar year 2015, OSHA published ``Guidelines  for Preventing Workplace Violence for Healthcare and Social Service  Workers'' and is currently working on a workplace violence prevention  rule.   H.R. 1309 would require the Secretary of Labor to issue a rule on  workplace  [[Page H9070]]  violence prevention based on OSHA's 2015 guidelines. An interim  standard is required within 1 year of the passage of this legislation,  and a final rule must be issued within 2 years.   While the goal of this legislation is laudable and important, the  timeframe imposed on the Department of Labor and OSHA does exceed the  norm. Between 1981 and 2010, the time it took OSHA to develop and issue  safety and health standards ranged from 15 months to 19 years, but the  average was more than 7 years. While no one believes we should continue  to delay worker protections, OSHA has already begun the rulemaking  process and is gathering stakeholder input.   According to the OSHA rulemaking process, a rule should take 10 years  to complete. There are 7 stages comprised of 48 different steps. For  example, one step is listed as ``continue discussion with  stakeholders.'' The penultimate stage requires OSHA to send the final  rule to the Small Business Administration before submitting the rule to  Congress.                                time  1245    This last stage involves developing a small entity compliance guide  responding to legal action.   This is bureaucracy at its finest. While it is important to ensure  that any rulemaking does not adversely affect the people and industries  it is meant to assist, the length of this process far exceeds other  administrative rulemakings. Perhaps, rather than pass a bill to require  the issuance of a single rule, we should be considering reforms to the  entire OSHA rulemaking process. It seems like that may be overdue.   Despite the lengthy process of OSHA rulemaking, as written, this bill  truncates established rulemaking procedures. But that is up to us.  Until Congress changes this process, OSHA will follow the established  framework to develop its workplace violence protection rule.   H.R. 1309 requires covered employees, including hospitals, outpatient  facilities, residential treatment facilities--which includes nursing  homes--and any other medical treatment or social service clinic at  correctional facilities to develop and implement a written workplace  violence plan within 6 months of the issuance of a rule. The plan must  include identification of violence risks and prevention practices and  incorporate reporting and emergency response procedures. In addition,  the plan must delineate violent incident investigation procedures and  training programs for employees.   Again, the importance of such a plan is undeniable. Six months may be  a short timeframe within which to determine all of the required  components. In order to produce the most effective plan to ensure  employee safety, employers really should be granted adequate time to  fully evaluate their workplace, gather input from employees, and  identify the best procedures to ensure a safe environment. It is  possible that, given the short timeline, workplace violence prevention  plans could be hasty and, therefore, incorrectly assembled.   Here is the good news. There is middle ground. While OSHA's  rulemaking process is lengthy, this bill's timeline is short. OSHA is  currently gathering feedback from stakeholders and requiring an  expedited rulemaking that will limit their input.   While OSHA rulemaking would ensure enforcement of workplace violence  prevention policies, according to a 2018 American Hospital Association  survey, 97 percent of respondents reported already having a workplace  violence prevention policy in place. In 2009, the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention stated that additional research was required to  identify effective strategies to prevent violence, particularly in  healthcare settings.   In addition, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost  to private entities will be well over $2.5 billion the first 2 years of  implementation and almost $1.5 billion annually thereafter. The rule  self-executes a manager's amendment that will bring this cost down to  $1.3 billion for the first 2 years and $700 million annually  thereafter.   This mandate may make it difficult for rural hospitals and healthcare  providers to continue effectively serving patients in their more rural  locations.   Extending the implementation timeline of this bill may help reduce  some of these concerns. We had an opportunity to work on a bipartisan  basis--this is not a partisan issue--to solve a problem that we all  agree needs to be solved. We are, instead, considering a bill that  circumvents the established rulemaking process in favor of a swift  outcome.   We can all agree that there is a need for OSHA to issue proper  workplace violence prevention regulations to protect healthcare  providers and social workers. I hope we are able to accomplish this  goal, but we should recognize that we are placing burdens on entities  through an expedited process that may require modification in the  future to ensure a safe and effective workplace for all Americans.   Madam Speaker, for these and other reasons, I urge opposition to the  rule, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Madam Speaker, just so that we are technically accurate, the  resolution in front of us today, point number one, it is a structured  rule for H.R. 1309. This is not an open rule. I have served in the  United States House of Representatives when we had open rules, and it  is a different environment.   Mr. Cole last night in the Rules Committee did make a motion for an  open rule on this, saying: If you are going to accept all these  amendments, maybe we should open the floor up to all Members. This is  an important topic. Let's get their input.   But the request for an open rule was voted down in the Rules  Committee. It wasn't really a suspenseful vote. The Republican side  lost 4-9, which is generally the way that works out in that committee.   I am grateful that so many amendments were made in order. I think  that is important. But I also feel obligated to point out that under no  circumstances should this be regarded as an open rule. It is anything  but.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, Republicans will  amend the rule to immediately consider H.R. 1869, the Restoring  Investment in Improvements Act. This bill, which has 271 bipartisan  cosponsors, would fix a technical error in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to  allow qualified improvement property to depreciate over 15 years and be  eligible for immediate expenses.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this  amendment into the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Walorski) to further explain the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for his  comments, and I would agree that the efficient functioning of any  Federal agency should always be our highest priority. The efficient use  of the taxpayer funding that goes into those agencies or branches of  agencies should require our constant attention. We should always be  looking to improve the service and the protection that those agencies  provide.   I will also predict that this bill is likely to pass with a large  margin and it will be bipartisan and will raise the question of why we  are not considering it under a suspension of the rules. Nevertheless,  that is what the majority has chosen to use their time doing this week,  so we have the bill in front of us today.   Workplace violence is a threat that no American should have to face.  The threat is particularly high for healthcare providers and for social  service workers. These workers dedicate their lives to taking care of  others, and they deserve to be taken care of in return.   I support the goal of this legislation. I believe it would benefit  from further discussion to ensure that the timeline for issuing a rule  and developing a workplace violence prevention plan will produce the  most effective and safe outcome for American workers.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question and a  ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
