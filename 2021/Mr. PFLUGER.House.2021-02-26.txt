 Madam Speaker, I rise today in complete opposition to  the Democrats' blue State bailout bill.   This bill will cost the American taxpayer nearly $2 trillion--let  that sit for a second--$2 trillion when our Nation is already $27  trillion in debt.   Where does this money go?   Surely it will be spent towards fighting the pandemic and COVID.  Wrong. Only 9 percent of this money will go towards fighting COVID-19.  The rest of the funding is going towards Democrat pet projects, like a  subway in Silicon Valley and a bridge in New York. Taxpayers in Texas  should absolutely not be rewarding States who have kept their economies  shuttered and prevented workers from earning a living.   Madam Speaker, for these reasons and more, I urge my colleagues to  vote ``no.''
