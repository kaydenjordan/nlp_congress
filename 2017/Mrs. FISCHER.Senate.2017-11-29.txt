 Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak about tax  reform, which is so important for families in Nebraska and throughout  this country. The last time Congress comprehensively reformed the Tax  Code was in 1986, and we all agree it is long overdue. My priorities  for tax reform have always been threefold: delivering relief to the  middle-class, unleashing small business growth, and making our country  competitive globally. This bill before us accomplishes these goals.   American families have struggled over the past decade, and too many  in our country have found themselves living paycheck to paycheck. Wages  for workers have stagnated while the prices of goods and services have  continued to climb. Things are only just starting to turn around and,  as I travel across my State, Nebraskans have begun to tell me they are  finally feeling confident about the economy again. That needs to  continue, and the best way to do it is by putting more money back into  the pockets of regular Americans. This bill does that in one of the  best ways possible, by doubling the standard deduction and protecting  the first $24,000 that married couples earn and the first $12,000  individuals earn from Federal taxes.    Increasing the standard deduction is pro-family, and it helps to  foster the American dream. It not only leads to Americans keeping more  of their hard-  [[Page S7401]]  earned money, but it also means that simplifying the code will help  them save money in tax preparation as well. According to the  nonpartisan Tax Foundation, a married couple with two kids making  $85,000 per year, will see their taxes decrease by $2,224. This reform  provides money that will allow Americans to plan for their future and  to pay their bills. It can be a downpayment on a house or it can be put  away for future college tuition or for retirement. It gives millions of  earners more empowerment to use these savings for their lives as they  see fit.   Simplifying the code isn't the only family-focused provision included  in this legislation. The Senate bill doubles the child tax credit from  $1,000 to $2,000 per child. According to the Department of Agriculture,  parents of a child born in 2015 are likely to spend more than $233,000  raising a child to age 17. That doesn't even include college tuition.  Doubling the child tax credit will allow families to keep up to an  additional $4,000 every year if they have two children or more. This  credit builds a stronger future by helping families all across our  country keep more money to raise happy and healthy children.   In addition to these changes, this legislation will preserve many  other popular deductions. This includes the charitable deduction,  medical expense deduction, the student loan interest deduction, the  mortgage interest deduction, and the low-income housing tax credit.  This bill also continues popular savings programs such as the 401(k)s  and individual retirement accounts. These saving incentives are key  tools that allow individuals to provide for their families and to  prepare for retirement. It empowers Americans to plan ahead.   There are also commonsense provisions in this bill that have been  overlooked during the current debate. These are changes everyone here  can agree are long overdue. For example, this reform takes away the  tax-exempt status for professional sports leagues. We all love sports,  but professional sports leagues like the NFL and the PGA shouldn't be  allowed to use exemptions for nonprofits to avoid paying taxes. These  are for-profit leagues where commissioners make tens of millions of  dollars. They should be treated for what they are, and that is a money- making enterprise.   I also want to take the time to address a misconception. Some have  argued that this bill will tax the tuition waivers graduate students  receive from their universities as a part of attending to their  studies. There is no such provision. Ph.D. research is a staple of  higher education, and it drives our Nation's innovation. It helps us  better understand our world and often leads to incredible technological  advancements. We in the Senate support graduate studies, and none of us  want to make it more difficult to obtain graduate degrees or do  research at the highest levels. We will not be taxing you for tuition  you don't pay while earning a master's or doctorate degree.   There are some other important provisions in this bill that haven't  gotten the attention they deserve, and I want to take a moment to  discuss some of them. The Senate tax reform retains nearly all of the  education incentives that are present in the current Tax Code for  students and for teachers. For example, we keep the Hope credit, which  allows taxpayers a credit of up to $2,500 per student, per year, for  qualified tuition or related expenses. We also keep both the Coverdell  and the 529 education savings accounts. These accounts promote saving  for school, and they help parents prepare for future tuition. Finally,  we double the educator deduction, which helps teachers make their  classrooms as friendly for learning as possible. This is a pro- education tax reform bill, and it acknowledges education is a key to  our country's future success.   We must also recognize that our economy has changed over the last few  decades, and our Tax Code needs to catch up to the times. We have the  chance to make history, one that will help working families. My Strong  Families Act, which is included in this legislation, would be the first  nationwide paid family leave policy in American history. If we want to  build a better future for our children, we must tackle problems for  families juggling those responsibilities between home and the  workplace.   This plan has the potential to make life much easier for working  families across our country by providing a tax credit as large as 25  percent for employers who offer up to 12 weeks of paid family leave to  their employees. Under programs set up by employers, employees would be  able to take an hour, a day, or weeks off for purposes like taking care  of a sick child or an ailing parent to make sure they get to a doctor's  appointment. They could also take maternity or paternity leave to bond  with a newborn or recently adopted child.   In 21st century America, the number of dual-income households is on  the rise. According to the Department of Labor, 70 percent of mothers  with children under 19 participate in the labor force, with over 75  percent employed full time. For those without the means to take unpaid  time off, the burdens of caregiving are a real burden. A recent study  from the Pew Research Center found that most individuals who make  higher salaries usually have access to some kind of paid family leave,  but those making less than that are not always covered. This is why my  paid family leave plan limits eligibility to those earning below  $72,000 per year. We want these benefits to target hourly and lower  salaried workers. We want to increase access to paid family leave for  those who need it the most.   While my friends on the other side of the aisle focus on the stick  approach to paid family leave--pushing mandates or the creation of new  government programs--this bill pursues the carrot approach, and  Americans agree with us. A recent study showed that 87 percent of  Americans supported a limited government approach that enables  employers to provide the benefit themselves.   It is not hard to understand why. The plan balances the need of 21st  century workers with the real-world challenges that small businesses  face today. Eric Dinger, who is the CEO of a Lincoln startup named  Powderhook, put it the best. Eric told me:         I want to offer my employees paid leave, but a mandate       forcing me to do so would be hard. I have to make payroll.       [The Strong Family Act] is much more workable and wouldn't       provide a disincentive to hire anyone.   I agree.   Another of my constituents, Alison Ritter--an employee at Applied  Systems, Inc., in Lincoln--is helping her company's leadership develop  a paid leave policy. In reaction to my bill being included in the tax  reform proposal before us, she told me:         This concept would change the game for many newborn babies       and their parents, allowing them the time they need to bond       and establish a nursing routine without as much of the stress       and guilt they face today. It would provide families with the       financial support they need in order to do what's best for       their family, but also help businesses that struggle with       putting a plan in place due to the financial burden extended       absences create. . . . Our country wins when we focus on and       invest in healthier families.    Sara Rasby, who is the co-owner of Lotus House of Yoga, which has  locations across my State agreed:         It is refreshing to see a policy that supports the family       and small business unit. As co-owner of a small business and       a mother of two young children, I know firsthand how       challenging it can be without paid leave. A mother and/or       family needs time to adjust and bond. . . . This bill would       help parents, families, and small business owners be more at       ease with the transitions and changes that come with       maternity leave. Additionally, it will create more community       awareness on the importance of supporting the family       structure through policy.    We need to get this done for people like Eric, Alison, Sara, and  other business owners, caregivers, and working parents throughout the  country.   I also said my goal in this process is to promote policies that will  ensure small businesses succeed. There are over 29 million small  businesses throughout our country, and these small firms drive our  economy. They have generated over 60 percent of the new jobs created  over the last two decades and have made up nearly 98 percent of our  exports. They are often the face of our country to the world.   This reform will provide small businesses with additional incentives  to invest and grow. When small businesses make money, they invest it  back into their businesses and help grow their local economy. Places  like Lincoln and Omaha are well known to the entrepreneurial community  as bustling hubs of  [[Page S7402]]  innovation. This bill provides a 17.4-percent deduction for the large  majority of small businesses, which will lower their tax bills and give  them more financial flexibility. The preservation of things like the  1031 like-kind exchanges and the stepped-up basis will further help our  small businesses, especially agriculture businesses.   Small businesses don't have the professional resources to deal with  the Tax Code that comes in at over 74,000 pages. Simply doing taxes-- let alone paying them--has become a burden on too many of our small  companies. Moreover, they cannot take advantage of all the corporate  deductions or the little-known loopholes like big companies can. This  is not fair. It hurts our competitiveness globally, stifles strong  economic growth, and it favors big corporations, which have offices  full of lawyers and accountants. This tax reform lessens this disparity  and deserves support from everyone who wants to promote American  entrepreneurialism.   Lastly, this legislation goes a long way toward making America  competitive internationally. A large part of this is lowering the  corporate tax rate. At 35 percent, America's corporate tax rate is a  full 13 percentage points higher than the average rate of our  competitors from the developed world. This is a big reason why  companies are fleeing our shores, and they are choosing to set up their  headquarters or invest outside of America. These so-called inversions  have been on the rise in recent years, and there is little reason to  think that trend will reverse if we stand by and do nothing.   This legislation will put us in line with our trading partners and,  once again, make America an attractive place for business, which will  lead to more jobs and higher wages for our country.
