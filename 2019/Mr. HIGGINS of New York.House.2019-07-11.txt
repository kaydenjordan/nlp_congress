 Mr. Speaker, on September 11, 2001, as  millions of Americans watched in horror, our country was attacked.  Thousands of people courageously stepped up, left their homes and  families, and answered the call to respond to a nation in need.   Among them were dozens of western New Yorkers, including John Asklar  of the Niagara Falls Fire Department who injured his leg in the rubble  and continues to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder; Jennifer  Czarnecki, who is reminded every day of her five assignments to Ground  Zero with the New York State Police following a breast cancer diagnosis  in 2015; and my friend Dave State, who bravely faced cancer last year  as a result of his 9/11 service with the New York State National Guard.   For them and others, the pain and consequences of this attack are as  real today as they were 18 years ago. We must act urgently to make the  9/11 Victim Compensation Fund permanent. These men, women, and families  were there for our country in our time of need. Now, we must be there  for them in their time of need.                            ____________________
