 Madam President, I rise today to speak about the omnibus  bill that we are going to be voting on either later today or tomorrow.   I came to the Senate almost 12 years ago. I have 9 months left in my  term. I told folks back home that I couldn't imagine serving more than  two terms. Yet it has been an incredible privilege to be here. When I  ran, I ran concerned about our Nation's fiscal issues, and I ran on the  combination of pro-growth tax reform and entitlement reform and dealing  with the tremendous deficits that our country has. I really thought we  would do something about it.  [[Page S1888]]    We had the financial crisis that took place back in 2007, 2008,  2009--building in 2007 and occurred in 2008. We dealt with much of it  over 2009. I remember talking to people around our country not just  about the financial crisis but about the tremendous deficits that our  Nation was creating. I was still hopeful in my first term that we would  rise to the occasion and actually deal with the fiscal issues that are  going to haunt these young people who are our pages sitting before me.  We have $21 trillion in debt today and over $100 trillion in unfunded  liabilities with our long-term programs, our mandatory spending  programs. So during that period of time, near the end of my first term,  I kept saying to people around the country: There is no question that  the Senate and the House, with leadership from the executive branch,  will deal with this fiscal issue.   I am convinced today that that is not going to happen until there is  a crisis in our Nation. Let me say it one more time. Without extreme  leadership at the very top, I do not think we will deal with this issue  until there is a crisis, because I just don't see the will here to do  the things that need to be done.   During December we had a debate on the pro-growth tax reform side of  this, and I think it is well documented that I had concerns about it.  As a matter of fact, when the bill came through the Senate, I voted  against it. I continued to work with some of my counterparts on the  Democratic side--Chris Coons and others--and the White House, to see if  there was some way to potentially alter the bill so that if growth  projections didn't achieve what we thought they might be, we had some  way of ensuring that we would not have deficits. At the end of the day,  when it came to the floor, I supported it--pro-growth tax reform,  again, being one of those things that I ran on back in 2006.   What concerns me is that today, or maybe tomorrow, we have a 2,232- page omnibus bill before us that sets a base in spending that will be  about $2 trillion in deficit spending over the next 10 years. By the  way, that doesn't include some of the supplemental items. I am talking  about just the baseline in spending.   I think everyone knows that, like the Presiding Officer, I am a very  strong supporter of our men and women in uniform. No doubt we all  understand that the defense numbers in this bill are way beyond even  what the executive branch asked for. Somehow, in these negotiations, we  have ended up, over a 2-year period, with an average increase in base  spending of about $150 billion. When you multiply that times 10, that  is $1.5 trillion. We know there are going to be increases over that 10- year period. Then, if you look at the interest on the debt that it is  going to create, we are voting on a bill tonight or tomorrow that is  going to add--there is no question--a minimum of $2 trillion in  deficits over the next 10 years.   What was fascinating during the month of December, when we were  dealing--let me stop for a second.   Let me just say this. There are a lot of discussions about the fact  that maybe the Republican Party has lost its soul. There is a lot of  discussion about that around the country--that maybe the Republican  Party has lost its soul.   I will say that for the Republican Party to have the Presidency, for  the Republican Party to have the Senate, and for the Republican Party  to have the House of Representatives, and for us to be passing a bill  today--obviously, it couldn't happen without us; we control the agenda  here--for us to be in this situation where we are getting ready to pass  a bill that adds $2 trillion in deficits over the next 10 years, or  sets the stage for that by passing the first 2 years with a huge  increase in base spending with no offsets to speak of, does have to be  a wake-up call for people as for whether that is the case.   I can't imagine, for instance, had the 2016 election gone a different  way and we had a Democratic President and we controlled the House and  Senate, our being in a situation where we would vote tonight or  tomorrow for a bill that is going to add $2 trillion in debt without  offsets. As a matter of fact, I can just tell my colleagues,  absolutely, that would not be the case.   So here we are. There are going to be all kinds of things in this  bill that people don't even know about. It is just human nature. When  you have the pen in your hand and you are working in a back room some  place--and I don't criticize back rooms; that is how these bills get  written--people do things that benefit themselves. They just do. That  is the way it works. I don't even want to speak to that. That will be  something I hope the media will speak to over the next two or three  weeks, when we find, in these 2,232 pages that no one has read, the  things in this bill that are going to be egregious to the American  people--highly egregious.   I hope people will find them. I hope the media will report them. I  know they are in there. I just don't know what they are yet because the  bill has just been produced. That is of concern.   What is of grave concern to me is that we have made no attempt  whatsoever to create any kind of offsets and no attempt whatsoever to  try to solve our fiscal issues. Together, Republicans and Democrats are  running off a cliff and passing a bill.   Now, let me speak to Democrats. I am criticizing Republicans, as I  should, with this piece of legislation, when we control the executive  branch, we control both Houses of Congress, and we are getting ready to  pass a bill that will add $2 trillion for these young people to pay for  down the road, which will compound, compound, compound. We have $21  trillion in debt today, not to speak of the $100 trillion of unfunded  liabilities.   My Democrat friends, raised unmitigated H-E-L-L over the tax bill  that was potentially going to create some deficits if growth  projections didn't occur. I have not heard a word from them--not a  word, not a word--about the fact that there is no question that we are  adding $2 trillion in debt here--no question. This is money gone, down  the tube, out the door, and no way to pay for it. I haven't heard a  word from them--not a word. My friends in the media were beside  themselves--beside themselves--in December. I mean, the world was going  to come to an end if the growth projections that were laid out didn't  occur, and the deficits that might be created by this tax bill if we  didn't have the growth projections. They were just beside themselves. I  have not heard a word from them. It is amazing. Somehow or another,  spending more money than we have is different than hoping to create  pro-growth tax reform.   So let me just say this. I am optimistic about our future. I see  young people around our country who are just so impressive. I go to  schools. I go to colleges. I see people in townhall meetings, in  restaurants, at the grocery store and in other places, and I could not  be more upbeat about the generation of people coming after us--who care  about others, who care about the future, and who are engaged in issues.  We will have a big crowd up here this weekend, caring about a  particular issue that they should care about.   But I could not be more discouraged about where we are today with our  adult leadership here in Congress and at the White House.   This is one of the most grotesque pieces of legislation I can  remember.   One of the best votes I ever made was the Budget Control Act. It was  criticized, but it kept domestic and discretionary spending on a level.  We should have done the rest of it. The rest of it was people getting  together to solve our long-term problems. That didn't happen. We  created sequester, and I know that has built some of the pressure that  leads us to where this bill is today.   This is a grotesque piece of legislation--grotesque--that we would  pass a piece of legislation that would set the standard for $2 trillion  in deficit spending not offset.   I am discouraged. I am discouraged about where we are today. I am  discouraged about the fact that we continue to be engaged in  generational theft--my generation.   We will not deal with mandatory spending--mandatory spending that  benefits my generation. To these young people sitting in front of me,  we are engaged right now in generational theft because we are  transferring from you to us your future resources, because we don't  have the courage or the will to deal with issues.   By the way, unfortunately, the American people are not there. The  [[Page S1889]]  American people do not care about this issue because we are living fat  and happy today and because the crisis has not yet occurred and because  we can slough it off on you and keep ourselves from making these tough  decisions.   By the way, these tough decisions play themselves out in the polls  because people get angry about the fact that we need to be responsible  and that we need to make sure that you guys are not going to pay these  huge tabs. By the way, your standard of living, when we pass this bill,  will be diminished. When you go on to college and graduate and start  working in your job, just know that what we are getting ready to do  tonight or tomorrow is going to diminish your standard of living,  because we are going to pass a huge bill, unpaid for, that you are  going to pay for and your children are going to pay for. That is what  we are doing.   That is what we are doing because we don't have the will as a body to  say: OK, if we are going to spend this additional money, what is it  that we are going to cut over here? What are we going to do relative to  the fact that right now Medicare recipients take about three times out  of the program what they put in. What are we going to do about that?   Well, see, we are going to do nothing about it because that is  unpopular, and people don't want to hear the truth about these things.  Instead, what they would rather do is say: Well, let's worry about that  down the road.   But let me tell you who is going to be worrying about it. You are  going to be worrying about it.   I know you have seen some outstanding people. I serve with  outstanding people in this body. I really do. They are intelligent,  hard-working people. I really do. It has been a great privilege. But  what you are going to see tonight and tomorrow is a bunch of hard- working people pass a piece of legislation that is going to make your  lives and your kids' lives worse.   I will not support this piece of legislation. I know it is going to  pass overwhelmingly because there is too much in it to make people  happy for the moment. But let me just say that down the road the  American people are going to be very unhappy with our lack of  responsibility.   Not only do I question the soul of my own party, I question the soul  of the other party, and I wonder where the media is and why they are  not out crying over what we are getting ready to do.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

Saudi Arabia will have no difficulty       absorbing this equipment and support into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        There are no principal contractors involved with this       potential sale. There are no known offset agreements proposed       in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       permanent assignment of any U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Saudi Arabia.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.

Also included is       government furnished equipment; technical manuals and       publications; essential spares and repair parts; consumables;       live fire exercise and ammunition; tools and test equipment;       training; transportation; U.S. Government technical support       and logistic support; contractor technical support; repair       and return support; quality assurance teams; in-country Field       Service Representative (FSR); other associated equipment and       services in support of TOW 2B missiles; and other related       elements of logistics and program support. The total       estimated program cost is $670 million.        This proposed sale will support U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives by improving the security of a       friendly country which has been, and continues to be, an       important force for political stability and economic growth       in the Middle East. This potential sale is consistent with       U.S. initiatives to provide key partners in the region with       modern systems that will enhance interoperability with U.S.       forces and increase stability.        The proposed sale of TOW 2B missiles and technical support       will advance the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's efforts to develop       an integrated ground defense capability. A strong national       defense and dedicated military force will assist Saudi Arabia       to sustain itself in its efforts to maintain stability. Saudi       Arabia will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into       its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor is Raytheon Missile Systems,       Tucson, AZ. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       permanent assignment of any U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Saudi Arabia. There will be no more than       two contractor personnel in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at       any one time and all efforts will take less than two weeks in       total.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 17-62       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The TOW 2B RF Missile is a fly-over-shoot-down missile       designed to defeat armored vehicles. These missiles are fired       from a variety of TOW launchers in the U.S. Army, USMC and       FMS customer forces. The TOW 2B RF can be launched from the       same launcher platforms as the existing wire-guided TOW 2B       missiles without modification to the launcher. The TOW 2B       missile (both wire & RF) contains two tracker beacons (xenon       and thermal) for the launcher to track and guide the missile       in flight. Guidance commands from the launcher are provided       to the  [[Page S1938]]       missile by an RF link contained within the missile case. The       hardware, software and technical publications provided with       the sale are unclassified; however, the system itself       contains sensitive technology that instructs the system on       how to operate in the presence of countermeasures.        2. If a technologically advanced adversary obtains       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems that might reduce weapon system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        3. A determination has been made that Saudi Arabia can       provide substantially the same degree of protection for the       sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government.       This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.        4. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.                            ____________________     Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the House  sent a bill over today a little after 1 o'clock, and it is 11:56 p.m. I  know that every Senator here has the right to object, and I assume some  people have objected to voting.   We are not going to close. I had called down earlier and asked the  Secretary if we are not going to vote by 10 o'clock, if we could just  vote at 8 o'clock in the morning. This is ridiculous. It is juvenile.  This is a juvenile process that we go through every time we do one of  these.   I would respectfully ask our leader, who has been dealing with a lot  today--and I am glad that he has the job he has and I don't, and the  Secretary has the job that she has and I don't--could you explain to us  what has occurred over the last 11 hours that keeps us here voting on a  bill that we all know is going to pass, regardless of how we vote on it  and that has kept us from just going ahead and voting?   Could you explain to the body, just very quickly, what has happened?  And could we in the future possibly try to resolve these things at a  decent hour, or come back the next morning and vote?    The changes that have occurred at the White House in the  last several hours, and this--it has been an unusual day, I will say.    Well, if I could, reserving the right to object, I would  like for us to have some degree of discussion about this in the  future--either to finish our business at a normal time or to come back  the next morning. This is a ridiculous process that we go through where  people extort us until we get so tired that we are willing to do  whatever it is they wish for us to do.   I don't know what the issues were today. For instance, I would love  to have a week's debate on an AUMF at some point. Now, I can hold this  vote up on a legitimate issue and say: No, we are not going to vote  until you agree that we are going to have an AUMF debate. I haven't  done that. To my knowledge, I have never in my life held a vote up.  Maybe I did 10 years ago and I can't remember.   But I just think that, again, we ought to have a little more  certainty around here. I appreciate that people have flights in the  morning and that there are some codels going out. So I am not going to  object.   However, I am going to discuss with other Members, whether in the  future, if we cannot finish our business at a reasonable hour, let's  just come back the next morning and start.   With that, I do not object.
