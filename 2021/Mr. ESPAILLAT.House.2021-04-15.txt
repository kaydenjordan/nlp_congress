 Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I include in the Record a  letter from the Equal Rights Advocates in support of H.R. 7.                                         Equal Rights Advocates,                                                     April 14, 2021.      Re Pass the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) and vote no on           harmful amendments.         Dear Representative: As the House votes on the Paycheck       Fairness Act (H.R. 7), Equal Rights Advocates strongly urges       you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R. 7, without       amendments that limit its scope or undermine its critical       protections.        Equal Rights Advocates (ERA) is a national, non-profit       legal organization based in San Francisco, California, whose       mission is to protect and expand economic and educational       access and opportunities for women and girls. We have a long       history of working  [[Page H1807]]       to address pay discrimination and to close the gender wage       gap. We have litigated numerous cases relating to pay       discrimination and regularly provide information and       resources to employees who contact our free legal information       hotline regarding unlawful gender and race-based pay       disparities.        We also advocate for various bills at the state-level to       ensure economic and gender justice for women and families.       Most recently, ERA has co-sponsored SB 973 (Jackson, 2020)       which requires California employers with 100 employees or       more to submit an annual pay data report to the Department of       Industrial Relations outlining the compensation and hours       worked of its employees by gender, race, ethnicity, and job       category. This allows state agencies to more efficiently       identify patterns of wage disparities and encourages       employers to analyze their own pay practices to ensure they       are fair and lawful. Additionally, ERA co-sponsored the       California Fair Pay Act, SB 358, (Jackson, 2016) which       amended and strengthened our state's Equal Pay Act to       prohibit employer secrecy rules, clarify that workers must be       paid equally to coworkers of another sex who perform       substantially similar work, unless the employer proves that       the disparity was due to a legitimate, job-related, bona fide       factor not based on or derived from sex. We also cosponsored       AB 168 (Eggman, 2017) which prohibits California employers       from inquiring about prior salary and requires them to       provide the pay Scale for a position in question upon       reasonable request and AB 2282 (Eggman, 2018) which clarified       that prior salary cannot be used on its own, or in       combination with a lawful factor, to justify a wage       differential under the California Equal Pay Act. Finally, ERA       also chairs Equal Pay Today, a national collaboration of       organizations working at the local, regional, and federal       level to close the gender wage gap.        Today in the United States, despite the passage of previous       equal pay legislation, including the critically important       Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the gender pay gap remains       pervasive. Women, even those who work full-time and year       round, still only earn 80 cents to a man's dollar. This gives       rise to a nationwide pay gap of $900 billion every year. For       women of color, the pay gap is even larger. For every dollar       earned by a non-Hispanic white man, Latina women earn only 53       cents, Native American women only 58 cents, and Black women       only 61 cents. These large pay gaps, although of varying       sizes across demographics of women, prove harmful to the       economic security of women and families across the country.       The negative economic consequences of these gender pay gaps       are especially pronounced as ``mothers are primary or sole       breadwinners in half of U.S. households with children.'' Of       these female-headed households, one-quarter of them fall       below the poverty line.        As it stands, the gender and race pay gaps are closing at a       glacial pace. At current rates, the gender wage gap will not       close until 2059. For women of color, the picture is even       bleaker. It will not be until 2124 that Black women receive       equal pay to white men and not until 2233 that Latinas       receive the same. Now is the time for action.        The Paycheck Fairness Act is an important step in       accelerating the closing of the gender pay gap. Among many       provisions, the Paycheck Fairness Act would bar retaliation       for discussing or disclosing wages. According to the       Institute for Women's Policy Research, across the country,       about half of workers were prohibited or strongly discouraged       from disclosing their wages to other employees. Yet, when an       individual is unable to discuss wages with other employees,       it becomes exceedingly difficult to determine if one is       making less than one's colleagues. By ending the practice of       pay secrecy, the Paycheck Fairness Act would make it harder       for employers to keep pervasive practices of pay       discrimination hidden.        In addition, the Paycheck Fairness Act would also prohibit       employers from relying on salary history when setting the       wages of their employees. This provision is critical as the       practice of relying on prior salary can lead to a single act       of pay discrimination following a woman throughout her       career. One year out of college, women are already earning 7       percent less than their male colleagues, even after       controlling for factors such as college major, occupation, or       hours worked. If a woman's prior salary is used by future       employers, the gender pay gap will continue to persist as a       depressed past salary continues to be used to determine       future wages. Prohibiting employer reliance on salary history       will help stop the perpetuation of unequal pay.        Another crucial provision in this version of the Paycheck       Fairness Act is the commitment to pay data collection. As       mentioned above, ERA fought for pay data collection at the       California state-level and secured this via SB 973 (Jackson,       2020). The need to ensure equal pay is now more apparent than       ever during the current COVID-19 health and economic crisis,       which has exposed the lasting harm of unequal pay and other       contributors to economic security on women, and in       particular, women of color. Pay data collection helps uncover       pay discrimination, which is a major contributor to the       overall gender and race-based wage gaps.        Recognizing that pay discrimination is difficult to detect       and address, the Obama Administration announced a proposed       revision to the Employer Information Report (EEO-1) to       include the reporting of pay data by gender, race and       ethnicity beginning in 2018. For more than 50 years, large       companies have been submitting these EEO-1 reports with       demographic information to the Equal Employment Opportunity       Commission (EEOC). This data has helped the agency to       identify patterns of occupational segregation and       discrimination and enforce federal equal pay and anti-      discrimination law. However, the Trump Administration put a       halt to the implementation of this new rule, dealing a       significant blow to the fight for equal pay.        The Paycheck Fairness Act would also close loopholes that       allow employers to pay women less without a legitimate       business justification and would provide the same robust       remedies for sex-based pay discrimination as race and       ethnicity based discrimination. It would also require wage       data collection and support salary negotiation skills       training programs to give women the tools to advocate for       higher wages. Salary negotiation workshops have been shown to       be highly effective. For example, in a study conducted       following the free salary negotiation workshops put on by the       city of Boston, the Center for Women in Politics and Public       Policy at the University of Massachusetts Boston found that       nearly half of the women who were interviewed had either       successfully negotiated a pay raise or starting salary that       brought them either to or above the market rate following the       training.        As the bill states, these continuing pay disparities have       devastating impacts on women, especially women of color. Over       the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have found       this to be even more true. Since last February, 2.4 million       women have exited the workforce, or, been pushed out of the       workforce, highlighting a dramatic regress for gender equity.       More and more women are forced to stay home in order to care       for children and loved ones while men continue to work.       Before the pandemic, ``women did, on average, three times       more unpaid care work than men, and this responsibility has       heightened since the pandemic given school and childcare       closures, and increased care needs for elderly relatives.''       Women who are able to remain in the workforce, however, are       still paid less than their male colleagues, especially Black       women and women of color. COVID-19 has exacerbated these       long-standing gender and racial inequities. Now, more than       ever, elected officials must recognize these disparate       impacts and deliver solutions to American women.        Without continued efforts to provide women with the tools       to challenge and unearth pay discrimination and provisions to       keep employers from perpetuating persistent inequalities, the       gender pay gap will not close. The Paycheck Fairness Act is       an important step on the path towards a future where women       can stand on equal economic footing to their male       counterparts.        For these reasons, we are proud to support the Paycheck       Fairness Act and urge you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.                                                Jessica Stender,                                                     Senior Counsel,                                 Workplace Justice & Public Policy.     Mr. Speaker, it should offend every one of us that  there remains a pay gap between men and women for the same work.   Women of color, in particular--African-American women, Latina women,  Native American women, AAPI women--are making as low as 52 cents, Mr.  Speaker, for every dollar for the same job and work by a man.   This is a travesty.   Let's make our communities stronger. Let's make our economy stronger.   In Harlem, East Harlem, northern Manhattan, and the northwest Bronx,  women of color are the majority of workers. I can't go back home to my  district and say that somehow they are working the same as men, or  maybe more, in many cases, and are making less.   I support H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act, because we need to bring  fairness into the discussion. Let's make our communities stronger.  Let's make our economy stronger.   Gender-based pay discrimination should not be something we are still  discussing now in 2021.   The Paycheck Fairness Act will put everyone on the line to make sure  that we are all doing our best to ensure fair and equitable pay.   Closing the pay gap will make women and families financially  stronger.   Mr. Speaker, let's make our communities stronger. Let's make our  economy stronger.    Madam Speaker, I was in a Zoom meeting with the  Secretary of Transportation. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 104.
