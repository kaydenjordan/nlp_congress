 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6020) to require an evaluation by the  Government Accountability Office of the social, economic, and historic  contributions that Minor League Baseball has made to American life and  culture, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6020         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) more than forty million fans have attended Minor League       Baseball games each season for 15 consecutive years;        (2) Minor League Baseball provides wholesome affordable       entertainment in 160 communities throughout the Nation;        (3) in 2018, Minor League Baseball clubs donated over $45       million in cash and in-kind gifts to their local communities       and completed over 15,000 volunteer hours;        (4) the economic stimulus and development provided by Minor       League Baseball clubs extends beyond the cities and towns       where it is played, to wide and diverse geographic areas       comprising 80 percent of the population in the Nation;        (5) Minor League Baseball is committed to promoting       diversity and inclusion through its Copa de la Diversion,       MiLB Pride, FIELD Program, and Women in Baseball Leadership       initiatives;        (6) Minor League Baseball is the first touchpoint of the       national pastime for millions of youth and the only       touchpoint for  [[Page H1565]]       those located in communities far from Major League cities;        (7) Congress has enacted numerous statutory exemptions and       immunities to preserve and sustain a system for Minor League       Baseball and its relationship with Major League Baseball;        (8) an abandonment of 42 Minor League Baseball clubs by       Major League Baseball would devastate communities, bond       purchasers, and other stakeholders that rely on the economic       stimulus these clubs provide;        (9) Minor League Baseball clubs enrich the lives of       millions of Americans each year through special economic,       cultural, social, and charitable contributions; and        (10) preservation of Minor League Baseball in 160       communities is in the public interest, as it will continue to       provide affordable, family friendly entertainment to those       communities.       SEC. 2. GAO EVALUATION.         Following consultation with the relevant committees of       Congress, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       evaluate the social, economic, and historic contributions       that Minor League Baseball has made to American life and       culture.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 6020.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume. Minor League Baseball has been part of the  social fabric of America for over 100 years.   Today, there are 160 minor league teams across the country, including  the Staten Island Yankees and the 2019 New York-Penn League Champion  Brooklyn Cyclones.   This bill requires the Government Accountability Office to conduct a  study on the social, economic, and historical contributions that these  teams have made to American society. Minor League Baseball provides  family-friendly entertainment to millions of Americans. It is also an  important economic influence in many communities, employing thousands  of individuals, and often serves as an important source of charitable  giving.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Lori Trahan and David McKinley  for their leadership on this bipartisan effort. I also recognize the  members of the Committee on Oversight and Reform who have cosponsored  this measure, Representatives Comer, Haaland, Keller, Miller, and  Welch.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan).    MALONEY of New York.
