 Mr. Speaker, I, too, support the renaming of the VA  outpatient clinic in Hinesville, Georgia, after the four servicemembers  who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country in Vietnam. Like a  majority of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I will support  this bill because it is the right thing to do.   This weekend, so many of us returned to our districts to honor the  men and women who have served our Nation in uniform in theaters and  eras from World War II to our veterans who served multiple deployments  in Iraq and Afghanistan. We recognized every man and woman who has  answered the call to duty because it is the right thing to do.   However, it is incumbent upon all of us in this Chamber to do more  and to do better. Our words ring hollow if we don't do our part to  fulfill our Nation's solemn promise to serve our veterans and their  families as well as they have served our country. These words cannot  only be spoken, but we must act upon them, live upon them.   While I believe it is important that we recognize John Gibson, Dan  James, William Sapp, and Frankie Smiley, I ask myself how do we best  serve the next generation of our Nation's veterans? How do we show them  the respect that they have shown us? How do we let them age with  as much dignity as they deserve and as much as possible?    Long-term care is one of the biggest challenges facing our aging  population and their families. That is why I am calling on Speaker  Johnson to bring before the House my bill, H.R. 542, the Elizabeth Dole  Home Care Act, for a vote. This bill, which has overwhelming  bipartisan, bicameral support and passed out of the House Veterans'  Affairs Committee unanimously almost 4 months ago, would be a fitting  honor for the service and sacrifice of the Vietnam veterans advocating  for this bill.   It would be the single largest expansion of long-term care services  at VA in decades. It would impact nearly every veteran living with  catastrophic disabilities or living with the effects of aging.   Currently, every veteran enrolled in VA has the right to nursing home  care if clinically eligible, but it is important to note that nursing  homes are not where veterans want to live their golden years. They want  to be home. They want to be with their families. They want to be in  their communities and with their communities. I doubt there is a person  here today who has not grappled with how best to care for an aging or  disabled loved one. Every veteran should have the right to dignity in  their later years.   VA home- and community-based services enable veterans to do just  that. However, these services are not available at all VA medical  centers, and my bill changes that.   In addition to listening to what veterans want, home- and community- based services are also a far less expensive option for taxpayers and  an investment in the elder care infrastructure this country so  desperately needs. Even more important is, the health outcomes of those  who are cared for at home are far, far better than the outcomes of  those who receive care in an institution.   The chairman spoke about the Elizabeth Dole bill and said that CBO  has scored it in a way that has caused him to have to revisit the bill.  I don't know what he means because we got a CBO score. We had one CBO  score that was astronomical. Then, finally, we won with CBO, and CBO  went back and looked at the bill again and said, oh, no, it is just a  very minimal cost. The beauty of this bill is the health outcomes of  veterans are much better, it is less expensive than institutionalized  care, and we can use that money to invest in other programs for our  veterans.                                time  1800    As you all know too well, our healthcare system is facing a silver  tsunami as the largest generation, baby boomers, enter their later  years. VA is not exempt from this tsunami, and preparation is critical.   Almost half of VA's patient population is over 65. Without an  aggressive expansion of home care, in the next 15 years, VA will have  doubled its spending on institutional, long-term care services, nearing  $15 billion, to meet these needs.   Without the option of receiving care at home, veterans will have to  languish on wait lists or move to facilities far away from their  families.   All this aside, the Elizabeth Dole act is the right thing to do right  now. As both Chairman Bost and Ranking Member Takano have stated, this  is the right time. The Elizabeth Dole act is the right bill for this  Congress to pass and move forward.   It is too late for this bill to go to the President's desk before  Veterans Day,  [[Page H5710]]  as I had hoped, but we cannot delay any further. Our veterans, their  caregivers, and their families cannot wait any longer. To further delay  this bill is really absolutely cruel.   Let us work together. Let's work with Senator Elizabeth Dole to  fulfill our promise to America's veterans. Let us act, and let us act  now, Mr. Speaker.
