 Mr. Chair, I rise today to join my voice with millions of  American parents as the House considers H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of  Rights Act.   H.R. 5 is about one simple and fundamental principle: Parents should  always have a seat at the table when it comes to their child's  education.   We believe that learning is a partnership between a family and their  child's teachers. This bill is the vehicle by which we can put parents  and educators together at the same table to have a productive dialogue.   This bill is not complex or complicated, nor should it be partisan or  polarizing. Contrary to what you may hear from my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle, it is not an attack on our hardworking  teachers, who will always be the heroes in my eyes. It is not an  attempt to have Congress dictate the curriculum or determine the books  in the library. Instead, this bill aims to bring more transparency and  accountability to education, allowing parents to be informed and, when  they have questions and concerns, to lawfully bring them to their local  school boards.   Over the past 2 years, we have seen too many instances where rather  than opening their doors to welcome parents in as partners, some  schools instead slammed them shut and said that government bureaucrats  know what is best for our children.   Parents across this country have overwhelmingly spoken out that they  have had enough. They want a seat at the table because, at the end of  the day, these are our children, not the government's.  [[Page H1349]]    Mr. Chair, I worked in education before I came to Congress, and I am  also a mom. I have seen firsthand how when you educate a child, you  give them a future.   We know that when parents are involved, it is the students who  succeed. We also know that when a family is shut out of their child's  education, it will lead to disastrous results.                                time  1430    Mr. Chair, let us give parents that voice in the learning process.  Let schools open the doors and welcome them in as partners. Let us work  together to build a brighter future for America's children.
