 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to  the House Republican farm bill. I really didn't think that I would have  to say the ``Republican farm bill'' when we worked so diligently in  committee.   This bill would strip our Nation's most vulnerable of the necessary  resources they need to feed their families. The farm bill would bring  hunger and pain to children. The bill kicks 265,000 schoolkids out of  free and reduced lunch, and I have attended a lot of those schools  where I see the kids on free and reduced lunch.   Florida will be the hardest hit State resulting from the removal of  categorical eligibility. In addition, 130,000 hardworking Floridians  will go hungry as a result of this farm bill.   The farm bill doesn't just hurt Floridians. It hurts the entire  country. It hurts seniors. It hurts college students and young adults.  It hurts the disabled, and it even hurts our active military families.   The farm bill also hurts rural communities. I represent several of  those rural communities in north Florida, and it also hurts the  communities that we border in rural Georgia that I receive calls from.   Before voting on this bill, I want to remind my colleagues of the  motto of the USDA, ``Do right and feed everyone.'' The farm bill does  not do right, and it surely doesn't feed everyone.   Mr. Speaker, I want to end with a quote from Isaiah 58:10.    ``If you pour yourself out for the hungry and  satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then shall your light rise in the  darkness and your gloom be as the noonday.''
