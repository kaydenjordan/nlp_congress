 Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of my friend from  Colorado's amendment which would increase funding to improve NOAA's  weather forecasting abilities.   This is an issue that we have to deal with. This is an issue that has  to be dealt with in a proper way. This amendment does that. As chairman  of the subcommittee that oversees this section of the bill, I approve  of, and I hope my colleagues will vote for, the amendment.
