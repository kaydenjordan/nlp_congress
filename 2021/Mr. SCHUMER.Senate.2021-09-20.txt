 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Senate begins this week with a lot  to accomplish in very little time. This week, and in weeks to come,  Senate Democrats will continue our work to pass historic legislation to  strengthen our economy and renew America's middle class for the 21st  century.   Very soon, we will also take up a continuing resolution to avoid a  needless government shutdown and provide emergency funding necessary to  settle Afghan refugees and those devastated by this summer's natural  disasters.   We must also work on a bipartisan basis to extend the debt ceiling to  preserve the very important and cherished full faith and credit of the  United States.   The Senate will also consider recently introduced voting rights  legislation and advancing President Biden's nominees to the judiciary  and to his administration.   So the next few weeks will be critical weeks for the Senate. Members  should be prepared for the possibility of working late nights and into  the weekend.   On the nominations front, we will begin the week by confirming Ms.  Veronica Rossman of Colorado to serve on the Tenth Circuit. Ms. Rossman  has spent the majority of her career in public service, representing  criminal defendants who cannot afford counsel oftentimes. She would be  one of very few Federal public defenders on the entire Federal bench,  bringing both personal and professional diversity to our courts at a  time when we need to strengthen the public's trust in the Federal  judiciary.   In addition to Ms. Rossman's confirmation, Senate Democrats are  working to confirm many other nominees for a critical number of  Agencies, including the Departments of Defense, State, and Treasury.   Now, unfortunately, some of our Republican colleagues have chosen to  play cheap political games and stonewall the confirmation of these  uncontroversial but essential nominees.   Let's be clear. By blocking these perfectly qualified public  servants, my Republican colleagues are deliberately hindering our  government's ability to protect our country and to work with our allies  abroad.   These nominees should be the work of a few hours at most. Many of  them have been reported out of committee with bipartisan support and,  under normal circumstances, would be confirmed without any trouble.   And so while my Republican colleagues won't be able to stop these  nominees from reaching final confirmation, their stonewalling will drag  out what would normally be a routine and easy process. The few  obstructionists on the Republican side who are leading this charge are  deliberately derailing the confirmation of these important nominees in  an all-out effort to gain the support of hard-right elements of their  party, and in the process--the nasty political process they are engaged  in--they are making Americans less safe at home and abroad. They should  stop immediately, and the Republican leader should admonish them.   Now, on the legislative front, Democrats continue to make good  progress toward enacting our Build Back Better agenda into law. Last  week, the House completed their markups--the House committees completed  their markups on the legislative text that underpins Democrats'  reconciliation bill.   Here in the Senate, our caucus held a long and productive discussion  last week about the substance of our bill. We will continue these  discussions as the week progresses.   Now, no one expected that it would be easy to pass legislation to  transform the American economy and provide the biggest tax cut for the  middle class in a generation. But no one in this body was elected to do  only the easy stuff. We have a lot of hard work to do, and  [[Page S6536]]  we are going to keep at it until we get the job done.   Now, I just want to say something about the news we received last  night about the Senate Parliamentarian.   Last night's ruling was extremely disappointing. It saddened me. It  frustrated me. It angered me. But make no mistake. The fight continues.   Senate Democrats have prepared alternative proposals and will be  holding additional meetings with the Senate Parliamentarian in the  coming days.   I have been working closely with my colleagues in the Senate,  including Judiciary Chairman Durbin, Senators Padilla, Menendez, Lujan,  and Cortez Masto, and we will continue our fight to find the best  option available to provide immigrants with the chance at one day  obtaining lawful residence here in America.   The last year and a half have shown how vital our immigrants have  been to keeping our economy going during a time of crisis. So many  risked their lives on the frontline of this pandemic but remain  excluded from the very same benefits that have kept millions of others  secure during these hard times.   We are short of workers from one end of America to the other. One of  the reasons, the Trump administration dramatically cut back on  immigrants in this country. We need them. We need them in our labor  force. We need them to continue American vitality. We need them because  they are part of the American Dream.   It is estimated in my city by some that one-third of the healthcare  workers at the height of COVID who risked their lives for us were  immigrants.   Having a strong law that helps our immigrants is vital. The American  people understand that fixing our broken immigration system is a moral  imperative and an economic imperative. Immigration reform has been one  of the most important causes of my time in the Senate, and I will not  stop fighting to achieve it.   Finally, on addressing the debt limit, on debt limit the Republicans  are doing a dine-and-dash of historic proportions that hurts the  American people and hurts our country. That hurts the American people  and hurts our country.    In the immediate future, both parties will have to come together to  allow the Federal Government to continue its most important  responsibility: paying the bills and making good on our outstanding  obligations.   A few minutes ago, I joined with Speaker Pelosi in announcing that  the continuing resolution that we will take up to avoid a government  shutdown will also include a suspension of the debt limit through  December 2022, allowing us to meet our obligations and preserve the  full faith and credit of these United States of America. Suspending the  debt limit through December of 2022 provides an amount of time  commensurate with the debt that was incurred as a result of the $908  billion COVID emergency relief bill last year. That was a bill that was  passed when Donald Trump was President and Senator McConnell was the  majority leader of the Senate. It was passed under Republican  leadership. That is the debt we are paying in this bill. The  legislation that funded this $908 billion in COVID relief was supported  by more than 40 Republicans and signed into law by President Trump. So  anyone who says this is Democratic debt is not talking fact; they are  talking fiction.   Both sides--both sides--have a responsibility to pay for the debt  that we have already incurred. It has always been done in a bipartisan  way. Unfortunately, last week, Leader McConnell announced that the  Senate Republicans are inclined to deliberately turn their backs on  their obligations.   When asked if Republicans would block an extension of the debt limit,  Leader McConnell, amazingly and cravenly, said that ``Republicans are  united in opposition to raising the debt ceiling.'' Shame. This is the  same Leader McConnell who urged Democrats and Republicans to support  raising the debt ceiling when Donald Trump was President and he was  majority leader. He always comes up with some sophistry as to why it is  different, but everyone knows it is not different. In fact, Democrats  supported three times raising the debt ceiling when Trump was  President, and if my recollection is right, at least one of those times  was when the House, the Senate, and the Presidency were controlled by  Republicans.   Should Republicans careen our country toward a default, our country  could actually be plunged into recession--laying off millions, making  it harder for people to pay for the food on the table and their  mortgages and their rent. Shame, shame on the Republican leader.   As Secretary Yellen put it just days ago, failure to raise the debt  limit would have ``absolutely catastrophic economic consequences . . .  [and] would precipitate a financial crisis.'' A default would risk  sending interest rates sky high across the board, hurting consumers,  small businesses, and our country's ability to borrow in the future.  Our economy, still fresh off the trauma of the COVID crisis, could slip  back into recession and undo everything we have done to help struggling  Americans pick themselves back up.   Now, many on the other side, including the Republican leader himself,  are trying to justify their reckless position with deeply misleading  talking points. They have argued over and over again that they refuse  to work with Democrats because they oppose our forthcoming legislative  agenda. Of course, what they don't say is that these two issues have  nothing to do with each other. The forthcoming legislative agenda has  not incurred any debt--a nickel of debt--in the United States. It was  the previous agenda of President Trump and the Republican Senate and  Republicans in the House that created this debt.   Republicans ignore the analysis like the one done by the Washington  Post, which observed that ``roughly 97 percent of the current U.S.  cumulative debt was accrued before Biden took office.'' Indeed, none  other than the Wall Street Journal made this even clearer. ``Raising  the debt limit wouldn't facilitate future spending,'' it said, ``and  Congress would still need to raise the debt limit this fall even if no  new major spending programs are enacted.''   I want to repeat that not just for Leader McConnell but for my  Republican colleagues. Hopefully there are some who will rise to their  responsibility and abandon this crass, craven, political move, which  would do such harm to the United States, that the Republican leader has  proffered. So I will read it again. The Wall Street Journal said,  ``Raising the debt limit wouldn't facilitate future spending'' and went  on to say that ``Congress would still need to raise the debt limit this  fall even if no new major spending programs are enacted.''   So the bottom line is simple. Let me repeat. What Republicans are  doing is nothing short of a dine-and-dash of historic proportions. They  want working-class American families to foot the bill for their  irresponsibility, and as a consequence of their callous political  games, it will be veterans and Social Security payment recipients who  suffer most.   This isn't just another partisan fight. This isn't who can be more  macho. This is about the country. All too often, the press--they make  it into macho, macho. That is wrong. What one party is doing here,  everyone knows, is deliberately wrong--at least the Republican leader  and all those who choose to follow him--with serious consequences for  the people. It is not just another partisan fight; it is about avoiding  a crisis that would undo all the progress our country has made to heal  itself of the COVID crisis.   Democrats are going to do the responsible thing and vote to extend  the debt limit when the time comes. We will see which of our Republican  colleagues on the other side will have the strength and the courage to  follow suit.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
