 Mr. Speaker, in times like this, I am inspired by the  strength and generosity of the people in Kansas and across our Nation.  However, we know that the coronavirus outbreak has impacted hardworking  Kansans, their families and their friends and relatives across the  country.   Wichita is their capital of the world. In our area, we have already  been hit hard by the grounding due to the 737 Max issues, but now small  businesses are facing uncertainty, as Kansans have been asked to stay  at home, not knowing when they can resume operations again.   Today, I rise on behalf of the workers and families in Kansas who  need Congress to get this right. Every minute we spend trying to  politicize this crisis wastes critical time and hurts Americans. We  should focus on what really matters: offering stability to families  that need it and getting America back open for business again.   The CARES Act assists small businesses and distressed industries,  giving families and unemployed workers the financial means to make it  to the other side of this crisis and ensures that job creators are  positioned to keep paying their workers and rehire those who have been  laid off when we recover.   Kansans and Americans across the country----
