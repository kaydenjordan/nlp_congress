 Madam Speaker, I was appalled to learn that multiple  schools in Fairfax County, Virginia, withheld National Merit  Scholarship commendation award letters from hundreds of students. This  is a problem.   When political ideology stands in the way of students' success, it is  a problem. When the pursuit of so-called equity starts harming  students, it is a problem. When school bureaucrats hold students back  to hide their own failures, it is a problem.   The education bureaucracy failed these students. These students  deserve to be rewarded for their hard work, and these students deserve  an education system that will lift them up, not try to keep them down.   These school administrators were trusted with the future of these  students, and they broke that trust. Shame on them.                               Dual Enrollment     Madam Speaker, one silver lining of the pandemic is that it  pushed more high school students to take dual enrollment classes.   With the ever-rising cost of postsecondary education, dual enrollment  programs are a great way for high school students to save on college  costs. These programs allow advanced students to get a head start on  their futures.   This is the case at Jefferson State Community College in Birmingham,  Alabama, where high schoolers made up a third of the student body,  according to NPR. These students are benefiting from extensive State  expansion of a dual enrollment program. The more education innovation  we have, the better.   Madam Speaker, we know that if a high school student takes at least  one college-level course, that student is three times more likely to  graduate from college than if the student didn't take a course.   We should give students as many opportunities as possible to shape  their own education experience, and encouraging dual enrollment is one  great way to do just that.                                time  1015                            Filling the Skills Gap     Madam Speaker, it is no wonder we have a skills gap. For  decades, people have been told that a bachelor's degree is the only  path to a successful career. As a result, fewer and fewer young people  are choosing to learn skilled trades.   Without skilled professionals, who will repair our roads, homes, and  cars? We need these men and women who aren't afraid to get their hands  dirty.  [[Page H285]]  Yet, applications for technical jobs dropped by almost 50 percent over  the last 2 years.   With a potential looming recession for those holding office jobs,  many might be disappointed they missed out on learning a high-skilled  trade. Fortunately, it isn't too late. Many open technical jobs pay a  six-figure salary, and businessowners are struggling to fill them.   If I had to give young people advice today, it would be to consider  learning a high-skilled trade.                            ____________________
