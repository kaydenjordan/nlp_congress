 Mr. President, I wish to thank our colleague from  Nebraska and our guest this morning for reminding us of the wonderful  story of Boys Town. We were discussing the movie from the late 1930s  staring Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney, as well as learning what has  happened to Boys Town since then.   Thank you so much, Senator Fischer and our guest, for bringing us up  to date on the latest on Boys Town.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, in addition to our important work on  tax reform and to fund the government, this week the Senate is also  continuing our efforts to confirm President Trump's nominees to his  administration.   Soon the Senate will consider the nomination of Joseph Balash to  serve as Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Land and Minerals  Management. Through his career in both State government and as the  Alaska commissioner of natural resources and his service here in the  U.S. Senate, Mr. Balash has shown his talent and passion for affordable  sources of energy and environmental protection.   The Alaska Department of Natural Resources manages one of the largest  portfolios of land, water, oil, gas, renewables, timber, and minerals  in the world. Mr. Balash's leadership of the department required  collaboration with many diverse stakeholders and a dedication to the  protection of Alaska's natural beauty. He worked closely with the  Interior Department and the commissioner, and he has the skills  necessary to fulfill this leadership role at the Department.   As the Assistant Secretary, Mr. Balash will be responsible for many  of the Interior Department's critical functions, including the  management of all Federal lands and waters, the management of their  associated resources, and the appropriate regulation of surface coal  mining. I look forward to working with Mr. Balash on many of these  issues, especially those important to the coal miners in my home State  of Kentucky.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this nomination.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on another matter, yesterday the  Senate formally voted to join our colleagues from the House to consider  our tax reform bills in a conference committee. It is another important  step toward delivering much needed relief to the men, women, and  families we represent. Now the committee members will reconcile the  differences between the bills. When they finish their work, Members of  both Chambers will have the opportunity to pass this tax reform  legislation and send it to President Trump.   As I have said before, tax reform represents the single most  important thing we can do right now to grow the economy and boost  middle-class families. It will also incentivize businesses to bring  investment and jobs home and keep them here. We want a tax bill that  works for hard-working American families, one that can bring  opportunity, help create new jobs, and keep more money in workers'  paychecks. That means a typical family of four earning a median income  could see a tax cut of approximately $2,200.   This tax reform plan is our way of helping families get ahead and  plan for their future. It has taken a lot of hard work to get to this  point, and I wish to thank my Senate colleagues and our friends in the  House and in the Trump administration for their efforts to  fundamentally rethink our Tax Code.   I look forward to the conference committee's report so we can  complete our efforts and deliver relief to those who need it most.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on one final matter, the Senate  must act before the end of the week to pass a clean, short-term funding  bill to maintain critical operations of the Federal Government. Our  colleagues in the House will send us the noncontroversial provision  soon, and then we will have an opportunity to consider it. I urge my  colleagues to join me in voting to pass it. This short-term continuing  resolution will provide us with the time we need to complete  discussions on a long-term solution. It will also provide certainty to  States to continue funding the Children's Health Insurance Program.   Later today, Speaker Ryan, Leader Schumer, Leader Pelosi, and I will  meet with President Trump to continue discussing an agreement to fund  the Federal Government. I look forward to working together with  colleagues in a serious, bipartisan way to address a number of the  priorities of our Nation in the coming weeks. I hope all Members will  join me.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, on behalf of all of our colleagues, I  want to thank the junior Senator from Alabama for an extraordinary  farewell. Due to the unusual circumstances of his arrival, his service  here regretfully is limited to roughly a year, but I know all of our  colleagues share the view that the Senator from Alabama has made an  extraordinary difference for Alabama and for the Nation during his time  here. I know I also express the views of all of our colleagues that we  will miss him greatly.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to H.J. Res. 123, which was received from the House, and that  there be 30 minutes of debate, equally divided in the usual form, in  relation to H.J. Res. 123; further, that following the use or yielding  back of that time, the joint resolution be considered read a third time  and the Senate vote on the joint resolution with no intervening action  or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order to make a motion to proceed to Executive Calendar Nos. 533, 534,  and 535 today.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 533.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 534.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 535.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions, which were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 351, S. Res.  352, and S. Res. 353.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolutions be agreed to, the preambles be agreed to, and the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 4 p.m. on Monday,  December 11; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that following leader  remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Grasz nomination; finally, that notwithstanding  the provisions of rule XXII, the cloture motions filed during today's  session ripen at 5:30 p.m., Monday.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:21 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, December 11, 2017, at 4 p.m.                            ____________________
