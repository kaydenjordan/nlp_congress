 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 111, which  will block the CFPB's harmful arbitration rule.   I want to start with a little story. Last year, I opened up the mail,  and I got a wonderful surprise. I got a check for $3.92. Apparently, I  was part of some class action lawsuit, didn't know it, dug into the  facts, didn't feel I had been harmed, didn't know who the attorneys  were, but I got $3.92, almost enough to buy a latte. I did a little  digging around and turns out the lawyers representing the plaintiff  class made millions of dollars.   Now, we have heard a lot of conflicting stories here today about this  bill being harmful to consumers. Here are the facts.   In a class action lawsuit, a typical consumer gets $32; in  arbitration, a typical consumer gets $5,400; in a class action lawsuit,  it takes 12 times longer for the consumer to get the money.   But how can this be? Well, in my prior life, I represented a lot of  clients who were involved in class action lawsuits. Here is your  typical class action lawsuit.    It involves a highly technical violation, not the Wells Fargo  example, where there is little or no harm to the consumer, goes on for  years, costs millions of dollars in legal fees, and at the end of the  day, there is a settlement for $3.92.   I will make a deal with my friends on the other side of the aisle. I  will buy anyone a latte who comes clean with the American people and  tells them why they are opposing this bill.   The reason why they are opposing this bill is the Trial Lawyers  Association makes millions of dollars, and that money lines the pockets  of their campaign coffers. It is not about consumers. It is about  lawyers protecting lawyers, and it is about protecting the bureaucrats  in the swamp.   I ask all my colleagues to join me in supporting this joint  resolution.
