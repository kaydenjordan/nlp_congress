 Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to  honor an outstanding member of south Jersey. Rev. Dr. Robin Weinstein  is a true believer in human potential and harnesses that power through  extensive work and his community involvement.   In addition to being an associate professor at Wilmington University,  he started the M25 Initiative to find ways to alleviate suffering, feed  the hungry, end poverty, reduce crime, and revitalize the community.   Dr. Weinstein is also a cofounder of the Cumberland County Code Blue  Coalition, which provides emergency winter shelter to those who are  very much in need.   On top of all of these things, Dr. Weinstein serves as the founding  pastor of Bethany Grace Community Church in Bridgeton, New Jersey.  Under his leadership, the church has started a weekly soup kitchen,  monthly food pantry and clothing closet, showers for the homeless, and  many other programs that provide for the people of south Jersey who so  desperately need them.   His tireless efforts make an impact on the community that is felt far  and wide.   The people of south Jersey appreciate all you do, Dr. Weinstein.                            ____________________
