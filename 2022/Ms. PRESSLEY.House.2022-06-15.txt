 Mr. Speaker, for too long, our policies and financial  systems have exacerbated inequities and disparities throughout our  country. I rise in support of our disabled neighbors who have been  subjected to a second-class standard of living.   By passing the Financial Services Racial Equity, Inclusion, and  Economic Justice Act, the House will move one step closer to addressing  these systemic injustices.   Today, I rise in support of a series of amendments I have offered to  advance disability justice. My amendments will prohibit financial  creditors from discriminating against consumers who are disabled and  increase access to interpretation services, including American Sign  Language.   My amendment will also hold corporations accountable to disclose the  disability status, based on voluntary self-identification, of their  board of directors and executive officers.   The status quo will not change until we recognize that disability  rights are human rights and call out and address the barriers the  disability community faces.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my amendments and  support the underlying bill.    Madam Speaker, my family and I have celebrated  Juneteenth for decades, but this year marks only the second year that  Juneteenth will be observed as a Federal holiday.   Some may wonder what is the significance of this day and why is  national recognition long overdue and notable?   It matters, because as we celebrate Juneteenth--the emancipation of  my enslaved ancestors--it is a truth-telling reminder of our Nation's  history and founding, but also of what is possible.   When enslaved Black people and allies began the work of abolition,  many considered the goal of freedom an improbable or impossible one,  but because of their imaginations and sacrifice it did happen.   While we recognize that our fight for equity and justice continues  today, on this day, we celebrate the Black family, our culture, our  melanin, our resilience, our brilliance, and our joy. We affirm our  humanity. We are more than hashtags, sobering statistics, deficits,  disparities, and gaps. We are more than our labor, the resistance, and  justice-seekers.   From the heart of Texas to kitchen tables in Roxbury, we celebrate  the dedicated coalition of Black folks who organize to make this  celebration a Federal holiday.   Black lives matter. Black healing matters. Black joy matters. Happy  Juneteenth.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Omar for bringing  us together this afternoon and for her steadfast leadership on the  issue of hunger and food insecurity, an issue that she has been leading  on since she was in the Minnesota State Legislature. We are grateful  for her shining a light consistently on this and the need for us to  address rising hunger and its impact on communities here and around the  globe.   Madam Speaker, across Massachusetts' Seventh District and across the  Nation, families are facing unprecedented levels of food insecurity. I  am reminded of the words of Coretta Scott King, who said: ``Starving a  child is violence. Neglecting schoolchildren is violence.''   We can, in fact, do something about this violence.   I am picking up on the words of Congressman McGovern, a global  champion in the fight against hunger and food insecurity, when he said  that we should stop managing problems and solve them. This is a  solvable problem.    A recent survey by the Greater Boston Food Bank found that nearly 2  million adults across the Commonwealth struggled to get enough to eat  last year. It was Black, Latinx, and LGBTQ people and their families  with children who were most likely to struggle.   No one should know hunger. No parent should know the heartache of  putting their baby to sleep with an empty belly.   Our communities were already in the midst of a hunger crisis, one  that we knew would be exacerbated by the pandemic. In response, my  congressional colleagues and I acted to provide critical resources and  flexibilities to support schools and communities in serving and meeting  the needs of families and children in need. Schools across the Nation  were able to keep school meal programs afloat while providing free  meals to an additional 10 million students each day.   Boston Public Schools, the largest school district in my district,  was able to serve over 330,000 students with free breakfasts and  lunches across all city neighborhoods.   For many families, these meals were the only reliable source of  nutrition throughout the day. They were a saving grace and a lifeline  for families across my district and across the Nation, Madam Speaker.   In less than 2 weeks, these school lunch flexibilities are set to  expire. We must act with urgency to avoid a hunger cliff that will fall  hardest on our most vulnerable children. We must act to avoid a  scenario where children will face a loss of 95 million meals over the  course of the summer alone.   States and districts have been sounding the alarm. It was these calls  from the community that prompted my colleagues, Representatives  McGovern, Lee, and me, to send an urgent letter to House and Senate  leaders, 1 month ago now, urging them to do everything in their power  to extend these essential lifelines. Senate Minority Leader McConnell  continues to block efforts to get this done. It is shameful yet  unsurprising.   In one of the richest nations in the world, it is an absolute  disgrace that millions of children struggle with food insecurity every  single day. The clock is running out, and we have a mandate and a duty  to get this done.   To my Republican colleagues, I urge them to join us in getting this  done. Children, families, and school district leaders across the Nation  simply cannot wait.   Once again, I thank my sister in service, Representative Omar, for  her steadfast leadership.
