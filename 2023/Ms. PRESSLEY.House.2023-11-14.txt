 Mr. Speaker, I rise to unequivocally condemn anti- Semitism, Islamophobia, and all forms of hate on college campuses  throughout our country.   The Massachusetts Seventh is known for its institutions of higher  learning,  [[Page H5734]]  and my office has heard from students, faculty, and administrators  sounding the alarm on hateful rhetoric since the outbreak of war in  Israel and Gaza.   Let me be clear: There is no justification for anti-Semitism or  Islamophobia or any other form of hatred. Mr. Speaker, whether you wear  a yarmulke or a hijab, you have a right to show up as your authentic  self.   Doxing on the internet, violence at protests, and endangering  people's lives must stop. We cannot become that which we condemn.   The only way forward is to center our shared humanity. I came to  Congress to strengthen our communities, not to play politics with  harmful resolutions of erasure or to defund civil rights by banning  diversity and inclusion.   To the students of the Massachusetts Seventh of all faith traditions,  I say this: Know that I see you. The world is better because of you.  Your talents, skills, and passions will transform our society.  Together, we can build a future rooted in radical love, not hate.                            ____________________
