 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my opposition to the  idea of using Federal funds to arm teachers. This issue has haunted me  from the moment it was first discussed after the tragedy at Sandy Hook  Elementary School to more recently when it was revisited after the  Parkland shooting.   Seventy-three percent of teachers do not want this. More than 60  percent of parents do not want this. And the majority of students do  not want this.   Since 1999, in 225 incidents of school campus gun violence, armed  personnel failed to disarm a shooter 223 times.   I came to Congress from the classroom. As a teacher, I would never  want the responsibility of securing a firearm in a school. I understand  how this would drastically change the school culture and make it feel  more like a prison.   As the wife of a police officer, I understand the training that is  involved with the responsibility of owning a firearm, and I know that  school districts cannot manage that. I could never imagine explaining  to a parent that it was my firearm that accidentally injured their  child.   I recognize that many local school communities are still trying to  decide where they fall on this conversation, yet I cannot overstress  the point that Federal funds should not be diverted from student  learning outcomes to arm teachers.   This is why, today, I have introduced a resolution to prohibit the  use of Federal funds to arm teachers.                            ____________________
