 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great uncertainty. I am  uncertain that I can make it through this speech without being  interrupted by a robocall, which has become a daily or, rather,  sometimes an hourly nuisance.   For far too long now robocalls and spoofing have become a hindering  plague upon the phones of millions of Americans. I hear from  constituents on a daily basis about how their lives are habitually  interrupted by phony phone calls, and how their cell phones, once seen  as necessities, are now sources of frustration.   In many cases, these calls are dangerous and disguised, seeking to  steal valuable information by tricking the unsuspecting. In other  cases, these aggravating calls disrupt important business, intrude on  leisure activities, disturb family dinners and, even worse, are not  restricted by the time of day.                                time  1030    These calls have been distracting, irritating, and deceiving  Americans for long enough, and that is why I have introduced a bill  called the Double the Enforcement and Fines of Everyone Associated with  Terrible Robocalls Act, or, in short, the DEFEAT Robocalls Act. This  bill ensures the harshest penalties for the individuals who are caught  making illegal robocalls and spoofing calls. Simply said, the bill  takes all the fines and penalties that those making robocalls currently  face and doubles them.   It is time that we hold those who continue scamming Americans all  across the country liable for their actions in a manner as serious as  their crime.   I am encouraged to see Congress' recent legislative actions to  prevent robocalls from being a daily hindrance, and I call on my  colleagues to continue moving swiftly to send a bill to the President's  desk so that we can restore Americans' trust when they answer their  phones.             Honoring the Life of Dr. Christopher Columbus Kraft     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Dr.  Christopher Columbus Kraft, who served as NASA's first flight director  and one of the agency's preeminent leaders.   Kraft passed away on July 22, 2019, at the impressive age of 95 years  old and only 2 days after the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon  landing.   It is impossible to overstate the vital role that Kraft played in the  formative years of NASA.   After graduating from Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 1944 with a  bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering, Dr. Kraft started work  at NASA's precursor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics;  and toward the onset of the space race in 1958, President Eisenhower  established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and  tasked Project Mercury with getting America into space and putting a  man into orbit.   During this time, Kraft essentially created the entire concept of  mission control and successfully directed all six crewed Mercury  missions, including those that made Alan Shepard the first American in  space and John Glenn the first American in orbit.   In Project Gemini, Kraft was promoted to the head of mission  operations. Now in charge of a team of flight directors, he served ``on  console'' during many historic moments, including Ed White's first  spacewalk in Gemini 4.   Achieving all of this proved to the country and the rest of the world  that America could succeed in space, and certainly set the stage for  the Apollo missions to the Moon.  [[Page H7385]]    During Apollo, Chris Kraft soon rose to the position of deputy  director of the Manned Spacecraft Center, now known as Johnson Space  Center, which I proudly represent, and in 1972 was promoted to serve as  the Center director.   Before Dr. Kraft's retirement in 1982, he contributed to a myriad of  other projects, including Skylab and the first space shuttle missions.   While our space program continues to grow by leaps and bounds and our  hands and hearts reach outward for Mars, we should remember the man on  whose shoulders we stand and the great debt owed not only by NASA and  our Nation, but also by our entire planet, to this incredible  individual. Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Kraft for his service to our  country, ``flight.''                            ____________________
