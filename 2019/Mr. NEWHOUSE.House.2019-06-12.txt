 Mr. Chair, as the designee of the gentlewoman from  Texas, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the amendment that I  introduced with my friend from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) to prevent Federal  funds from being used to close or transfer the operations of the U.S.  Forest Service Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers.   Mr. Chair, I am a strong supporter of this administration's  demonstrated commitment to rural prosperity for communities often  ignored or forgotten across this country. Their focus on promoting  policies to protect rural communities is so important to regions of the  country like my own district of central Washington.   Unfortunately, the recent proposal to close many Forest Service Job  Corps facilities and remove the Forest Service-based mission from the  remaining centers will hurt rural America.   It is for this reason that I have been working with a bipartisan  coalition of Members from across the country, both in the House and in  the Senate, to prevent this proposal from moving forward.   The three centers in central and eastern Washington are critical to  supporting our rural communities, which are on the front lines of  facing ever-worsening impacts of catastrophic wildfires.   I have met the students who aid active management efforts in our  Nation's forests and help restore communities devastated by wildfires.  The public service they provide is worthy of our support.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record letters from the National  Association of Home Builders to Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy.                                             National Association of                                                   Home Builders,                                      Washington, DC, June 12, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi: On behalf of the more than 140,000       members of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB),       I write in support of Amendment #13 (#95 for Division A,       sponsored by Representatives DeFazio, Newhouse, Schrader, and       Gianforte) to H.R. 2740, the Fiscal Year 2020 Labor, Health       and Human Services, Education, Legislative Branch, Defense,       State, Foreign Operations, and Energy and Water Development       Appropriations Act. This bipartisan measure would prohibit       funds appropriated for Job Corps from being applied towards       the closure of any of the 25 Job Corps Civilian Conservation       Centers currently operating.        The recent termination of the Department of Agriculture's       training partnership with Job Corps and subsequent       announcement by the Department of Labor (DOL) of nine center       closures is deeply concerning to NAHB and its workforce       development arm, the Home Builders Institute (HBI), which has       trained and placed thousands of students for careers in       residential construction through its 45-year partnership with       Job Corps. HBI Job Corps programs are offered at 65 centers       across the country, and have equipped at-risk youth with the       skills and experience they need for successful careers       through pre-  [[Page H4543]]       apprenticeship training, job placement services, mentoring,       certification programs, textbooks and curricula.        DOL's planned Job Corps center closures stand to impact       more than 43 construction training programs, six of which are       operated by HBI at three of the affected locations. Many of       these centers serve rural and dislocated communities and have       enrollment numbers exceeding national and regional averages.       However, the Department of Labor has not disclosed any       performance metrics or data to support its closure       determinations and it has provided little information on how       it will continue to serve the thousands of at-risk youth who       will be displaced from their local centers. Further, DOL has       not informed contracted training partners like HBI whether       their successfully operating programs--and their       administering staff--will be relocated or simply terminated       along with the centers they have served.        At a time of endemic labor shortages in the industry and a       record-setting 404,000 open construction positions,       eliminating in-demand workforce training programs could prove       catastrophic for the labor market, the underserved youth that       have benefited from the opportunity to learn a skilled trade,       and the communities and businesses that turn to Job Corps for       their workforce needs.        NAHB encourages Congress and the Department of Labor to       work together to address outstanding stakeholder questions       about the proposed closures and urges DOL to offer a plan       that ensures minimal disruption to affected Job Corps       partners and students. In the interim, we ask Representatives       to support Amendment #13 to prevent a hasty shuttering of any       Job Corps centers.            Sincerely,      James W. Tobin III.                                   ____                                             National Association of                                                   Home Builders,                                      Washington, DC, June 12, 2019.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Minority Leader McCarthy: On behalf of the more than       140,000 members of the National Association of Home Builders       (NAHB), I write in support of Amendment #13 (#95 for Division       A, sponsored by Representatives DeFazio, Newhouse, Schrader,       and Gianforte) to H.R. 2740, the Fiscal Year 2020 Labor,       Health and Human Services, Education, Legislative Branch,       Defense, State, Foreign Operations, and Energy and Water       Development Appropriations Act.

HBI Job Corps programs are offered at 65 centers       across the country, and have equipped at-risk youth with the       skills and experience they need for successful careers       through pre-apprenticeship training, job placement services,       mentoring, certification programs, textbooks and curricula.

Mr. Chair, the National Association of Home Builders  accurately states that ``the Department of Labor has not disclosed any  performance metrics or data to support its closure determinations, and  it has provided little information on how it will continue to serve the  thousands of at-risk youth who will be displaced from their local  centers.''   In fact, Mr. Chair, many of the facilities slated to be closed, six  out of the nine, like the Fort Simcoe facility in my own district, are  some of the highest-performing centers in the country.   This simply makes no sense.   I thank Mr. Schrader and Mr. DeFazio, my colleagues from Oregon, as  well as my colleague from Montana (Mr. Gianforte), for their leadership  on this issue, as well as the dozens of bipartisan Members who have  been working alongside Mr. DeFazio and myself to stop this proposal  from moving forward.   I urge my colleagues to support our amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers),  my colleague from just east of me.    Mr. Chair, I would like to, again, urge all of my  colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
