 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the farmers,  ranchers, agricultural producers, and independent oil and gas producers  that have been forced to operate their businesses under three different  definitions of the word ``water'' in the past 10 years alone.   Congress has spoken clearly on this issue. President Biden received a  bicameral, bipartisan joint resolution of disapproval under the  Congressional Review Act on his administration's flawed and burdensome  waters of the United States, or WOTUS, rule. He vetoed it, and that is  inexplicable. Congress, not the executive branch, was created to  legislate, and it is sad that this particular example of legislating  from the executive branch serves as an outrageous instance of  government overreach.   While President Biden would like to federally regulate every small  stream, ditch, and puddle from sea to shining sea, American producers  have been the careful custodians of their own resources for centuries.  They are the original conservationists, and their livelihoods already  depend on their voluntary efforts to care for their own water  resources.   How we vote today will speak volumes. By overriding President Biden's  veto, Congress has the opportunity to stand up not only for the people  who feed, fuel, and clothe us all, but also for all Americans whose  businesses and private lives would be affected by this Big Government  encroachment onto their property.   We can either tell Americans that we believe the Federal Government  knows best, or we can tell them that the Federal Government should get  out of their way and let them do what they do best. I know where I  stand.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
