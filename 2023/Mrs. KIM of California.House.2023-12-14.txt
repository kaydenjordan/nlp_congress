 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Calvert  for his leadership and for yielding.   I rise to honor and thank Speaker Kevin McCarthy who is a selfless  and amazing leader and who is always optimistic about his service in  Congress which has left a lasting impact on his community, our States,  our party, and our country.   Kevin has had my back since I first decided to run for Congress, and  he has encouraged me every single step of the way. He has worked  tirelessly to make our party look more like America, and the gains we  have made in the past 5 years are a testament to that.   Kevin has been committed to ensuring people like me and each of us in  our conference have what it takes to be effective Members for our  districts. He is the reason we have a House majority today.   I always say the GOP is the grand opportunity party, and that is  because of Members like Kevin, who are committed to promoting  commonsense policies to get our country back on track, make life more  affordable, keep our communities safe, and protect the American Dream.   I thank Kevin. I wish him the best in the next chapter. I know he is  just getting started because I know he never gives up.
