 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, the motorcoach industry has been  particularly hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic  turndown as a result of it. Iowa has many motorcoach operators, several  of which are really family owned and some of them for two or three  generations.   I have been in frequent communication with these Iowans, and I am  learning they are quickly coming to the point of making a decision of  whether they can even stay in business. Motorcoaches provide passenger  transportation services to all Americans, providing over 600 million  passenger trips annually across the country. By comparison, airlines  provided service for 925 million passenger trips in 2019.   While most other modes of transportation received specific funding to  help them through the pandemic, the motorcoach industry has not. What  they are really referring to when they talk to me, they seem to feel  that they have been left out when we have given several tens of  millions of dollars to help the airline industry.   I spoke with Secretary Mnuchin about this matter and have relayed the  concerns from these Iowa companies to relevant committees here in the  Senate. The government relies on motorcoach industries to help move  troops and also evacuate people to safety during our natural disasters.  However, with passenger bookings being nonexistent and few charters  being scheduled, this leaves little hope of rebound yet this year. The  industry may not survive to provide this service in the future if they  don't receive support.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I do thank the Senator from Delaware for  bailing me out, as we sometimes say in Iowa.   I have two reasons for speaking this morning. No. 1, very shortly,  this week is the 30th year of the Americans with Disabilities Act as  the law of the land. There are plenty of reasons to recognize that law  for the landmark that it is and how it has helped people advance in our  society and get more equality, but also, I do it because a former  colleague of mine from Iowa, Senator Tom Harkin, working along with  Senator Bob Dole, worked really hard to get this landmark civil rights  legislation signed into law. Since that day, America has continued to  improve opportunities, inclusion, and access for individuals who live  with disabilities.   As my colleagues and I work to defeat the virus, heal the racial  divide, lower prescription drug prices, and restore the U.S. economy,  let's take a lesson from the passage of the ADA, very much a  cooperative relationship between Republicans and Democrats. Let's work  together in good faith and work out our differences for the good of the  American people--whether it was the Americans with Disabilities Act or,  now, efforts to beat the virus and get the economy going.
