 Madam Speaker, Build Back Better not only meets long- awaited critical needs, such as clean energy technology, it is fully  paid for, unlike the 2001 and 2017 tax cuts under Republican  Presidents.   This is because the largest corporations and the highest income  Americans will pay their fair share, are not rewarded for shipping jobs  and profits overseas, and will have more difficulty avoiding IRS  compliance.   Moreover, 17 Nobel Prize-winning economists say the bill's  investments enhance productive participation in our economy and ease  the long-term inflation pressure that is the frontline concern of  Americans today.   Congress will make history by passing this historic legislation.                            ____________________
