 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our friend and  colleague, Jackie Walorski, with a cause that was near to her heart,  the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program, also  known as the MIECHV program.   Jackie lived a life of service, not just as a Member of the House of  Representatives, but as a missionary for 4 years in Romania where, not  surprisingly, she worked with a lot of children. She championed  children and families in her role on the Worker and Family Support  Subcommittee, and always advocated for the Hoosiers she represented.   In her honor today, we're going to pass this critical bipartisan  legislation reauthorizing a program that its whole purpose is to ensure  that mothers and children do not fall through the cracks. Families will  be able to be met where they are and connected to a host of support  systems.   Earlier this year, I visited with some early childhood supporters in  Wichita, and the MIECHV program was something that they repeatedly told  me was important for the work they do and the families they serve.   I look forward to seeing strong bipartisan support today to pass this  bill, lift up children and families, and honor our friend, Jackie.
