 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for coming down here and  talking about the importance of farming in the United States. One of  the things we are dealing with, obviously, and talked about, is some  fertilizer shortages. I know that firsthand, seeing some of the farms  in the district I represent, West Texas and so forth. And we have got a  lot of issues we have got to address.   And I just want to note, as a Texan--we had my fellow Texan down here  just a little bit ago--that here we sit again. Here it is, March 31, in  an empty Chamber again. It is the close of a quarter, a fiscal quarter.  Members got their places to go, their dinners to go to.   We just ran through a handful of votes today. No amendments. No  debates.   Here is the people's House in all its glory. No debate. No  discussion.   Did we have a single debate here in the people's House about what is  happening at our southern border today? Any discussion at all?   Does the Speaker of the House of Representatives give a rat's rear- end about South Texas or the rest of this country; about the ranchers  that are dealing with a flood of people coming across our border,  endangering them and their families? No, they don't care. They don't  care at all. But I can tell you, we in Texas care. And the leadership  of this body better start caring soon.   And let me just say something to all my fellow Republicans who just  funded this government two weeks ago. Those of you who cut a deal, a  deal with the devil, you are responsible for this, too. You funded this  government. You funded the government that is allowing people to come  across our border, that is empowering cartels, that is allowing  migrants to get abused, that is causing ranchers to lose their  livestock, ranchers to be endangered, fentanyl to pour across our  border.   And now this administration has the gall to shut down Title 42 while  Americans are still wearing masks on airplanes, while we still have men  and  [[Page H4067]]  women in uniform being forced to get a needle stuck in their arm from  the power of government. And the leadership, so-called leadership, of  our government has the gall to shut down Title 42. The one thing  allowing us to stop the flood at our border, even partially.   March of this year. This year. Right now. March, 200,000  apprehensions; 100,000 turned away under Title 42. But now the head of  the CDC, in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security  Secretary, is saying we are going to stop using Title 42.   Well, then what in the hell are you going to do? Nothing. Other than  process more immigrants coming across our border who are not truly  seeking asylum. But that is what is happening. And what is actually  happening at our border right now is there are shootouts going on as we  speak on a daily basis, between the Gulf Cartel--technically, the  Jalisco New Generation Cartel, but Gulf Cartel CDG warring with Cartel  del Noreste of Los Zetas.   And we are talking about dead people, dead bodies. People getting  shot in their car. Bullets firing, flying all over our southern border.  Dead individuals.   This young girl here, head blown off. All of this is happening every  single day. All while American kids are dying from Xanax laced with  fentanyl.   And again, I want to be clear here. When you take Title 42 away--you,  Secretary Mayorkas; you, CDC Director Walensky; you, my Democratic  colleagues who are countering and funding it; you, President Biden-- when you take away Title 42, the blood is on your hands.                                time  2000    And we're talking about dead Americans, dead migrants, destroyed  communities in Texas, empowered cartels. Literally last night in  talking to people coming across the border, saying they are spending  $3,000 to $5,000 to come up from Nicaragua, Venezuela, Cuba. There were  13,000 apprehensions from Russia in the last 5 months.   We are about to see an unprecedented explosion on our southern  border. Again, this administration not only doesn't care, it is  purposeful. It is 100 percent purposeful. Endangering the people of the  United States, endangering migrants while--in the false name of  compassion saying it is good for them, empowering cartels, knowing they  are doing it. Knowing for the most part you do not have a legitimate  claim for asylum.   They are purposely not enforcing the laws of the United States. They  are purposely not using the tools at their disposal, like now ending  Title 42. For what reason? For crass political purposes. That is your  modern Democratic Party. Using migrants for political purposes and  endangering them and Americans in the process.   It is a gross violation of the oath taken to defend the Constitution  of the United States. It is fully and entirely impeachable and every  Republican should be agreeing to impeach Secretary Mayorkas on day one  when we come into this body and we are in charge of the House of  Representatives next January after the absolute feckless destruction of  this country by an incompetent, destructive Democratic majority in this  body, an incompetent destructive and flat out reckless administration  refusing to enforce the laws of the United States. That is what is  happening.   Oh, you going down there ranting on the floor again about the border?  Well, excuse me, but it is Texas. And Texas needs to be starting to  take a little action to tell the rest of this country to shove it up  its rear end because Texas is taking it on the chin because the  leadership of this country is forsaking Texas, hurting Texas, hurting  my neighbors, hurting my community.   It is about time that it stops. It is about time that Republicans on  this side of the aisle stop giving lip service to border security,  choose to actually do their job and not fund the government that is  refusing to enforce the laws.   I listened to Republican leadership down here on the floor a few  weeks ago trying to tell me, oh--thank me for giving us more money for  ICE and Border Patrol. Well, how the heck is that working out now? More  money for more processing of more migrants getting abused by cartels.  More money for more processing of more migrants to come into Uvalde,  Texas, where the mayor just texted me 5 minutes ago. Tell them--in case  you are wondering, that is you Democrats across the other side of the  aisle, and by the way, Republican leadership--Tell them to come and see  the--I will edit his remarks--crap show they have created 500 to 1,000  a day in Eagle Pass in Del Rio. No vetting.   These are human beings, Texans, people we represent, our communities.  I promise my colleagues on the other side of the aisle they don't give  a whit. They sit in their smug chairs in their committee hearings  saying: Oh, this is all made up. There is nothing to it. It is all  lies.   Just like the lie that President Biden said and his press secretary  said when he accused Border Patrol agents of whipping people. They are  flat out lies. Where are those Border Patrol agents now? Have they been  returned to their job? Has a report come out? No.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield to the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. Good), my friend who accompanied me on a trip to the border about  a month ago or so. He is a good friend and he understands what is  actually happening at our border.    Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania, I just want to pick up on something that the gentleman  from Virginia said and see if he would agree. If Title 42 goes away,  our country is completely open to anyone who wants to come. Would the  gentleman agree?    Everyone who has been turn away, it has almost entirely been  done under Title 42.    Now, for the listeners at home, Title 42 is a health code  provision allowing our officials in government to turn people away if  we have a communicable disease environment, like we do during the COVID  pandemic. Now, we can do it for any number of communicable diseases,  but we got that in place now.   Roughly half of the folks have been turned away under Title 42. Would  the gentleman agree?    So to that point, would it surprise the gentleman that under  the administration we have turned away 1.7 million people under Title  42?    Yeah, including the time under the Trump administration. So  1.7 million times during the pandemic all the people that were turned  back would likely have been let in and released into the United States  under this administration. Some of those are repeats.    Something along the lines of a million people that would  have been released into the United States last year. Does the gentleman  agree?    Another point. Of the people that have come into the United  States and are being encountered, these are all not just nice people  looking for a job, are they?    One hundred sixty different countries. Roughly, 10,763  criminal noncitizens and at least 3,662 have been arrested thus far in  fiscal year 2022. The combined timeframes include roughly 85  convictions of manslaughter or homicide, 604 sexual offenses, and 2,892  convictions of illegal drug possession and trafficking. Based on  reports at least 14 illegal migrants who are on the terrorist watch  list were stopped at the southern border in fiscal year 2021.   The biggest problem is what?    The got-aways. The more than half a million known got- aways--known--known got-aways--last year. So if we have got people we  are catching on the terrorist watch list, if we have got criminals  convicted of sex crimes, convicted of murder and manslaughter that we  are catching--but that is all people the Border Patrol is running  across and they are often turning themselves in. All of those known  got-aways, do you think those are just the angels seeking a nice job?    It would be.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Perry), one of the great patriots and I am proud to call him my friend.    I would ask my friend from Pennsylvania if he is aware that  our colleague and colleague in the House Freedom Caucus, our friend  Yvette Herrell from New Mexico, introduced legislation a year ago-- actually over a year ago to require the use of Title 42. Is that right?                                time  2015     They do not. And I want to make sure for every American out  there to understand the truth. If you are disgusted about what is  happening at our border, if you are concerned about what is actually  happening to our communities, there is a way we can solve the problem  without Speaker Pelosi making the decisions. Because that is how things  work. We don't ever debate, we don't ever amend, and we don't actually  have discussion in the people's House. The Speaker in a backroom  decides what happens on the floor, vote ``yes'' or ``no,'' walk out,  and give a press conference   But we can do something about that. There is a tool. It is called a  discharge petition. We have a discharge petition at the desk to try to  empower the actual Representatives of this country. We have 200 and I  think now eight Republicans on that discharge petition.    We have zero Democrats--not one Democrat--on that discharge  petition. Now, I want everybody to think about that. The Democrats in  this body apparently are so beholden to the radical idea of wide-open  borders and not implementing Title 42 while Americans are being forced  to wear masks on airplanes, and while Americans are getting a jab  needle stuck in their arm by force of government if they are in the  military or Border Patrol or any other Federal employee while there is  still a Federal health emergency in place under order of the President.    So while that is in place, we have a discharge petition  where we can bring to the floor and vote to force enforcement of Title  42 in this country, and not one of our Democratic colleagues will join  us in that.    We have 13.    It sure would. I think there are somewhere around 50  Democratic Members from border States if you count New Mexico, Arizona,  California, and Texas.   So where are my Democratic colleagues in border States?   I think they ought to be asked. I want to know why won't my  Democratic colleagues from border States or anywhere else in the  country say they believe that we ought to enforce Title 42?   Because guess what? There are a few Senators who have said so.   Isn't that right?    It is a way to wrestle control of the people's House away  from a handful of self-anointed individuals who are wrecking this  country in the name of so-called democracy.   Does my friend from Virginia agree?    Both my friends, the gentleman from Pennsylvania and the  gentleman from Virginia, you guys are both fathers, correct?    Do you think that there is anything compassionate--when my  colleagues on the other side of aisle like to talk about their  compassion for migrants who are seeking to come to this country, do my  friends think there is anything at all compassionate about a little  girl getting raped in a stash house in Houston, Texas, as we speak?   Or being driven up and put into the sex trafficking trade up I-35 or  across I-10 in the southern part of the United States?   Or trafficked to anywhere throughout the rest of this country?   Do you think that is compassion?   Do you think it is compassionate for a young woman to be getting shot  up in a cartel warfare happening at south Texas, happening along the  Rio Grande in northern Mexico?   Is that compassion?   Is it compassion?    Is it compassionate for the young man or young woman of the  100,000 or so last year who died from drug overdoses to take Xanex and  it be laced with fentanyl and die?   Is that something that is compassionate?   My friend from Virginia, do you think these are compassionate things  to be doing?    One of my good friends who was a former Texas Department of  Public Safety expert on these issues dealing with cartels just sent me  a text showing me video from last night at the border, and individuals  they were recording were saying they were paying $3,000 or $5,000 to  get across the river.   How is that compassionate?   They are going to have to make a monthly payment to cartels. A lot of  those payments are going to come in the form of sex trafficking and  labor trafficking.   I have about 1\1/2\ minutes remaining. I would just say--and I thank  my friends for joining me down here on the House floor--that this is a  solvable problem right now. This could be stopped right now. It could  be stopped right now.    This hour. This moment.   But where is President Biden?   Where is Secretary Mayorkas?   Other than purposely ignoring the laws of the United States to  endanger the American people and the migrants who seek to come here,  where are they?   And why shouldn't we be impeaching Secretary Mayorkas for failing to  faithfully execute the laws of the United States and causing death and  destruction to Americans' property and to American people in the form  of drug overdoses, in the form of the endangerment of our citizens and,  again, the migrants who seek to come here?   I would ask that question of all my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle: You can take this back and wrestle it away from the  administration. Sign that discharge petition. Let's have a vote. Let's  have a debate.   What are my colleagues afraid of?   The truth?   What are they afraid of?   The rule of law?   What are they afraid of?   A secure America?   Migrants who get to come here safely?   Put aside the politics and stand up for our country. That is our job  as Members of the House of Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlemen from Virginia and Pennsylvania for  their leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
