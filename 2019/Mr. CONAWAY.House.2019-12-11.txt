 Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 671.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on Section 1011 in  the NDAA conference report relating to contracting submissions about  disciplinary proceedings involving audit personnel to be made to the  Department of Defense will be afforded confidentiality and other  protections otherwise due under existing law, including those that  Congress has separately accorded such proceedings. As a result of  Section 1011, Section 1006 from the FY 2019 NDAA submissions must be  treated in a manner ``consistent with any protections or privileges  established by any other provision of federal law.'' Section 1011 in  this year's NDAA requires Section 1006 from the FY 2019 NDAA to  henceforth require disclosure of the existence of a PCAOB proceeding  against relevant personnel doing important DoD audit work, and in a  manner that is compliant with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
