 Mr. Speaker, the United States and Canada  enjoy a shared border and shared values. We are friends and trading  partners.   Unfortunately, in recent years, we have seen a layering of  restrictions that hinder binational movement. This not only makes it  hard to cross a bridge, but it hinders binational cooperation. It  separates us from one another. It stifles trade and diminishes life  quality.   Confusion, hassles, and delays prevent travel and inhibit travel  plans.   As President Biden and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau meet today to  discuss our future, I urge them to leverage our strengths to craft  solutions that make it easier for us to connect between two countries,  fostering better connections, a better economy, and a better life  quality.                            ____________________
