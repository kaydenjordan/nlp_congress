 Mr. President, 77 years after being killed in the  attack on Pearl Harbor, AD2 Durell Wade of Calhoun County, MS, will be  laid to rest in the North Mississippi Veteran's Memorial Cemetery.   On December 7, 1941, 429 men lost their lives aboard the U.S.S.  Oklahoma, including Aviation Machinist's Mate 2nd Class Wade.   He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1936 and was in line to be promoted  to chief aviation machinist mate shortly before his death. His service  in the U.S. Navy helped in the ultimate fight to protect our liberty.   The U.S. Department of Defense and its Defense POW/MIA Accounting  [[Page S7354]]  Agency deserve commendation for its work to identify casualties, like  Durell Wade, and offer some measure of closure to families of fallen  servicemembers.   In this instance, I am pleased that Wade's family, including his 99- year-old sister Nancy, have an opportunity to be part of a burial  ceremony with full military honors in Kilmichael, MS.   So many families in Mississippi lost loved ones during World War II,  but Durell's long absence made this family's sacrifice all the more  heartbreaking.   I hope the families of those who perished on the U.S.S. Oklahoma will  find comfort and peace in knowing their loved one's service in defense  of our Nation helped in the ultimate fight to protect our liberty.   I ask unanimous consent that an August 18, 2018, article from The  Baton Rouge Advocate titled, ``Pearl Harbor casualty's remains getting  a proper funeral ends lifetime of wondering for Baton Rouge family  members,'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             [August 18, 2018]  Pearl Harbor Casualty's Remains Getting a Proper Funeral Ends Lifetime                of Wondering for Baton Rouge Family Members                             (By George Morris)         Seventy-seven years after he was killed, sailor Durell Wade       will finally get a proper burial. For his Baton Rouge nephew,       it ends a lifetime of wondering.        ``I knew that I had his name, and I knew that he died at       Pearl Harbor,'' said Dr. Larry Wade, 75, whose middle name is       Durell. ``I'd think about him a lot but never explored and       tried to know more about him. He was just Uncle Durell who       had been killed at Pearl.''        This spring, Wade's family learned that the Defense POW/MIA       Accounting Agency has identified their relative's remains, as       well as others of his shipmates who died in the attack that       launched the United States into World War II. Naturally, the       family is grateful.        ``Because his body wasn't recovered when his immediate       family was still alive, they didn't have that resolution,''       said Lauren McAdams, Larry Wade's daughter. ``Obviously, we       know now it was a time of a lot of distress because there was       the confusion of had he survived or had he not.''        Durell Wade, who was born in rural Calhoun County,       Mississippi, in 1917, was an aviation machinist mate aboard       the USS Oklahoma. He had enlisted in the Navy in 1936 and re-      enlisted four years later.        Larry Wade's research on his uncle revealed him to be a       cheerful person who loved to joke and laugh. Late in her       life, Durell Wade's oldest sister, Orena, said he ``loved his       life aboard the USS Oklahoma (and) bragged that it could not       be sunk.''        Wade, who was not married, had written home on Sept. 27,       1941, pleased to report that he had passed tests to be       promoted to chief aviation machinist mate.        ``In one of his letters, he mentioned his fiance had broken       up with him,'' Larry Wade said. ``He last saw her when he was       an aviation machinist's mate third class, and he wanted to       propose to her but he knew he could not support her on the       kind of income he had then. Right after that, she sent him a       `Dear John' letter and she married another guy. He mentions       that in one of his letters.''        On Dec. 7, 1941, five torpedoes from enemy aircraft struck       the battleship, which capsized in less than 12 minutes,       trapping hundreds of sailors in their battle stations below       deck. The attack killed 429 men on the Oklahoma.        Those who perished inside the overturned ship remained       there for more than a year before the ship could be righted.       Remains that were recovered were hastily buried, said Chuck       Pritchard, public affairs director for the Defense POW/MIA       Accounting Agency.        After the war ended in 1945, remains were disinterred to       identify them using forensic methods available at the time.       Thirty-five were identified, and the rest buried again.        In 2015, remains from the Oklahoma were disinterred for DNA       testing. Family members, including Larry Wade, were contacted       to provide DNA samples.        So far, 146 remains from the Oklahoma have been identified.       It's a tiny fraction of the roughly 72,000 unaccounted-for       military losses from World War II, but it's meaningful to       each family, Pritchard said.        Larry Wade, Lauren McAdams and her husband, Brendan       McAdams, met with Navy representatives on Aug. 2 at the       American Legion Nicholson Post 38 hall, where they received       an inch-thick notebook that included details of how the DPAA       identified his remains. The notebook also had copies of       letters between the Navy and family members that revealed       something living family members never knew--that the family       erroneously had been told that Durell Wade had survived       before authorities confirmed his death.        ``That stirred the family up quite a lot,'' Larry Wade       said.        The Navy will pay to have Durell Wade's remains returned       and buried, and the funeral is set for Dec. 7--the 77th       anniversary of his death--at North Mississippi Veterans'       Memorial Park in Kilmichael, Mississippi.        ``I have his name and my grandson has his name, but still,       Uncle Durell was just an idea from Pearl Harbor,'' Larry Wade       said. ``I've learned a lot about him (by) reading and talking       to family members. He's come much more alive as a person.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am proud to honor Chip  Morgan of Leland, MS, for his contributions to the State of Mississippi  and the Nation, while serving as Delta Council executive vice  president.   Delta Council was founded in 1935 by farmers, entrepreneurs and  educators committed to improving agriculture production,  transportation, and flood control in the Mississippi Delta. Over the  years, Delta Council has become a highly respected economic development  organization representing a wide range of issues for northwest  Mississippi. I commend Delta Council for its continuous role in  improving the quality of life in this unique part of our country, and I  applaud Chip Morgan for his many years of good leadership.   Chip began his work with Delta Council in 1975, and was promoted to  executive vice president in 1982. Under his leadership, Delta Council  expanded its influence beyond agriculture and related industry, which  are themselves vital to the economic well-being of the Delta and my  State overall. The Delta Council today is involved in a number of  important areas, including access to healthcare, funding for higher  education, improving adult literacy, among many others. Throughout his  tenure as executive vice president, Chip has helped transform  innovative concepts and strategies, into meaningful results.  [[Page S7355]]    The positive impact Chip has had cannot be quantified, and his awards  and achievements are best illustrated by the changes he has made for  the Mississippi Delta, rather than on plaques or certificates. Whether  through his input on eight farm bills, the successful completion of  flood control projects which have brought 100-year flood protection to  Delta communities, or his work on major four-lane highway legislation  for the State of Mississippi, Chip Morgan has made a difference.   Although a native of Oxford, MS, and a graduate of the University of  Mississippi, Chip has dedicated his entire professional career to  making the Mississippi Delta a better place to live. After leading  Delta Council for over four decades, he will soon turn over his role as  executive vice president to the more than capable hands of Frank  Howell. I wish Frank the best.   I am pleased to offer well-deserved congratulations to Chip Morgan on  his impressive tenure as council executive vice president. I also share  this appreciation with his wife, Connie, their two children, Trey and  Lindsey, and the many individuals Chip has guided and worked with  toward positive outcomes for the Delta and all Mississippi.                            ____________________
