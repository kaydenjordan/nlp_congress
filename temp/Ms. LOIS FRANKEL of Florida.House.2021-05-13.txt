 Mr. Speaker, a 63-year-old grandmother,  Leah, was sitting in her house near Tel Aviv. Ido, a 5-year-old boy,  was home with his big sister and his mom in a small Israeli city near  Gaza. Nadine, an Arab-Israeli 10th grader, was driving with her mom and  dad outside Jerusalem.   What did they have in common?   Their families are shattered and heartbroken. Leah, Ido, and Nadine  were all murdered by Hamas rockets bombarding Israeli cities. In the  last few days, Hamas terrorists have launched over 1,500 rockets-- blowing up homes, schools, and buses.   Thankfully, Iron Dome has stopped most. Still, millions of Israelis  are forced to sleep and eat in bomb shelters as red alert sirens blare  across the country.   The violence is a cynical Hamas power grab using policy disputes as  an excuse for terrorism.   Let me make it clear: I agree with President Joe Biden: Israel has a  right to defend itself when you have thousands of rockets flying in  your territory.   Hamas must end its attack, and the United States and allies must help  bring calm.                            ____________________
