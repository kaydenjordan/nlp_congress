 Madam Speaker, let me be very clear: This rules  package is horrible. It is a progressive affront to America.   The rules package continues proxy voting and remote hearing measures,  even though Members of Congress and staff now have access to the COVID- 19 vaccine. If Congress can be first in line for the vaccine, then we  must be first to go back to work.   Exactly how far Democrats intend to take their attack on free speech  is unclear, but look no further than the extremism in the opening  prayer yesterday that concluded with ``amen, and a woman,'' which,  quite simply, is illiterate and has nothing to do with gender.   This package paves the way for Democrats to spend unlimited dollars  to promote a climate agenda that will harm rural America and our  economy while doing nothing to create a cleaner, safer, and healthier  environment. Republicans want a better environment and economy, and  this rules package will facilitate harm to both.   I urge all of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, to vote against  this resolution. We can do better than neglecting our responsibility to  show up in person.    Madam Speaker, we can do better than wasting taxpayer  money on idealistic, political environmentalism.
