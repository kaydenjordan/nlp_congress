 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the newest Baseball Hall  of Fame inductee, Buck O'Neil.   John Jordan ``Buck'' O'Neil is a native of Carrabelle, Florida, and  signed with the Memphis Red Socks in 1937, then with the Kansas City  Monarchs the next year.   O'Neil was a three-time all-star and became a Negro World Series  champion in 1942.   O'Neil later served as manager of the Monarchs and a scout for the  Chicago Cubs.   Buck made history as the first Black National League coaching staff  member and was determined to keep the memory of the Negro Leagues alive  and helped establish the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.   Last Sunday, Buck was inducted posthumously into the National  Baseball Hall of Fame, a well-deserved and long-overdue honor.   Because of legends like Buck O'Neil, America's favorite pastime is  what it is today.                            ____________________
