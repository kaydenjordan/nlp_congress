 Madam President, it has been a busy, productive, and  truly bipartisan week here in the U.S. Senate.   After days of fruitful cooperation from both sides, the Senate is now  a few moments away from approving one of the most significant changes  to employment law in years, eliminating for good the awful practice of  forcing victims of sexual harassment and assault into arbitration.   An hour from now, we will be able to say this: The House has acted;  the Senate has acted; and we are sending bipartisan forced arbitration  reform to the President's desk. It is a momentous reform bill and one  that is painfully overdue.   For decades, arbitration clauses have been routinely tucked into the  fine print of employment contracts. Today, they impact about 60 million  Americans. And many people may not even realize such clauses affect  them, until it is too late.   All of us have heard the searing testimonies of those who have faced  harassment or abuse at work, only to discover their jobs offered  precious little in accountability.   Countless careers have been derailed or undone. Worse still,  countless lives have been forever damaged. And for decades, workplace  practices, like mandatory arbitration, have perpetuated cultures of  abuse and unaccountability.   We can't ignore a basic reality of these clauses. They deprive  victims of sexual harassment and assault of their basic rights by  mandating they seek  [[Page S620]]  remedy only behind closed doors of private arbitration, with no other  alternative.   This is wrong; it is unfair; and it is about time it changed. And  that is exactly what we will accomplish through this bipartisan  legislation. It will not only ensure that those who have suffered  sexual harassment or assault have the option to go to court if they  choose, it will also be retroactive. People locked into these clauses  right now will benefit just as much as new employees will in the  future. That is an important point that hasn't gotten enough attention.  It will undo the pernicious effect of these clauses that already exist.   I want to thank my friend and fellow New Yorker, Senator Gillibrand,  for spending years advocating for this legislation. This accomplishment  wouldn't be possible without her leadership and her commitment to  working with the other side.   Likewise, I want to thank Senator Graham and Senator Ernst for  reaching across the aisle and working with us to get this bill done.   Yesterday, Senators Graham and Ernst met in my office, and we came to  an agreement to move this forward. And we very much appreciate that. It  was truly a collaborative effort by the Senate, and thanks to  everyone's work, forced arbitration for sexual assault and harassment  will soon be a thing of the past.   As I said in my very first speech as majority leader, Democrats will  always be open to working with Members of the other side of the aisle  when the opportunity arises. The differences between the parties are  real and cannot be ignored, but we can neither ignore the genuine  chances for progress when both parties agree to move forward on certain  topics.   Last year, it was precisely this majority's commitment to bipartisan  cooperation that cleared the path for historic hate crimes legislation.  Together, we also passed a historic jobs and supply chain bill, which  we hope is enacted soon.   And together, Democrats and Republicans secured the first stand-alone  infrastructure package in years.                            ____________________     Madam President, this week has been a continuation of  that commitment to working with the other side when possible. The  legislation on forced arbitration is a prime example. And yesterday we  saw another example: Appropriators from both parties announced that  they reached a framework agreement for a yearlong appropriations  package.   This is a huge step forward for arriving at an omnibus, and it is  great news for our goal of avoiding a yearlong CR, which would have  been painful and costly.   There is a lot of work left to do before we pass a government  spending bill, but yesterday's announcement shows appropriators are now  on a very good path.   We are driving forward toward an omnibus, and I am very, very hopeful  and optimistic that we will get there.   In the meantime, the Senate will do the responsible thing by passing  a temporary CR next week in order to give the appropriators enough time  to put their funding packages together.                            ____________________     Madam President, yesterday, our colleagues from both  sides of the aisle came together to announce an agreement on  reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, which was last acted on  nearly a decade ago by this Chamber.   I want to commend my colleagues Senators Feinstein and Durbin, as  well as Senators Ernst and Murkowski, for all the work they have done  to bring us closer to reauthorizing VAWA.   I also want to thank my colleagues who are cosponsoring this  legislation. And I have a particular interest because when I was in the  House, I helped carry the original VAWA legislation that became law and  has now lapsed.   Most importantly, I want to thank every single person who  participated in yesterday's press conference who shared their own  experiences of abuse.   The Violence Against Women Act is one of the most important laws  passed by Congress in the last 30 years, and it is my hope that the  Senate can take action on this bill in the near future.   There are nine Republicans cosponsoring this legislation so we need  one more, at least, in order to clear a path forward.   If we can find more support for VAWA, I would expect that the Senate  will seek to take action.   VAWA must be reauthorized. We cannot allow inaction to persist for a  moment longer, and with yesterday's bipartisan announcement, we are  closer than ever to achieving that goal.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on postal, there is one more sign  of progress this week that I want to mention, another bipartisan effort  like VAWA and like all of the other bills I have mentioned--arbitration  and the CR--and this is the bipartisan efforts by both Chambers to pass  the most significant postal reform bill in decades.   Later today--soon--I will file cloture on the postal reform bill  approved overwhelmingly by the House earlier this week. For the  information of all Senators, this will set up the first vote this  coming Monday evening.   Postal reform has been decades in the making and is one of the best  steps we can take to strengthen one of our country's most important  institutions. Tens of millions of Americans depend on the post office  every day. Seniors and veterans need it for things like medication.  Businesses need it to function. Rural communities need it to stay  connected. Countless people rely on the post office to connect with  each other for things like birthdays, travel, the holidays, or any one  of life's many, many special occasions.   By passing postal reform, we can ensure that Americans will continue  to rely on a speedy, dependable, and well-run post office. We have all  heard complaints about how the mail delivery has slowed down. This is a  strong, important effort to rectify that bad problem. It will be a win  for everyday Americans and for the dedicated men and women who work to  deliver our mail every single day.                            ____________________     Madam President, finally, on cannabis legislation. All  of these issues I have mentioned--forced arbitration reform,  appropriations, VAWA, and postal reform--have been bipartisan efforts.  They reflect a commitment that Democrats made at the start of the year  to work with the other side when the opportunities presented  themselves, and I thank my Republican colleagues for working with us.  Before I close, there is one more appeal I want to make for bipartisan  cooperation, and that is on cannabis reform.   This morning, I joined with Senators Booker and Wyden in sending a  ``Dear Colleague,'' inviting Members from both sides of the aisle to  join in an effort to draft and finalize comprehensive cannabis reform.  Last summer, I joined with Senators Booker and Wyden in introducing our  framework legislation for Federal reform of cannabis, and we want to  build on this framework as we prepare to introduce legislation in the  near future.   Today, millions--hundreds of millions of Americans live in States,  both blue and red, where cannabis has been legalized in some way. It is  long past time for the Federal Government to catch up.   This is about individual freedom and about basic fairness. For  decades, Federal cannabis laws have caused immense damage to millions  of Americans, particularly Black and Hispanic people, who have been  unfairly targeted by these laws. We need to change that. We need to  create opportunities for entrepreneurs and small businesses to  legitimately pursue new opportunities, and comprehensive Federal  cannabis legislation is critical--critical--to reaching that goal.   I want to thank Senators Booker and Wyden and all my colleagues who  have worked with us on this important and long-overdue change. I hope  we can make more progress on cannabis reform in the near future.  [[Page S621]]                                ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 266,  H.R. 3076.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 668.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Finally, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  the mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today,  Thursday, February 10, be waived.    Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk that is due for a second reading.    Madam President, in order to place the bill on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I will object to further  proceedings.    Sure, please.    Mr. President, first, let me compliment my colleague  from New York. Her persistence, her intelligence, her determination and  passion to change the law so these injustices, which occur so many  times that we don't know about, will no longer be there is so vital.   So thank you for a job well done.   Thanks to my colleague Senator Graham, the lead Republican sponsor,  who, when he gets behind something, it gets done. So I want him behind  more things with us in the future.   And to Senator Ernst, who is not here, she has been a great leader on  this as well. And when we met in my office with Senator Graham, Senator  Ernst was very amenable to getting this done.   It is an outrage, just an outrage, that women and men who are abused  cannot seek justice, are forced to be quiet, are forced to keep the  agony inside themselves. It is outrageous.   For decades, this forced arbitration has just deprived millions of  people, almost all women, from basic rights to justice. We need justice  in so many areas, but when you can't seek justice when you are  harassed, it is just one of the greatest marks of injustice, one of the  greatest times of injustice.   The good news about this legislation is all the clauses that people  already signed in their employment contracts, even when they didn't  know about it, will no longer be valid. So it not only affects the  future but affects those who signed in the past.   If you could ever say that any legislation is long overdue, this is  it. It is time for a change. And moments from now, the Senate will  finally act to make forced arbitration for sexual harassment and  assault a thing of the past.   We are now going to voice vote this wonderful, needed legislation.    Call the question.
