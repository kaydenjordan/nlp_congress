 Madam President, I come to the floor today to once  again discuss healthcare in America and, specifically, to oppose S.J.  Res. 52, which is the latest congressional disapproval resolution.   What is happening here is that the Democrats are trying to block the  efforts Republicans are making to actually lower the cost of health  insurance. We are working on ways to lower the cost of health insurance  for American families, and the Democrats are trying to block it.   Let me explain. People certainly understand that after the Obama  healthcare law was passed, healthcare insurance premiums all across the  country went way up. I strongly oppose the passage of this resolution,  and I strongly opposed the passage of this law, which many of the  Democrats running for President are now willing to admit has failed.   It is interesting that the Democrats now just say: Scrap the whole  thing, and go with a one-size-fits-all, government-run healthcare  program in which people will pay more to wait longer for worse care.   Ironically, it is the Republicans who, today, are delivering on so  many of the Democrats' empty promises about ObamaCare because  Republicans are actually doing things to lower the cost of care and the  cost of health insurance for American families.   I like to think of Republicans as EMTs arriving on the scene of the  ObamaCare train wreck. We didn't cause the accident. We are trying to  help the victims, and the victims live in States all across this  country. For nearly 3 years, Republicans have tried to treat the  victims of ObamaCare and tried to help people who have been hit by  skyrocketing health insurance premiums.   Last week we saw a major breakthrough. For the second year in a row,  on average, we saw insurance premiums on the ObamaCare exchanges  actually come down. They have actually come down. Well, it is very  welcome news for people who have to pay these premiums. Yet, what we  see is that the 2020 Democratic candidates, when you listen to them,  don't seem to be concerned about lowering the costs. They are too busy  pushing this astronomically expensive $34 trillion Medicare for All  health insurance healthcare scheme--one that by Republicans and  Democrats alike has been called a pipe dream.   To put the cost into perspective, this total dollar figure has been  estimated by people on the Republican side of the aisle, the Democratic  side of the aisle, folks who looked at what promises are being made,  and all have come to the conclusion that the cost will be greater than  what we spend right now in this country on Medicare, Medicaid, and  Social Security combined. Add it all up, and it does not even reach the  point of what the Bernie Sanders-Elizabeth Warren Medicare for All plan  would cost.   Interestingly, when taking a look at the proposal, they actually want  to take away from the American people--the 180 million people who have  earned health insurance through work--they want to take that away from  180 million Americans and put them all on a one-size-fits-all,  government-run program. Even union workers, who, as part of their  contract negotiations, negotiated the health insurance they want, would  lose their hard-fought healthcare benefits if it were ever to become  law.   We see Democrats backing what I believe is a very foolish resolution  of disapproval. They are attacking part of President Obama's healthcare  law. We are talking about ObamaCare section 1332. This section of the  law helps give States more flexibility. The Presiding Officer's State  and mine like to have flexibility to provide better coverage and to  bring premium costs down.   We need to set the record straight on one key point. Section 1332  never can be used to waive protections for the American people, such as  for people with preexisting conditions. They can never waive those. It  is not happening.   My wife is a breast cancer survivor. She has had three operations,  chemotherapy twice, and dozens of radiation treatments. I know, as a  doctor and as a husband, how important it is for patients to have  protections of their preexisting conditions. Republicans remain 100  percent committed to protecting people with preexisting conditions. We  will protect them today, tomorrow, and always.   The House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman,   Greg Walden,  asked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for clarification  regarding this section 1332. Administrator Seema Verma responded: ``To  be very clear, the 2018 guidance does nothing to erode the [healthcare  law's] pre-existing condition provisions, which cannot be waived under  section 1332.''   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the  CMS Administrator's letter be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           Department of Health & Human Services, Centers for             Medicare & Medicaid Services      Hon. Greg Walden,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Walden: Thank you for your continued       interest in new state flexibility available under guidance       recently issued interpreting section 1332 of the Patient       Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) (the 2018       guidance). Working within the limitations of the PPACA, this       2018 guidance is an important element of the Administration's       actions to expand options and lower costs for patients around       the country. I wanted to take this opportunity to set the       record straight and reaffirm this Administration's commitment       to lowering healthcare costs, increasing consumer choices,       and protecting our most vulnerable citizens. including those       who have pre-existing conditions.        To be very clear, the 2018 guidance does nothing to erode       the PPACA 's pre-existing condition provisions, which cannot       be waived under section 1332. Section 1332 does not permit       states to waive Public Health Service Act requirements such       as guaranteed availability and renewability of health       insurance, the prohibition on using health status to vary       premiums, and the prohibition on pre-existing conditions       exclusions. Furthermore. a section 1332 waiver cannot be       approved that might otherwise undermine these requirements.       This Administration stands committed to protecting people       with pre-existing conditions.        Under the PPACA, we have seen dramatically higher premiums       and decreased options for millions of consumers, in large       part due to the law's overly prescriptive mandates and       excessive Federal government takeover of areas traditionally       under state oversight. In 2019, the average monthly premium       for a benchmark plan for a family of four on HealthCare.gov       is now over $1,500, which can easily exceed a family's       mortgage. There are many areas of the country with far higher       monthly premiums. For example, a 60-year-old couple living in       Grand Island, Nebraska, making $70.000 a year, will need to       pay over $3,000 per month for the lowest cost silver plan       available. That's almost $38.000 per year for a plan with an       11,100 deductible. That's over half their income.  [[Page S6224]]         For millions of Americans, coverage this expensive is not a       realistic option, and many choose to go without coverage at       all. In fact, after average premiums rose by 21 percent, 1.3       million unsubsidized people walked away from the market in       2017 last year the prior administration oversaw open       enrollment. While these higher premiums force some people to       go uninsured, coverage is generally not optional for people       with a pre-existing condition and so, without a subsidy,       someone with a pre-existing condition must face the full       burden of the PPACA's skyhigh premiums. This Administration       has not forgotten the people facing this hardship.        Section 1332 of the PPACA provides the discretion to       approve a section 1332 state waiver plan if the following       four statutory guardrails are met: affordability,       comprehensiveness, coverage, and federal deficit neutrality.       Section 1332 allows states to develop new healthcare programs       and solutions that would be not permissible without a section       1332 waiver.        Unfortunately, guidance issued under the prior       Administration in December 2015 (the 2015 guidance) regarding       section 1332 waivers had the effect of significantly       restricting the innovation states could pursue. The prior       Administration imposed a one-size-fits-all approach to these       waivers, making it difficult for states to address the       specific needs of their residents.        In October, the Administration issued guidance under       section 1332 of the PPACA to provide states with significant       opportunities to chart a different course for their markets       through expanded flexibility. Section 1332 and the 2018       guidance ensure that consumers who wish to retain coverage       similar to that provided under the PPACA can do so, but they       empower states to take steps to stabilize their markets and       allow more affordable coverage options that may be more       attractive to individuals and families priced out of the       current market, including people with pre-existing       conditions.        Over the past two years, this Administration has approved       seven section 1332 waivers authorizing reinsurance programs       to help fund claims for people with high healthcare costs.       These reinsurance programs provide much needed premium relief       for people in the market and, in particular, for people with       pre-existing conditions without other coverage options. These       section 1332 waivers were all approved under the prior, more       restrictive 2015 guidance. I believe, given the expanded       flexibility discussed in the 2018 guidance, states will be       able to develop additional healthcare programs and solutions       that work for their residents.        As you know, some have criticized the state flexibility       offered under the 2018 guidance, claiming that states will       pursue section 1332 waivers that undermine their own       individual market risk pools and make coverage more expensive       for their own residents with pre-existing conditions. Again,       I want to make clear that a section 1332 waiver cannot       undermine coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.       Moreover, any section 1332 waiver will need to carefully       account for any impact on the individual market risk pool and       guarantee that access to coverage is at least as       comprehensive and affordable as would exist without the       waiver.        So, if a state seeks to pursue the use of more affordable       options, such as catastrophic plans or short-term limited       duration plans, under a section 1332 state waiver plan, the       state must ensure access to coverage that is overall as       affordable and comprehensive for people who remain in the       individual market risk pool.        Thank you again for your shared interest in bringing down       healthcare costs and protecting our fellow Americans with       pre-existing conditions. We remain focused on improving our       nation's health care system by empowering states to innovate       and develop new solutions to expand access to affordable and       high value coverage options, and we look forward to working       with you to achieve these goals. Should you have questions,       please contact the CMS Office of Legislation.            Sincerely,                                                       Seema Verma.     Madam President, the letter proves that all patients  will be protected. Section 1332 simply gives States some leeway--a  little wiggle room for following the law and how to use and apply the  law best in their own States.   All State waivers must meet the following conditions: They must  provide coverage at least as broad as is currently offered under the  healthcare law; they must provide coverage and cost-sharing at least as  affordable as under the healthcare law; they must provide coverage to  at least as many people as under the healthcare law; and they must not  increase the Federal deficit.   The section 1332 waivers leave protections for preexisting conditions  unharmed. They are not just popular with Republican Governors. It is  interesting that the people applying for these 1332 waivers are  Democratic Governors from around the country. They are at odds with  what the Democrats in the Senate are trying to do. They are pursuing  waivers. They are asking the Trump administration for waivers for their  States as well. Why would these Democratic Governors come to the Trump  administration and ask for waivers? It is because they work. The reason  the Democratic Governors are coming to the Trump administration asking  for waivers is that they work. In fact, a number of States are using  these waivers today to help lower the cost of health insurance.   Let's look at the States whose section 1332 waivers have been  approved since the Trump administration guidance was issued. Let's look  at just the States that have applied for waivers since the new Trump  administration guidance was issued. Again, these waivers were approved  using the very same guidance that the Democrats in the Senate now want  to have repealed.   It is astonishing. The States with 1332 waivers since the Trump  administration came out with its guidance are Colorado, Delaware,  Montana, North Dakota, and Rhode Island. Nearly all have Democratic  Governors--four out of the five do--and have Democratic Senators in  many cases or they have both.   Take a look at what has happened for the proposed premiums for 2020-- what they are expected to be in States under the leadership of  Democratic Governors who have asked for and have been granted waivers  from the Trump administration and what the impact is on insurance  premiums in these States. In Colorado, with a Democratic Governor and  one Democratic Senator, the rates are going to fall this next year by  about 16 percent. In Delaware, with a Democratic Governor and two  Democratic Senators, the rates will fall about 13 percent. In Montana,  with one Democratic Governor and one Democratic Senator, one Republican  Senator, rates will fall by 8 percent. In Rhode Island, with a  Democratic Governor and two Democratic Senators, rates will fall by  about 6 percent.   So in State after State where Democratic Governors applied for and  were granted a waiver, they have seen rates go down. Yet Democratic  Senators on the other side of the aisle are offering a resolution to  remove these waivers, to remove the guidance from the Trump  administration that is resulting in rates of insurance and the costs  going down.   Of course we need to fix healthcare in this country, but we need to  take a scalpel to our healthcare problems, not a meat cleaver, which is  what we see the Democrats doing.   The Obama healthcare law was a train wreck. Republicans opposed it  all the way. We are still treating the victims of this wreck, and we  want to help them for years into the future by changing and coming out  with guidance that will make it easier and give flexibility to the  States, whether their legislature is Republican or Democratic, to help  lower the high cost of ObamaCare insurance.   I find it outrageous that Senate Democrats are wasting precious  healthcare debate time. They should be working with us to find  solutions to lower the cost of care, to lower the cost of prescription  drugs, to provide more accountability and more transparency so that  patients can make more informed decisions.   Even as we address this issue and vote on this joint resolution  tomorrow, it is time to really take a look at what the Democrats are  saying in the Senate as opposed to what the Democrats who are in the  statehouses are doing across the country.   I say, let's make sure the States can keep the relief they are asking  for and are getting by rejecting what the Democrats in the Senate are  proposing. Let's keep working to give patients what they need, which is  the care they need from a doctor they choose at lower costs.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, in just a few weeks, the Wyoming Farm  Bureau Federation will hold their annual meeting in Laramie, WY. This  year is unique, as the organization marks their 100th meeting and  celebrates ten decades of service to farmers and ranchers across the  State. Without question, the agriculture industry in the State, and in  the region, has seen immense benefit from the important work the  Federation employees do every day.   Today, the Wyoming Farm Bureau is integral in gathering public  opinion and disseminating information to farmers and ranchers across  the state. Officially, their mission identifies ``The primary goal of  WYFB is to take appropriate actions to protect private property rights  and help members achieve an equitable return on their investment.''  Just as they did in 1920, the organization brings individuals together  to identify common threats to their way of life. Wyoming Farm Bureau  worked closely with the national organization during the 2015 waters of  the United States rulemaking process to effectively communicate the  negative impacts the rule would have on those who are the primary  caretakers of our Nation's natural resources.   As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I invited  the Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation president, Todd Fornstrom, to share  his story. Todd emphasized the need to protect clean, plentiful water  sources while providing predictability for States, counties, and  communities. Through his testimony, Todd skillfully shared the  undeniable link between agricultural production and the Wyoming way of  life and Wyoming's commitment to protecting our precious resources.   I believe you can tell the strength of an organization by the  dedication shown by its members and staff. Todd Fornstrom is serving  his third elected term as president. Executive Vice President Ken  Hamilton recently celebrated his 36th anniversary with the  organization, Media and Member Relations Director Kerin Clark just  passed 25 years, and Brett Moline has served Farm Bureau for 13 years.  Every one of the 23 counties in Wyoming has a local Farm Bureau  organization to build policy and address local issues. The county  committees are key parts of the communities they serve.   Without question, farmers and ranchers faced many challenges when the  Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation was founded in 1920. Just as they did  100 years ago, farmers and ranchers continue to work together today to  produce abundant, high-quality food and fiber for their neighbors and  communities around the world. I can only imagine the challenging  discussions that prompted the first meeting in 1920, but I am certain  early members left that meeting with the same confidence they will  leave the 100th meeting.   Working in agriculture is not simply a job. It is a calling, and  sometimes, a challenging way of life. I rise today with great  appreciation for the work Wyoming farmers and ranchers have done, and  continue to do, for our great State. My wife, Bobbi, joins me in  congratulating each member of the Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation on  their 100th anniversary.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to recognize a  significant anniversary for the Wyoming Weed and Pest Council. When  they meet in a few short weeks, the council will celebrate 75 years of  service to Wyoming ecosystems and communities. While the council is  partially funded by the State of Wyoming, the council's success lies in  dedication of staff, volunteers, seasonal employees, and partners who  dedicate themselves to eradicating invasive species and noxious weeds.   Invasive species threaten the delicate balance in nearly every  ecosystem. Around the world, invasive species cause billions of dollars  in damage to the environment and to economies each year. They threaten  watersheds, forests, and grasslands. They crowd out important native  species, increase the risk of catastrophic wildfires, introduce  disease, and fundamentally undermine the natural cycle of life.  Dedicated experts work each day to stem the tide of new introductions.   Each of the 23 counties in Wyoming has a Weed and Pest District, run  by staff and an elected board. The districts set policy, monitor  existing infestations, work with the public to develop a comprehensive  list of risks, and act quickly when new species are detected. Often,  Weed and Pest supervisors wear many hats; depending on the hour, they  are grant writers, weed sprayers, staff managers, and policy experts.   Wyoming Weed and Pest coordinator, Slade Franklin, detailed the  important work of the council when I invited him to testify before the  Environment and Public Works Committee earlier this year. In his  testimony, Slade shared the coordination that is required to ensure  invasive species are not able to gain an advantage in States where  lands are managed by multiple jurisdictions. Slade knows that invasive  species do not respect fence lines, and during his decade-long  leadership of the Wyoming Weed and Pest Council, he has forged  important relationships with local, State, and Federal agencies. His  leadership has been integral in many of the State's successes.   It is without hesitation that I say Wyoming's forests and plains  would look much different today if the Wyoming Weed and Pest Council  had not unified in 1973. While the State has struggled with cheatgrass  and Russian olive, they have been hugely successful in preventing new  infestations of invasive mussels and limiting spread of other grasses,  like ventenata. Each municipal water manager, rancher, hiker, forester,  hunter, and miner owes a debt of gratitude for the good work of the  Wyoming Weed and Pest Council.   Whether they work from horseback, ATV, the air, or a desk, I rise  today to honor the dedicated professionals to work to keep our  ecosystems healthy. My wife, Bobbi, joins me in thanking them and  wishing the Wyoming Weed and Pest Council another 75 years of success.                            ____________________
