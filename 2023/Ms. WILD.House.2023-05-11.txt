 Mr. Speaker, as Teacher Appreciation Week draws to a close,  I am thrilled to recognize one of the many educators who has made an  incredible impact on the lives of kids in my community: Mr. Mark Lavine  from the Panther Valley School District.   A sixth grade math teacher, Mr. Lavine has been a Panther Valley  educator for 21 years. His love for teaching and mentoring extends  beyond the classroom as the high school football coach, adviser for the  academic quiz challenge, and organizer of school spirit day.   Hardworking and compassionate, Mr. Lavine doubled the size of his  math class to cover for a colleague on a leave of absence--twice.   He is known as the big brother on staff as a mentor to new teachers,  and his energy inspires a loving curiosity for math in his students.   Mr. Lavine epitomizes the dedication of so many educators across  Pennsylvania-07 who foster a lifelong love for learning in our kids.   This week and every week, thank a teacher who made a difference in  your life, your child's life, or a loved one's life, someone like  Panther Valley's Mr. Lavine.                            ____________________
