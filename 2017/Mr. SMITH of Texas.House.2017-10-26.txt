 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the House Judiciary  Committee approved the Legal Workforce  [[Page H8230]]  Act, a bill I introduced that saves jobs for citizens and legal  workers. It requires U.S. employers to use the E-Verify system to check  the work eligibility of all future hires.   A September 2017 Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that 82 percent  of voters favor requiring business owners to check the immigration  status of prospective employees.   E-Verify is the most popular immigration reform that reduces illegal  immigration. E-Verify is a free and quick system that already is used  voluntarily by employers to cover one-third of the workforce.   The Legal Workforce Act has the backing of both national business  organizations and immigration enforcement groups. This bill deserves  the enthusiastic support of all Members of Congress who want to put the  interest of American workers first.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the  chairwoman of the Budget Committee for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, we need to pass this budget not only to rein in out-of- control spending, but also to give Congress the go-ahead on much-needed  tax reform.   We need to reduce the tax burden on hardworking Americans. The  typical household in the 21st Congressional District of Texas pays over  $15,700 in Federal taxes. Past experience shows that tax relief  generates strong economic growth. It enables Americans to save, invest,  create jobs, and spend more of their income.   Our vision of tax reform benefits families across America. For  example, in my congressional district, one-sixth of households utilize  the child tax credit. Increasing the child tax credit will help  families keep more of their hard-earned money to use on child care or  parental leave, school supplies, college savings, and other expenses  associated with raising a child.   Let's help American families enjoy a more prosperous future rather  than pay more of their hard-earned dollars to the Federal Government.
