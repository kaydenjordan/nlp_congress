 Mr. Speaker, big talk and broken promises, that is what we  have seen.   As Trump's first 100 days come to a close, we see desperate times are  leading to desperate measures. First, there is a push to revive  TrumpCare. Really? Twenty-four million Americans would be kicked off  health insurance in the first year, and there would be 15 to 20 percent  increases in premiums according to the Congressional Budget Office. The  big change to get a compromise is taking away essential benefits and  preexisting conditions, the foundation of making sure Americans have  health care.   Second, we see Trump's threats to defund the subsidies. This is a  blatant violation of law. Seven million Americans would lose health  care immediately if that happened.   Third, we see Trump's threats to cut Medicaid and Medicare by $1  trillion. Block grants will mean cuts to senior's health care, cuts to  children's health care.   With these 100 days coming to a close, we see Trump as the least  popular, least productive President in modern history.   While Trump is breaking his promises, our constituents are depending  on us to keep ours.                            ____________________
