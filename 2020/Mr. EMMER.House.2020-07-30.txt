 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Sharon  Erichsrud, who passed away in March at the age of 79. She was a loving  mother, devoted wife, and lifelong Minnesotan.   Sharon was born in 1941 in Frost, Minnesota. She attended Frost High  School, where she met Butch, her husband of 60 years. After graduation,  she went on to work at 3M and several banks in the Blue Earth area,  eventually becoming bank manager at Albert Lea Savings and Loan.   Sharon and Butch are parents of three children, Beth, Shelly, and  Mark of St. Michael-Albertville, who gave them five children and four  great-grandchildren.   Sharon was adored by her family, who remember her as a voracious  reader and a pillar of her community at Trinity Lutheran Church.   Sharon was a beloved member of our Minnesota community. May her  memory be a blessing.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Automotive Parts  Headquarters in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on 100 years of dedicated service  to their customers and their community.   Owning and operating a business is never easy, and reaching this  milestone is an important testament to the hardworking people they  employ and the services they offer.   Founded in 1920, Automotive Parts Headquarters outgrew their first  shop in Minneapolis. Today, they have 125 corporate stores and 36  independent locations across the Midwest.   Automotive Parts Headquarters has stayed true to its roots. In fact,  President and CEO Corey Bartlett is the third generation of his family  to be involved in the business.   It was an honor to visit Automotive Parts Headquarters recently and  learn about the great work they do in the St. Cloud area.   Automotive Parts Headquarters not only supplies parts to repair  shops, the company builds partnerships with their customers to help  them grow.   Automotive Parts Headquarters also supports the communities where  they operate, contributing to charities like the American Cancer  Society, Toys for Tots, and WACOSA.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Automotive Parts Headquarters for their  continued service to our communities and congratulate them for 100  years of incredible service in Minnesota.                            ____________________
