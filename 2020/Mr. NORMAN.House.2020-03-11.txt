 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor two heroes of my local  police department in Rock Hill, South Carolina.   In May of last year, Sergeants Cedric Stokes and Bruce Haire  demonstrated the meaning of compassion when they used unconventional  means to save the life of another man.   That day, the police department heard reports of a man seeking to  commit suicide while streaming it live on social media. Without a  moment's hesitation, these officers used social media to identify the  man online and, upon identification, coordinated rapidly, with the help  of Facebook employees, to ensure that the man was found and promptly  cared for in a medical facility.   Ours is a brave new world, and the implications of new technology cut  both ways. On this day, it was at once a morbid display of pain, but  also a beacon signaling for help.   A quote came to mind when I read of these officers' heroic responses.  In the words of Theodore Roosevelt:         Do what you can with all you have, wherever you are.    On behalf of the Fifth District, I commend the officers of the Rock  Hill Police Department for their unwavering and adaptive dedication to  protect and serve.  [[Page H1597]]    Without officers like Sergeant Cedric Stokes and Sergeant Bruce  Haire, we would be one beautiful life shorter and our community all the  lesser for it.   I think of the words of Winston Churchill, who said, when Great  Britain was under siege by Germany:         There will be a time when doing your best isn't good       enough. We must do what is required.    These officers did what was required.   God bless.                            ____________________
