 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Crossroads  Quartet for their 60th anniversary of vocalizing Southern Gospel music  throughout Kentucky and other States.   Founded in 1960 in Russell Springs, Kentucky, this fine group of  constituents has now been active within the music world for 60  consecutive years. They have traveled thousands of miles, worn out four  Dodge vans, and touched numerous lives.   While some of the names and faces have changed, the inspiring mission  of Crossroads Quartet has remained a constant. Today founding member  Vernie McGaha, alongside Brian McGaha, Dave Powell, and Randy Hart,  continues to fulfill the original calling of Crossroads Quartet.   I am proud to be their voice in Washington and am confident that  their musical ministry will be active for many years to come. Their  decades of contributions are certainly deserving of recognition by this  entire body.                            ____________________
