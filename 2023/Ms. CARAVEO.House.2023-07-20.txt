 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of rural families,  families who work hard every day, play by the rules, and deserve the  very same access to opportunity as every other American.   Despite advancements in many other areas, our rural communities lag  behind, underserved with bad cell service and internet service, fewer  options for healthcare and schools, and insufficient investment for  small businesses.   No one should have fewer opportunities just because of where they  live. I am working from all angles to beef up support for rural  communities: from mental health support with Representative Finstad's  and my Rural Wellness Act to improving childcare access with my and  Representative Gluesenkamp Perez's bipartisan rural childcare bill; to  helping farmers with disabilities with my and Representative Molinaro's  agriculture accessibility bill; to connecting communities with  investments they need with my and Representative Fischbach's Investing  in Rural America Act.   I am proud to work on a bipartisan basis with so many of our  colleagues who share the understanding of how vital our rural  communities are to all of our lives and look forward to collaborating  on this year's farm bill.                            ____________________
