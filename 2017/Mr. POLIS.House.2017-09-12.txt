 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman.   This is about giving both sides--the workers seeking to organize and  the employer--the opportunity to make their case to workers fairly and  expeditiously.   Prior to this case, in every case, employers would have access with  ways to pester and bug employees at home, through their personal email,  through their phone numbers. There was simply no way that there was any  equality given to the case for union organizers to make. In fact, union  organizers often had to try to find ways that they could reach to  simply make the case to workers so that they can make a fair choice.    In addition, I find it ridiculous that this is called, by those on  the other side, an ambush when, in fact, the only ambush is when they  ambush the right of workers to organize by drawing out the election  process to months and years, often beyond when many of the employees  involved are even at the same employer because of the adverse working  conditions that could have led them to organize in the first place.   This rule was done through a multistakeholder process. There was a  lot input from all sides, and it was a very thoughtful rule that gave a  level playing field to ensure that workers, should they desire to  organize, had a reasonable calendar for doing so and a reasonable way  of reaching other workers to tell them the benefits of organizing, just  as the company was telling them the downside.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to reject this amendment which  throws out a very thoughtful rule that levels the playing field in  labor relations.
