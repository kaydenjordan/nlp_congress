 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  conference report to accompany S. 1790, the 59th consecutive National  Defense Authorization Act.   With a new top line of $739 billion, plus another $5.3 billion in  emergency authorizations, I believe this conference report now  represents a good bipartisan compromise that we all should support  because it provides for our common defense and addresses the priorities  required by our men and women in uniform.   This bill will continue the progress we have made in rebuilding  military readiness while also setting the right conditions through  oversight to accelerate needed modernization capabilities required for  the national defense strategy and credible deterrents.   A few examples of these critical capabilities include funding for  eight F-15EX aircraft, an additional $1.4 billion for F-35 fifth- generation Joint Strike Fighters, funding for 24 F-18 Super Hornets,  strong support for the Army's identified Big 6 modernization  priorities, and an additional $265 million for National Guard and  Reserve Component equipment modernization.   I am also pleased the bill includes a provision to ensure  servicemembers forced to move from any type of military housing,  including dormitories, receive a partial dislocation allowance. This  fixes a gap that previously prohibited our lowest paid servicemembers  from receiving this assistance.   I thank Ranking Member Thornberry for his leadership and guidance  throughout this entire process, as well as our subcommittee chairman,    Donald Norcross, for his leadership and spirit of bipartisan.   This conference report also wouldn't be possible without the hard  work and dedication of the entire subcommittee staff.   The NDAA has always been a product of bipartisan consensus, and I am  pleased that we were successful in reaching that level of consensus  again.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill  and vote ``yes'' on S. 1790.
