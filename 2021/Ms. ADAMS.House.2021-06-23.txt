 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his work on this  bill.   Although House Democrats continue to work for an end to the pandemic,  COVID-19 has changed the American workforce. People from all walks of  life have suffered. Older Americans in the workforce continue to feel  the fallout from the coronavirus.   The perception that older workers are not as valuable as their  younger counterparts persists. The myth that older workers are  unproductive and costly persists. The idea that older Americans do not  value their careers, their job, or their work persists. Because of  these challenges, older workers are more likely to remain out of the  workforce when they lose a job.   Age discrimination is a real threat to our workforce, but it doesn't  have to be that way. That is why the Protecting Older Workers Against  Discrimination Act is so very important. Older workers need specific  protections under the law.   As we look ahead to a stronger economy and upcoming legislation, I  urge Members to remember the importance of older workers to our  economy, to our workforce, and to our families.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the group  Paralyzed Veterans of America.                                   Paralyzed Veterans of America,                                       Washington, DC, May 24, 2021.      Hon. Robert Scott,      Chairman, Education and Labor Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) is       pleased to support reintroduction of the Protecting Older       Workers against Discrimination Act (POWADA). PVA is the       nation's only Congressionally-chartered veterans service       organization solely dedicated to representing veterans with       spinal cord injuries and/or disorders. POWADA is important to       our members as people with disabilities because it will       restore well-established legal standards on workplace       discrimination that were undermined by a 2009 Supreme Court       decision.        In 2009, in the case of Gross v. FBL Financial Services,       the U.S. Supreme Court decided to impose a much higher burden       of proof on workers who allege age discrimination than on       those who allege discrimination based on race, sex, national       origin, or religion. By changing the legal standards in age       discrimination cases--from having to prove that age played a       role in the worker's treatment to having to show that age       played the decisive role in the worker's treatment--the Court       set aside decades of legal precedent and signaled to       employers that some amount of age discrimination is       permissible. Moreover, the decision made it exponentially       more difficult for workers who have experienced age       discrimination to seek redress in court and prove their case.        Many courts began applying the Gross decision to weaken       other civil rights laws, including disability discrimination       cases. In 2019, in the case of Natofsky v. City of N.Y., the       Second Circuit joined the Fourth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits       in ruling that disability discrimination under the ADA and       the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 must be established under the       higher, ``butfor'' standard. Federal courts have       consistently, but in our view erroneously, applied Gross to       claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), ADA       retaliation, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Some courts       have questioned the applicability of Gross to disability  [[Page H3059]]       claims without deciding the issue, but no court has declined       to apply Gross to the ADA/Rehabilitation Act. Some courts       have even begun to apply Gross to disability discrimination       in public accommodations.        The unemployment rate for workers with disabilities is       almost double the rate for workers without disabilities. For       all the workers affected by the Gross decision, POWADA is a       jobs bill.        By clarifying that discrimination may play no role in       employment decisions under the ADA and certain other laws,       this legislation would simply restore the law prior to the       Gross decision.        PVA appreciates your continued pursuit of this important       legislation and urges Congress to act swiftly on its passage.            Sincerely,                                         Heather Ansley, MSW, Esq.,                                      Associate Executive Director.
