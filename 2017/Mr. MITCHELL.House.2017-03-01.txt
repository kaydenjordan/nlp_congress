 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Utah for  yielding.   Last night, President Trump stood feet from here and spoke about the  need and his commitment to regulatory reform.   I would like to echo those comments. One of the chief reasons the  voters sent most of us here is because they know that Federal  regulation is killing our economy and placing a heavy burden on  families. I am proud to deliver on a promise I made during the  campaign, and to have done so in the first 100 days. The OIRA Insight,  Reform, and Accountability Act codifies the Office of Information and  Regulatory Affairs, known as OIRA. OIRA serves as the regulatory  gatekeeper, a safety valve, providing a process and review to hold back  the floodgates of unnecessary burdensome and duplicative regulations.   OIRA is a bipartisan office within the executive branch that was  originally created during the Reagan administration and further  outlined by President Clinton in an executive order. President Clinton  put it well when he said:   ``The American people deserve a regulatory system that works for  them, not against them: a regulatory system that protects and improves  their health, safety, environment, and well-being and improves the  performance of the economy without imposing unacceptable or  unreasonable costs on society; regulatory policies that recognize that  the private sector and private markets are the best engine for economic  growth; regulatory approaches that respect the role of State, local,  and tribal governments; and regulations that are effective, consistent,  sensible, and understandable.''   I agree with President Clinton's words in 1993. This is about making  sure government solves problems, rather than creates them. And create  them, it has.   In recent years, the regulatory state has grown to impressive levels.  Between 2006 and 2015, agencies published over 36,000 final rules, of  which 555 were considered economically significant. That is, they  anticipated an economic effect of $100 million or more.   Many of these regulations have been imposed without thorough cost- benefit analysis, placing huge burdens on families and businesses. What  is worse, Americans have had little, if any, influence on regulations  that impact their lives as unelected bureaucrats regularly have  exceeded their authority while imposing regulations that negatively  impact them. It is our responsibility as the people's representatives  to protect them from this ever-expanding regulatory state.   This bill is simple and plain. The bill locks into place existing  transparency requirements like the unified agenda and the annual  regulatory plan.   The bill also requires OIRA to tell us more about what they are  currently doing.   After OIRA conducts a review of significant regulations, H.R. 1009  requires OIRA to give us a readout. Imagine that, we want them to tell  us what they are doing. How did the agency do? Is the regulation well  drafted? Did the agency meet the requirements of the law? That is a  novel approach. Did the agency pick the best way to regulate? OIRA is  already required to conduct this review under Executive Order 12886.   The bill asks OIRA to tell us the results. I am surprised and  disappointed that even on this bill we have seen significant  opposition.   My minority counterparts have made complaints based on strained legal  arguments, but they haven't offered an amendment to fix the alleged  problem. Why? Because they don't like the basic concepts of the bill.  These are not partisan concepts. We have heard their concerns in  committee. We obviously disagree at this point. And as the chairman  said, this is passed by committee without amendment. We look forward to  support, and I ask my colleagues to support the bill.     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 7, line 2, strike ``Administrator shall work with       interested'' and insert the following: ``head of each agency       shall submit the program descriptions required in       subparagraph (B) to the Administrator.

Page 26, insert after line 16 the following:        (e) Effective Date.--Section 3524 of title 44, as added by       subsection (a), shall take effect 120 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act.       SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to carry out the       requirements of this Act and the amendments made by this Act.       Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts       otherwise authorized.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 156, the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Chair, this amendment makes technical changes to  H.R. 1009 to ensure consistency in dates and terms, require OIRA to  review significant guidance, and prohibit authorization of additional  funds. It allows OIRA 4 weeks to review the Unified Agenda submissions,  requires a mutual agreement to extend the regulatory review beyond 90  days, and requires a written explanation of each 30 days of the  extension.   That is critical. They must explain to us, to the people, any  extension.   It clarifies the timing of the post-review disclosure to occur as  soon as the agency makes the proposed final rule public, clarifies that  disclosure of interagency communication is limited to exchanges with  senior-level OIRA staff, requires a written explanation  [[Page H1439]]  for any exempt regulations, and expands OIRA to review the guidance  document per a Bush-era executive order.                                time  1645    This amendment primarily makes technical changes to the bill that  were developed in consultation with OIRA staff. We took their concerns  and suggestions into account, and we incorporated most of those in this  amendment. For example, this amendment clarifies the review extension  process that has been the subject of some conversation here.   Our minority counterparts have claimed that OIRA has 90 days, plus a  30-day extension to review under current executive order. That is  clearly not true under the executive order or in practice. Under the  Obama administration, OIRA review, at times, exceeded 2 years without  explanation. This limitless extension is permissible under the  governing executive order, which allows an automatic 30-day extension  at the request of OIRA and a limitless extension at the request of the  agency.   We have heard that when OIRA needs that additional time, they simply  call up an agency and ask for an extension. So this bill requires  transparency in the review process, puts limits on that, and requires  the disclosure of that.   OIRA has suggested the term is a mutual agreement between the  agencies so that, in fact, we could put limits on the review and  extension process.   Another important addition to this amendment is that we are extending  OIRA's review to guidance documents. This is not a new practice. In  2007, President Bush issued Executive Order 13422, which extended  OIRA's review to guidance documents.   While President Obama rescinded that executive order, OIRA  Administrator Shelanski affirmed to the Oversight and Government Reform  Committee in the past Congress that OIRA should continue the practice  of reviewing significant guidance documents.   These guidance documents will only rise to the level of OIRA review  if they meet the significant standard.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, one brief comment, which is we are perfectly  comfortable with the cost of $20 million, given the billions of dollars  that the regulatory system currently costs businesses and taxpayers. We  think it is a small investment to, in fact, have regulations make  sense, not duplicate, not be overburdensome; and we suggest that it is  a small cost given the overall cost to running the Federal Government  to actually get regulation dialed back to some controllable level.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit by my colleague.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized  for 5 minutes.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle for the robust process by which we considered this bill.   The bill came to the floor through regular order in the Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform. We had a full markup which allowed for  Members on both sides of the aisle to offer amendments and insight. We  had healthy debate on a number of amendments, and we just voted on some  of them.  [[Page H1446]]    This bill codifies existing policy with changes only to include  independent agencies and improve government transparency.   I oppose the motion to recommit. I urge my colleagues to oppose the  motion and vote ``yes'' on final passage.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote
