 Mr. Speaker, our Thanksgiving celebration for this year is  in the rearview mirror, but the rising inflation that drove dinner  costs higher this year is sticking around for Christmas and will  continue to crush household budgets into the new year.   From the grocery store to the gas pump, Americans across the board  are paying more for just about everything. No matter where you may fall  on the income spectrum, none of us can escape paying more for less.  However, lower income households and the elderly who are on fixed  incomes will be hit hardest by the pain that inflation always inflicts.   What is driving the skyrocketing inflation? Wasteful and increased  Federal spending that encourages workers to remain on the sidelines,  supply chain shortages, and transportation disruptions are to blame.   Americans are not stupid. That is why a majority say that President  Biden's multitrillion-dollar socialist tax-and-spend scheme will only  make bad inflation worse, not better.                            ____________________
