 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of three amendments to the  National Defense Authorization Act which include language from three of  my bills, the Burn Pits Registry Enhancement Act, the Reducing Exposure  to Burn Pits Act, and the Toxic Exposure Education for Servicemembers  Act.   All three of these amendments are bipartisan here in the House as  well as in the Senate. I thank my partners and friends here in the  House, Republican Congressmen Wenstrup and Bilirakis.   Fighting to ensure our veterans get the care and benefits they have  earned and deserve has always been, still is, and will always be a  priority of mine.   Additionally, all three of these amendments are endorsed by the major  veterans service organizations, including Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans  of America, Disabled American Veterans, and the Wounded Warrior  Project. All three amendments will help care for servicemembers exposed  to toxic burn pits.   Amendment 460 is my Burn Pits Registry Enhancement Act. It would  allow veterans in the burn pit registry to designate someone to update  the registry with their cause of death. This data is crucial to further  identify the vast array of illnesses that are causing burn pit-exposed  servicemembers and veterans to die, and it will help doctors recognize  early symptoms of life-threatening conditions and save lives.   The next amendment, 464, is my Reducing Exposure to Burn Pits Act. It  would require the Department of Defense to submit a report to Congress  on what the cost would be to get rid of the use of burn pits. This  amendment will get us one step closer to ending the use of dangerous  and toxic burn pits to prevent illness.  [[Page H3216]]    Finally, amendment 503 is my Toxic Exposure Education for  Servicemembers Act. It would require the Department of Defense to  establish a new risk assessment for toxic exposure for servicemembers  who are assigned to work near toxic burn pits. This amendment would  also require the Department of Defense to establish an outreach program  to inform servicemembers about the harms associated with working near  toxic exposures.   These three amendments all aim to save lives and help prevent  exposure to toxic burn pits. They do this by requesting the collection  of data in the hopes of catching associated illnesses and conditions  faster, educating our servicemembers on the harms associated with them,  and forging a path forward to end their use.   I have fought for years to bring attention to this issue and its  devastating toll on our Nation's servicemembers and their families.  Time and time again, I have come before this body to tell the stories  of those whose lives were devastated and forever changed by burn pits.   I have told the story of Jennifer Kepner, an Air Force veteran from  Cathedral City in my district. Jennifer was an otherwise healthy mother  of two who lost her courageous battle with pancreatic cancer likely  caused by her exposure to burn pits during her military service.   I have told the story of Alejandro Camacho, from Palm Desert, who  developed testicular cancer from the toxic fumes, particulate matter,  and carcinogens he breathed in every day during his service in Iraq.   Their stories shed light on the obstacles that veterans across the  country have faced and continue to face to get the care and benefits  they earned and deserve.   It is for Jennifer, Alejandro, and the millions of other veterans  suffering from their burn pit exposures that I founded the bipartisan,  bicameral Congressional Burn Pits Caucus.   It is our duty to take care of our veterans who sustained injuries  and illnesses while they were fighting for our country.   I am encouraged by the steps we have taken to address how we take  care of our servicemembers and veterans suffering from toxic exposures.   The historic passage of the Honoring our PACT Act, led by Ranking  Member Takano, will provide generational change, giving care and  support to veterans and their families suffering from illness due to  their toxic exposure.   The foundation of the bill was built upon my bill, the Presumptive  Benefits for War Fighters Exposed to Burn Pits and Other Toxins Act,  which removes the burden from veterans to prove that 23 illnesses or  conditions, including various cancers that they are suffering from, are  due to their service near burn pits.   However, there is more to do to prevent toxic exposures from  happening, and I will not stop fighting until our servicemembers are  safe.                            ____________________
