 Mr. President, on May 31, 2020, Mr. Tom  Gresham of Indianola, MS, concluded his term as the 84th president of  Delta Council. I am pleased to commend him for his service and  contributions to the Delta region and the State of Mississippi.   Organized in 1935, Delta Council plays an important role in uniting  the agricultural, business, and economic development leadership to  solve problems and promote greater opportunities in the Mississippi  Delta region, which encompasses 19 counties in Northwest Mississippi.   Mr. Gresham's tenure began on the heels of the devastating and  historical Yazoo Backwater Flood of 2019, which destroyed thousands of  acres, hundreds of homes, and took two lives. As a Delta native,  business owner, and servant to his community, his leadership helped  bring tremendous attention and change to a new plan proposed by the  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to address this critical flood control  issue.   He also met challenges unlike any other Delta Council president in  the unprecedented times we faced during the onset of the global  pandemic of COVID-19. In leading Delta Council throughout his  presidency, he navigated the way for the council to continue its  devoted work to the region, despite the difficulties the virus brought  us. This included the first-ever virtual meeting of Delta Council.   I also applaud Mr. Gresham, as a longtime former chairman of Delta  Council's Development Department, along with Delta Strong leadership,  on bringing hundreds of jobs to the Delta through the Delta Strong  industrial recruitment initiative. As the president of Double Quick,  Inc., for over 35 years, Tom Gresham knows what it takes to grow a  successful business in the Delta.   Despite the time spent dedicated to his presidency and career, Mr.  Gresham still finds time to serve in a multitude of capacities locally  and regionally. He has served in leadership roles as cochairman of the  Indianola Promise Community, director of Northwest Mississippi  Community Foundation, past chairman of Mississippi Economic Council  past president of Mississippi Association of Convenience Stores,  Indianola Educational Foundation, Indianola Rotary Flub, Mid-Delta Arts  Association, Society of Independent Gas Marketers of America, and more.   I am pleased to join the citizens throughout the State of Mississippi  in commending Thomas G. Gresham and sharing our appreciation with his  wife Louise Houseman Gresham and their three adult children and four  grandchildren. His input over his year of service has undoubtedly  contributed to the overall success of this highly respected 86-year-old  organization, Delta Council.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Mr.  Paul Hollis of Rollingi Fork, MS, for his service and contributions to  the State of Mississippi while serving as the 85th president of Delta  Council.   Organized in 1935, Delta Council plays an important role in uniting  the agricultural, business, and economic development leadership to  solve problems and promote greater opportunities in the Mississippi  Delta region, which encompasses 19 counties in Northwest Mississippi.   Mr. Hollis has selflessly committed himself this year to the standing  priorities of Delta Council's agenda, namely flood control, among other  major issues the council addresses. As the owner and operator of Hollis  Farms in Anguilla, MS, for over 30 years, he knows all too well the  unjust history and devastation the incomplete Yazoo Backwater Pumps  flood control project has brought to his community. There are few  proponents of the Yazoo Backwater Pump Project who have volunteered the  time, loyalty, attention, and leadership as fervently as Paul Hollis.   Mr. Hollis assumed the role of Delta Council president in a  nontraditional fashion by way of the first-ever virtual meeting of  Delta Council, due to the unprecedented challenges we faced during the  COVID-19 global pandemic. Despite the hardships the virus brought upon  our State and Delta Council, Mr. Hollis led this organization admirably  through the rest of 2020 to restore the traditional Delta Council Day  at the 86th annual meeting, at which I am honored to serve as the  keynote speaker.   Outside of his time spent working on his farm and serving Delta  Council, Mr. Hollis contributes his leadership skills to many valuable  community organizations. He serves as commissioner for the Mississippi  Levee Board and chairman of the Delta Council Flood Control Committee.  He is president of his local Rotary Club, president of the Sharkey  Country Club, serves on the board for Sharkey-Issaquena Academy, as  well as Sharkey County School Board, chairman of the Board for Central  Mississippi Walk to Emmaus, and a board member for the Lower Delta  Partnership. He has also served as past chairman of Farm Service Agency  for Sharkey County and is chairman of Trustees for Rolling Fork United  Methodist Church.   It is my pleasure to join the citizens throughout the great State of  Mississippi in offering congratulations to Mr. Paul C. Hollis and  sharing our appreciation with his wife Laura Boykin Hollis, their four  adult children, and six grandchildren. His input over his year of  service has undoubtedly contributed to the overall success of this  highly respected 86-year-old organization, Delta Council.                            ____________________
