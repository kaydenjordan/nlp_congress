 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of this measure. I want to thank Mr. Hoyer, the  gentleman from Maryland.   Let me start by thanking the chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, Mr. Royce of California, for authoring this legislation and  working to bring it to this floor.   By now we have seen the footage. We went to the film and saw the  footage of Turkish thugs attacking peaceful protesters during President  Erdogan's visit to Washington a few weeks ago. It is bad enough when we  see governments anywhere crack down on basic rights like the freedom of  assembly or expression. It is bad enough to see that sort of oppression  in the streets of Ankara or Istanbul, but it is becoming more and more  common as Turkey slips towards authoritarianism.   But to see that on the streets of Washington, D.C., is absolutely  unacceptable--especially at the hands of foreign government officials  who are guests in our country. We cannot allow these actions to remain  unnoticed and to trample on our constitutional rights.   We know that President Erdogan was never in danger. He simply decided  to treat Americans the way he treats his own people. His guards even  had the nerve to attack law enforcement officials who were protecting  him and his delegation.   This behavior cannot stand, and the resolution before us sends a  clear, decisive message that Congress won't tolerate it. The State  Department must do whatever it takes to make sure that this does not  happen again, and those responsible for these heinous acts must be held  accountable. Charges must be filed and pursued.  [[Page H4631]]    I am glad to support this measure that puts the House on record  saying that we won't stand for this type of bully who attacks American  citizens and American democracy.   Mr. Speaker, free speech, free assembly, and free expression are at  the core of any democracy across the world. Turkey is certainly a  partner and an ally, and it is deeply concerning to see the steady  erosion of democracy in that country.   But we cannot tolerate that sort of behavior here in our country.  When you are in the United States, you play by our rules, and that  means obeying our laws and respecting our values. Those responsible for  violence against American citizens should face the consequences.  Otherwise, what is to stop them from doing this once again?   Mr. Speaker, I support this measure, and I urge all my colleagues to  do the same.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this measure.   I, again, want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel, who  have worked in a bipartisan way to bring this important measure before  us today. I would also like to thank Mr. Smith and Ms. Eshoo for their  work on this bill, the Iraq and Syria Emergency Genocide Act, and for  their tireless efforts on behalf of religious minorities in the Middle  East. It is often easy to look away in the face of these atrocities,  Mr. Speaker, but these lawmakers have made sure that we stay focused on  preventing genocide and promoting accountability in this part of the  region.   On March 17, 2016, Secretary of State John Kerry said: ``In my  judgment, ISIS is responsible for genocide against groups and areas  under its control, including Yazidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims . .  . the United States will strongly support efforts to collect, document,  preserve, and analyze the evidence of atrocities, and we will do all we  can do to see that these perpetrators are held accountable.''   The House had urged the Secretary to designate the crimes against  minorities in Iraq and Syria as ``genocide,'' and the measure before us  today follows up on those efforts. It is tragic that a bill like this  remains necessary. Unfortunately, ISIS continues to target religious  minorities, including Christians, Yazidis, and Shia.   We have seen overwhelming evidence of forced migration, execution,  rape, starvation, enslavement, amputation, and public lashings. In  Raqqa, which ISIS has declared capital of the caliphate, children are  forced to watch videos of mass executions in order to desensitize them  to this level of violence.   ISIS remains an ongoing threat, and its campaign of violence and  persecution is an ongoing tragedy for the people across the region.  This bill would respond to that part of the challenge. It states that  American assistance for humanitarian, stabilization, and recovery  should go to those individuals and communities with the greatest need.  That includes communities of religious and ethnic minorities.   The bill also will help ensure that those responsible for this  violence and persecution are brought to justice. It pushes USAID to  assist in the efforts to conduct criminal investigations and help  develop skills on the ground to collect evidence and press these cases.   This legislation is supported by the Knights of Columbus, U.S.  Conference of Catholic Bishops, HIAS, Yazidi Human Rights Organization- International, and several other organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   The only way for the people of Iraq and Syria to find peace and  stability in the coming years is to move towards more inclusive  governing, ensuring that minorities have a stake in the way their  countries are run, and for those responsible for violence to face  justice. It is as simple as that.   This legislation is a recognition that there are no military  solutions in the Middle East; rather, the best way forward is to  address the underlying causes that led to the creation of ISIS so we  can prevent the next ISIS from rising up from the ashes in Iraq and  Syria.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for H. Res. 355. This  resolution was submitted by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks) and  the gentleman from California (Mr. Cook). It is a strong message  condemning in the strongest terms the most recent terrorist attacks in  Manchester and London. We worked quickly in the committee to pass this  resolution in a bipartisan way. I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking  Member Engel again for their bipartisan efforts.                                time  1730    I would like to lend my voice of condolence to the families and  friends of those who were killed and injured. I pray that the  Manchester and London communities remain resilient and continue their  beautiful human display of kindness in the depths of such tragedy.   I read numerous human stories about neighbors, faith leaders, and  local businessmen and -women coming together to aid their fellow  citizens with open arms and compassionate hearts. The people of  Manchester, London, and the U.K. in general show the rest of the world  how to persevere in the face of terror.   Finally, let us remember that the attacks are directed at our open  societies that we have built over many generations. Let us remember  that our response will set the tone for not only the security of the  present day but also the faith in such open societies and the  unbreakable bonds of community for years to come.   We will continue to work in the Foreign Affairs Committee to bring  about justice and encourage peace. The United States admires the  Manchester and London response of stoicism, openheartedness, and  solidarity.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the British people are well known for  their stiff upper lip, their resolve, and resilience. We have seen all  these traits on display in the recent days in the proud European cities  of Manchester and London as the dead are mourned, the injured are  nursed to health, and the guilty are pursued.   Life must and will go on, and the United Kingdom will remain the  beacon of freedom, tolerance, and justice. I am glad we took this time  today to send this strong message of solidarity to the people of the  U.K. Through the years, they have long stood by us, and we are proud of  their friendship. We call them our friends. I support this measure and  trust the House will do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
