 Mr. Speaker, we are grateful for  Captain John ``JT'' Shelson for having served in the Washington office  of the Second Congressional District of South Carolina from the Army  for the past year as a defense fellow.   After graduating from Drexel University, Captain Shelson enlisted in  the Army, attending basic combat training at Fort Jackson, South  Carolina. He then attended the U.S. Army Officer Candidate School at  Fort Benning, Georgia, where he was awarded the Jess Walls Award for  commissioning as the top graduate in his class.   In 2017, Captain Shelson assumed command of Headquarters and  Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment and was  deployed to Eastern Europe in support of Atlantic Resolve. Captain  Shelson has also served in Afghanistan and Kuwait.   Captain Shelson has been vital to the office for the past year. He  was instrumental in repealing the widow's tax. I am grateful to him for  helping enact this important legislation for military families. I am  thankful for his commitment to America and wish him all the best for  continued success.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism with the leadership  of President Donald Trump.                            ____________________
