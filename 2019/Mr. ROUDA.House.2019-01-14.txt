 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 206, the  Encouraging Small Business Innovation Act.   The Small Business Innovation Research program, or SBIR, and the  Small Business Technology Transfer program, or STTR, were established  to spur innovation and job creation throughout the country. Since their  inception, these programs have awarded over $40 billion to small  innovative firms, including $34 million in California's 48th District.  Together, these programs are some of the Federal Government's largest  technology development programs.   For many research companies in my district and around the country,  these two programs serve as a gateway to the Federal contracting field.  The continued success of these programs depends on three primary  factors:   First, the program must remain highly competitive;   Second, applicants and awardees must have access to financing of all  types, including venture capital;   Third, we must ensure these products make it to the market.   But the lack of competitiveness and diversity continue to raise  questions, with the participation of women-owned and minority-owned  firms in these programs declining.   According to the Small Business Administration's annual report for  fiscal year 2013, only 15 percent of total award dollars went to women- owned small businesses, and only 10 percent to socially or economically  disadvantaged small and HUBZone-certified small businesses.   This bill addresses both issues by requiring participating agencies  to use part of their SBIR allocation to conduct outreach to minorities  and underrepresented States by removing the waiver of this requirement  from statute.   To address the need for outside financing, this bill includes small  business investment companies in the SBIR and STTR programs as possible  investors and increases the capital levels that can be invested by  private investors.   Finally, H.R. 206 also provides an avenue for more experienced SBIR  and STTR companies to mentor newer companies. It is clear that the SBIR  and STTR programs have promoted our shared goal of fostering  innovation, but we must continue to provide vigilant oversight of these  programs to ensure their maximum effectiveness.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from the  Small Business Investor Alliance.                               Small Business Investor Alliance,                                                   January 14, 2019.      Hon. Harley Rouda,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Rouda: Since 1958, the Small Business       Investor Alliance (SBIA) has been the voice of Small Business       Investment Companies (SBICs). We write in support of H.R.       206, the Encouraging Small Business Innovation Act, which is       being considered by the House of Representatives today. The       bill is a simple, modest improvement to the Small Business       Investment Act of 1958 that would encourage more investment       in job-creating American small businesses.        SBICs are highly-regulated private funds that invest       exclusively in domestic small businesses, with at least 25%       of their investments in even smaller enterprises. The nearly       $28 billion SBIC debenture program is a market-driven       platform that serves an important public purpose of       facilitating private investment in domestic small businesses.       After raising private capital and successfully navigating a       rigorous licensing process, a licensed SBIC is permitted to       access a line of credit (leverage) to increase the amount of       capital to be invested in domestic small businesses.       Generally, the ratio of leverage to private capital is a       little less than 2:1, with some strategies utilizing an even       lower leverage ratio. With the private capital in a first-      loss position, a modest leverage ratio, and the benefits of       the portfolio effect, the program operates by law at zero       subsidy, further exhibiting effective protection for the       American taxpayer. As a testament to the underlying structure       of the SBIC program, it is one of the few government programs       that was able to continue to operate at zero subsidy through       the Great Recession.        H.R. 206 seeks to encourage more investment in Small       Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business       Technology Transfer (STTR) companies. The stated mission of       the SBIR and STTR programs is to ``support scientific       excellence and technological innovation through the       investment of Federal research funds in critical American       priorities to build a strong national economy.'' Both       programs seek to increase private sector commercialization of       innovations arising out of federal research and development.       H.R. 206 would include SBICs in SBIR and STTR and would allow       SBICs to exclude a percentage of their SBIR and STTR       investments from their leverage calculation, with the goal of       spurring more investment in technology and innovation.        H.R 206 would make thoughtful improvements to the SBIC       program and thereby help domestic small businesses. SBIA       thanks you for your leadership on this legislation and for       your commitment to expanding economic opportunity in America.       We look forward to working with you during the 116th Congress  [[Page H528]]       to continue strengthening the SBIC program.            Sincerely,                                                      Brett Palmer,                       President, Small Business Investor Alliance.     Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to thank Chairwoman  Velazquez for her support and leadership of innovative small business.  I also want to thank Representative Espaillat for his work on this  issue in the last Congress, and I urge Members to support this  legislation.
