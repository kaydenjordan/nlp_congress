 Mr. Speaker, as someone who comes from  a long line of dairy farmers, it is my honor to rise and recognize  National Dairy Month.   I am proud to come from the State with the second most dairy farms  and to represent more than 1,000 dairy farms in my district.   In Pennsylvania, the dairy industry is a major driver of economic  growth, supporting more than 47,000 jobs and bringing in more than $11  billion in revenue, but Pennsylvania dairy producers are struggling.   The total number of dairy farms and the dairy cows in Pennsylvania  are decreasing. One way to revitalize the dairy industry across the  country is by passing my bill, the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act.   This bill will allow whole milk to once again be served in school  cafeterias, giving children access to vital nutrients they often do not  consume enough of. Not only is this bill a win for children and parents  across the country who have been begging for more options in school  cafeterias, it is a win for dairy farms.   I believe there is no better way to celebrate National Dairy Month  than by passing the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act.                            ____________________
