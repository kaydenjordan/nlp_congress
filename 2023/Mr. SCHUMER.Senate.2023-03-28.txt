 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, by a large bipartisan vote of  65 to 28, the Senate invoked cloture on legislation repealing the Iraq  AUMFs of 2002 and 1991. We will continue voting on amendments over the  course of today, and Members should expect the final passage on  repealing the Iraq AUMFs as soon as tomorrow.   I want to thank both sides of the aisle for their cooperation and  bipartisanship. This has been a reasonable process here on the floor,  with votes on amendments brought forth by our Republican colleagues. I  hope this process can serve as a blueprint for how the Senate can work  into the future and in the next few months for sure. We will have  amendments without being dilatory. We will have debate without bogging  down the process. We will look for opportunities to advance bipartisan  bills as we did over the past 2 years.   So, again, I hope this AUMF portends good things to come. I hope it  can serve as a blueprint for how the Senate can work in this session of  Congress as we work together to make our country a better place.   I want to thank Senators Kaine and Young, Chairman Menendez, and all  of the cosponsors of this legislation for their good work.                              Women's Healthcare    But, unfortunately, there are disturbing trends here in the Senate,  and one of the most disturbing is what the Senator from Alabama is  doing to weaken our national security. For a long time, both parties  have worked together to quickly confirm the routine promotions of  generals and flag officers without partisan bickering, without needless  delay. Confirming military promotions is one of the most important  responsibilities of the Senate--a charge that rises far above normal  political fights. But, today, one Member--one Member, the Senator from  Alabama--is blocking the routine promotions of 160 generals and flag  officers because he objects to women within the military getting access  to reproductive care.   It is very simple. The senior Senator from Alabama wants to make the  healthcare decisions for the women of our military, and the Senator  from Alabama is holding up scores of military nominees, who have not  done anything to be treated this way, until he gets his way.   The women of our military are more than capable of making their own  decisions when it comes to their health. They do not need the senior  Senator from Alabama making decisions on their behalf, and they  certainly do not need any Senator throwing a wrench in the  functioning--the vital functioning--of our military when they, our  military, work every day to keep us safe.   So the Senator from Alabama risks permanently injecting politics into  the confirmations of routine military promotions. The Senator from  Alabama  [[Page S976]]  risks permanently injecting politics into the confirmations of routine  military promotions. And that would risk our entire national security.  For what? So he can push the MAGA hard line on blocking women's choice,  which is something that most women in this country--that most people in  this country--reject? That is beyond the pale.   Now, let's be clear. The Senator from Alabama's delay of 160 routine  military promotions is reckless. It puts Americans' security in  jeopardy. The 160 nominees who are on hold, all of whom have worked to  earn their promotions and all of whom we need to protect our security,  include 5 three-star generals, commanders for the U.S. naval forces in  the Pacific and Middle East--leaders who are confronting the likes of  China and Iran--and the U.S. Military Representative to the NATO  Military Committee, which is especially important right now as Russia  continues its war in Ukraine.   So let me say it again. This level of obstruction of routine military  promotions is a reckless departure from the Senate norm. None of us  want to live in a world where military appointments get routinely  politicized, and that is just what the Senator from Alabama is  doing. He is inflicting unnecessary damage to our military leadership.  It would paralyze the Senate if all of us had to take one rollcall vote  after another just to confirm routine, apolitical, qualified generals  and other flag officers.    I know that Members of both sides of the aisle feel passionately at  times about certain issues. We all do. But if every one of us went to  the floor and said that we are holding up every general, every admiral,  every flag officer until we get our way, our military would come  crashing down, would be in shambles, and our national security would be  in jeopardy. But that is just what the Senator from Alabama is doing.  The obstruction is dangerous--dangerous--for our national security.   I urge my colleague from Alabama to think about it. Why shouldn't a  Member on this side block military appointments? Why shouldn't any  other Member on that side on things they believe in just as  passionately as he believes in his issue of choice? The proper place to  take it up is on the floor of the Senate and the House as a legislative  proposal, not as hostage-taking and taking hostage of our generals and  admirals and people who deserve a promotion.   I urge my colleagues, my Republican colleagues on the other side, to  speak out and to certainly speak to the Senator from Alabama and tell  him how reckless this is. Several of my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle, to their everlasting credit, have voiced their concerns with  the Senator from Alabama's action. Our colleagues, our Republican  leadership, should convince him to stand down and let these military  promotions go through.                                 Debt Ceiling    Mr. President, now on the debt ceiling, this morning, Speaker  McCarthy stated in an interview that he sent a letter to President  Biden demanding the two sit down to talk about the debt ceiling. He has  been saying that for a very long time, but for a very long time, he has  not shown us any plan.   To date, Speaker McCarthy has failed to unite his conference behind a  single proposal that can win 218 votes. We are hearing a lot of  contradictions and U-turns by the Republican caucus in the House and  lots of outlandish proposals that would harm a lot of Americans, but as  far as a plan goes, the Republican leadership still has none. When the  Speaker is asked about specifics for his plan, all we get is crickets.  All we get is crickets.   Republicans have been flailing. One day there is a term sheet. Then  there is having a budget. Then there is not having a budget. Now there  is a supposed amorphous $4 trillion number. But the only thing missing  is a real plan. You can't just pick a number out of the sky and say  this is a plan. Of course it is not. You can't just put a number on the  floor of the House and try to get it to pass.   So when Speaker McCarthy points fingers at Democrats, all he is doing  is deflecting from problems he has in his own conference--that those on  the MAGA right want to pull one way and those who are more mainstream  want to pull another way, and he can't bring the two of them together.   Speaker McCarthy says he wants to sit down with the President, but if  he comes to the President's office with no specific plan, no specific  details about what the Republicans want to cut, what are they going to  talk about? The weather? If the two sit down, the Speaker would have  nothing to say because for 3 months he has been missing the one thing  that he needs most: an initial plan that can unite 218 votes.   We Democrats have had a plan--House, Senate Democrats. Pass it  without brinkmanship, without hostage-taking. Do what we have done  under President Trump and President Biden in the past when we have  reached the limit of the debt ceiling.   We say to Speaker McCarthy: Where is your plan? If the two were to  sit down, the Speaker would have nothing to say because for 3 months he  has been missing an initial plan that can unite 218 votes.   During today's interview, the Speaker also claimed multiple times  that his party is considering $4 trillion in cuts.   Great. Fill out the specifics, where the $4 trillion exactly comes  from. Put it on the floor, Mr. Speaker. Show us the plan. Have a vote.  We need specifics. You can't say you are for $4 trillion in cuts if you  can't point to specifics.   If the Speaker truly has a proposal, he should lay it out. This isn't  about some amorphous, vague number; it is about having a plan. This is  the central problem with Speaker McCarthy's approach. It is not even  possible to meet with the President and have a true meeting if he can't  guarantee he will keep his conference together.   That is why Republicans should drop their brinkmanship, drop the  hostage-taking, work with Democrats on a clean, bipartisan extension of  the debt ceiling, and remove this cloud that is hanging over our  economy that is imposed by Speaker McCarthy's brinkmanship.                            Lower Energy Costs Act    Mr. President, on H.R. 1, the House is expected to vote this week on  Republicans' partisan, unserious, so-called energy package they call  H.R. 1. All it takes is a brief glance at H.R. 1 to realize it is just  a big giveaway to Big Oil, pretending to be an energy package.   House Republicans' so-called energy package would gut important  environmental safeguards on fossil fuel projects. It would lock America  into expensive, erratic, and dirty energy sources while setting us back  more than a decade on our transition to clean energy.   Everyone admits we have to do something about the carbon that is  causing global warming. We have seen all the changes that it has caused  all across the country. And they want to move back 10 years at the  behest of Big Oil?   It is a plan that has no support with the American people--very  little--the oil interests, yes, but just about nobody else. It falls  woefully short on long-overdue and much needed reforms for accelerating  the construction of transmission to bring clean energy projects online.  Transmission is hugely important to increasing access to clean energy,  but the Republican plan falls woefully short on this front as well.    I want to make clear that H.R. 1 is dead on arrival in the Senate. It  is another exercise. You can go back to the MAGA supporters back home,  the big oil companies you are walking in lockstep with, and say: See,  we put this on the floor, but it is not going to get anything done.   We are not going to waste our time on a bill that sets America back  decades in our transition to clean energy.   A serious clean energy package would help ease America's transition  to clean energy while ensuring that clean energy is reliable,  accessible, and most importantly, affordable.   Fortunately, many Democrats and Republicans understand that we need a  bipartisan, bicameral approach to produce a serious energy package.  Everyone knows there is going to have to be give on both sides to get  it done. We on our side will continue working in good faith on real  permitting reform talks.   But, House Republicans, H.R. 1 is, very simply put, a nonstarter.                                Student Loans    Mr. President, on the student debt CRA, yesterday, Republicans  introduced legislation that would end the pause on payments and  overturn President Biden's historic student loan debt  [[Page S977]]  relief program, denying the millions of Americans with student debt the  critical relief they need.   Republicans talk a big game about helping working families, but they  are once again showing how callous and uncaring they are by blocking  that relief that would immediately improve the lives of millions of  families burdened with student debt.   Republicans call President Biden's plan a ``giveaway to high  earners.'' That is just false. That is just malicious. That is just  nasty. Under President Biden's plan, nearly 90 percent of relief  dollars would go to out-of-school borrowers making less than $75,000 a  year.   Republicans, look at the facts. Let me repeat it. Under President  Biden's plan, 90 percent--nearly 90 percent of debt relief dollars  would go to out-of-school borrowers making less than $75,000 a year.   Under President Biden's plan, no one in the top 5 percent of incomes  will receive a penny in debt relief. President Biden's plan is not a  giveaway to high earners. In fact, there are a lot of very, very  wealthy people who never want to see the government help anybody except  themselves who seem to push this idea of getting rid of the President's  plan.   President Biden's plan is a ladder up to the middle class for  millions of Americans who need it most. Rather than help the privileged  few, the Biden plan would benefit students of color, poor Americans,  children of immigrants, and working and middle-class families across  the country. These are the Americans who bear the brunt of the student  debt crisis. They are the ones hurt by Republican legislation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the notice  of adoption of regulations from the Office of Congressional Workplace  Rights be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                            ____________________
