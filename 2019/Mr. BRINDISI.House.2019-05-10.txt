 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor L. Frank Baum,  author and creator of ``The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,'' on the 100th  anniversary of his death.   Baum was a native of Chittenango, New York, which is home to the  International L. Frank Baum and All Things Oz Historical Foundation and  Museum.   Each June, the village celebrates Baum's classic tale with the  longest running Wizard of Oz festival in the country. The community,  joined by fans from all over the world, come together for Oz-themed  parades, exhibits, fireworks, and contests.   But the magic of Oz isn't only present this one time of year. The  classic yellow brick road runs through the village for visitors to  enjoy year-round.   Chittenango is proud to be the birthplace of such an influential  author, and his legacy lives on in central New York. After all,  ``there's no place like home.''                            ____________________
