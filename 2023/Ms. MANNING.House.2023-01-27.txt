 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the late Annie Brown  Kennedy, a devoted mother, grandmother, pillar in the Forsyth County  legal community, and fierce pioneer for civil rights.   Annie's story is one of many firsts. Annie was one of the first Black  women to become a licensed lawyer in the State of North Carolina, the  first-ever Black woman lawyer in Forsyth County, and the first Black  woman to serve in the North Carolina House of Representatives.   Annie's dedication to the fight for equality under the law made  history. Her vision for a more equitable North Carolina drove her  success in landmark legal cases, including Simpkins v. The City of  Greensboro, which desegregated public recreational facilities across  the South.   Annie's work moved our Nation forward, while creating a path for the  next generation to continue her work. She will be deeply missed by her  loving family and the entire community.   May her memory be a blessing to all.                            ____________________
