 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last week, a man submitted his 2-weeks'  notice to his place of employment in Virginia Beach before going there  and shooting 12 people and injuring 4 others. He unloaded dozens of  rounds indiscriminately. In addition to having two handguns, he had  extended ammunition magazines and a suppressor to muffle the sound of  gunfire.   This was the 100th mass shooting in America, coming on the 100th day  of the year. This has become a regular part of life in the United  States of America--individuals walking into churches and shopping malls  and schools and places of employment and shooting indiscriminately such  that dozens of innocent lives are lost. In most cases, the same kinds  of weapons are used--semiautomatic rifles, extended magazines--weapons  or components of weapons that are banned in other countries and that  were banned in this country for a period of time because they were  believed to have been so dangerous such that they should have been in  the exclusive province of the military and law enforcement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Ryan Keith Cox was 50 years old when he  was shot and killed on May 31. He was known for his soft-spoken nature  and his powerful singing voice in his church choir, and he was  constantly affecting those around him with small but meaningful  gestures of kindness.   The day that he was killed in Virginia Beach, a close coworker of  Ryan's, Christi Dewar, was with him when the shooting started. Ryan  told Christi and other colleagues to barricade themselves in the break  room. Christi implored Keith to join them in the break room, but he  said to her ``I have to go check on the other ones.'' Keith left and  was soon shot by the gunman as he was assisting other coworkers in  reaching safety.   Christi said:         Every time I was upset, [Ryan] would give me a [big] hug.       When I was upset about something, he knew exactly what to say       to make you smile. He's the type of person who you know would       lay down his life for someone, just like he did.    Bishop Williams of Faith World Ministries in Norfolk said that he had  known Keith and his family for years. They were close, a very loving  family, and had just been ``leaders in the church world,'' Bishop  Williams said.   Ryan Keith Cox was 50 years old when he was shot in Virginia Beach.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Joshua Hardy was 2 years older. He was 52  years old. He had been working for 4\1/2\ years as an engineer and  technician for the city of Virginia Beach. He was raised in Hampton  Roads. He came from a really big family, and he was described by his  friends and his family as being incredibly caring, especially about  kids. He didn't have any children of his own, but he often watched over  his nieces and nephews.   One of his nieces, Tasha, remembered that he was around a lot. ``He  cared about me and all of my cousins,'' she said. ``He was like a  father figure to me because my dad wasn't around.''   In 2011, Joshua actually published a book, called the ``ABC Book on  Protecting Yourself from Strangers.''   The people he worked with remember being so impressed that Joshua had  gone above and beyond the call. One of his colleagues in the  engineering department, Larry Knight, gave a copy of the book to his  daughter and his grandson. He remembers Joshua as just always having a  smile on the job:         Joshua was one of the nicest men you would ever care to       meet. He was funny and kindhearted. [He] would do anything       for you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, LaQuita Brown was 39 years old. She was a  public servant from Chesapeake, VA. She had worked in the public works  department for more than 4 years. She was a right-of-way agent. Her  friends called her ``Ms. Worldwide'' because she loved to travel. She  had  [[Page S3225]]  been all around the world, and her social media was plastered with  pictures of her travels.   Her father, as any father would be, is absolutely heartbroken by her  death.   He said:         She was just everything. She was everything to me. I know       nobody's perfect--but from the time she was born, she had no       faults.    For the Brown family, the grief surrounding LaQuita's death comes on  the heels of LaQuita's brother dying from a hit-and-run driver 3 years  ago. Her father said that LaQuita helped him through the grief. ``She  saved me,'' he said. ``I wouldn't have made it through that [without  her].''   In 100 days into the year, we have had 100 mass shootings. It doesn't  happen anywhere else in the world except in the United States of  America. We can't claim to be helpless, and we can't claim to have no  solutions because, if it only happens here and nowhere else, then there  must be something different happening here. We can learn. We can adapt.   It has now been 100 days since the House of Representatives passed a  universal background checks bill, a universal background checks bill  that is supported by 90 percent of Americans and would have a  significant downward effect on the number of people who are shot in  this country.   We tend to pay attention as a nation and as a body only when  something like Virginia Beach happens, when there is a mass shooting of  an epic scale--when 5 or 10 or 20 people lose their lives at one time.  Yet, since the House passed the universal background checks bill,  10,000 people have been shot and killed in America. That is a stunning  number.   There have been 10,000 people shot and killed in America in just the  100 days since the House passed the universal background checks bill,  but the vast majority of these individuals were not killed in mass  shootings. Most of these were suicides. Most of these were individuals  who had taken their own lives with weapons. Others were accidental  shootings. Many of them were homicides.   The grief and the pain that comes with all of those is no different  than the grief that LaQuita Brown's family is feeling right now. We  should care about every single one of these deaths.   The reason I pegged this to the passage of the background checks bill  is that we know that background checks save lives in States that have  universal background checks, meaning, if you are getting a gun in a  commercial sale, you need to prove that you are not a criminal or that  you are not seriously mentally ill. In the States that have universal  background checks, you have fewer suicides, and you have fewer  homicides.   Connecticut is a perfect example. The research shows that once we  passed our universal background checks requirement--and we did it quite  a number of years ago--we saw a 40-percent reduction in gun homicides  in our State. Similarly, when Missouri went from having a universal  background checks requirement to its not having one, the State saw a  40-percent increase in gun homicides.   Not every single one of these 10,000 deaths was preventable, but many  of them could have been. It is not that we don't know what to do, and  it is not that we don't know what makes this country different; it is  just that we are unwilling to take those steps.   Just this past weekend, 52 people were shot in communities across  this country. There were 10 deaths from gunshot wounds in Chicago  alone. These victims are just as worthy of remembering as the victims  in Virginia Beach or in Sandy Hook or in Parkland.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Gwain Brown was 16 years old. He was a  sophomore in high school in Chicago, IL, and he was all hyped up to  throw himself the biggest 16th birthday party that his friends had ever  seen. At the end of April, he was going to throw down. Yet, on April 1,  he was standing in front of a gas station when a gunman opened fire and  hit Gwain in the leg and the chest.   One of his basketball teammates thought the initial news of Gwain's  death was an April Fools' joke as it happened on April 1. So, when he  heard about it, he just went back to sleep.   His friends said Gwain was the life of the party and was so  energetic. ``I was . . . with him . . . a week ago, and for that to  happen in this time period, I'm just in shock.''   At a vigil, his elementary school principal read an excerpt of  something he had written well in school.   Gwain wrote: ``I want to be a good son, always be there for my mom  and always be there to take care of her.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, a couple weeks ago, Jaylin Ellzey was a  freshman at Fenger Academy High School in Chicago. According to his  uncle, Jacob, he was an outgoing, kindhearted kid. He lived with his  mother. He had two sisters and three brothers.   Jaylin is not around anymore because he was one of those victims of  gun violence in the city of Chicago.   His uncle said:         Summer in the city, it's just something different. Other       kids look forward to going to summer camp. He was just trying       to make sure he lived another day.    His uncle, Jacob, began tearing up as he recalled his favorite memory  of Jaylin as a small child. Whenever Jaylin and his brother would come  stay with their uncle, they would take a bath, and then they would  nestle amongst the pillows and the blankets, waiting for their uncle to  blast them with hot air from a blow dryer.   ``He was just a lovable kid surviving his environment,'' said his  uncle. ``And he knew about family. Family was always instilled in  him.''   Since my life was changed in December of 2012, when 20 first graders  were killed in Sandy Hook, I have tried to come down to the floor every  couple weeks and tell the stories of victims of gun violence in this  country to try to put some personality behind the 10,000 lives that  have been lost in the last 100 days, and I told you about 5 of the  victims this morning.   Our inaction is complicity. There are tough things, and then there  are easy things. I get it that there are some anti-gun violence  measures that I would support that are just too hot for some Republican  Members, but I don't care what State you are from, 97 percent of your  constituents, 80 percent of your constituents--the vast majority of  your constituents--support expanding background checks to make sure  that if you buy a gun online or you buy a gun at a gun show, you have  to go through a 5-minute background check.   All of our constituents, no matter whether we represent a blue State  or a red State, support extreme risk protection orders--the idea that  you should be able to go to court when somebody is on the verge of  lashing out against someone else or going to hurt themselves and take  away their guns, at least temporarily. These are things that are not  controversial anywhere, except for here, that we could pass.   Since the House passed the background check bill--by the way, with  bipartisan support--10,000 people have died, but there have been 109  mass shootings. Thirty-one States have had a mass shooting; 166 kids  have been killed or injured; 175 teenagers have been killed or injured.   I am on the floor today to send my heartfelt condolences to the  families in Virginia Beach who continue to mourn yet another mass  shooting. I express, as I always do, my condolences to the families of  gun violence throughout this country. Eighty to ninety people lose  their life every day from a gunshot wound.   I am also here today to ask my colleagues to think about why we  continue to refuse to have a debate on a piece of legislation that the  House passed 100 days ago in a bipartisan fashion.   Even if you don't love the version of the background checks bill that  the House passed, bring your own version to the floor--bring a  different bill that will address the epidemic of gun violence in this  country. All I ask is that you don't do nothing; that you stop your  absolute silence in the face of this epidemic of slaughter.   Let the Senate be the Senate. I heard there was a time some years ago  when the U.S. Senate actually debated legislation. I have read in the  history books that this is supposedly the greatest deliberative body in  the world. We are doing no deliberation here. Bill after  [[Page S3226]]  bill passes the House of Representatives. None of them come before the  Senate for a vote--no healthcare bills, no immigration bills, no anti- gun violence bills.   I get it that the bills that pass the House probably can't pass a  Republican-led Senate, but why are we not even trying? Who is in charge  here? The special interests who want nothing to happen, the gun lobby,  the health insurance companies or are we in charge? We are the ones who  were elected. We are the Members of the U.S. Senate. We could choose to  have these debates, hash out our differences, and see if there is a  proposal that 60 of us could agree on that would do something about  this unacceptable level of gun violence that plagues this Nation on a  daily basis.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that floor  privileges be granted for the remainder of the day to my fellow, Dr.  Kali Cyrus, and that they be granted for the rest of the year to the  interns in my office, named Jyot Singh, Darcy Farwell, Alexandra  Hartman, Jordan Sicklick, Holly McGrath, Jordan Adjepong, and Cady  Stanton.
