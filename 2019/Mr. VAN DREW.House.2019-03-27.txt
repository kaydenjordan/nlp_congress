 Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to  speak to the Members of the House. We are all here because the American  people made it so.   The diversity of our Nation's political ideals is boundless. That is  what made our country what it is today. We are here to represent these  vast ideals.   The definition of bipartisanship is of or involving the agreement or  cooperation of two political parties that usually oppose each other's  policies. It is about cooperation, it is about compromise, and it is  about working together with those who don't have the same exact ideals  as you.   I am asking for the membership of this House to think on the idea of  bipartisanship. It is my belief that we owe it to the American people  to work together.                            ____________________
