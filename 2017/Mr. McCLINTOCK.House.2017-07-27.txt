 Mr. Speaker, this administration was elected to drain  the swamp, and one of the muckiest parts is the Export-Import Bank that  makes taxpayer-guarantied loans to foreign companies that buy American  products, often to use in competition with American companies that get  no such advantage.   Now, when politicians are picking winners and losers in the shadows,  it shouldn't surprise us that we find a particularly nasty breeding  ground for corruption.   We can debate the merits of the Ex-Im Bank, but one thing is  undeniable: it is an agency that needs a taxpayer watchdog on its board  and not just another lapdog for crony capitalists seeking to fleece the  taxpayer.   Scott Garrett is a watchdog. He has sounded the alarm on the Ex-Im's  more questionable loans, and his leadership on its board would restore  credibility to its decisions.   The bank's supporters should welcome an independent voice that could  restore its reputation, and the President should insist on it.                            ____________________
