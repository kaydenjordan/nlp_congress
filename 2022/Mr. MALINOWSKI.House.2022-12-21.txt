 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur  in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 1917) to modify eligibility  requirements for certain hazard mitigation assistance programs, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:          Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

(e) Termination.--The authority provided under this Act       shall cease to be effective on the date that is 3 years after       the date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1917, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1917. This bipartisan bill,  sponsored by Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher, makes it easier for  municipalities to access Federal funds to protect people and property  from disasters, like the major floods that have hit my State of New  Jersey and other States across the country.   For every one taxpayer dollar invested in mitigation, up to $13 are  saved. The vast majority of FEMA's mitigation investments are made via  the Agency's longest running mitigation grant program, the Hazard  Mitigation Grant Program, or HMGP, which began in 1989.   Since then, more than $5 billion have been obligated to HMGP  projects, but due to various issues, including lack of capacity and  burdensome red tape, more than $1 billion of these funds have gone  unobligated.   Mr. Speaker, $1 billion in unspent hazard mitigation funds translates  to a minimum of $4 billion in unrealized disaster recovery savings in  the communities that were unable to advance these mitigation projects.   This bill begins to cut the red tape and make it easier for  communities to start their projects early while still taking advantage  of the HMGP grants to complete their hazard mitigation projects that  involve acquisitions.   In short, H.R. 1917 helps communities access funding to complete  mitigation projects that will save lives, property, and taxpayer  dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of  my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I continue  to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I am proud to stand with the 409. It is nice when we can pass  important legislation with such a large majority, and I sometimes  wonder about the 16. I don't know quite what is going on over there,  but maybe the gentleman can tell me afterwards.   In closing, the Stafford Act entitles disaster-impacted States to  HMGP grants after the disaster so that they can learn from the damage  and protect their communities in the future.   The ability to complete post-disaster mitigation projects should be  accessible to communities in a much more timely manner. H.R. 1917 does  that. It will empower States to cut through the red tape and complete  acquisition projects much more quickly and with fewer burdens.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
