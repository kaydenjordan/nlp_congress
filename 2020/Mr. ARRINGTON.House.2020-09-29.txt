 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor my colleague, my  friend, and fellow pitcher on the Congressional Baseball Team.   In fact, in 2018, after watching my colleague John Shimkus pitch for  an  [[Page H5047]]  inning, I followed him on to the mound. After watching him for an  entire inning, I still, Madam Speaker, cannot throw the ball straight.   But in all seriousness, it is a privilege to serve with a man with  such great character and commitment to service.   In fact, John, you are the epitome of a servant leader. I imagine  this is how you were when you were a soldier, when you were a teacher,  a local leader. That is certainly who you are in this Chamber, and it  has made all the difference.   I am reminded of the scripture in Philippians that says: Do nothing  out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility, value  others above yourself.   That is who you are, John, and that is the value and the trait that  has made this country what it is today. I pray that we will have more  leaders follow you in your ilk.   It is an honor to be your friend. I am grateful for your friendship,  and I wish you blessings and Godspeed in all your future endeavors.
