 Madam President, recently, the Biden administration  withdrew a proposed Trump administration rule that would have required  universities and K-12 schools to identify their connections with  Confucius Institutes, which are very much connected to the country of  China and, I would even say, to the Communist Party of China, which may  be one and the same. I have asked the Biden administration about that  move, but the administration has failed to respond to date. So I am  here today to discuss four areas wherein the administration must be  tough with China as well as with other countries.   Since April 2015, I have conducted oversight on several key aspects  of foreign efforts to influence Members of  [[Page S1454]]  Congress and the American public. First, I have focused on the equal,  fair, and aggressive enforcement of transparency laws. An example of  one transparency law that I will focus on is the Foreign Agents  Registration Act.   I first raised concerns about the Foreign Agents Registration Act in  April 2015, when it became very apparent that it wasn't being used  hardly at all. Historically, it hasn't been used very much, and people  have been getting away without registering under that act. It may be OK  to represent a foreign country or a foreign interest, but at least we  in Congress ought to know about it, and, in turn, the American people  ought to know who you are and whom you are speaking for.   In 1938, Congress passed that law for the purpose then of exposing  Nazi propaganda and identifying foreign attempts to influence  policymakers as well as the American public. Last updated in 1966, the  Foreign Agents Registration Act requires those who lobby on behalf of  foreign governments and foreign interests to register their  affiliations and activities with our Justice Department.    The Foreign Agents Registration Act reflects the fundamental  principle that transparency brings accountability. Until recently,  however, the law has been seldom used. The Foreign Agents Registration  Act ought to be better enforced and also be equally enforced. That is  why I worked to expose holes in the existing law and then find ways  through additional legislation to shore it up or even use oversight to  see that the Justice Department takes its use with more certainty and  with more force.   As a result of those efforts, last session, I introduced a bipartisan  bill that goes by the title of ``Foreign Agents Disclosure and  Registration Enhancement Act.'' Since it wasn't passed in the last  Congress, I will be reintroducing it this session. The bill requires  the Justice Department for the first time to craft a comprehensive  enforcement strategy and to release advisory opinions to promote that  transparency. It gives investigators new tools, including civil  investigative demand authority, to help identify violations.   Last Congress, the bill had support from Chairman Graham and Ranking  Member Feinstein of the Judiciary Committee and Chairman Rubio and Vice  Chairman Warner of the Intelligence Committee. It also had bipartisan  support on the Foreign Relations Committee, including from Senators  Shaheen, Rubio, Murphy, and Young, who have all worked to shine a light  on foreign influence. We also had the signoff from the chairman of that  committee, also with support from the Trump administration.   Unfortunately, when Senator Cornyn and I joined on the floor just  before Christmas to ask for unanimous consent for the passage of this  bill that had such broad bipartisan support, the Democrats objected  even though it had this bipartisan, multicommittee support.   So I strongly urge the Biden administration to join my efforts in  making commonsense, bipartisan reforms to the Foreign Agents  Registration Act and to make it a priority. My bill gets the job done.   The second point I want to raise is that I have focused my oversight  on increasing nontraditional espionage activities and foreign threats  targeting taxpayer-funded research.   When I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 2018, I convened a  hearing regarding Chinese nontraditional espionage against the United  States. In that hearing, both DOJ and FBI officials made very clear  that the threat to our universities and taxpayer-funded research from  foreign governments, especially China, is real and it is ongoing. For  example, the Department of Justice witness stated:         We need to adapt our enforcement strategy to reach non-      traditional collectors, including researchers in labs,       universities, and the defense industrial base, some of whom       may have undisclosed ties to Chinese institutions and       conflicting loyalties.    The FBI witness stated that China's talent recruitment programs are  effectively ``brain gain programs'' that ``encourage theft of  intellectual property from U.S. institutions.''   In June of 2019, when I was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee,  I held a hearing on foreign threats to taxpayer-funded research which  focused heavily on China's theft and China's espionage within our  research community here in the United States.   After the hearing, I organized a classified committee briefing on the  topic from the Department of Health and Human Services, the National  Institutes of Health, the Department of Health and Human Services  inspector general, and the Department of Homeland Security.   The Trump administration ramped up government efforts to investigate  and prosecute researchers for stealing intellectual property and  research. The Biden administration must continue those aggressive  efforts if they want to be taken seriously. Those efforts are more  important now than ever. For example, during the COVID pandemic, China  has used cyber attacks to try to steal COVID-related research.   Third, another focus of mine has been on propaganda efforts within  our schools and universities. Specifically, that concerns China's  Confucius Institutes. As an extension of the Chinese Government, the  Confucius Institutes are a foreign principal for purposes of the  Foreign Agents Registration Act. According to reporting, the strategic  goal of the Chinese Government is to place its institutes within  existing colleges and universities in order to influence perceptions of  the Communist government in China under the guise of teaching Chinese  language, Chinese culture, and Chinese history. In other words, we have  to see this problem with open eyes.   In light of these factors, in October of 2018, I wrote to the Justice  Department and asked why it had yet to require individuals working for  Confucius Institutes to register as foreign agents under the Foreign  Agents Registration Act.   Then, in March of 2020, I wrote to dozens of schools asking that they  get a briefing from the FBI on the threats Confucius Institutes bring  to the academic environment.   I have also strongly backed Senator Kennedy's Confucius Act--that is  the title of the bill--which passed the Senate just last week. In part,  that bill mandates that if a school wants an institute on campus, that  school must have full managerial and academic control, not control from  the Chinese Government.   China's threats to our security are very real. They are known and  show no sign of stopping. It is a very good sign that in the past  couple of years, many universities and colleges have cut ties with  Confucius Institutes. Probably some of those were on those respective  campuses for a long period of time.    The Biden administration must use every tool at its disposal to  protect and defend our national security from this Communist threat,  which is why I wrote to the Biden Department of Homeland Security on  February 11 this year regarding its withdrawal of the Confucius rule,  which I thought was a very good step forward from the previous  administration.   Among the questions I asked of the Department, two relate to whether  the Biden administration considers the Confucius Institute to be an  extension of the Communist Chinese Government as well as being  purveyors of Communist Chinese propaganda. That ought to be easily  recognized, and I imagine our President does recognize it, but I want  to have him tell me so. So far, that Department has thus far failed to  respond.   The Biden administration would be wise to answer both in the  affirmative to clearly state to the country and the world where it  stands regarding China's gigantic propaganda machine, of which the  Confucius Institutes are only a small part. In other words, besides  going after the Confucius Institutes, we have to have our eyes open to  every way that the Communist Chinese and their government is trying to  influence things in this country, as well as stealing things from our  country.   Lastly, I want to highlight a very important issue that has recently  been brought to my attention. Upon entering office, President Biden  fired all U.S. Executive Directors at multilateral development banks  who were currently serving out their terms. Some of these multilateral  development banks are the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank,  the Asian Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction  and Development.   It has been U.S. tradition for incoming Presidents to allow these  nonpartisan U.S. Executive Directors to  [[Page S1455]]  serve in their positions until their term ends regardless of whatever  administration put them in those positions. This tradition is meant to  ensure that the United States maintains a consistent authoritative  presence and engagement within those multilateral institutions.   In the last administration, the United States was tough on China  through these development banks, and we were hoping that these people  would be left in place so they could continue that tough-on-China  approach. The Executive Directors who were in their respective  positions made it a point to defend U.S. strategic interests by  building coalitions aimed at eroding Chinese influence, which has been  allowed to grow at an alarming extent. There is quite a push by the  Chinese Communist Government to get involved in the highest levels of  almost every international organization, not just these banks that I am  talking about.   Removing these U.S. leaders from their positions prior to their terms  expiring and with no replacements even nominated isn't an example of  the United States leading; this is an example of our country ceding its  duties and responsibilities on the world stage.   In addition to my unanswered letters, the Biden administration should  inform Congress as to why it removed all Executive Directors from their  positions prior to their terms expiring.   I hope President Biden knows China is aggressively growing its  influence in these multilateral organizations, so now isn't the time to  abandon the field. There is no time to be weak with China. We must work  tirelessly to protect our way of life and our national security from  the ever-present threat of the Communist Chinese Government. At the  same time, we must build on the foundation that the Trump  administration created to protect American taxpayers from foreign theft  and espionage and propaganda.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
