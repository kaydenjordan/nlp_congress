 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  thank him for his leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor.   Madam Speaker, I pay special tribute to Congresswoman Chu, the chair  of the caucus in the House that represents the Asian Pacific American  community, and Pramila Jayapal, a member of the Judiciary Committee,  instrumental in bringing this legislation as well, the NO BAN Act, and,  again, the right to counsel legislation.   As I was thinking of this legislation today--I have a statement for  the record, but I was thinking back to the  [[Page H3631]]  ``rump'' hearing that we had under the leadership of the Judiciary  Committee at the time the NO BAN was announced. The distinguished  chair, Ms. Chu, talked about how people reacted at the airports and the  rest--among them, John Lewis--going to the airport.    But at this hearing, it was so remarkable, because people turned out.  Diplomats showed up and spoke for their colleagues who were still in  the diplomatic service, saying how wrong this was. They took  professional risk as members of our diplomatic corps. There were around  a thousand of them who signed a statement opposing this ban.   The military was there, our men and women in uniform. They were there  saying: You are hurting us. We have made promises to interpreters and  others who have helped us in Iraq and Afghanistan--they were Muslim-- and now they can't come to the United States? It is wrong on its face,  but we are not even keeping our word. Who will trust us? Who will trust  us if we don't have respect for people?   Some military who were Muslim--actually Khizr Khan was there, a Gold  Star father, he came and was very brief in his testimony. He had some  good advice about what we could do about this.   But our men and women in uniform who are Muslim were hearing this, in  Khizr Khan's case, a Gold Star family whose son had given his life for  our country, a Muslim, and now we were saying there is going to be a  Muslim ban.   What was interesting, though, was that a leader of the evangelical  community was there. And this bill is sending a strong message. It is  repealing all versions of the Muslim ban, the refugee ban, and the  asylum ban, rescinding each cruel version of the President's  discriminatory bans, including his executive order mandating extreme  vetting for refugees and asylum seekers.   Well, the person who was there, and the record will show,  representing the evangelicals, he said in his testimony that the United  States Refugee Resettlement Program is the crowning glory of American  humanitarianism, and here this President is rejecting that focus of who  we are as a country and the model we should be.   In fact, all this administration has done is diminish the  opportunities for those who would come here--some for fear of  persecution, others because they had helped us, and others because of  the Statue of Liberty, again, a beacon of hope to the world that is  constantly undermined by this administration.   So, Madam Speaker, I salute the maker of this amendment, Chairwoman  Judy Chu. I salute Pramila Jayapal, who has been relentless, persistent  on this matter, and I thank all of our colleagues who fought so hard.   Just to recall, we remember the day after the inauguration that women  turned out in huge numbers not only in Washington, but all over the  country and all over the world. They knew the power of their presence.   So, when this came shortly thereafter, people understood the power of  their presence, and people showed up at airports and wherever a  manifestation of support for our Muslim community was needed. It was  really quite a defining time for our country, because people knew their  power and the power of their presence, being there, being there for  everyone in our country.   So, Madam Speaker, I am very grateful to the makers of this motion,  to the Judiciary Committee. And to Chairman Nadler, I thank him for  giving us this opportunity to honor what the Statue of Liberty means to  us and to the world.   Then just go look at Ronald Reagan's statements about the Statue of  Liberty and the beacon of hope that it is to the world and contrast it  to the attitude that we see coming out of this White House now.   I hope we have a good, bipartisan vote on this repeal of the Muslim  ban and the access to counsel that goes with this legislation.   Madam Speaker, on the base of the Statue of Liberty, which is a  beacon of freedom and hope for the world, are inscribed these words:  ``Give me your tired, your poor/ Your huddled masses yearning to  breathe free/ Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me.''   I rise to join my colleagues in support of the ``NO BAN'' Act to  rescind the President's Muslim ban, which betrays everything the Statue  of Liberty and our nation stand for.   I salute Congresswoman Judy Chu, Chair of the Congressional Asian  Pacific American Caucus, and the lead on this legislation--which is the  first Muslim civil rights bill in our nation's history.   Thank you also to Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal for her leadership to  ensure that those unjustly detained have access to legal counsel.   It is particularly senseless that the President continues to inflict  his Muslim ban on the country as we face the COVID-19 pandemic.   These bans harm the economy and public health by depriving our nation  of the researchers, scientists, physicians and other medical  professionals desperately needed to crush the virus.   More than 100,000 medical professionals in our country are from just  two of the countries included in the ban.   Overall, the ban has led to a 15 percent drop in new physicians from  Muslim-majority countries coming to America.   These bans fuel anti-Muslim discrimination, which sadly, the White  House is encouraging, when it misleads the public and says that the  bans are needed to keep us safe--when in reality, the bans only weaken  our response, by banning doctors and medical professionals from our  shores.   At the same time, the bans erode our national security and devastate  families: separating families and preventing thousands from attending  loved ones' births, graduations, marriages and funerals. One study  finds that these bans have prevented more than 9,000 family members of  U.S. citizens from entering the country, including more than 5,500  children.   More than 400 national, state and local civil rights, faith-based,  national security and community groups, from AFSCME and Amnesty  International to United We Dream and Veterans for Peace, have spoken  out to demand passage of the NO BAN Act to ``end the harmful Muslim Ban  and put in place vital protections against future discriminatory  bans.''   ``The NO BAN Act is a clear and unequivocal response to the Muslim  Ban that would ensure no one can be banned from our country based on  religious or nationality-based discrimination ever again.   ``Regrettably, the Muslim Ban validates the worst stereotypes about  Muslims; that they are inherently foreign and violent and pose such a  threat to the United States they should be banned.   ``The ban on Muslims comes after generations of politicians hostile  to religious minorities have attempted to ban Jews, Catholics, and  Latter-day Saints. Congress now has an opportunity to take action  against the Muslim Ban and this troubling history by sending a strong  message that our nation rejects religious bigotry.''   With this bill, Congress is sending that strong message. We are:   Repealing all versions of the Muslim ban, the refugee ban, and the  asylum ban--rescinding each cruel version of the President's  discriminatory bans, including his executive order mandating ``extreme  vetting'' for refugees and asylum seeking;   Strengthening immigration law to explicitly prohibit discrimination  based on religion--and ensuring that it applies to non-immigrant visas,  entry into the U.S. and the approval of any immigrant benefit; and   Limiting executive authority to prevent any president from issuing  future bans like the Muslim ban--imposing strict requirements before  any future restrictions can be issued & enacting reporting requirements  to Congress to create an oversight mechanism for the future.   The Democratic House will always stand up to defend our values. As  Pope Francis said, ``It's hypocrisy to call yourself a Christian and  chase away a refugee or someone seeking help.''   I urge a strong bipartisan vote to put an end to this act of  callousness and discrimination from the White House.   Madam Speaker, I urge a strong ``yes'' vote.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for being a lifelong champion of environmental justice and  environmental stewardship as chair of the Committee on Natural  Resources.   Mr. Speaker, as a Californian, as an American, as Speaker of the  House, I proudly rise in support of the Great American Outdoors Act,  one of the most important conservation and public lands bills in  decades.   This legislation builds on the progress made here by House Democrats  and others earlier in our majority when we passed the John D. Dingell,  Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, named for our former  colleague, a fitting testament to Chairman Dingell's legacy, which made  permanent the authorization for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.   Mr. Speaker, the Great American Outdoors Act--I love the title--takes  the next step in our pro-conservation agenda, as it boldly protects our  country's natural and cultural heritage for our children, our  grandchildren, and generations to come.   This legislation reflects the energy and expertise of our freshmen,  and I particularly salute and thank Congressman   Joe Cunningham of  South Carolina. Congressman Cunningham is a former ocean engineer, now  serving on the Committee on Natural Resources, who was the lead author  on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, in passing this legislation, Congress is ensuring that  America lives up to its conservation promises, as we finally  permanently fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund at levels that  were promised.    Over 55 years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has provided over  $17 billion in funding for over 40,000 recreational and conservation  initiatives in every county in the country, creating and protecting  America's iconic landscapes like the Grand Canyon and historical sites  like the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park.   Some of California's most treasured natural areas benefited from the  protection provided by the Land and Water Conservation Fund, including  Joshua Tree, Lake Tahoe, and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area  in the San Francisco Bay Area.   The Land and Water Conservation Fund also addresses environmental  injustice by creating green spaces near low-income communities and  communities of color across the country, permanently. Funding the LWCF  will ensure that we preserve our natural heritage in an equitable  manner to ensure that all communities can benefit.   The Great American Outdoors Act--I love the name, as I said--also  makes an urgently needed investment in our national parks, which face a  crippling $12 billion deferred maintenance backlog. Our parks are  critical to preservation of our natural and cultural heritage, and we  must ensure that they can be enjoyed for generations to come.  [[Page H3652]]    The Great American Outdoors Act enjoys overwhelming bipartisan  support both in the Congress and across the country. Nearly 900  national, State, and local groups representing small businesses,  ranchers, sportsmen, veterans, outdoor recreationists, and conservation  organizations have written in support of this legislation sharing these  thoughts:   ``The Great American Outdoors Act will ensure a future for nature to  thrive, kids to play, hunters and anglers to enjoy. National parks and  public lands provide access to the outdoors for hundreds of millions of  people every year and habitat for some of our country's most iconic  wildlife.''                                time  1330    It goes on: ``These treasured places also tell the stories that  define and unite us as a Nation. Funds provided in this bill will  secure these vital resources while preserving water quantity and  quality, sustaining working landscapes and rural economies, increasing  access for recreation for all Americans no matter where they live, and  fueling the juggernaut of our outdoor economy.''   Indeed, the Great American Outdoors Act supports good-paying jobs and  grows the economy. Nationally, outdoor recreation supports more than 5  million jobs and adds nearly $780 billion to the economy.   House Democrats are proud to pass this bill and send it on to the  President's desk. We hope to do so in the strongest possible bipartisan  way, as it passed the United States Senate.   As we do, we will continue our work to protect our environment and  natural heritage by including calling on the Senate to take up H.R. 2,  the Moving Forward Act, which rebuilds America's infrastructure, while  investing in a clean energy future, including by modernizing our energy  infrastructure, boosting our commitment to renewables, building a clean  transportation sector, and more.   Also we want to implement the Select Committee on Climate Crisis'  action plan, Solving the Climate Crisis, the most sweeping and detailed  climate plan in decades, which sets out a vision of 30 by 30,  conserving at least 30 percent of land and ocean in America by 2030 to  confront the threats of the climate crisis, which the Great American  Outdoors Act advances.   And urging the Senate to take up H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act,  our strong response to the American people who are demanding climate  action by keeping us in the Paris Agreement.   That is not in this bill. We have a different bill here. We must  invest in the future we want for our children.   I just want to put this in a little perspective, Mr. Chairman and Mr.  Ranking Member. And thank you for your leadership in so many ways, Mr.  Bishop.   When our country was founded and when Thomas Jefferson became  President, he tasked Secretary of the Treasury Gallatin to build the  infrastructure of America, for an infrastructure plan that would follow  the Lewis and Clark Expedition. It was Erie Canal, Cumberland Road, all  kinds of things, and build into the Louisiana Purchase that would  follow. It was a great undertaking. Gallatin was the Secretary of the  Treasury, and so many things happened at that time to build the  infrastructure into the manifest destiny of America and as we moved  west.   You wonder why I am bringing that up. 100 years later, at the  anniversary of that initiative, President Teddy Roosevelt did his own  infrastructure initiative called the National Park Service. It was to  build and respect and conserve the green infrastructure of America. It  was quite remarkable. So much sprang from that initiative of Teddy  Roosevelt, the great conservationist.   And now, over 200 years later, this is a tip of the hat to all of  that. But so much more needs to be done. It is a recognition of the  importance of the great outdoors, to the quality of life, but also the  juggernaut of our outdoor economy.   So, I hope we will have a strong bipartisan vote. I once again thank  the distinguished chairman, Mr. Grijalva, for his leadership in all of  this over the years and for this bill. And I, again, salute Mr.  Cunningham of South Carolina for bringing his expertise as an ocean  engineer to bear as the lead author of this important legislation, the  Great American Outdoors Act.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his leadership in bringing us together today, along with our  distinguished leader, Mr. Hoyer; our distinguished whip, Mr.  Jim  Clyburn; Congressional Black Caucus Chair Karen Bass; Chairman Bennie  Thompson; Congresswoman Barbara Lee; and Mr. Butterfield. I thank Mr.  Butterfield for leading this critical effort, so important.   Mr. Speaker, as our country knows, nearly 2 months after the murder  of George Floyd, America remains gripped by anguish as racial injustice  continues to kill hundreds of Black Americans and tear apart the soul  of our country.   Last month, inspired by the activism of the American people and led  by the Congressional Black Caucus, the House passed the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act to fundamentally transform the culture of  policing, to address systemic racism, curb police brutality, deliver  accountability, and save lives.   On Juneteenth, I had the privilege as Speaker of the House, by my  authority as Speaker of the House, to remove four paintings of Speakers  of the House who were in the Speaker's lobby, to remove them because  they were part of the Confederacy, three of them before they came to  the Congress and one who came after his participation in the  Confederacy.   It was long overdue. When we were checking out the statues, we found  out about the paintings, and on Juneteenth we said good-bye to those  four.   Now in Congress and in the country, we must maintain a drumbeat to  ensure that this moment of anguish continues to be transformed into  action. That is why, today, the House is proud to pass legislation to  remove from the U.S. Capitol the 12 statues of Confederate officials  and four other statues honoring persons who similarly exemplify bigotry  and hate.   Mr. Speaker, again I thank Leader Hoyer, Whip Clyburn, CBC Chair  Karen Bass, Chairman Bennie Thompson, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, and  Chairman G.K. Butterfield for leading this effort.   As I have said before, the Halls of Congress are the very heart of  our democracy. The statues in the Capitol should embody our highest  ideals as Americans, expressing who we are and what we aspire to as a  nation. Monuments to men who advocated barbarism and racism are a  grotesque affront to those ideals. Their statues pay homage to hate,  not heritage.   Among the Confederate statues in the Capitol--can you believe this?-- are Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens, president and vice  president, respectively, of the Confederacy, both of whom were charged  with treason against America. Both were charged with treason against  America, and they have statues in the Capitol.   Now, think of this about Stephens--I hate to even use his words, but  it may be important for people to know why the statues have to go in  clearer terms. The infamous words of Stephens make as clear today as  they did in 1861 the aims of the Confederacy.   In his so-called Cornerstone Speech, Stephens asserted that the  ``prevailing ideas'' relied upon by the Framers included ``the  assumption of the equality of races. This was in error,'' says Mr.  Stephens.   Instead, he laid out in blunt and simple terms the awful truth of the  Confederacy. He said: ``Our new government is founded upon exactly the  opposite idea.''   Imagine, exactly the opposite idea of equality of races.   ``Its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great  truth''--and these are his words; I hate to even use them, but we have  to face this reality--``the Negro is not equal to the White man; that  slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal  condition.''    He has got a statue in the Capitol of the United States.   How can we seek to end the scourge of racism in America when we allow  [[Page H3660]]  the worst perpetrators of that racism to be lauded in the Halls of  Congress?   This bill also removes the statue of John Calhoun, the unapologetic  leader of the Senate's pro-slavery faction, who, on the Senate floor,  celebrated slavery as a ``positive good.''   Mr. Speaker, I know Mr. Clyburn supports removing this South  Carolinian.   On the floor, John C. Calhoun made this vile assertion that ``in few  countries is so much left to the share of the laborer, and so little  exacted from him, or more kind attention paid to him in sickness or  infirmities of age.''   What could he have been talking about?   It removes from the old Supreme Court Chamber the bust of Justice  Roger Taney. And this is because of the persistent leadership of Mr.  Hoyer, who has been on this case for a long time.   Justice Taney was the author of the Dred Scott ruling, which Mr.  Butterfield very clearly laid out as probably one of the worst  decisions of the Supreme Court ever, certainly a horrific stain on the  history of our country, and certainly on the Court.   How fitting it is that the Taney bust will be replaced with a bust of  U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, a towering champion of  equality and justice in America.   Mr. Clyburn, as well as Mr. Hoyer, has been working on this. Mr.  Hoyer is a Marylander. I am a Baltimorean. As we all know, the airport  in Baltimore is named for Thurgood Marshall. So as one who was born and  raised there, I take pride in his leadership and service to the  country.   Let us recall Justice Marshall's words spoken nearly 30 years ago but  as true today. Justice Marshall said: ``Democracy cannot flourish amid  fear. Liberty cannot bloom amid hate. Justice cannot take root amid  rage. America must get to work. In the chill climate in which we live,  we must go against the prevailing wind. We must dissent from the  indifference. We must dissent from the apathy. We must dissent from the  fear, the hatred, and the mistrust. We must dissent, because America  can do better, because America has no choice but to do better.''   How much our great Elijah Cummings reflected the words of Thurgood  Marshall, two Baltimoreans.   The Congress now has a sacred opportunity and obligation to do  better, to make meaningful change to ensure that the halls of the U.S.  Capitol reflect the highest ideals as Americans.   Mr. Hoyer, as our distinguished floor leader, had this planned for  awhile that everybody would work together and bring this composite bill  to the floor at this time. Little did we know when those plans were  being made that, at the same time, we would be mourning the loss of our  darling John Lewis. It is a death in the family for us in the Congress.  But he knew that this was in the works, and he is up there looking down  on us to make sure it happens in the most bipartisan way.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong bipartisan vote for this important step  for justice, reconciliation, and progress in America.   As far as our John Lewis is concerned: Thank you. Thank you for  bringing us to this place. May you rest in peace.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and  appreciate her calling us together for this Special Order for a very  special person.   This big picture of John Lewis was just put up here. ``Rest in  Power,'' it says. You can't see from the TV, but over here in the front  row is a big bouquet of white flowers. It is in a place where John  usually sat in the front row of a section that many of the Members of  the Congressional Black Caucus held fort, conspired sometimes, plotted,  and made progress for the American people. It is appropriate that we  have those flowers there where John sat for so many years.   Jon Meacham, who is writing a book on John Lewis, told us yesterday  on a Caucus call that when John was born, he was born into a garden. He  loved to be in the garden. He loved to be with the chicks, as we know,  the little chickens, and he loved to see things grow. He loved to see  things grow.   He lived his life in that way. He loved to see progress grow. He  loved to see love and peace grow. He loved to see ideas grow, and he  loved to see a more perfect Union grow.   Many of our colleagues will have many things to say this evening, and  because it is a Special Order, I don't have my usual 1 minute, which is  endless, so I will be briefer and save some remarks for another time.  But here is what I will say.   John has always been about nonviolence. That was his spirit in  everything that he did. He was respectful of other views and respectful  of other people. In the spirit of nonviolence, Reverend Lawson taught  that to him, to Dr. King, and the rest, and much of it was in the  spirit of Mahatma Gandhi and much of the nonviolence that he put forth.   In Sanskrit, Mahatma Gandhi's language, the word for nonviolence is  ``satyagraha.'' That word means two things: Nonviolence, and insistence  on the truth.   And John Lewis, nonviolently, always insisted on the truth. Whether  it was a lunch counter, the truth of equality, whether it was upholding  the Constitution, the truth of our Founders, in everything that he did,  it was about truth and peace and love.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record my statement, because, again, I  am not used to not having endless time as the Speaker of the House, and  I do know that our colleagues have a great deal to say.   I will say one more thing: At the end of his life, end of his time in  Washington, D.C., right before he was preparing to go back to Atlanta,  just a couple of weeks ago, in the middle of the night, he decided-- early in the morning, 4 a.m.--that he was going to go, in the morning,  to Black Lives Matter on the street.   So one of the last official or public photos that we have of John  Lewis is with the Mayor of Washington, D.C., and then alone, standing  on that beautiful tapestry, ``Black Lives Matter,'' the connection from  John, the boy from Troy, to Black Lives Matter, the future of a  movement of which he was so much a part.   May he rest in power. May he rest in peace.
