 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution.  Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress the power to  declare war.   This was not a matter of great controversy among the Founders,  because going to war is the most portentous decision that a nation can  make. And in our democracy, it is a decision to be undertaken by the  people through the Congress, and not by one person.   We are all enormously grateful that no U.S. personnel were killed in  Iran's missile strikes, and I hope that the President will take  advantage of the momentary calm to deescalate the situation.   But we cannot assume peace will hold indefinitely because of the  impulsive actions of this President which have so often brought us to  the brink of war.   Qasem Soleimani was a malign force responsible for the death of many  Americans, but after the briefings I have received, I have no  confidence that there is some broad strategy at work, or that the  policies of the President are doing anything but increasing the dangers  to the American people.   That is a recipe for disaster, one which increases the likelihood of  stumbling into a war that the American people do not want and Congress  has not authorized.   The resolution before the House today is a step toward reasserting  our constitutional duty to rein in a President whose unilateral actions  have isolated us from our allies, increased the risk of a nuclear-armed  Iran, and made us less safe.   Finally, I hope the vote today is the first of a broader reassertion  of Congress' war powers including the sunset or repeal of the 2001 and  2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force which have been stretched  beyond recognition.   It is past time for Congress to do our job and not simply write the  executive a blank check. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the resolution.
