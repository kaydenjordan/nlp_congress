 Mr. Speaker, 56 years ago, 600 peaceful protesters, led by  the late John Lewis, prepared to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge for the  right to vote. On the other side stood Sheriff Jim Clark and his armed  patrolmen ready to stop them.   The protesters marched on. Clark and his troopers put on their gas  masks, blasted the marchers with teargas, and then brutally beat them  with billy clubs and cattle prods.   Some of Clark's men mounted their horses and charged into the crowd  trampling protesters while unleashing a rebel yell. They beat John  Lewis so hard, they broke his skull. He and dozens of his fellow  marchers were hospitalized.                                time  2115    Mr. Speaker, 5 months after Bloody Sunday, Congress enacted the  Voting Rights Act. As we remember Bloody Sunday, let us also recognize  the Jim Clarks who blocked the bridge to democracy today.   Five decades after Bloody Sunday, the Supreme Court struck down the  heart of the Voting Rights Act in a decision in 2013 called Shelby. As  we commemorate our first Bloody Sunday without John Lewis, Republicans  in Georgia have passed a new law cracking down on the right to vote.   Today, as we answer John's call to cross the bridge to democracy once  again, let us hope that no Supreme Court Justices stand in our way on  the other side. If they do, may we, like our ancestors, march on.
