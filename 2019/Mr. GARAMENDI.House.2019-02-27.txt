 Mr. Speaker, yesterday the House overwhelmingly passed  the Natural Resources Management Act, including a provision sponsored  by Senator Feinstein and me that would establish California's first  National Heritage Area, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National  Heritage Area.   I want to thank my House colleagues from California, Representatives  Matsui, DeSaulnier, McNerney, Thompson, Harder, Lofgren, and Bera, for  their support as cosponsors of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta  National Heritage Area Act, H.R. 357.   I also want to thank Chairman Grijalva of the Natural Resources  Committee for bringing the bipartisan public lands bill to the floor of  the House following Senate passage earlier this month.   I sponsored this legislation to establish the Sacramento-San Joaquin  Delta National Heritage Area since 2011 along with my colleague Senator  Feinstein.   A National Heritage Area designation will help conserve the  California Delta, which I have had the great pleasure of calling my  home for the last 40 years.                                time  1015    This iconic working landscape is central to California's life and is  the most productive watershed and delta in the Western United States  and, indeed, from the coast of Alaska to Chile.   Specifically, this legislation authorizes $10 million in Federal  grants for  [[Page H2239]]  local development of cultural heritage issues, historic preservation,  and working lands conservation projects.   This Federal grant funding will be available for the next 15 years to  support local governments, historical societies, and nonprofit  organizations throughout the delta.   Our National Heritage Area Act proposal is endorsed by the Delta  Stewardship Council and the Delta Counties Coalition, consisting of  Sacramento, Solano, Contra Costa, Yolo, and San Joaquin Counties, all  of which represent the delta. It is also supported by the Delta  Chambers of Commerce and Visitors Bureau, Restore the Delta, and the  National Parks Conservation Association.   California's Delta Protection Commission is charged with developing  the management plan for the new national heritage area.   Lastly, I want to address some of the persistent misconceptions about  national heritage area designations, not only this new one but also  those throughout the United States. Such designations do not affect  individual property rights, water rights, landownership, or local land  use decisions, nor does the designation affect hunting and fishing.  Rather, the national heritage area program simply makes Federal grant  funds administered by the National Park Service available for local  projects.   The national heritage area program and planning process is  collaborative and voluntary, meaning that local groups, businesses, and  landowners can choose to participate or not. I look forward to  continuing to work with local governments, county governments, local  businesses, communities, local action groups, and all others interested  during the public management planning process.   After nearly a decade of work, the President is expected to sign the  Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area Act into law. We  thank all who supported the legislation and the local entities that  have done so.   This is truly a historic achievement for the entire delta, including  the farming communities, the families, and the immigrant communities  who have settled in the area over the last 150 years and generated the  rich cultural and agricultural heritage.                            ____________________
