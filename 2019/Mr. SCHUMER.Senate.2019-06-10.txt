 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    First, Madam President, on my way coming down to  Washington, I heard that a helicopter crashed onto the roof of a  building on Seventh Avenue in my hometown of New York City. We are  still learning the circumstances of the crash and the extent of the  damage, the injuries and casualty it may have caused. But, as all of  America saw after 9/11, the Fire Department of New York and the Police  Department of New York are truly some of the very, very best we have.  They are strong, they are brave, they are smart, and I have every faith  they will do their duty to protect New Yorkers and make sure everyone  is safe.                               Border Security    Madam President, on another subject--the border--the President  ultimately, of course, backed off his threat of tariffs against Mexico,  but really, anyone who has observed the President's foreign policy  efforts could have predicted how this would play out. It is a pretty  simple pattern. The President stakes out a maximalist position but  never clearly defines his objectives. That way, after he backs himself  into a corner, he can use a deal of any kind, even if it is merely a  fig leaf, to justify retreating from whatever misguided policy he has  threatened. Then he declares victory, having done little or nothing to  solve the underlying problem.   Well, that is exactly what happened right here. According to public  reports, the agreement President Trump reached with Mexico contains  policies negotiated months ago--nothing more than warmed-up leftovers-- and then today, after the President tweeted that we have ``a fully  signed and documented . . . Immigration and Security deal with  Mexico,'' the Mexican Foreign Minister said that no secret deal exists.  He clarified that the only agreement reached was to revisit the issue  in the future. This is the headline of the New York Times: ``No Secret  Immigration Deal Exists With U.S., Mexico's Foreign Minister Says.'' It  is amazing how this President will just make stuff up--there is an  ``L'' word here--he just makes it up, and then it is refuted.   So, to recap, in February, the President declared a bogus emergency  to build a wall he said would solve the problem. Then he made a bogus  threat to shut down the border completely, which, of course, never  materialized. Then he made a bogus threat to impose tariffs, which the  business community and Republicans in Congress rejected. And now the  President claims a bogus agreement with Mexico, which contains policies  Mexico volunteered to do months ago. Bogus, bogus, bogus.   It is no wonder our problems don't go away in this country because of  the way the President does things both on the domestic front and the  foreign policy front. What he did here is typical of the President's  game-show foreign policy: a big production without very much progress.  He generates a lot of coverage and attention around big summits, photo- ops, scare tactics, and belligerent threats, but because the President  doesn't set clear goals, because the President doesn't have a defined  strategy about how to achieve them, and because he is impatient to  always declare victory prematurely even when it doesn't occur, his  negotiations with foreign countries are ineffective.   We saw this play out in North Korea last June. The President returned  from his meeting with Chairman Kim and tweeted: ``There is no longer a  nuclear threat from North Korea.'' One year later, North Korea  continues to conduct weapons tests. We are seeing it play out now with  Mexico, which has not agreed to anything new. And I am deeply concerned  the same pattern may play out with China--perhaps the most serious of  them all.   We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform China's economic  relations with the world. But despite the President's success in  getting China to the table--and he has with the tariffs--the President  has never clearly defined what an effective agreement with China looks  like. So I am afraid that, in the end, just like he did with Mexico,  the President could retreat from his position on China in exchange for  a face-saving deal that doesn't accomplish much of anything. I hope and  pray that is not the case. I hope and pray he stands strong because the  state of the future of jobs in America, of businesses in America, and  of wealth in America is at stake.   For the sake of all of those things, I hope that, unlike this charade  with Mexico, President Trump is willing to stay the course on China and  not come up with another bogus solution that doesn't solve any problem.   One final point on this matter, and a very important point, and I  hope everyone will listen because we have talked about this in the last  week or two, but so far, the media hasn't written much about it. I hope  they will today.   President Trump tweeted this morning that Democrats have no plan to  deal with the surge of migrants at the border. That is another bogus  claim. Democrats do have a plan. We proposed it, actually, last year. I  have talked about it here on the floor of the Senate two or three times  in the last 2 weeks, and it would be far more effective at dealing with  the actual problem than what President Trump announced on Friday. Let  me outline the three things in our plan.   First, we would allow asylum seekers to apply for asylum within their  own countries.   If you are a Guatemalan, a Honduran, or an El Salvadoran, your child  is threatened with being beat up, brutalized, or killed by gangs, and  your daughter is threatened with rape, you want to leave the country.  But it is a long, dangerous trek to go across Mexico. You have to pay  the coyotes a lot of money.   Let them apply for asylum in their home countries, not at the border  with the United States.   Second, we would provide security assistance to Central American  countries to crack down on the violent gangs and the drug cartels and  the human trafficking. That is what most of these people are fleeing.  If you look at their pictures, most all of them are not criminals. They  are not gang members. They are average people seeking desperate relief.  [[Page S3278]]    What we could do to stem the tide--and it wouldn't cost that much--is  crack down on violent gangs, drug cartels, and trafficking. President  Obama began to do this, and President Trump has rescinded it. It is  logical, and it could work. These countries don't have our knowledge,  our ability, or our resources to go after these horrible gangs and  these horrible drug dealers, but we can help them. We should.   Third, here at our border, we could increase the number of  immigration judges to process the cases faster so people wouldn't have  to wait so long. Their case could be adjudicated. If they meet the  asylum requirements, fine, and if they don't, they don't get in.   Those are three commonsense solutions to the problem that President  Trump has talked about. As the President's illusory deal with Mexico  continues to unravel, as the situation doesn't get better, please-- there are Republicans on the other side of the aisle who agree with  this solution. Please, Mr. President, look at this solution. It can  work. It can be bipartisan. No, you don't get to pound the table and  make a lot of demands that won't ever affect anything, but it might get  the job done. Let's give it a shot in a bipartisan way.                              Election Security    Madam President, finally, on election security and my friend the  Republican leader's graveyard, which continues to grow, ever since the  Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives, Leader  McConnell has hardly considered legislation on the floor of the Senate.  Instead of bringing up bills passed by the House, Leader McConnell has  turned the Senate, as now widely quoted and known, into a legislative  graveyard where pretty much the only thing we debate around here is  nominations. It is frustrating not just to Democrats but to Americans.  They say: Can't we get something done for the country? And it is  frustrating, I am sure, for my Republican friends who didn't come here  just to rubberstamp nominees.   One of my biggest frustrations about Leader McConnell's legislative  graveyard is that even on the nonpartisan issues, there is virtually no  movement. Take election security. We all know--on a good day, even  President Trump agrees--the Russians interfered in our elections in  2016. That is uncontroverted. Senior intelligence officials and  Director Wray, the head of the FBI--well-regarded and appointed by the  President--issued multiple warnings that foreign powers will try to  interfere in our elections again in 2020.   We have to make sure our election systems are resilient and our cyber  defenses are up to date. There is nothing partisan about that. When a  foreign country can twist an American election one way or the other,  that eats at the wellspring of our democracy. We shouldn't allow it. So  why, when there is bipartisan legislation, is Leader McConnell just  sitting on his hands and refusing to bring it up? He is not moving any  legislation having to do with election security--Democrat, Republican,  or, best of all, bipartisan. We have multiple bipartisan bills that  would harden our election infrastructure and punish any adversary that  tries to interfere in our elections. Why will Leader McConnell not  bring them to the floor?    Now, I am certainly glad that he has agreed to my request to at least  hold a secure briefing on the risks we face in the next election. I am  looking forward to a date soon. I hope the leader will update us all on  when it might be scheduled. It should be ASAP. This is serious stuff.  The Founding Fathers were worried about foreign interference in our  elections, and in our modern digital world it has taken a new, new  dangerous turn.   But a briefing alone isn't enough. We have to take legislative  action. Democrats and Republicans, we all know, disagree on a whole lot  of issues, but surely we can all agree that nothing matters more in our  democracy than defending the integrity of our elections, and I hope  that we as a body can take bipartisan action soon.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
