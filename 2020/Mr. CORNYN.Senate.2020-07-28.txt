 Mr. President, I congratulate our friend from  Pennsylvania who has demonstrated that bipartisanship is not dead in  the U.S. Congress. In fact, I learned a long time ago that  bipartisanship, collegiality, and cooperation don't really make much  news, so people do get sort of a misimpression sometimes as to how  Congress functions. Let me just say there are plenty of people on both  sides of the aisle who are actually interested in solving some of our  Nation's biggest problems. Again, they aren't necessarily the ones you  see on cable news or grabbing the headlines, but they are doing  important work. I am proud to be part of a body that does bipartisan  work and solves problems in working together                            ____________________     Mr. President, over the weekend, as Texans continued to  battle COVID-19, those in parts of the State came to face with another  disaster at the same time. It just seems like the challenges keep  coming. First, we are in a pandemic. Then George Floyd lost his life  unnecessarily and raised our consciousness to the racial injustice that  still exists in this country. Then we had a natural disaster like a  hurricane. Hurricane Hanna made landfall in South Texas and brought  heavy rains and high winds to communities that were already grappling  with the pandemic, especially the Rio Grande Valley. On Sunday, nearly  300,000 homes were without power in South Texas, and power is still  being restored in a number of those communities. Navigating dangerous  floodwaters and downed power lines is difficult under normal  circumstances, and when you add a highly contagious virus to the mix,  as you can imagine, it presents a host of logistical challenges.   I first thank the first responders and emergency crews who have been  working overtime these last few days to get our neighbors to safety and  to restore their power as quickly as possible. There is a strong sense  of community in South Texas and the Rio Grande Valley, and I have no  doubt these communities will pull together and come out of this crisis  stronger than before.   I have been talking to a number of the leaders in several of the  counties that have been affected, and we will continue working with  them to ensure they have the resources they need to sustain their  response and recovery efforts in the short term and address those  critical infrastructure needs in the long term.   I have also heard from a number of farmers, ranchers, and  agricultural producers whose crops have been flooded, and I expect to  hear more in the coming days about how we might be helpful, especially,  again, in this already challenging time.  [[Page S4534]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, as I said, the number of COVID-19 cases  has surged in recent weeks in the Rio Grande Valley, South Texas, and  throughout the State as well. Just a couple of weeks ago, Texas  reported more than 10,000 new cases in a single day, and that happened  5 days in a row.   It certainly was a wake-up call for many who had not had taken the  most effective precautions seriously--things like social distancing,  good personal hygiene, the wearing of masks if you can't socially  distance, and staying home if you are sick. It is amazing what we can  do as individuals to stop the spread of this virus by doing those  simple things. Unfortunately, some people let their guard down and  didn't follow those protocols, so we saw a huge uptick in the number of  cases. Thankfully, though, I think the message has been received and  understood, and we have recently seen a gradual and encouraging decline  in cases.   Yet, as the war against COVID-19 wages on, we can't afford to lose  any additional ground whether from a public health perspective or from  an economic recovery perspective. So I believe it is time for Congress  to pass additional legislation to strengthen our fight. That is why my  colleagues and I introduced the HEALS Act yesterday. This legislation  builds on the significant progress we have made already in four  bipartisan bills that have already passed the Congress and have been  signed into law by President Trump that will sustain our effort to  defeat this virus and recover economically.   This legislation will ensure that workers who had the rug pulled out  from under them earlier this year will continue to receive enhanced  unemployment benefits.   It will provide funding to help K-12 schools, colleges, and  universities safely and effectively educate their students this fall  whether that means there being a combination of online or in-person  instruction   It will send additional and needed assistance to our farmers,  ranchers, and producers who are keeping our families fed in the midst  of the pandemic, and it will give States and local governments the  flexibility they have requested and that they need to use CARES Act  funding where it is needed the most.   In the coming days, I will talk more about how this legislation  supports the workers and institutions that have been hit the hardest by  this virus, but, today, I would like to focus on the ways it bolsters  our fight against the virus itself.   One of the most important ways we can do that is through testing. The  ability to identify positive cases as early as possible is the key to  stopping the spread of the virus. Yet, as we have learned, there are  massive numbers of people who have the virus who don't even know it and  don't experience any symptoms. In short, they don't even feel sick.  What we have seen, whether it be in multigenerational households or  with the people who are most vulnerable to this virus--mainly, the  elderly and the people with underlying health problems--is that they  cannot be properly isolated unless we can identify the people who are  carrying the virus even though they themselves may not be suffering any  symptoms.   The first coronavirus package we passed made testing free. It removed  the cost barrier that could prevent those who needed a test from  receiving one. At the time, if you were asymptomatic, the CDC--Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention--didn't recommend your getting a  test. Some of that was because of the constraints on the numbers of  tests that were available. The fact is, if you are not suffering from  any symptoms, you are probably not highly motivated to go get a test  because you may not even know you have the virus, and you may not know  you need one.   We are testing a lot more now than we were back then. Congress has  provided another $26 billion to scale up testing, and we have gone from  conducting an average of 145,000 tests a day nationwide in early April  to more than 780,000 per day in mid-July. So that has been a dramatic  improvement. What we know is there is more we need to do.   The HEALS Act, which we introduced yesterday, will provide an  additional $16 billion to support testing efforts. When combined with  the approximately $9 billion that still exists from the previous bills,  it will make another $25 billion available to strengthen our testing  nationwide. This will help to improve our testing strategy and capacity  and reduce the backlog that has left some Texans waiting more than 2  weeks for test results. These tests are not very useful if it takes 2  weeks to get the results.   Because we ramped up the number of people who were tested, the lab  companies that were analyzing the tests ended up getting backlogged.  Now we have taken corrective measures in cities like Dallas to make  other testing available and bring that number down, but this has been a  constant challenge. It needs to be as quick and easy as possible for  folks not only to get tests but to get the results, and this funding  helps to make sure there will be serious strides in support of that  goal.   I know there are testing protocols that are being analyzed right now  that may make this easier and may even make the results quicker. I  know, for example, in the Texas A&M University System, Chancellor Sharp  said he has contracted for 15,000 tests a month for students who will  return on campus. Now, in his view, he said those students will  probably be safer on campus than they will be back home, especially if  they end up going to bars or other social venues and do not properly  social distance or wear masks.   Beyond testing, we need additional support for the healthcare  providers who have been on the frontlines. In my State, I know the  Governor has asked a number of hospitals in the hardest hit areas to  defer elective surgeries. As I have come to learn and as the Presiding  Officer, no doubt, knows, that is how hospitals pay the bills. Many of  the people who show up either get charity care or the payment through  Medicaid or Medicare is less than that from private health insurance,  so hospitals need a mix of elective surgeries and other treatments so  they will have full insurance coverage in order to balance their books  overall.   Congress has already provided $175 billion for a healthcare provider  relief fund, which has given hospitals, clinics, and physicians the  resources they need to continue treating COVID-19 patients and stay  afloat financially. So far, more than 20,000 hospitals and healthcare  providers in my State alone have benefited from that funding, with over  $4.1 billion coming to Texas.   The HEALS Act will supplement that fund with an additional $25  billion to help these providers navigate the surge in cases and  maintain critical supplies like masks, gloves, and ventilators. If our  hospitals don't have the personal protective equipment to protect the  frontline staff, the resources to treat patients, or the funding to  keep their doors open, we will be in bad, bad shape. This legislation  will go a long way to making sure we don't ever reach that point.   In addition to supplementing the healthcare provider relief fund,  this legislation will also support some of our most critical health  resources. We know our community health centers are an important part  of the safety net when it comes to accessing healthcare. This bill will  provide $7.6 billion to our community health centers, which usually  serve people on a sliding scale based on their ability to pay. Some  people have full insurance coverage; others are covered by Medicare or  Medicaid; and some simply don't have the means to pay at all, but all  are welcome and are treated at our community health centers.   We also send $4.5 billion to mental health, suicide prevention, and  substance use disorder services. We all know that the mitigation  efforts we have all been engaged in by staying in our homes and not  leaving for a period of time, as instructed by public health and other  government officials, has exacted a very difficult toll on families,  particularly on people who have had nowhere to go to escape somebody  who has been abusing them in domestic violence scenarios or on people  who are simply feeling a sense of isolation and a challenge to their  mental health as they wonder how they are going to pay the bills and  take care of their families. Maybe they have loved ones who are in  nursing homes--the elderly are particularly vulnerable--whom they  haven't been able to see because of the isolation efforts.   And then we know people will self-medicate with alcohol or drugs. So  this  [[Page S4535]]  $4.5 billion is important to help provide the mental health, suicide  prevention, and substance use disorder services that are going to be  needed not only right now but in the indefinite future.   We also provide an additional $15 billion to the National Institutes  of Health for research and an additional $26 billion for vaccine  research.   We know our frontline healthcare providers have gotten much, much  better and saved many more lives by coming up with treatments that  actually have been effective. Some of these are common prescription  drugs that are used for other purposes that have been repurposed for  treatment of COVID-19 symptoms.   We know that convalescent plasma, taken from people who have had the  virus, who have developed immunities, when they donate blood, that  plasma can actually be used to help treat patients with serious COVID- 19 symptoms.   And we know that there are other treatments in progress, along with  the race to get a vaccine. Ultimately, we know that the vaccine is  going to be important to our ability to defeat and live with this  virus.   But in the meantime, we know we need to learn to live with this virus  in a way that protects our public health and allows us to safely reopen  our economy.   So the last thing I want to mention is liability protection. Why is  this so important?   Well, as many nonprofits or businesses think about reopening,  thinking about kids going back to school safely--whether online and  then transitioning to in person, or colleges and universities--we know  that there are going to be a lot of lawsuits filed, second guessing why  people didn't do something different, when, in fact, this pandemic has  surprised all of us in so many ways.   And what this does is provide a safe harbor from legal liability for  those individuals who followed government guidance in good faith. It  can't be the fact that you would subject a frontline healthcare worker  who had no choice but to put on personal protective equipment and go to  work to treat patients--it would be a cruel joke to say: Now we are  going to come back and file lawsuits against you and sue you for money  damages because you didn't somehow know exactly what you were dealing  with.   We know that frontline healthcare workers are performing a physically  and mentally taxing job, made only more difficult by the fact we didn't  understand exactly what we were dealing with, with this novel virus,  and we are still learning more.   Well, I learned, for example, about a rural hospital where test kits  are in short supply. In fact, it was especially true in the early days  as testing infrastructure was being stood up, and I mentioned that a  moment ago.   I learned about a hospital in a rural community outside Wichita Falls  that only had 12 tests available. Because of limited resources, a  physician made the difficult decision not to test an ER patient for  COVID-19 because the patient didn't meet the criteria set out by the  Centers for Disease Control. The following day, that same patient went  to Wichita Falls and received a test, and several days later found out  that they tested positive.   Now, imagine you are that physician. You followed the CDC guidelines  for testing; you tried to conserve the limited resources available in  your community; but there is nothing stopping the patient from heading  to the nearest lawyer's office and filing a lawsuit against you for  somehow refusing them a test.   All of a sudden, you are scrambling to defend yourself in a lawsuit  that, quite frankly, should not have been filed in the first place.   But I have spent enough time in courtrooms to know that many times  lawsuits are not filed with the goal of actually prevailing on the  merits; they are filed in order to gain a settlement because the cost  of defending yourself can be large, indeed. And, in fact, if you are a  business that has been hanging on by a thread, just the threat of that  kind of litigation and the expense and energy it takes to defend that  case, even though it lacks merit, could well cause you to throw in the  towel or put you out of business.   So we have introduced, as part of this HEALS Act, legislation that  will provide that safe harbor. It will not provide blanket immunity; it  will not protect against intentional or reckless misconduct; but it  would establish clear guardrails like those in a number of States. As a  matter of fact, 30 different States have passed similar protections for  their healthcare workers. Other States have done it in other  categories, but it is important, I believe, for us to provide clear  authority so people know what they are dealing with.   I would note, for example, that some of these same guardrails are  very similar to those enacted by Executive order in the minority  leader's home State of New York. I know the legislature has now sent  Governor Cuomo another bill, basically, with the same framework, and he  has not yet made a decision to sign that.   But overall the HEALS Act will help provide the resources Texas  hospitals, clinics, and healthcare providers need to sustain and win  this fight, while protecting our heroic healthcare workers from a  second epidemic in the courtroom.   So I hope both sides of the aisle will work together, as we have in  the past on COVID-19 response legislation, and make sure we can get a  bill to the President's desk on a timely basis that delivers these and  other necessary changes at a critical time for our country   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
