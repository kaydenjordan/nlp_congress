 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce a  new internship program my district office has started. My program is  designed to help individuals who are in long-term substance abuse  recovery meet their programming requirements of obtaining job-readiness  skills.   Along with the bills we are passing this week to fight the opioid  epidemic, my office has partnered with Recovery Point in Charleston,  West Virginia, to help those who have decided to get their lives back  on track.   West Virginia has been ground zero of the drug epidemic, and it is  important to support the important crucial recovery programs that are  changing the lives of so many of our people who have fallen on hard  times. This internship opportunity will help to prepare these  individuals to reenter the workforce.   It is important to lead by example and help those who have decided to  turn their lives around. I encourage all of my colleagues in Congress  to partner with recovery programs in their districts to create similar  opportunities for recovering addicts. The interns in my Charleston  office have already made a positive impact and are a great addition to  our team                            ____________________
