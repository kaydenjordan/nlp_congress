 Madam President, today, I rise to recognize  Mrs. Julia ``Julie'' Rita Ursone, a longtime Connecticut resident who  turns 100 on January 8, 2022.   Born in Providence, RI, Mrs. Ursone was the child of Italian  immigrants who became U.S. citizens. She moved to Stamford, CT, in  1947, where she has lived ever since.   Mrs. Ursone grew up during the Great Depression and readily supported  American efforts during World War II through factory work.   To this day, she still lives in the house she built in 1951 with her  late husband, who served in World War II and was an active member of  their community. Passionate about doing her part in support of our  Nation, Mrs. Ursone remains an active voter.   I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Mrs. Julia  Ursone, her son Lou, and the rest of her family on this milestone of  her 100th birthday.                            ____________________
