 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the HEROES Act.   The bill confronts the unprecedented pandemic that we are facing by  first directing significant funding to State and local governments.  Without this funding, they will have to make devastating cuts,  especially in education, public safety, and basic services.   Then it funds education to address the unique challenges created by  the pandemic. K-12 funding would be available for technology, summer  programs, special education, and initiatives to reduce the achievement  gaps. It funds higher education to support students and maintain their  institutions. It provides relief for student loans, continuing the  present relief from payments, as well as interest accrual, and  extending that relief to virtually all student loans, both Federal and  private. That relief goes to virtually all student loans. Then we  target additional relief to students most in need of relief.   Mr. Speaker, this bill supports families by continuing the enhanced  and expanded unemployment benefits, increasing SNAP benefits, and  delivering another round of stimulus checks. It also protects  healthcare insurance, so that under this bill, when you lose your job,  you do not have to lose your health insurance.   The bill helps contain the pandemic by funding contact tracers so  that those who have been in contact with those who test positive can be  identified and they can isolate themselves.   Finally, the bill makes our workplace safer by requiring OSHA to  promulgate and enforce clear standards to protect workers from COVID- 19.   For our front-line workers, it authorizes premium pay for their  heroic work.   This bill is a necessary response to today's health crisis. It  enables workers and families to survive the pandemic.   If States don't get this money, the public will be inflicted with  drastic cuts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.
