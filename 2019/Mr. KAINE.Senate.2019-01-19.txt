 Madam President, in the last 2 days, I have stood on this  floor and asked that the American Government reopen. On Thursday, I  asked unanimous consent to proceed to the bipartisan House bill funding  most shuttered government Agencies through the end of this fiscal year.  The majority leader objected to my request.   Yesterday, I asked unanimous consent to proceed to the bipartisan  House bill funding Homeland Security Agencies through February 8. The  junior Senator from Oklahoma, on behalf of the majority leader,  objected to my request.   So today marks the 29th day of the government shutdown--29 days of  fiscal pain and mental anxiety and national humiliation; 29 days of  families worried about mortgage payments, canceling medical  appointments, losing their place at a favored daycare that they can no  longer afford to pay for; 29 days of being required to travel to work  without being paid and without even receiving money to put gas in your  car to get to work; 29 days of being unable to add your newborn child  to your Federal health insurance policy; 29 days of being turned away  from  [[Page S308]]  services like food stamps or National Parks or affordable housing  programs or domestic violence services; 29 days of chemical spills not  being investigated or food products not being inspected; 29 days of our  veterans who serve as Federal employees or Federal contractors  suffering as political pawns in an unnecessary stunt; 29 days of seeing  the country you love cease to be an example to others.   If a foreign adversary--if a foreign adversary--through an active  attack or cyber attack disabled major portions of the American  Government pushing 800,000 Federal employees to the brink of financial  disaster and blocking millions of Americans from accessing government  services critical to their lives--if a foreign adversary did that, make  no mistake, we would consider it an act of war.   If a foreign adversary figured out a way to block border guards, U.S.  marshals, Coast Guard members, DEA agents, ATF agents, FBI agents, TSA  agents, and air traffic controllers from being paid to intentionally  hurt those whom we charge with protecting our safety and security, we  would consider it an attack on our country.   If a foreign adversary took these steps to embarrass and humiliate  us, to bring much of the Nation to a halt, to divide us against one  another, we would consider it an attack on our country.   But these acts are not being conducted by a foreign adversary. They  are being intentionally waged against American workers and American  citizens by the President of the United States. He advertised in  December that he would shut down the government and gladly own the  responsibility for it. He has claimed pride--pride--in what he has done  and suggested that he might keep government shut down for weeks or  months. It is this President who is waging this attack against broad  swaths of the American public.   I think you are aware of this: I have long criticized the tendency of  Congress to allow Presidents of either party to wage war without  requiring congressional approval. I criticized President Obama for  unilateral military action in Libya, Iraq, and Syria, and I have  criticized President Trump for unilateral military action in Syria and  Yemen. But I have reserved my toughest criticisms in this matter for  Congress. How can we be silent when a President chooses to initiate  war, sending our troops into harm's way, without a congressional vote?  How can we be silent when the President takes such an action without a  congressional vote?   Today, I am critical of this Senate--a body I love, with 99 other  colleagues I love. I am critical of this Senate for allowing this  President to wage this attack against American workers and citizens  without being willing to hold a vote about it.   Just a few weeks ago, this body was very willing to vote for funding  the very Agencies that are shuttered today. Democratic and Republican  Members decided that such a vote was in the interest of their country,  their own States, and their own constituents. But following the vote,  the President expressed his disappointment in the vote, so the vast  majority of colleagues in the majority, with notable exceptions,  obviously have changed their position from December and are now  unwilling to vote.   The House bills that are pending at the desk would reopen government,  and I find it truly outrageous that the majority is not yet willing to  hold a vote on those bills. Just as Congress abdicates its clear  responsibility constitutionally by refusing to hold a vote on the  initiation of war, I believe that the Senate is now abdicating its  clear responsibility to appropriate funds for government by refusing to  even entertain a vote on the bipartisan spending bills that are before  us.   Let's be clear about this. If we were to proceed to those bills,  every Member in this Chamber would be required to vote either for or  against government funding in the previously agreed amounts. We all  would be held accountable for either voting for funding or against  funding. It is this accountability--or, rather, the fear of being held  accountable--for a vote that is blocking consideration of these bills.   The majority--again, with notable exceptions, including the Presiding  Officer and another Senator who will be here today--are afraid to vote.  If they vote for funding, as they did a month ago, they are worried  that they will make the President angry. But if they vote against  funding, they are worried that their own constituents will be angry.   The fear of voting and being held accountable even extends to the  floor session--the unusual floor session--that we are holding right  now. At the end of the day on Thursday, I made good on my promise to  object to adjourning the Senate while the government was closed. Of  course, my objection, which I had lodged earlier in the week and on  which I acted on Thursday, can be overcome. My objection to the recess  that we were supposed to have can be overcome by a simple majority of  the body. But, just as occurred last week, the majority was afraid to  challenge my objection because it would have meant that they would have  had to vote on whether to adjourn.   This shutdown--this attack on American workers and citizens--can end  if the Senate is just willing to vote on the pending bills. But the  fear of being held accountable, the fear of political consequence, is  so great that the majority strategy currently is to avoid any vote  whatsoever.   What is the fear of voting compared to the fear of losing your home?  What is the fear of voting compared to the fear of not having health  insurance? What is the fear of voting compared to the pain of letting  your trusted babysitter go or the humiliation of your children coming  to you with their piggy banks to help you overcome your family's  financial distress?   Can it be that one works so hard to come to this respected place,  taking an oath to protect and defend the Constitution against all  enemies foreign and domestic, but then lets fear of accountability and  political consequence become the overriding factor in one's decisions?  That politics would motivate us all is no surprise but that it would so  dominate the action--or, rather, inaction--of this body when the  government of our Nation is closed is shocking to me. I am not young  and I am not naive, but I never would have imagined in coming to this  body that the Senate in the Article I branch of this democracy would  take the position that we can't vote on any matter unless we know the  President agrees.   I hope my colleagues will raise their voices and demand a vote on the  pending bipartisan House bills. If we vote and the bills fail, we will  have to go back to the drawing board, but I think we all know what will  happen if we vote on those bills. If we vote on the House bills, the  House bills will pass. The majority currently is withholding a vote,  aware that if the vote happens, the bills will pass.   So on day 29, as the Senate seeks to avoid a vote and avoid  accountability, my constituents--and all of our constituents--continue  to suffer.   Heidi from Vienna wrote me:         My husband and I are both veterans and current federal       employees without pay.    They are both veterans and both Federal employees without pay.         [W]e are at a breaking point. We haven't paid our mortgage,       and our pediatrician donates medication to our children.        After a life of dedicated public service in support of my       country, I never expected to find myself in this position.       It's a breach of trust.    Sarah from Ashburn:         My husband and I are both federal law enforcement and have       been working without pay during the shutdown. We have three       young children and continue to not only have bills to pay,       but childcare expenses to pay so we can continue to work       without pay. We haven't had to borrow money yet, but soon we       will have to take a good look at what our options are. We       have cut back on all expenses, no eating out, no purchasing       anything other than food and gas, no registering for spring       sports or after school programs, no buying Girl Scout cookies       or anything else extra. We don't want to get our margin of       cash so low that we will have to use credit. We have been       trying very hard to get out of debt--and credit is a last       resort for us. We will be dipping into our emergency fund       soon. I have worked for the federal government for 21 years,       and I am very frustrated.    John from Fairfax Station:         My son is one of hundreds of thousands of federal       contractor employees who have been essentially furloughed       from their consulting jobs and forced to use 2019 Annual       Leave (exhausted last week) and pay for lapsed health       insurance because the federal agency that he works for has       been closed by the Government Shutdown. If the Shutdown is       not ended  [[Page S309]]       soon, my son's firm will have to start laying off staff to       offset millions of dollars in losses due to the federal work       stoppage. This is the unpublicized nightmare of the shutdown       . . . . hundreds of thousands of federal contractors may lose       their jobs because Trump is holding federal workers (and       their contractors) hostage for his ineffective wall.    Theresa from Middletown:         I have been a public servant for 30+ years and you are       using me and my family as pawns in a game no one can win. . .       . I've dedicated my life to serving the American people and       this is how you treat me?        I've had to go from giving food to the local pantries to       wondering when I will be the one visiting these same       pantries. My child is stressed because he doesn't know when       he may be hungry, when we may be homeless, or when we will       have to start selling things off--he literally has unopened       Christmas gifts he won't open because he's afraid we'll need       to return them to buy food. All for a . . . wall! That wall       won't clothe, house or feed my family. God help us all!    Elizabeth from Pound, which is in Appalachia, VA:         Mr. President, I write to you as the wife of a Federal       Corrections Officer at USP Lee. I urge you to help find a       solution for the numerous people, like my family, who are       getting ready to have our worlds crumble. On this Saturday,       my family will not receive the paycheck my husband has earned       for the past weeks. The stress that this is causing myself       and my husband is compounding. We do not know how we are       going to pay our bills, much less feed our children. He       cannot even attempt to get a temporary job in the meantime       because he is still having to go to his . . . job. My       family's lives are being used as pawns in a political war. We       are a typical working family in a rural area who live       paycheck to paycheck. We pay our bills and taxes and have       good credit and all of this is being jeopardized at no fault       of our own. I cannot imagine going to my daughter's dance       teacher and saying please continue to provide her with       classes and we will pay you eventually, or the power company       and saying please keep our lights and heat on and we will pay       you eventually, etc. We do not know when that will be but       ``eventually''. . . . SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE TO FIX THIS!    Jacquelyn from Manassas:         I am an FAA 35 years of service federal excepted and       essential employee.    This is an interesting one.         December 23, 2018, would have been my reporting date to a       new facility closer to my elderly mother to assist in her       home care. I have broken my lease at my current residence and       obtained an apartment at the new station [near my mom], which       I can't move to until after this ``Shutdown.'' The       ``Shutdown'' has placed my career and life in limbo. My 81       year old Mother is anticipating my aid in her health and       medical care. The financial burden of my Mother not receiving       the biweekly allotment I provide has caused undue stress on       her and myself. The urgency of my moving closer to her is       time critical [for both her health and my finances].    Carolanne from Fairfax:         We are stationed in Australia--    Her husband is a Federal employee, stationed overseas--       far from family and friends, with limited employment options       for myself as the spouse. And now we find ourselves without a       paycheck. And still liable for paying our mortgage on our       home in Fairfax City. And liable for paying all medical       expenses out of pocket, including my son's surgery two weeks       before Christmas . . . . It's not a game.    Gracie from Woodbridge:         I am writing you now asking for your help. I've been a       loyal Federal government employee for . . . 16 years,       receiving \1/3\-\1/4\ of what I could make in the private       sector with little or no thanks from anyone. My husband, a       veteran, was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer in June       2015 at the age of 35 and has been receiving treatment since,       which is adding to our debt. We have two young children who       each require the basics, of course, and who are involved in       sports, something we want to encourage. We have a mortgage       payment, car payments, other debt, and student loan debt,       which we will likely still be paying when our children go to       college. And we have not been able to save for their college       because we're still paying mine off. . . . All this adds salt       to the wound of also being a furloughed employee. I know I am       not alone but we are being held hostage for political       purposes. So I'm not receiving any pay right now and the       Department of Education is somehow calculating that I should       be able to pay $600/a month [for my loans]. I do not like       asking for help. I was raised to be very independent and pull       myself up from my bootstraps.    Sara from Fredericksburg:         I am a mother of 2 and a wife to an FBI employee. We are       now approaching the end of week 4 of the shutdown and there       is no end in sight. By the end of this month our accounts       will be almost empty. We have had to have the hard       conversation with our children about the lack of funds and       making cuts in order to pay our bills and cost of medication.       My son has asthma and a blood pressure disorder, which both       can be life threatening. He is on medication to treat his       conditions, but if the government doesn't open and our sole       provider does not receive his pay, how are we supposed to       fulfill our responsibilities as parents in keeping our kids       safe and healthy?    Finally, Christopher from Leesburg shared this on my Facebook page:         I'm a federal employee who used the last of his       discretionary funds today to attend my grandfather's funeral,       my second funeral in a month, and repair our vehicle so that       we could make it home to our kids from hours away. Now I'm       preparing to file for unemployment, my wife is going to have       to try to get a job despite her severe and crippling anxiety,       and we've had to return some of the Christmas presents [that       we bought] for ourselves, our four-year-old son, and our six-      year-old daughter. Now we have to figure out what to do next       because our car is still in need of major repair, we need to       buy food for our daughter's lunchbox for kindergarten each       day, and afford family meals and gas. We've always lived       paycheck to paycheck because of the high cost of living in       northern Virginia and we don't have the option to take out       loans because we incurred so much debt moving to the area and       dealing with my wife's medical bills. . . . I gave up       military service to join the civil service and have been so       disheartened to see the lack of respect for federal       employees.    This is just a sample, and I know every Senator in this body is  receiving these. Per capita, I may receive more because I represent  Virginia, but only 20 percent of our Federal employees are in the DC- Maryland-Virginia area, and 80 percent are all over the country. These  stories are common. We are getting them in the dozens and scores every  day.   I return to a request, and I am speaking to the choir as I address  this Presider because I know we largely share the views that I have  expressed.   We stand for office. We work hard to get here. We are elected, and it  is a privilege to be here. The thing we are supposed to do in being  here is to be willing to vote yes or no and be held accountable for our  votes.   The fact that these bills that would end the pain that I have just  read to you about are sitting right there on the desk and could be  voted on immediately if the majority agreed but that maneuvers are  being used to block the vote from happening is, in some ways, the most  discouraging aspect of this.   With confidence, I am aware that if the bills were called and voted  on, we would vote for them, and government could reopen immediately. I  would encourage my colleagues to abate and end the pain that I have  just described and hold that vote.   With that, I yield the floor.
