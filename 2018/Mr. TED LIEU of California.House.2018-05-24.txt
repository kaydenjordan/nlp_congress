 Mr. Speaker, I am here with Congressman  Ruben Gallego. I would like to talk about national security and how the  President of the United States may be inadvertently giving away  classified information.   The President, through public reporting, shows that he is unwilling  to swap out his cell phones. There is a big problem with this.   Last term, I was involved with this flaw called the SS7 flaw. It is  something that allows foreign powers and criminal syndicates affiliated  with foreign powers to listen in on your cell phone just knowing your  cell phone number, and there is no real good way to stop it. Our  concern is that if the President finds it too inconvenient to deal with  this issue of his cell phones, then his conversations could be listened  in on by other foreign nations or by criminal syndicates.   We also find this somewhat ironic and hypocritical when the  Republican-  [[Page H4727]]  controlled Congress, last term, went to great lengths to talk about the  potential damage of having a private email server for Secretary of  State Hillary Clinton. This is a very similar concept. These are cell  phones from which foreign powers can get the actual conversations of  the President of the United States.   We just want the White House, the Secret Service, and other agencies  to talk to the President and say: Look, you just have to deal with  operational security. You are their most highly-valued target in terms  of intelligence information that foreign powers want; and, please, for  our national security, swap out your cell phones.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Gallego  for his comments.   Both of us served Active Duty in the United States military-- Congressman Gallego served in combat--and we both know that one of the  most important things to our military is operational security and  protecting our communications and making sure that they are secure.                                time  1115    Donald Trump is the Commander in Chief of our military. If there is  anyone that needs to have their communications secure, it has got to be  our Commander in Chief.   Unfortunately, the President and the Republicans here that enable him  are allowing him to have unsecured communications. That is really going  to be harmful to our national security.   This is not some sort of theoretical flaw that exists. The Federal  Communications Commission has issued a report saying that this flaw  where foreign powers can listen in on our cell phone communications is  real, it exists.   People have used it not just to listen in, but also to do nefarious  things. A bank earlier this year lost millions of dollars because of  this flaw.   So, again, we urge the President and the Republicans here to change  the President's behavior, to do oversight on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to conclude this segment. I thank you for  listening.   I yield back the balance of my time.
