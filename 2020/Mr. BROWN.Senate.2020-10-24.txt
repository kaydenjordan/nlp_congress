 Will the Democratic leader yield?    I hear Senator Johnson talk about employers can't find  workers. There are 600,000 in my State who lost their unemployment  insurance just like that at the end of July. Six hundred thousand  people lost $600 a week.   I go back to March, when we passed this bill that was so important it  passed unanimously. There was one amendment Republicans wanted for this  $2.5 trillion bill. It was to strip out unemployment insurance so that  those workers didn't get the $600 a week. What are they to live on? Six  hundred thousand people in my State can't find work, 100,000 in  Wisconsin, even more in New York, tens of thousands in Iowa and Utah.  What are they to do?   We know there is going to be a wave of evictions and foreclosures as  people are thrown out of their apartments and their homes.   This Congress continues to--the Senate just won't do its job. Do your  job. If Senator McConnell would do his job, we could do our job and get  this economy back on track.   Thank you.    Mr. President, that sounded really good.   Senator Grassley knows, of course, she was a good witness. Of course,  she didn't take positions. Of course, she said she made no promises. Of  course, Judge Barrett said she was openminded. Cut through it all. I am  not a lawyer, and I don't serve on the Judiciary Committee. I don't  think Senator Grassley is a lawyer, but I am not really sure. Maybe he  is. I might be mistaken, and I apologize if he is.   Yet we all know why she was nominated. President Trump said why she  was nominated. President Trump has been very explicit in saying that he  wants a judge who will overturn the Affordable Care Act and that he  wants her there quickly because the Affordable Care Act hearings begin  soon after the election. He wants a judge who will undermine women's  rights to make their own decisions about their own healthcare. He is  putting her on because he knows she will oppose workers' rights. He is  putting her on because he knows she will oppose marriage equality. He  also wants her on quickly because he said: I want her there when the  election is contested after the election.   So, of course, Senator McConnell always does the bidding. Senator  McConnell comes out of his office. I assume he gets many of his  marching orders from the President of the United States. He comes down  here, and 51 spineless Senators--and then there is the Senator sitting  in the Presiding Officer's chair, and I appreciate his courage--do  whatever the President tells McConnell to tell them on issue after  issue after issue. I mean, that is the way this place works. That is  the corruption of this place. The President of the United States has  said: I want her confirmed now because I want her there to decide the  election that I am going to be involved in, and I want her there now so  she can overturn the Affordable Care Act.   Of course, Judge Barrett said to the committee: Well, I have made no  promises. I have made no commitments. I have not cut deals with  anybody. Of course, she says that, but the fact is that this is why the  President nominated her. We know that.   As a result, in my State, I know what the Affordable Care Act has  done for the last decade. There are 900,000 people who have insurance  who didn't have insurance before the Affordable Care Act. More than  100,000 people under the age of 26 have been able to get health  insurance because they have been able to stay on their parents'  healthcare plans. There are a million seniors in Ohio who have gotten  free preventive care--screenings for osteoporosis, physicals. More than  100,000 Ohio seniors have saved an average of $1,100 on their  prescription drugs because of the Affordable Care Act. Maybe, most  importantly, 5 million Ohioans have preexisting conditions. This was  before the coronavirus. Now that number is higher. There are 5 million  Ohioans who have had their preexisting conditions covered over the last  decade. Why? Because of the Affordable Care Act, those people with  preexisting conditions have been protected. Insurance companies can't  raise their rates because of preexisting conditions, and they can't  cancel their insurance because of their preexisting conditions. Those  will be gone. The protections for preexisting conditions will be gone  if the Affordable Care Act is gone. Protections for people under 26-- their staying on their parents' plans--will be gone if the Affordable  Care Act is overturned by the Supreme Court.   Now, they couldn't do it democratically. They couldn't do it because  the citizens of this country didn't want it repealed. So President  Trump has gone to the courts to legislate so they can overturn it. We  know all of that.   That is why the comments of my friend from Iowa are just  disingenuous. He knows that. Of course, she didn't sit in front of the  committee and say: Yes, I made a deal. Of course, she didn't sit in  front of those on the committee and say: I have strong feelings about  the Affordable Care Act and gay rights and women's health. She is not  going to say that. I am not a lawyer, but I know enough to know that  she is not going to go to the committee and say that.   We know what it is about. It is about repealing the Affordable Care  Act. It is about taking rights away from LGBTQ citizens in this  country. It is about taking rights away from women. Maybe it is also  about fixing the election. Deep down, the President and Senator  McConnell know they are not  [[Page S6434]]  going to win the election this year, so they want that ninth vote in  the Court just in case the President brings a lawsuit. If it ends up in  the Supreme Court, he and the Republicans will have appointed six of  the nine Justices. That is the game in town. That is what we know is  rigged.   So many millions of Americans are frustrated and angry with the way  the President has failed the country during this pandemic. We know we  have 4 percent of the world's population but that 22 percent of the  deaths in the world are of Americans. It is not because we don't have  good doctors in Utah or in Wisconsin or in Ohio; it is because of  terrible Presidential leadership.   President Trump and Senator McConnell have essentially left the  country to fend for itself during this pandemic. The stock market is  up, so Trump and McConnell seem to think everything is fine. The stock  market is up. What the heck? They are oblivious to the families staring  at stacks of bills. They are oblivious to the small businesses that are  watching years and, in some cases, often decades of hard work and  investment--or they are family businesses going back many, many  decades--evaporate in a few short minutes, but the stock market is up,  so Trump and McConnell seem to think everything is fine.   It is the same story over and over again. Corporate lobbyists, their  allies in Washington do whatever it takes to make sure Wall Street  recovers, and then they say: Oh, no, we really can't afford to help  anyone else.   I hear from small, family-owned businesses all the time, how they are  struggling. They are under incredible stress. They are worried about  whether they can make rent or make payroll. They have waited on the  phone for hours and couldn't get answers about loans. These folks  aren't lounging in a C-suite corner office. They don't have high-priced  lawyers and accountants who can do all the paperwork. They don't have  the lobbyists who line up outside Mitch McConnell's office helping  them. They are fighting for their dreams.   We know why they are struggling. We know why some of them still can't  open their doors 7 months--7 months--into this crisis because the  President and this Senate have so botched this crisis.   Again, 4 percent of the world's population, 22 percent of the world's  deaths, and the President said: I take no responsibility. The President  said: Not my fault. The President said: I get a 10 out of 10 for how I  have managed this.   President Trump has no plan, never has, to control the virus. He has  not even tried. Imagine if President Trump, back in March, instead of  lying to the American people--he knew how serious it was. He told his  Wall Street friends, and he told that reporter from the Post. I can't  remember his name. He told them it was serious, but he didn't tell the  American people. He lied to us.   Imagine, instead, if the President had worn a mask and stood up and  treated us like adults and said to the American public: You know, this  is really serious. This could turn from an epidemic into a pandemic. We  have to fight back. I am wearing a mask. I ask every American to wear a  mask, just like we ask people to wear seat belts and stop at stop  signs. I want every American to wear a mask. I want people to socially  distance so we can get this--but he didn't do any of that. Of course he  didn't do any of that.   And he also came up with no national testing, contact tracing  strategy. He didn't invoke the Defense Production Act so that we could  make cotton swabs and gloves and masks and gowns and all the things we  needed to do to stay safe. He had none of that.   He has no guidance on how businesses are supposed to protect their  customers, no investment of our vast resources to help them do it.   And we see the results. We saw them in April and May, in June and  July, in August, in September, and now October. In fact, in my State,  as in many States, there are more coronavirus diagnoses every day-- almost every day--than there were a month ago, 2 months ago, 6 months  ago.   Local restaurants are closed for good. The big chains may recover.  Communities that already didn't get a lot of investment--Brown and  Black neighborhoods, rural communities, places you can't see from Trump  Tower--those places are seeing their homegrown businesses shut their  doors and lay off workers.   Black-owned businesses have closed at twice the rate of White-owned  businesses. We know Latino- and Asian-owned businesses are getting  disproportionately hurt.   Our office hears from so many of these Ohio businesses. We have done  a series of virtual roundtables with Ohio restaurants.   One Ohioan in Zanesville talked about taking over the family business  his dad first started 67 years ago. Business is down significantly. He  tries to pay his employees a living wage and give them time off for  vacations and family needs. He is a really good employer. He is afraid  of letting his employees down.   Another, a bar owner in Bellefontaine, told us his sales are down and  he is worried about his own businesses. When he wrote to me, he didn't  just talk about himself. He said that he is worried about the ripple  effects on the farmers and suppliers, the truckdrivers, and so many  others.   Now he is dreading the winter, when he won't even be able to use the  patio. He wonders what he is going to do, what the suppliers are going  to do.   And it is not just restaurants. The media reported on a newsstand in  downtown Cleveland, owned by Mr. Patel, an Indian immigrant who came to  Ohio and has lived the American Dream. He built a better life, started  his own business, was employing other Clevelanders. Now the office  building is empty. The food court is closed. His sales have dropped  from $700 a day to just $200 a day. He is looking at impossible choices  unless the government helps.   We know we can. We did it in the spring when we passed payroll  protection. There were all kinds of implementation problems. The  Secretary of the Treasury and the President seemed more interested in  the big guys than the little guys. Too many businesses went to the  front of the line, but despite all that, we hear from businesses that  are open today only because of PPP.   I heard from Spangler Candy in Bryan, OH, a family-owned union  company. I have toured their plant and seen the great work this, I  believe, fourth generation management team has done.   They have seen business drop 70 percent. They had to take their first  Federal support in their 114-year history, using PPP to prevent  layoffs. They kept their doors open, and they provided pandemic premium  pay for their Teamster employees.   A music and arts venue in Youngstown, the Westside Bowl, talked at  one roundtable about how they how had zero dollars in revenue in the  past 6 months. PPP kept their office staff and stagehands on payroll,  but as it runs out, so will their ability to pay employees.   Ohio Star Forge, a parts manufacturer in Warren, just north of  Youngstown, represented by the Steelworkers, lost 90 percent of their  business when auto plants shut down. PPP made a difference. They are  now back to about 70 percent of their capacity.   Polter's Berry Farm is a family farm in Fremont. One of their crops  is pumpkins. The major pumpkin buyers are amusement parks and fall  festivals. Pumpkin sales were down. PPP was helpful, but now they are  worried about whether they can repay it.   A+ Cleaners in Dayton has seen demand plummet. People don't need much  dry cleaning when they are working from home. They were able to stay  open with an EIDL loan and a CARES Act grant from the county. They are  terrified of what happens when the money runs out.   We have a bill to get more help to these businesses--the Small  Business Lifeline Act. It would extend PPP through at least next  spring. It would get more funding to the program so they can get more  money out the door to these businesses. It would specifically target  help to the truly small businesses that need it the most, including  minority-owned businesses. It would extend the debt relief program. It  would get help to nonprofits that we know are hurting just like  businesses are.    As important as these steps are, we can't just give businesses loans  and think that will take care of it when the  [[Page S6435]]  virus is still raging and the customers don't have jobs.   That is why we need a comprehensive bill that actually meets the  magnitude of this crisis. This visceral, decades-long opposition from  my colleagues to unemployment insurance--I don't know how they don't  realize that when 600,000 Ohioans are getting $600 a week, they are  spending that money at local businesses. They are keeping the economy  going from just a total crevasse. They are helping the economy. They  are helping local businesses. They are giving those businesses revenue,  but when the $600 just stops, not only are those 600,000 Ohioans' lives  just so, so difficult, but it makes the businesses of which they are  patrons, the businesses that they patronize--it obviously hurts them at  their bottom line.   I think the stories from these businesses really get to the  fundamental question of what sort of country we want to live in. When  we invest in small business, we invest in people and communities, not  stock buybacks, not executive bonuses.   I know that Senator McConnell and his colleagues here always are  looking out for the stock market, always are looking out for Wall  Street, always want to hear about stock buybacks and executive bonuses.  I know that is their thing. But during a pandemic, I wish it were less  their thing.   The stakeholders in these businesses are not nameless, faceless  shareholders. They are the owners' neighbors. They are family members.  They are the people we see or used to see at our kids' schools, in the  grocery store, and at church.   A year from now, do we want to be left with only the biggest  companies that follow the Wall Street business model that treats  workers as expendable?   Ohioans know all too well what happens when you let Wall Street run  things and you ignore Main Street. Our communities have watched for  decades as factories closed and investment dried up and storefronts  were boarded over in towns and cities that once were thriving.   When people in those towns wake up, they realize the only jobs you  can get are at a big-box chain for rock-bottom wages with no  healthcare, no paid sick leave, no power over your schedule. Is that  what we want for our future?   We have the resources to fix this. We are the greatest, richest  country in the world. Let's rise to meet the moment. Let's pass a  comprehensive bill that gets help to our businesses, our workers, and  their customers. And let's get the communities the support they need.   Mr. President, in order to proceed to the consideration of H.R. 986,  the Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act, which the  House passed with bipartisan support, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative business.    Mr. President, before offering another unanimous consent,  I just point out there were 10 years of protections for people with  preexisting conditions under ObamaCare and 10 years of speeches from  Republicans about repeal and replace, with no real proposal to replace  the Affordable Care Act. The President has promised it about every  couple of weeks through 4 years, and he still hasn't put a real bill  forward.                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1230    Mr. President, in order to proceed to the consideration of H.R. 1230,  Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act, which passed the  House with bipartisan support, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, in order to proceed to consideration of  H.R.  [[Page S6436]]  1759, BRIDGE for Workers Act, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I guess I am not surprised about that,  considering I hear my colleagues talk about how outrageous it is that  we were spending $600 a week to help unemployed workers, and this  bipartisan bill that passed the House would help workers to get  retrained and get jobs, and they are not willing to do that either, but  we also know that this is a bill that--we have seen this act before.                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3659    Mr. President, in order to proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3659,  Danny's Law, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  legislative session.    Mr. President, in order to proceed to the consideration of  H.R. 4029, Tribal Access to Homeless Assistance Act, I ask that the  Senate proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, in order to proceed to the consideration of  H.R. 5084, Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity Act,  legislation to require corporations to disclose--just disclose the  racial, ethnic, and gender composition of their boards, which again  passed the House with bipartisan support, I ask unanimous consent that  the Senate proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I will hold the floor for just another few  moments.   I have watched Senator McConnell--and I am sorry to call some of my  colleagues spineless, Senator Johnson, but, you know, when the  President made comments about our soldiers who had died in battle, I  didn't hear hardly any Republicans speak up. I admire the courage of  the Presiding Officer. I admire Senator Murkowski and her courage over  a number of things. But I see my colleagues--I hear what you all think.  I know what Senator Sasse said during that townhall. I know many of  you, if not most of you, maybe all of you--probably not--think that  about the President's lack of integrity and lack of character and  dishonesty and the lies he tells. And I know, I have watched, and I sat  right here and I looked across the aisle during impeachment and I saw  the look of fear in my colleagues' eyes because they didn't want to  cross the President; they didn't want to get the President to tweet  about them or even get a primary opponent to them. That is why I use  that term, but more importantly to the citizens of this country, we  spent most of the last month after month after month after month,  confirming very conservative, very young judges. I understand why you  want to do that, but we are not doing anything for the public.   We had a high moment in March when Senator Johnson said we  unanimously approved the CARES Act. A study shows the CARES Act kept 12  million Americans out of poverty. But then we ask to continue the CARES  Act and do something similar like the Heroes Act, and instead Senator  McConnell--and I know the lobbyists that line up in front of his door,  I know they have a lot of influence on him, but we saw Senator  McConnell say: no urgency, no urgency.   My favorite Abraham Lincoln quote is Lincoln wanted to--his staff  wanted him to stay in the White House and win the war and abolish  slavery and protect the Union, and they wanted him to stay in the White  House. And he said: No, I have to go out and get my public opinion  baths. Are none of my colleagues hearing the pain of laid-off workers  who have lost their unemployment?   Haven't they seen schoolchildren--their parents saying: ``I want to  send my kids back to school, but they are not safe'' because we aren't  voting dollars to help?   I talked to my daughter last night. Just a few days ago, they  announced that instead of school opening in person in Columbus next  week, it is going to open in January, if even then, because we are not  helping schools open.   We are not helping people avoid eviction. We are not helping local  governments keep police and firemen on the streets and people who work  in the parks and people who provide help for abused children and all  the things that local governments do--we are doing none of that, but we  have plenty of time to do judges. That is the frustration and why I  made the comments I made   It just breaks my heart that we all sit here. This is a group of  pretty affluent and pretty privileged people. Yet we can't look out for  people who are hurting like this country hasn't hurt for decades.   I yield the floor.    One last comment.    I just don't really understand what I just heard, when the  President went straight to the American people and told them it was  going to disappear. He said it was a Democratic, liberal hoax to bring  down his campaign.   But look at a little history. I wear on my lapel a picture of a  canary in a birdcage. It was given to me at a workers' Memorial Day  rally, a rally to honor workers who had been injured or killed on the  job.   This canary in the birdcage--you know, the mine workers used to take  it down in the mines 120 years ago. If the canary died, the mine worker  got out of the mine. He knew that he didn't have a union that was very  strong or a government that cared very much. He was on his own. So I  always cared a lot about public health. That is really the best  prevention for the canary in the mine.   I wrote a letter to President Trump in 2018, after he had closed the  Office of Global Health Security in the White House and essentially  fired or transferred Dr. Ziemer, a Bush appointee who was one of the  world's great malaria doctors. His job--he had 40 people on his staff.  His job was to surveil the world and look at potential disease  outbreaks that might turn into an epidemic which then might evolve into  a pandemic. That was his job. The President eliminated the office. And  I wrote a letter to the President asking him to reinstate it, and he  didn't even answer the letter.   Then, the following year, 2019, he brought Dr. Linda Quick home from  China. And her job was to make sure, if anything was happening in  China, that we would know about it and could help them prevent the  disease. Our CDC--our Centers for Disease Control, we are the best in  the world. It was the United States of America leading the charge to  eliminate smallpox. It was the United States of America that led the  job to all but eliminate polio in this country. Some of us here are old  enough--the Presiding Officer, anyway, will remember knowing people who  had minor cases growing up in our schools. So we know what that meant.  It was the President of the United States who pulled CDC employees out  of China because of a trade or some--depending on when the President  loved Xi or disliked Xi--I mean, it was back and forth with the Chinese  leader, and we just unilaterally disarmed. Then the President denied  that the virus meant anything.   I know he took care of ventilators, but other kinds of protective  equipment, just talk to nurses and doctors and healthcare workers in  our States--in Madison, in Cleveland, in Columbus, in Milwaukee, in  Kenosha and Fairbanks and Salt Lake City.   I yield the floor.
