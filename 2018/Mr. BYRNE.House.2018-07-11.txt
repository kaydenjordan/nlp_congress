 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 965 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 965         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant  [[Page H6058]]       to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into       the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union       for consideration of the bill (H.R. 200) to amend the       Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to       provide flexibility for fishery managers and stability for       fishermen, and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Natural Resources. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. It shall be in order to consider as an       original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-      minute rule the amendment in the nature of a substitute       recommended by the Committee on Natural Resources now printed       in the bill. The committee amendment in the nature of a       substitute shall be considered as read. All points of order       against the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute       are waived. No amendment to the committee amendment in the       nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House       on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the       bill or to the committee amendment in the nature of a       substitute. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with       or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 965 provides for  consideration of H.R. 200, the Strengthening Fishing Communities and  Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act.   This structured rule makes in order 11 amendments, including 4  minority and 2 bipartisan amendments.   Mr. Speaker, I was born and raised in coastal Alabama, so I have  spent my entire life experiencing the long-held tradition of fishing  off the Gulf Coast. Some of my best memories growing up were fishing  with my family, and I have carried on that same tradition with my  children. I look forward to fishing with my grandchildren once they get  a little older.   This isn't a tradition unique to the Gulf Coast. All along America's  shores, countless families and friends have made so many memories while  fishing.   No one wants to be a better steward of our Nation's fisheries than  those of us who actually enjoy fishing. No one wants a healthier fish  stock than those of us who have spent our lives on the water.   That is where H.R. 200 comes in. This bill includes commonsense  reforms to ensure that our Nation's fisheries remain strong, while also  being accessible to fishermen from every walk of life.   Now, I know this bill is about much more than just those of us who  like to fish recreationally. Commercial fishing is a major economic  engine in many of our coastal communities, so the bill also ensures  access to our oceans and ocean resources for our commercial fishermen.   Just consider these numbers that demonstrate the overall impact of  fishing on the U.S. economy:   In 2015, the fishing industry generated $208 billion in sales and  supported 1.62 million American jobs.   Approximately 11 million saltwater anglers spent a total of $60.9  million on fishing trips, which generated roughly $22.7 billion in  income.   And I want to make one other point. The underlying bill will also  ensure that all Americans have access to fresh, sustainable seafood.  That is important to our Nation's restaurants, but it is also  especially important to seafood lovers like me.   If you doubt the importance of the fishing sector, let me tell you  about red snapper fishing in my home State of Alabama. It is a major  economic driver for our coastal communities. From restaurants, to gas  stations, to bait and tackle shops, to the charter boat industry, red  snapper fishing is critically important to the economy in our coastal  communities and surrounding areas.   Unfortunately, the Federal Government has failed for years to  adequately count the number of red snapper in the Gulf. This has  resulted in ridiculously short red snapper seasons, which hurt our  fishermen and the economies in our coastal communities.   So, how bad was the Federal Government in counting red snapper? Well,  they weren't even sampling for red snapper on reefs, despite the fact  that red snapper are reef fish. It made absolutely no sense.   Colleges and universities, like the University of South Alabama, have  been able to do a much better job of assessing the health of the red  snapper stock with far fewer resources. Their data has proven to be  much more accurate and up to date.   Thankfully, along with my Gulf Coast colleagues, we have been able to  work with the Trump administration and the Commerce Department to  ensure adequate recreational red snapper seasons over the last 2 years.  But this bill includes reforms I authored to help fix the mismanagement  of red snapper for all sectors, once and for all. That means allowing  for greater State control, especially as it relates to stock  assessments and data collection.   That is one of the best things about H.R. 200. The bill eliminates  unscientific timeframes to rebuild fish stocks that unnecessarily  restrict access to fisheries. Our national fishery policy should be  based on sound, accurate data.   The bill goes against the Washington-knows-best approach that has  failed so many times in the past. By providing greater flexibility to  fishery managers, we can allow for better management strategies that  reflect regional needs and demands. We should empower people who live  and work in the local communities, instead of letting bureaucrats in  Washington decide what works best.   As I mentioned earlier, the bill will allow more Americans to have  access to fresh, sustainable seafood. Currently, around 90 percent of  seafood consumed in the United States is imported. This is especially  troubling when you consider that we have an abundance of fish right  here in our own waters. With reforms included in this bill, we can  boost access to affordable domestic fish.   Mr. Speaker, by passing H.R. 200, the House can support our Nation's  fishermen, American consumers, our coastal communities, and the overall  American economy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting House  Resolution 965 and the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman referenced a letter from the Seafood Harvesters of  America. In their letter dated June 21 of 2018, this group claims that  section 12 of the bill repeals a section of the MSA. There hasn't been  a section 12 in this bill since November of 2017. There is no section  12.   The letter also claims that section 4 undermines rebuilding  timelines. Section 4 of this bill simply states that all references in  H.R. 200 are to the Magnuson-Stevens Act, unless otherwise stated;  doesn't do anything like what is claimed.    As the most egregious example, this group is so committed to opposing  this  [[Page H6060]]  bill, no matter what changes we make, they reference a bill that, for  all intents and purposes, no longer exists.   The gentleman also said something about this bill being job- destroying.   Mr. Speaker, let me tell you about the destruction of jobs. When the  present regime was running the fishery in the Gulf of Mexico for red  snapper, they limited the number of days for fishing to such a small  number that it destroyed hundreds, if not thousands of jobs across just  my part of the Gulf Coast when people were no longer allowed to go out  and go snapper fishing.   Charter boat folks lost their jobs. People that sell ice or bait lost  their jobs. It was the Federal bureaucracy that was destroying jobs.   This bill will give us a commonsense regime that will restore jobs.  So, far from being a job-destroying bill, this bill is going to create  jobs.   The gentleman also referred to a bottoms-up approach. I have been  working on this issue for over 4 years, and I can tell you, the bottom,  which is us recreational fishermen, we haven't been listened to one  single time by the Federal bureaucracy. They closed their doors in our  face.   If you want to have a bottoms-up approach to this sort of thing, this  bill supplies it. What we have got right now certainly doesn't do it.   One of the most important things that is involved here is, who does  the science? Do you let a bunch of Federal scientists far away from  where the fisheries are make these decisions? Or do you let scientists  that are in the areas where the fisheries exist, do you let them do the  science?   I am not talking about just any Tom, Dick, or Harry out there that  calls himself a scientist. I am talking about Ph.D. scientists with  accredited universities who know the fishery. This bill would allow  that to happen, so that you could get good, accurate data, because they  don't have it today.   Let me go back to what I said initially on the red snapper issue.   The Federal scientists were sampling for red snapper on sandy bottom.  These are reef fish. You are not going to find reef fish on sandy  bottom. You find them on reefs. And if you talk to real scientists,  they will tell you there is no way you are going to get an accurate  assessment of this fish stock if you are looking for them on sandy  bottom. You have got to look for them on reefs.   Let me tell you, there are over 170 groups that have signed on to  being supportive of this bill. I do not have time to read all the names  to you, but let me just read a few. The first one is the Congressional  Sportsmen's Foundation. I go to their events up here, like many other  Members of Congress. When I was at one just recently, there were  hundreds of Members of Congress there from both parties. It couldn't  get to be any bigger, and it couldn't get to be any more bipartisan.   The Coastal Conservation Association, the Premier Recreational  Anglers Association in America, the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation  Partnership, the National Marine Manufacturers Association, which the  gentleman referred to as if they were opposed to it. They support the  bill.   The National Coalition for Fishing Communities and the Guy Harvey  Ocean Foundation. This is a very broadly, deeply supported bill among  people who are actually fishing.   Now, it may not be supported by people who don't fish and who don't  know anything about fishing; but for those of us who do fish, whether  we are commercial fishermen or recreational fishermen, we like it.   And it is time for Congress to understand that the waters of the  United States of America do not belong to the Congress, and they do not  belong to these Federal departments and agencies. They belong to the  people of America, and the people of America have a right to fish in  their waters. This bill will help restore that.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the gentleman's remarks. I want to make sure that I can  assure him and everybody in this House this bill doesn't cut funding to  anything. It's an authorization bill, and it reauthorizes the Magnuson- Stevens Act with some changes, but those changes do not include a  reduction in funding.   But here is the thing about fishing that people that don't fish don't  understand. Those of us that fish, we care about this fishery more than  anybody else because if we overfish the stock, we don't get to fish  anymore. No one has a greater interest in making sure that the species  in our waters are maintained than those of us that fish, whether we are  commercial fishermen or recreational fishermen. So there is no interest  here that is being served to try to somehow harm our fishery.   We believe, and it has actually been demonstrated to be true, that  local communities, regional people, can better regulate, sample, bring  science to the health of these fish stock than giving it to some  bureaucrat in Washington that doesn't know one single thing about our  fishery.   We care. We care deeply, because it is a way of life for us, and the  last thing we want to do is do anything that would harm these fish  stock out there.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we are here today to talk about the fisheries  of America. If the folks on the other side of the aisle want to address  the issue that they just referenced, then I am sure they could  foreswear taking any corporate contributions, any anonymous  contributions to their accounts for themselves. So they could lead by  their example, and I look forward to seeing them do that.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to talk about the fisheries of  America, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's remarks. There are  bipartisan cosponsors to this bill. This is a bipartisan bill.   What is this bill really about? It is about freedom. It is about the  freedom of the American people to be able to use their own waters, to  fish in their own waters, something the American people have done since  before we were a nation.   There is a really great book that just came out that won the Pulitzer  Prize called ``The Gulf,'' about the Gulf of Mexico. It recounts the  history of our area and how long we have been fishing in the Gulf of  Mexico and what it has meant for generations upon generations of both  commercial and recreational fishermen.   I have commercial fisherpeople in my family, and they are wonderful  people, have a great business. It is important to them and it is their  way of life. We need to make sure we do everything to preserve that way  of life.   I am a recreational fisherman, and we have been doing it in my family  for generations, and I want to preserve that as well.   My grandfather was one of the founders of the Alabama Deep Sea  Fishing Rodeo, one of the oldest and largest fishing tournaments in the  United States of America. It is really great to see, summer after  summer, generations of people who have been fishing in that tournament,  literally for three or four or five generations, come down there on  Dauphin Island and bring the fish that they catch, so proud of what  they have done.    And what have they just done? They have gone out in their own boat at  their own expense, spent a day in the open air on a beautiful summer  day, or maybe 2 or 3 days, and got some time to spend time together as  a family, with friends, and do something Americans have been able to do  without the Federal Government trying to tell them how to do it for a  couple, 300 years.   It is time for us to restore back to the American people the control  of their waters. That is what this bill does. Mr. Speaker, I again urge  my colleagues to support H. Res. 965 and the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 965 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       6239) to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to       provide for additional disclosure requirements for       corporations, labor organizations, Super PACs and other       entities, and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided among and controlled by the respective chairs and       ranking minority members of the Committees on House       Administration, Ways and Means, Financial Services, and       Oversight and Government Reform. After general debate the       bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute       rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the       House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6239.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.  [[Page H6063]]
