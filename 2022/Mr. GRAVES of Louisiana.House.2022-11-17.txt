 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  California for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I want to first thank my friend from Nevada for  working with us on this legislation. This is important. I thank my  colleague from Louisiana (Mr. Carter) as well as Miss Gonzalez-Colon  from Puerto Rico. These are all folks, Madam Speaker, who have been  through the aftermath of disasters. Of course, the lead sponsor whom we  are working on this legislation with is the chair of the Economic  Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management Subcommittee.   Just to explain what happens here, in the aftermath of a disaster-- and as the gentleman from California noted, this can be a forest fire,  it could be a flood, it could be a hurricane, an earthquake, or other  types of disasters--you have an alphabet soup of agencies that come in  and offer assistance. It could be FEMA, it could be the Small Business  Administration, it could be the Department of Agriculture, it could be  the Department of Housing and Urban Development, or others.   Madam Speaker, the last thing in the world the victim of a disaster  needs is to be revictimized by their own government bureaucracy.  Whether your home was destroyed in a forest fire, it was blown away in  a hurricane, or it was destroyed in a flood, you need help. You don't  need bureaucracy. Yet, each agency has its own process.   This bill brings common sense to that. It relieves the stress of  being a disaster victim, and it provides a universal application. You  do it one time, the data is shared. You don't have to come in and fill  out the same information over and over and over again.   I wish somebody could do this at a doctor's office. Just make a note.   Madam Speaker, this bill goes beyond there though. It also ensures  that as taxpayers we are not coming in and  [[Page H8565]]  spending money over and over and over again on the same homes. It  changes the threshold for assistance to come in and offer hazard  mitigation assistance for these homes to make them more resilient and  to address vulnerabilities. It ensures that if someone floods or there  is a repetitive flood, we don't allow it to continue happening. We  bring solutions to the table.    I am embarrassed to admit this, but in the district that I represent,  there was a home that had flood insurance claims 42 times--42 times. As  ridiculous as it is as a taxpayer to see that happen--can you imagine  the homeowner having to go through this over and over and over again?   Thankfully, we have solved that problem in that case, but this bill  prevents further similar problems from occurring.   Lastly, Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Louisiana for working  with us on section 12 of this legislation. This clarifies something  that we did in the Disaster Response Reform Act of 2018 that ensures if  you have a local entity like a sheriff's office or others that brings a  housing solution to the table that is at least 50 percent or less the  cost of what a similar solution would cost the Federal Government, they  can get reimbursed for that.   Said another way, Madam Speaker, this saves the Federal Government 50  percent of the money or more of housing solutions whenever a local  agency like a sheriff's office or others bring solutions to the table  for their own victims. As my friend from Nevada has said, in some cases  we have seen FEMA spending $250,000 per trailer--$250,000.                                time  1315    We have seen local entities come in and bring solutions to the table  for $32,000, turning around and selling the trailers back, and  recouping everything but $7,000.   This is about taxpayers. It is about efficiency. It is about better  solutions, more resilient communities.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this amendment.
