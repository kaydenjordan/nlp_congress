 Mr. President, the 116th Congress, so far, has just  talked about the humanitarian crisis at the border. Most of our  Democratic colleagues have claimed up to this point that there is no  crisis or emergency at the border.   We will recall that we started out the year with a government  shutdown because of the battle over border security, and our Democratic  friends made one thing perfectly clear: They would oppose any effort to  fund our security mission at the border. That resulted in the 35-day  shutdown.   The Speaker of the House at the time called the situation ``a fake  crisis at the border,'' and the minority leader here in the Senate  referred it to as ``a crisis that does not exist.'' Well, they weren't  the only ones. Throughout the Halls of the Capitol, Democrats in  Congress used terms like ``phony,'' ``imaginary,'' and ``make-believe''  to describe the challenges our frontline officers and agents were  facing every day.   While our Democratic colleagues have reflexively denied the existence  of a crisis at the border, the problems have grown only bigger each  day. Of course, it was 2014, I will remind my friends across the aisle,  when Barack Obama, then President of the United States, declared a  humanitarian and security crisis at the border. So it seemed very odd  to me that, in 2019, they decided--when the numbers kept getting bigger  and bigger and conditions worse and worse--all of a sudden that the  humanitarian and security crisis had gone away.   The fact is, over the last 3 months, the number of illegal crossings  across the southwestern border have hit six figures, something we  haven't seen since 2006. We surpassed the number of unaccompanied  children apprehended at the height of the 2014 crisis that President  Obama was speaking about.   This mass migration has nearly depleted our Federal resources,  causing the President to request $4\1/2\ billion for humanitarian  assistance and border operations. That request came almost 2 months  ago--almost 2 months ago, and Congress has not acted.   Now, it seems, our Democratic colleagues have finally accepted the  facts. There is a very real and very urgent humanitarian crisis on our  southern border. The bill they passed earlier this week meets the  dollar amount requested by the President, but the substance of the bill  shows that House Democrats don't want to send funding where it is  actually needed the most.   Unlike the Senate's bipartisan bill, the original House bill excluded  funding for the Department of Defense, immigration judge teams, and  underfunded both Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and  Border Protection. This morning, they made a last-ditch effort to  inject some of their deeply partisan provisions back into our Senate  bipartisan bill. While the House Democrats did increase needed funding  in some areas, the newly amended version still includes divisive  provisions and reduces funding in areas that the Senate overwhelmingly  rejected yesterday.   Here is just one example. Democrats in the House cut the Senate  bill's appropriation of $21 million for ICE Homeland Security  investigations to conduct--get this--human trafficking investigations.  So the House wanted to cut $21 million in the Senate appropriations  bill that was dedicated to investigating human trafficking. This is  just the latest example of their fundamental lack of interest in  sending money where it is needed most--only where it is politically  convenient.   It is unfortunately not much of a surprise. Our Democratic friends  are trying to keep up with their candidates running for President,  whose positions on immigration and border security get more extreme  each day. Now, more than one Democrat running for the nomination for  President actually supports making entering the country illegally  legal--in other words, no orderly immigration system at all--a free- for-all, where it is easier for human traffickers and drug smugglers to  come and go as they please. And, of course, there is this: no  consideration given for those would-be immigrants who are trying to  wait patiently in line and do things exactly the right way and no  consideration of the unfairness of those who would jump ahead of the  line and enter the country illegally before those who are trying to do  it the right way.   The House bill stands in stark contrast to the bipartisan agreement  we passed here in the Senate, which funds a range of programs at the  Federal departments and agencies working to manage the crisis, and,  importantly, it is the only bill in town that has the support of the  President. It is, after all, important to get the President's signature  on legislation for it to become law.   The Senate Appropriations Committee overwhelmingly supported this  bill, and it passed the committee by a vote of 30 to 1. When the full  Senate voted on it yesterday, only eight Members of the Senate voted  no.   We have simply waited long enough. We waited too long, in my view,  for Democrats to acknowledge this real humanitarian crisis. The House  bill is inadequate and mostly a partisan effort.   Our Democratic colleagues have resisted acting for far too long  already, making this humanitarian crisis worse. They circulate the very  tragic pictures of a father with his young child face down in the  waters of the Rio Grande River, and they somehow fail to acknowledge  their own complicity in failing to act to provide the sorts of fixes to  our asylum laws that would deter, if not prevent, that sort of thing  from occurring in the first place. They really do need to look in the  mirror.   We need to take action now, and I hope we don't have to wait any  longer for our colleagues in the House to pass the Senate's bipartisan  bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another note, I listened with great  interest as the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,  the Senator from Rhode Island, spoke about Iran and the challenges we  face there. I agree with some and maybe even most of what he had to  say.   The American people were appalled when, last week, Iran took down an  unmanned American aircraft over international waters. As the Senator  said, ordinarily, Iran operates by proxies or by third parties, whether  it is the Shia militia in Iraq or Hezbollah or one of their other  terrorist proxies like those operating in Yemen, the Houthis. But Iran  escalated its attack against the United States by shooting an unmanned  drone flying over international waters, so it was quite a shocking move  from that standpoint, even from a nation as untethered as Iran.   Iran has been engaged in a 30-year conflict with the United States,  one that has resulted in the death of U.S. servicemembers in Iraq and  elsewhere--victims of explosively formed penetrators and other training  that the IRGC, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, their Quds Force, their  Special Operations force--the training they gave to terrorists  operating in Iraq to kill Americans.   Then there is the periodic harassment of American and other  international vessels operating in the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow  strait through which a huge portion of the world's energy supplies  flow. So this is, in some ways, an escalation of what has been a 30- year conflict between Iran and the United States.   Tehran has waged acts of aggression against the United States and our  allies. It has exported terrorism around the globe. It is the No. 1  state sponsor of international terrorism, and it has engaged in gross  human rights violations against its own people.   As I indicated, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, is  the loyal henchman responsible for leading these acts. It is a branch  of Iran's Armed Forces which tries to squash democracy movements at  home and abroad by pushing its extreme ideology beyond Iran's borders.   The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps wields vast power and influence  and uses its capabilities to encourage turmoil and conflict and  violence throughout the Middle East. It funds arms, training, and foot  soldiers to the terrorist groups that spread their radical ideology.   While the terrorist activities alone are enough to cause concern, the  IRGC is also in control of Iran's ballistic missile program, which  unfortunately has only accelerated under the previous administration's  deeply flawed nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of  Action, the JCPOA. Once  [[Page S4608]]  we saw the details of that deal in 2015, it quickly became clear that  it was not much of a deal at all. If the goal is to prevent Iran from  getting a nuclear weapon--well, it obviously failed in that goal.   As the majority leader said at the time, it ``appears to fall well  short of the goal we all thought was trying to be achieved, which was  that Iran would not be a nuclear state.''   Despite the restrictions it would impose, the deal would leave Iran  with a vast nuclear program and allow it to continue to conduct  research and development on advanced centrifuges and building  intercontinental ballistic missiles.   Perhaps worse, the nuclear deal would lift those restrictions in a  decade. In other words, it was 2015 when the JCPOA was signed by the  relevant parties. So by postponing Iran's ability to develop a nuclear  weapon, we are already half of the way there almost. It is no wonder  that then-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered an  address to Congress in March of 2015 and said the JCPOA ``doesn't block  Iran's path to the bomb; it paves Iran's path to the bomb.'' That  certainly seems to be the case. We have seen Iran violate the nuclear  deal and U.N. resolutions time after time, and it is clear that their  resolve to create nuclear weapons remains their highest priority.   Just a year ago, President Trump announced the United States would  pull out of the nuclear deal, a decision I strongly supported. Even at  the time Secretary Kerry, the Secretary of State, admitted that the  tens of billions of dollars the United States released to go to Iran  would be used to fund their terrorist activities, he supported it  nonetheless. He supported it even though it paved the way for Iran to  get a nuclear weapon 10 years after the JCPOA was signed.   Since the Trump administration has withdrawn from the JCPOA, it has  taken resolute action against Iran, including stronger sanctions on  entities and individuals and the designation of the IRGC as a foreign  terrorist organization, which it clearly is. Somehow, though, despite  the unprovoked attacks, flagrant violations of international  agreements, and human rights violations, some of our friends on the  left and the mainstream media have grossly mischaracterized the  situation and have somehow managed to point the finger at the Trump  administration for starting the fight in the first place. They want to  blame America, and they want to blame this administration.   Let me be clear. Iran is the aggressor. Their history as the chief  mischief-maker in the Middle East began long before President Trump  took office, so don't lay this at his feet. From the Iran hostage  crisis to their outright support of terrorist groups in the Middle  East, to this latest strike at a U.S. aircraft, something they  admitted--they said: We did it--their actions at every turn have  demonstrated a desire not only to escalate the conflict with the United  States and our interests and allies but to spread their violent  extremism without regard for anyone else.   I have to say it has been 74 years since a nuclear weapon was  exploded during World War II, and I hope and pray there is never again  a nuclear weapon exploded on our planet, but can you imagine Iran, the  No. 1 state sponsor of international terrorism, getting a nuclear  weapon? We can never ever allow that to happen.   This last week marked the 23rd anniversary of a notable episode in  Iran's sad history of terrorism. That was the 23rd anniversary of the  Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia. In 1996, a truck bomb was  detonated adjacent to a building housing members of the U.S. Air  Force's 4404th Wing, killing 19 U.S. Air Force personnel and a Saudi  local and wounding 498 others.   If Tehran expects to continue exporting terrorism and violence around  the world without a response from the United States and our allies,  they are sorely mistaken.   If Iran can continue to escalate with no response from the United  States or our allies, they are going to continue to escalate as much as  they can, which I think is more dangerous than a proportional U.S.  response to what happened in the Strait of Hormuz.   The President has opted for hard-hitting sanctions, which I think are  a good start. Those sanctions announced by the administration earlier  this week represent an appropriate response to the Iranian escalation  consistent with President Trump's maximum pressure strategy on Iran.  These sanctions will deny the Supreme Leader, the Supreme Leader's  office, and close affiliates access to resources they need to finance  their rogue regime. There is no benefit--in the interest of peace--to  applying anything less than maximum pressure on Iran to change their  behavior. The tentacles of the IRGC run deep into their economy, and  these sanctions will prevent them from amassing even greater power to  develop sophisticated weapons.    We have seen reports that the economic challenges they are  encountering as a result of the sanctions already in place are making  it harder for them to finance their terrorist operations through their  proxy.   The actions taken by Iran show that they are feeling the squeeze of  these sanctions, and they know exactly what they need to do before they  can get relief. As Secretary of State Pompeo said, ``When the Iranian  regime decides to forgo violence and meet our diplomacy with diplomacy,  it knows how to reach us.''   I sincerely hope to see the day when the Iranian people can live  without fear, when their government respects its own citizens and  international allies and lives by international norms and finally  decides to forgo its nuclear weapons. Until that day comes, I hope our  allies will stand with us in confronting the tyrants in Iran and doing  everything in our power to push back against the world's largest state  sponsor of terror.   I yield the floor.
