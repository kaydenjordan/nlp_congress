 Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of my former  colleague, the late Senator Dianne Feinstein, to recognize the  dedicated service of her long-time State director, Peter Muller.   Born and raised in San Jose, Peter is a native Californian and has  spent his career serving the people of the Golden State. After  graduating from St. Mary's College of California, he earned his  master's in political science and government from American University.   Peter began his career in Congress in 1992 as a legislative assistant  for then-Congressman Norman Mineta, where he served until Congressman  Mineta's retirement in 1995. Peter then served as legislative director  to Congresswoman Karen McCarthy before joining Congresswoman Ellen  Tauscher's office in 1997, first as legislative director and then as  her chief of staff. Peter spent 9 years with Congresswoman Tauscher and  distinguished himself through his work with the House Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure and his efforts leading the  development of the New Democrat Coalition.   After three stints away from Capitol Hill working for California- based Genentech, Intel, and Metrolink and a move to Los Angeles, Peter  joined Senator Feinstein's staff in 2016 as her deputy State director.  He subsequently served as her State director until her passing last  month.   Every member of this Chamber knows the importance of their State  director. They serve as our eyes and ears in our State, and they often  act as our proxy when a cross-country flight isn't manageable. They  lead our State teams with incredible patience and care, ensuring our  offices run efficiently and our constituents receive the services they  need. And they do it all for the good of the people we were elected to  serve.   Peter was by Senator Feinstein's side for good times and bad, through  a reelection campaign and Supreme Court confirmations, impeachments and  insurrection, and the COVID-19 pandemic. I know that Senator Feinstein  valued his counsel on many contentious issues, and he was often the  first person she turned to when considering the impact of an issue on  her beloved California. He was essential to her lasting efforts to  protect California's public lands and water resources, improve our  immigration system, secure funding for the West Los Angeles VA campus,  and many of her other priorities throughout the State.  [[Page S5254]]    And so, on behalf of my former colleague and her team and as a fellow  former State staffer for Senator Feinstein, I thank Peter for his years  of dedicated service. The people of California are forever indebted to  him for the impacts he has made, and we wish him all the best in his  future endeavors.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  University Centers for Growth, Development, and Prosperity Act, which I  reintroduced today.   The U.S. Economic Development Administration created the University  Center Program to allow institutions of higher education and consortia  to establish and maintain university centers, with the understanding  that our higher education institutions play a critical role in our  Nation's economic growth.   University centers are Federal partnerships that leverage the assets  of higher learning institutions to strengthen regional economic growth  by promoting innovation, entrepreneurship, and job creation. They  encourage economic development in economically distressed regions,  which  [[Page S5259]]  helps spur job growth, high-skilled regional talent pools, and business  expansion.   Despite EDA's important work, many communities across the country  have yet to benefit from the Agency's programs, including smaller  communities, communities of color, and rural areas experiencing higher  rates of poverty.   Despite being one of EDA's most successful economic development  initiatives, the current University Center Program is not officially  authorized by Congress and is currently administered under EDA's  Technical Assistance Program. That is why I am proud to reintroduce  legislation that would codify and expand the University Center Program,  leverage more resources for minority-serving institutions, and support  a greater diversity of innovation and entrepreneurship in their  communities.   California has several thriving institutions, including Cal State  Chico, Cal State Bakersfield, and University of Southern California,  that will be able to scale their impact as a result of these new  resources. By prioritizing the establishment of new university centers  at colleges and universities that serve significant populations of  underserved students, we can further strengthen regional economies and  help close the racial wealth gap.   Specifically, the bill establishes an EDA University Center Program  to help universities collaborate with economic development districts,  trade adjustment assistance centers, and other economic development  technical assistance and service providers to develop and implement  comprehensive economic development strategies and other economic  development planning at the local, regional, and State levels, with a  focus on innovation, entrepreneurship, and workforce development.   It also prioritizes the participation of minority-serving  institutions as part of the University Center Program. Minority-serving  institutions provide incredible opportunities for so many low-income  and first-generation students. I am proud that my State of California  is home to 174 Hispanic-serving institutions and 51 emerging Hispanic- serving institutions, the highest amount in the country.   As a Senator representing one of the most diverse States in the  country, I am eager to work with my colleagues to ensure that we  improve the equity of EDA programming and help increase the  participation of minority-serving institutions.   As the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works continues to  draft an EDA reauthorization bill, I urge them to include this  legislation to expand and improve the University Center Program.   I want to thank Congressman Pete Aguilar for introducing this bill  with me, and I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this  program that benefits almost every State.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  University Centers for Growth, Development, and Prosperity Act, which I  reintroduced today.
