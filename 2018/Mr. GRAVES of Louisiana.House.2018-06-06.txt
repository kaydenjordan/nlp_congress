 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman  from Pennsylvania for all of his leadership on this important  legislation. I want to thank my friend from Oregon and my friend from  California for working with us on this, as there is a bipartisan  agreement to move this bill forward.   Mr. Chairman, why are we doing this bill? People at home who are  watching this, people who are living in their communities, why are we  doing this bill?   We are doing this bill because we need to ensure that people live in  places that are safe--safe from flooding and safe from hurricanes. We  just saw last year the 2017 hurricanes, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria,  and Nate, where we spent well over $150 billion so far--I believe we  are near $180 billion--responding to those disasters. People need to  live in safe, resilient communities.   We need to ensure that we can build navigation channels that stay  compatible with trends in shipping. We built the Panama Canal. The  United States built the Canal, yet the Panamanians have stepped in and  deepened and widened the canal and the lock system in a shorter period  of time than we have been able to even deepen ports here in the United  States.   Then, of course, there are environmental issues, the environmental  consequences of many of these projects, including in my home State of  Louisiana, where we have lost 2,000 square miles of our coast, and the  Corps of Engineers has not stepped in and done a single thing to  actually restore the environmental consequences of their actions--2,000  square miles of coastal wetlands. If you or I did that, we would be in  jail today.   So the reason we are doing this bill is because as the ranking  member, Mr. DeFazio, mentioned a few minutes ago, we have a nearly $100  billion backlog in projects. We are putting forward somewhere around $2  billion a year in construction funds. You can do the math. I am a math  whiz, and I can tell you that you will finish those projects  approximately never, because $2 billion a year on $100 billion, you  can't even keep up with inflation. We must reform the process, and this  bill moves in that direction.   There are important reforms in this bill like allowing the non- Federal sponsors, the States, the parishes, the counties, the water  boards, and the ports, to grab components of these projects and move  them forward on their own working in collaboration with the Corps of  Engineers to ensure that we are moving these projects forward  efficiently.    We need to make sure that we are moving redundancies in the process  and allowing these non-Federal entities to use the same permitting  process that the Corps of Engineers just went through and spent  millions of dollars complying with. We are still being respectful to  the environment, but we are not forcing them to carry out redundant  measures, paying twice for the same actions because that doesn't make  sense.   Let me go back and talk about, again, what these outcomes actually  yield. We are talking about projects to prevent communities from  flooding, to prevent hurricane damages, to restore the environment, and  to ensure that our ports and waterways can facilitate the ships that  are growing in width and in depth across the globe to where we can have  more cost-effective shipping in the United States and our port systems  and we can facilitate the trade that comes around the globe and into  our country.   Mr. Chairman, they have projects that have been in the study phase,  not for months or years, but for decades. We have projects that have  been waiting on full implementation of construction for decades. Once  again, in my home State of Louisiana, we have the Comite project that  has been around for 32 years, $100 million nearly has been spent, and  nothing has been done to actually provide flood relief--$100 million.   We have another project in southeast Louisiana in Terrebone and  Lafourche Parishes, where the Corps of Engineers has spent nearly $80  million and hasn't put a shovel in the ground yet.   How do you do that when you look at the fact that we have a $20  trillion deficit and we are spending those sorts of dollars on actions  that aren't benefiting taxpayers? Who is that representing? Because it  is not the people who sent us here.   So I will say it again: this bill moves forward in transparency, it  moves forward in efficiency while respecting the environment, it allows  projects to be expedited, and it gives more flexibility for the Corps  and their non-Federal partners to work together to deliver these  projects.   One thing that is in here that I know the chairman is a big fan of  and we pushed as well with our friends across the aisle, is taking a  look to study whether or not the Corps of Engineers should remain  within the Department of Defense.   Is this a mission that is truly compatible with our Department of  Defense? I want Secretary Mattis focused on Syria and focused on Iran,  North Korea, China, Russia, and other threats to our country. I don't  want him or her also worried about what is happening with a coastal  wetlands permit. I want him focused on the national defense of our  country, so looking at where this mission perhaps could be better  housed, better compatibility, and ultimately to deliver better outcomes  to taxpayers across the country.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is an important amendment in that it  tries to ensure that mitigation banks and other types of mitigation  mechanisms are viable options to be able to build projects.   In some cases, you have unavoidable impacts. We need to be able to  have options to mitigate for those impacts so we can truly build  projects.   I commend the gentleman from Ohio for raising this issue, for  bringing this up. I do think that we need to continue working on  refining the text a little bit and working together in a bipartisan  manner with our friends on the other side of the aisle to get this to a  place where everyone can agree.   Again, I think it is an important issue for us to address to ensure  that mitigation credits are actually accessible, and I want to see if  the gentleman will be willing to withdraw the amendment with the  understanding that we are going to work with him to ensure that we can  address this issue moving forward through the legislative process.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment, although I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment seeks to  provide better information to the Congress, to Federal agencies, and to  public entities all over the United States to ensure that we understand  the value of investments that we are making, to ensure that we  understand the return on investment that we are making with public  funds at the State and Federal levels.   Mr. Chairman, I commend the gentlewoman from Connecticut and I  commend the gentleman from Texas for bringing this issue up. I think  that there is much we can do to perfect the cost of benefit ratio  process and information provided to the Congress to where we can make  informed decisions to ensure that we are appropriately using the  limited taxpayer resources that we have.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition, but I don't plan to oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment assures the  Corps of Engineers can help mitigate any detrimental impacts to the  water supply as a result of a Corps of Engineers project. I appreciate  my colleague's work on this, and I do accept this amendment and urge  support of the amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim  the time in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to  it.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the  gentlewoman for offering this amendment that requires a study for the  use of noise abatement technologies at ports. I think this is a good  amendment, and I urge adoption of the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to  claim the time in opposition, although I don't plan to oppose the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I want to thank my friend from  Louisiana, a colleague, for offering this amendment.   As the gentleman stated, what is happening right now, the Corps of  Engineers is requiring non-Federal entities, like the State of  Louisiana and other States around the country and other private  partners and local governments to acquire land in fee title, and then  that is then absorbed as part of the overall cost of a project.   In many cases in our home State, 82 percent of coastal Louisiana is  owned by private landowners. These landowners are willing to donate the  project, servitude or easement to ensure these projects can be built.  And these are environmental projects for coastal restoration and other  wetland construction-type projects. It reduces overall project cost. It  incentivizes cooperation between landowners and government entities  trying to restore the coast. This is in the best interest of taxpayers.  It is in the best interest of the Corps of Engineers. It is absolutely  good policy, and I want to thank the gentleman for the amendment. I  urge adoption of the amendment.   Madam Chairwoman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to  claim the time in opposition, although I don't plan to oppose the  amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment intends to cut  through the bureaucracy to expedite decisions that are being made. In  the case of this amendment, it is designed to address an issue in Texas  where you have high-volume port projects and there are safety and  navigational improvements that are needed.   We support the intent of the gentleman's amendment to cut through the  bureaucracy to ensure that decisions are expedited and cost savings  result, and urge support of the amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to  claim the time in opposition, although I don't plan to oppose the  amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment is designed to  largely address, I think, a flaw that this underlying bill addresses in  the cost-to-benefit ratio calculations used by the Corps of Engineers,  by OMB, and others.   This particular amendment is focused on emergency repairs. What this  does is it allows the non-Federal entities to pay a higher non-Federal  cost share for repairs to levees.   There are many issues with how OMB and the Corps calculate cost-to- benefit ratios. This is a fix for emergency repairs while we work on  the underlying bill for the larger fixes.   Madam Chair, I want to thank Mr. Bost for offering this amendment. We  are prepared to accept it. I urge adoption, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to  claim the time in opposition, although I don't plan to oppose the  amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment directs the  Comptroller General to conduct a study and report on the Army Corps of  Engineers' ability to comply with Federal stormwater requirements. This  is an issue that affects districts across the United States.   I want to thank the gentleman from Washington for bringing this  amendment up, for raising this issue, and we are prepared to accept it.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to  claim the time in opposition, although I don't plan to oppose the  amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment expresses the  sense of Congress that projects in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of  Hurricanes Irma and Maria be expedited, that these be considered a  priority, and that the Corps of Engineers advance these projects as  quickly as possible.   My friend from Puerto Rico hosted myself, Mr. DeFazio, Chairman  Shuster, and others in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the storms, and  certainly the devastation there was extraordinary.   It is important to advance projects like this because as folks are  looking at whether they are going to reinvest back in their  communities, whether they are going to stay in their communities,  whether they are going to rebuild their homes and businesses, knowing  that things aren't going to be back in the same degree of vulnerability  is very important.   We have got to send a message to these victims of hurricanes in 2017  and other disasters that these communities are going to be built back  smarter, they are going to be safer, and the investments they are  putting back in their homes and businesses are wise investments.   I want to thank the gentlewoman for offering this amendment. I want  to thank her for her tireless work in the recovery of Puerto Rico. We  are prepared to accept, and I urge adoption of the amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to  claim the time in opposition, although I don't plan to oppose the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman  from Ohio for offering this amendment.   DMMP's dredged material management plans are plans to manage the  sediment that results from dredging activities. It can hold up the  navigation of channels for ships and vessels. It can obstruct activity  at ports.   This is what the rest of the world would call common sense. It  ensures that we are not collecting redundant information, we are  building upon information that exists, and that we have a limit or goal  of 2 years in completing this.   This makes sense. I want to thank the gentleman for bringing this  amendment forth, which we are prepared to accept.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentlewoman  from California for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I do want to thank the gentleman from Texas for raising  this issue. I actually agree with him that there are fundamental  problems in the levee safety program right now: number one, the fact  that the Corps produces these worst-case scenario outcomes that they  apply to levees without publicly making the data available on how they  came to those conclusions; number two, the fact that they fail to  provide alternative improvements with associated cost estimates on how  these systems could be improved and ensure the resiliency and  performance of these systems.   There are many, many other concerns. I think the amendment does  attempt to address some of those, but I think the gentleman also  understands that there are some concerns that have been raised that I  think are legitimate.   Mr. Chair, I do want to ask the gentleman if he would be willing to  withdraw the amendment. I would certainly be willing to work with the  gentleman through that process to see if we can find something that  everyone can agree to that makes sense without threatening the safety  of our communities, which I know no one here wants to do.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman  from Missouri (Mr. Smith) for offering this amendment.   There was something that the gentleman noted in the end that I wanted  to make sure legislative intent is preserved here, Mr. Chairman. The  gentleman from Missouri stated that the amendment is intended to  restore floodways after they are opened up, such as Bird Point-New  Madrid, as opposed to perhaps in south Louisiana where a crevasse could  open up that would provide fresh water and sort of mimic that natural  process that created coastal Louisiana and would currently restore  coastal Louisiana wetlands.   Mr. Chairman, I want to ensure the intent of the amendment and that  we have in legislative history here memorialized that this is intended  to address the restoration of floodways as opposed to crevasses that  may open in the aftermath of a flood.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman  from Pennsylvania for yielding. I want to thank the gentleman from  California for offering this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I actually want to discuss some of the provisions that  were included in the manager's amendment that I think are very, very  important.   Number one, there is a provision in the manager's amendment that  provides for the Corps of Engineers to take a fresh look at the old  river control structure, a structure that diverts 70 percent of the  water on the Mississippi River system down the Mississippi, and 30  percent down the Atchafalaya.    That is a rigid structure that dates back decades and decades. It has  not been revisited. The science has not been updated. It does not  reflect the fact that we have additional monitoring stations; and so  the plan, a rigid 70/30 split, doesn't maximize benefits to the lower  system.   We could be maximizing crawfish production, coastal restoration,  navigation features, flood control, and others, and it is not  happening. So, Mr. Chairman, this amendment is designed to address  that, to direct the Corps of Engineers to modernize this, to ensure  that current best science is being applied; to ensure that the  monitoring stations are being used and that we are having the best  outcomes for ecological productivity, for coastal restoration, for  navigation, and, importantly, for flood control, and then stop this  rigid, antiquated system of an artificial 70/30 split.   Secondly, the amendment also provides for a pilot program for 5 years  for an operations and maintenance contract, a 5-year operations and  maintenance contract; instead of coming in and offering dredging  contracts only when there is a shoal that has developed, instead,  coming in and offering a longer term contract, over a 5-year period,  and ensuring that navigation channels are certain that the navigability  of these channels at the port facilities are accessible.   In many cases, vessels may actually start weeks in advance trying to  get to the United States, and if these NAV channels aren't maintained,  these boats don't have options but to divert to other ports that are  lighter. It is expensive. We need to ensure the predictability and the  certainty of our navigation channels, and the manager's amendment  addresses that as well.   I want to thank the chairman again, Mr. Shuster, for including that.  I want to thank Mr. DeFazio and Ranking Member Napolitano for their  work with us on that manager's amendment and those important  provisions.                                time  1830
