 Mr. Speaker, nearly 50 years ago, during the Cold War,  Soviet Russia was the enemy of the people and the biggest threat to the  free world.   Fast forward to 2023, and it appears that history is repeating itself  once again as the threat of nuclear annihilation comes full circle as  two opposing ideological blocs dominate the world.   General Secretary Xi Jinping has imitated Soviet Russia's playbook  ever since he came to power more than 20  [[Page H2954]]  years ago. The Chinese Communist Party has built a cabal of global  partners through predatory and oppressive investments in foreign  countries, political strong-arming, stealing American technology, and  strengthening ties with anti-American tyrannical leaders.   This plan is taken straight from the Soviet's playbook. Only this  time, China is infinitely stronger than the Soviet Union ever was.   The United States must recognize and take immediate action against  China's push for influence in the developing world. The Soviet Union  used military might and territory conquest to forge strategic alliances  and expand its influence past the Iron Curtain. However, China mainly  uses economic sway and exploits our globalized economic system to  expand.   Over the past two decades, China has emerged as the critical trading  partner for many regions and developing countries across the globe, and  it is not by coincidence. China is intentionally targeting less- developed countries to popularize its authoritarian model and undermine  developing democracies worldwide.   China's strategic approach is rendered explicitly in Xi Jinping's  Belt and Road Initiative, aka the BRI, a lending gambit that grants  China's allies, over 140 nations, billions of dollars under the  pretense of economic integration and interconnected development.   China has bought up so much copper, pork, and soy, and constructed so  many roads, trains, power grids, and bridges, that it has surpassed the  U.S. as South America's largest trade partner, and it is now Brazil's,  Chile's, and Peru's single largest trading partner.   Compared to the U.S. and the EU, Latin America's bilateral trade in  goods with China grew dramatically from $14.6 billion in 2001 to $315  billion in 2020. That is a 21.5-fold increase since Beijing joined the  World Trade Organization.   These insidious tactics have made China an undeniable economic  superpower through unbounded dishonesty and underhanded manipulation.   In 2019, China, an active trade partner of the U.S., allowed the yuan  to fall below the 7-to-1 yuan to U.S. dollar peg it had maintained  since 2015. This action set off a day of intense selling in global  markets. In the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.9  percent, its worst daily decline all year.   By devaluing its currency, China could effectively undercut  competitors in the marketplace by offering lower prices on its exports  and, according to the U.S. Treasury Department, gain an unfair  competitive advantage in international trade.   Intellectual property theft, corporate espionage, forced technology  transfer, widespread product dumping, and currency manipulation are  just a few of the economic warfare tactics used by the Chinese  Communist Party.   This brings me to my point. One of China's most recent efforts to  destabilize the United States involves forging an unofficial alliance  with Russia to maintain Vladimir Putin's power at all costs. China is  also the top trader with Russia and Ukraine.   Before Russia invaded Ukraine, China had already surpassed Germany  and the U.S. as Russia's most significant commercial partner and the  largest consumer of its oil and gas. China has provided a financial  lifeline to Russia over the past year by buying goods that the West  won't and helping Russia continue to access financial markets despite  harsh Western sanctions.   China not only accounted for the highest year-over-year rise in  export volume to Russia of any country in 2022, but it was also the  largest exporter to Russia overall.   Moving on, it is no secret that Putin and Xi are determined to end  the U.S. and create what Xi called a new model of major country  relations.   Sure enough, they have had great success in forming the BRICS bloc  and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, whose citizens comprise two- thirds of the world's population.   China has been expanding its military production capabilities and is  now the world's fourth largest arms exporter. There has been a drastic  80 percent increase in Chinese military sales to regions across the  globe throughout the last decade. A growing number of United States  defense officials are expressing concerns about China's swift military  modernization.   At this rate, the United States cannot keep up with their prices and  turnaround, especially in regions like the Middle East, South Asia, and  Africa. Between 2017 and 2020, Chinese arms exports to sub-Saharan  Africa outpaced the United States by a ratio of nearly 3-to-1.   China has spread its malevolent influence this far simply because  China is determined to bolster our enemies and supplement them with  whatever they need to undermine democracy and our sovereignty.   China has allied with other iron-fisted regimes that are presently in  the crosshairs of U.S. sanctions, including some of the world's most  monstrous dictators, such as Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela and Russia's  Vladimir Putin.   China has shipped more than $12 million in drones to Russia since it  invaded Ukraine, indicating quiet collaboration between the two.   Recently, Chinese state-affiliated entities sold metals and  centrifuges to corporations affiliated with Iran's Ministry of Defense  and Armed Forces Logistics to aid in constructing Iran's first  hypersonic missile, which amplifies Iran's nuclear capabilities.   Despite debt-trapping Venezuela, China has remained their steadfast  ally, negotiating payment grace periods and concealing trades.   China has even gone so far as to support a veto of the 2019 U.S.- backed resolution in the United Nations calling for free and fair  presidential elections. The Maduro regime has become reliant on China  for disinformation campaigns and social control programs, including an  ID card that serves as a scorecard of loyal Venezuelan citizens to the  regime.   Close to $68 billion in loans has been given to Venezuela by China  since 2007, plus around 490 agreements have been signed in diverse  areas of investment. The exact nature of these investments is still yet  to be made public, but essentially everything comes down to extracting  Venezuela's rich mineral supply.   In addition, some of these quiet deals encompass state-affiliated  entities that have sold over $615 million worth of weapons to Venezuela  in the past 8 years.   This is the perfect example of the kind of mischief destabilization  the CCP is known for--preying on other countries via unsustainable and  corrupt lending while ignoring global labor and environmental standards  for their own economic gain.   Even with their own country, the CCP will only continue to enhance  their economic development. Forced labor has become common practice and  part of the CCP's plan for Xinjiang's economic development, which  includes making it a hub of textile and apparel manufacturing.   In fact, tens of thousands of Uyghurs detained in concentration camps  for religious persecution were sent to factories throughout China  linked to 83 global brands. To cover up a mass genocide and enslavement  of the Uyghur people, Chinese officials called the policy ``poverty  alleviation.''   More than a million Uyghurs are locked up in camps in their homeland  or blindfolded and transported to prison by truckloads. Brutal crimes  against Uyghur women, including forced sterilization and abortion, have  been carried out to diminish the Uyghur population. Children are taken  away from their parents and under pressure to deny their Uyghur  ancestry.   China's deep pockets have left its partners notably silent.  Prioritizing their economic ties and strategic relationships with  China, many other foreign governments continue to ignore human rights  abuses.   Taking another page out of Soviet Russia's book, propaganda,  censorship, and disinformation are pillars of the CCP's grand strategy  toward world domination. Their goal is to make the state and its  objectives appear favorable to the world while simultaneously  manipulating markets, lying, cheating, and stealing to fuel its  ceaseless attacks on democracy.   The COVID pandemic was the perfect example of what kind of propaganda  the China Communist Party is known for. Millions of Americans died of  the coronavirus. The epidemic was first reported in Wuhan, a city in  central China. However, instead of alerting the  [[Page H2955]]  global community in the early stages of the outbreak, the CCP sought to  cover up the severity of the coronavirus outbreak but also to carry out  a great propaganda campaign downplaying the severity of COVID-19,  attempting to shift responsibility and hide the origins of the virus.   I would hope the Biden administration and Congress would be willing  to step up to the plate and finally take a different approach toward  prevention and protecting the American people from the CCP's  unrelenting attempts to infringe on our national security. I hope that  as leaders of the free world we will take proactive steps to counter  the CCP's threat toward democracy and efforts to infiltrate our  sovereignty.   This is why I have introduced several bills that would hold China  accountable and protect our Nation's innovation, ideas, and way of  life.   Instead, we have senior officials of the DOJ colluding with the CCP  to have Chinese political asylees exiled from the United States to be  tortured and killed by CCP agents.   We have a President who promises to buy American but vetoes  legislation that has reinstated tariffs on solar panels from Chinese  companies in Southeast Asia. We have an administration actively  allowing the CCP to dodge responsibility for COVID.                                time  1215    Drug traffickers are smuggling fentanyl produced by China into the  United States through our unsecured borders killing millions of  Americans while benefiting China from a weakening America due to the  fentanyl epidemic.   There are ways we can legislate to make a safer, more secure, and  better America for the next generation. Here are 10 measures I have  introduced to counter the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party:   H. Con. Res. 51 is a concurrent resolution that makes it the opinion  of Congress that the Chinese Communist Party is the greatest threat to  freedom and the free world.   H.R. 4001 is a bill which includes a provision to prohibit the United  States from selling weaponry to the People's Republic of China and the  Chinese Communist Party.   H. Con. Res. 52 is a concurrent resolution condemning Cuba and the  Chinese Communist Party for discussing and implementing an agreement to  build a Chinese Communist Party spy base on the island of Cuba, 90  miles from the United States' coast.   H.R. 4000 is a bill to authorize the United States to bring civil  actions against the Government of the People's Republic of China for  harm suffered by the state as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.   H.R. 3757 is a bill to prohibit the availability of Federal funds to  institutions of higher education that fund the Confucius Institute.   H.R. 3664 is a bill to prohibit the availability of Federal funds to  the World Health Organization pending the conduct of an investigation  relating to the influence over such organization by the Chinese  Communist Party and for other purposes.   H.R. 3598 is a bill to direct the Secretary of State to conduct a  comprehensive study assessing the Chinese Communist Party's role in the  distribution of fentanyl in the United States.   H.R. 3597 is a bill to direct the President to impose sanctions on  the People's Republic of China.   H. Con. Res. 48 is a bill condemning the Chinese Communist Party for  the Wuhan Lab leak causing the deadly COVID-19 epidemic.   H. Res. 421 is a resolution expressing the sense of the House of  Representatives that the Chinese Communist Party should be held  accountable for present-day efforts of knowingly and intentionally  manipulating their currency.
