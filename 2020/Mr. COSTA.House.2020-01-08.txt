 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the impending  impacts of climate change on our planet and the unquestionable impact  that all of us are aware of.   Over the world, we see prolonged droughts fueling disastrous fires.  Over the last 6 months we have watched horrific bushfires in Australia  with tremendous losses. People have died, half a billion animals have  been lost, and millions of acres of land have been swallowed up by  flames.   As a lifelong resident of California, I have witnessed similar  devastation in  [[Page H18]]  our own communities as a result of climate change. The past 2 years  alone were the two worst fire seasons on record. Climate change has, no  doubt, heightened the impact of these fires which is why we are  witnessing these horrific impacts, and they are so difficult to manage.   Climate change is happening now and we must do more. For starters, we  must continue to make significant efforts to reduce our carbon  footprint. We must continue to invest in clean air and affordable  transportation made more readily available to all of our communities  throughout the country.   Last year, the House took strong steps to protect our planet in the  future by passing H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act. H.R. 9 confronts  the climate crisis by keeping us in the Paris Agreement, and demanding  a plan of action from the administration to participate in a meaningful  fashion. But that bill, along with hundreds of others, are currently  sitting on Senator McConnell's desk collecting dust, sadly.   These current events have made it clear that we have an imperative  need to act on this climate crisis. And while we wait for the Senate to  act, I am doing all that I can to make a difference in California as it  relates to our air quality, transportation, and our water needs that  are impacted.   As a member of the State legislature, years ago, I created the San  Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District to help monitor and  reduce pollution in the valley and improve our air quality, and we have  made progress.   I am also the cosponsor and helped to introduce the Clean Corridors  Act and the Clean School Bus Act that also reduced greenhouse gases.   We have also helped kick-start California's High-Speed Rail project  which will get millions of drivers out of their cars and into cleaner,  more accessible transportation, along with our inner-city  transportation, our intermodal concept to use all of the modes of  transportation more effectively for cleaner air quality.   I am also working on water legislation that will help improve  conservation and work toward a sustainable water supply for our farmers  and cleaner water for our communities throughout California.   California's broken water system is not suited to deal with the  increased volatility caused by climate change.   For those of you who are unaware, California gets most of its water,  its moisture, between November and March. The rains are important. They  are critical, and the snow in the mountains are Mother Nature's icebox.   With climate change, we see the droughts have become longer and more  intense, and the storms that we rely on for the snowpack are fewer and  are at a higher elevation, which means this incredible water system  that we have created over the last 100 years has to adapt to those  changes.   Food is a national security issue, not only in California, but in  America and throughout the world. Without a reliable supply of water,  we cannot grow food, not only for our Nation but for the planet, and so  this is a critical issue.    We need to understand that for 7 billion people on the planet in the  last 2 years--suggested to increase to 9 billion by the middle of this  century--the ability to provide a sustainable water supply for the  entire world and for us to grow food to feed our people in this country  is absolutely critical.   Therefore, we have a moral responsibility to be good stewards of this  planet that we call home for ourselves and for the future generations  to come.   As we begin the new year, let's work together now to find bipartisan,  commonsense solutions to help us pass along a better planet for future  generations to come. This, among all of the other difficult issues we  face, I believe, is the primary challenge of the 21st century.                            ____________________
