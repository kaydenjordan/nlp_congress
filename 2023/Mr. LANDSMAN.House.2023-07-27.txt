 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and work of  Sinead O'Connor. For me, Sinead was the first truly incredible singer  songwriter, and she made me think.   She made all of us think about justice and about fairness. She made  us think about who gets left behind and why it is on us to care for  those left out. She stood up for the most vulnerable, not only in her  songs, but at the expense of her own career.   Mr. Speaker, I will take this 1 minute to make sure that her family,  friends, and fans know how much she meant to so many of us.   May we all, especially those of us in Congress, honor her by fighting  for those in our communities who are most marginalized.                            ____________________
