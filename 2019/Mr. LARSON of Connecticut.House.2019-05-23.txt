 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the  SECURE Act and commend Chairman Neal and Republican Leader Brady for  the outstanding work on this, as well as our colleagues Ron Kind and  Mike Kelly. I also would like to single out Dave Reichert, who is no  longer here, and myself for the work that was done with regard to  volunteers.   The provisions of this bill in terms of aid and assistance to rank- and-file citizens are legendary--and I thank Mr. Neal again for those  efforts--but specifically for volunteer firefighters, for EMTs, and for  those who give selflessly in an opportunity to serve their communities.  For the meager amounts of uniforms and whatever they received in  compensation, to have that taxed was an insult. So I am proud, again,  to make sure that this piece of legislation included an opportunity for  volunteers all across this country. Twenty-three communities in my  State have volunteers.   I thank the chairman again for his leadership.
