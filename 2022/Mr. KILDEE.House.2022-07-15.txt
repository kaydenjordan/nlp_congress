 Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize a longtime  leader in our community, Mark Flegenheimer, as he retires from Michigan  Sugar.   Mark has been in the sugar industry for 40 years. He first started  with Michigan Sugar in 1994 before quickly moving up to become  president and CEO in 1998, where he succeeded his father.   At one point, the sugar beet industry was on the brink of collapse in  Michigan, a fate that many other communities across the country  suffered, but through Mark's leadership and the determination of the  beet growers and those who work with him, they got through these really  difficult times. During Mark's tenure, in fact, Michigan Sugar has  doubled its output while using 40 percent less energy to save costs and  to protect the environment.   In mid-Michigan, we have thousands of family farms, including sugar  beet growers. Every day they work with and depend on Michigan Sugar,  and so we thank Mark for all he has done over the years.    Mark is not only a great businessman but also a really good guy, a  great part of our community. He volunteers his time as a member of the  Delta College Foundation board of directors and as vice chairman of the  board at the Midland Center for the Arts.   Mark, thank you for your dedication to mid-Michigan, and  congratulations on your retirement.

Production of infant formula in this country isn't working properly.  It is not getting to the shelves, and it is denying families what they  need at the most important time in the development of the life of a  child. After product recalls, corporate consolidations, and obviously  pandemic-related supply chain issues, this is a real struggle for  American families.   As parents raising three kids, my wife and I empathize with those  anxious parents out there who are struggling to find formula for their  newborn children. That is why Congress has to act to increase imports  of formula until domestic production can get back to the point where we  can supply our domestic needs with our own production capacity.   However, as has been said, some formula imports are still subject to  really high tariffs, up to 27 percent, and there is no reason at this  moment that American families who are struggling should have to pay  that additional cost. They shouldn't have to pay more for something  that is absolutely necessary for their children.   That is why we introduced this legislation, supported by Republicans  and Democrats, to suspend these formula import tariffs for the rest of  the year and to lower costs for families with children. I really do  urge my colleagues, all of us, to join. This is something we ought to  be able to do together to immediately reduce prices  [[Page H6631]]  for families who have needs, for families with small children, to make  sure that until we can get our domestic production back online, we can  supply what we need at a cost that is affordable to those families that  are simply trying to take care of their kids. That is our obligation.  That is why we swore the oath to come here and do this work. We have  the tools in our hands to get this done.   I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort.
