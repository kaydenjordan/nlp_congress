 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  1, the For the People Act.   I am an engineer, and as an engineer, I fix things that are broken,  but it doesn't take an engineer to tell you that our politics is  broken. Confidence in our government and in the House of  Representatives has never been lower.   We have a system of gerrymandering where in many parts of the country  today, voters don't choose their politicians, politicians choose their  voters.   Special interest money has drowned out the voices of working people.   H.R. 1 is an opportunity to fix this imbalance. H.R. 1 will ensure  the peoples' voices are heard at the ballot box.   H.R. 1 will ensure the influence of big money in our politics and our  policies is ended.   H.R. 1 will ensure the voices of the people are heard.   Passing this bill is a moral imperative for our democracy and our  Nation.                            ____________________
