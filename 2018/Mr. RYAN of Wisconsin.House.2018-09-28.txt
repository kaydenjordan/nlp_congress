 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about something that is really  close to all of our hearts. We have reached a point in this country  where opioid overdoses claim more than 100 lives each and every single  day.   Think about that for a moment, more than 100 lives every day. Mothers  and fathers are burying sons and daughters, or in some cases, sons and  daughters are burying mothers and fathers.   I bring this up simply to impart the gravity of the situation, which  makes our response all the more urgent. But while the situation is  certainly grave, that does not mean that we should ever lose hope.   As we have worked on this legislation we will soon send to the  President, we all had to go out and gain an understanding of the facts  on this issue. Everybody on both sides of the aisle spent so much time  on this bill. In doing that, we have gleaned so much understanding.   And that is, after all, how our Republic works. That is what the  people's House does. We learn from our constituents. We hear their  stories. We see the suffering, and then we act.   This is a fantastic moment of people coming together to solve a  problem. I think, in this process, we gained something very special.   Many of us heard the stories from incredible souls who have known  unspeakable loneliness and who struggle with drug addiction. They made  it through to the other side.    We met family members and friends who have known the pain and the  fear that accompanies loving someone wrestling with addiction. Every  one of us knows somebody or is related to somebody who has gone through  this.   We met those who will never again have the chance to see the ones  that they love so much.   Amid the overwhelming darkness, we have gotten to see their spark,  their strength. From this pain has come something more powerful:  resolve and a passion to make sure that others have a safe place to  turn, that this doesn't happen to their family.   Witnessing this kind of strength, witnessing this kind of resilience,  that is what helped produce this legislation. Through these bills, we  are trying to ensure that anyone who needs help is not too isolated to  receive it.   We are giving our communities the resources that they need to provide  stronger treatment networks and support systems. That is where the  healing happens. That is where Americans are at our best.   If this legislation can save one life and bring help to one person,  that is what matters.   It is going to do far more than that.                                time  1100    So I want to thank all of those who were brave enough to share their  stories with all of us. I want to thank all of those people who all of  us met with  [[Page H9246]]  for being brave, for coming here, for meeting us, and for testifying  and giving us their stories. And for all of those who are continuing to  struggle in silence, I want them to know that there is no shame in  their trials. In our own ways, we all fall.   In our Catholic tradition, we look to St. Jude as the patron saint of  lost causes, a keeper of those who some in society may have written  off. To me, his guardianship is written in this legislation. There are  no lost causes. No one is permanently down. It is about offering a  helping hand, and it is about opening our hearts.   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of this legislation. I am so thankful to  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who came together to put these  families and to put these communities first.
