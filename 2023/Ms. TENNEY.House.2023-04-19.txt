 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I was a female athlete many years ago and didn't have  access to Title IX like women do today. I was a competitive basketball  player, equestrian, and, yes, the 1975 teenage curling champion from  Utica, New York. Some of these sports are sports where women and men  can compete equally, and some are not.   I recently attended an event with Riley Gaines, the brave young woman  who is standing up for women against the NCAA's unfairness in the  women's swimming championship.   Riley Gaines tied for first with a biological male and was denied the  ability to get her trophy. In fact, they sent it to her in the mail.  She couldn't stand on the podium because she was told by an NCAA  official that they needed a photo op to put the biological male in that  place, a person who had competed as a male for 3 years unsuccessfully  before coming in and reaching the top of the women's championships.   Unfortunately, Riley did not get to have that title. She did not get  to sit on the podium.   Today, House Republicans are standing up for Riley and women like  her.    Mr. Chair, this type of unfair competition weakens Title  IX protections. I hope that we will all join in and protect women's  sports, especially when we have worked so hard as women to gain these  rights for women, our grandchildren, and our children of tomorrow.   I thank the sponsor, Mr. Steube, and I thank Dr. Foxx for putting  this bill on the floor and for her advocacy.
