 Mr. President, the Klamath Tribes in Oregon have  a saying: ``We help each other; We will live good.'' These words are  neither hollow nor trivial to the members of these Tribes. They live  them each and every day and never more so than when disaster strikes.  When the Two Four Two Fire raged through the Chiloquin Ranger District  of the Fremont-Winema National Forest last September, scorching over  14,000 acres, destroying homes and traditional hunting and fishing  sites, members of the Tribes rallied together, opening their doors,  their hearts, and their wallets to help their fellow Oregonians in a  time of great need.   They brought those eight words--``We help each other; We will live  good''--to life.   When emergency personnel needed a large, open area to establish an  evacuation shelter for all those who had to  [[Page S816]]  flee their homes ahead of the inferno, the Tribes immediately offered  up the parking lot the Kla-Mo-Ya Casino for their use.   When the firefighters tasked with containing the fire needed a  massive open space to stage their ample equipment, those same expansive  parking lots were readily provided to them.   At the same time, the doors of their hotel were thrown open to anyone  displaced by the fire, to Tribal and non-Tribal members alike who were  in need of shelter. In the middle of a pandemic, with all manner of  precautions in place to keep folks healthy and safe, that was no easy  feat, but they did it, all while also welcoming the Red Cross inside to  set up a response center, as well.   As the forests burned around it, the Kla-Mo-Ya Casino stood there  like the eye of a hurricane. It became a center of help and healing, of  safety and shelter. Had they just done those things, the Klamath Tribes  would have already gone far above and beyond to support Tribal members  and community members alike. They didn't stop, however, with providing  the use of their hotel and its facilities to first responders and to  those in need.   No. Klamath Tribal Behavioral Health went out and provided assistance  and services to anyone who had been affected and displaced, free of  charge. Whether they were Tribal members or not, it didn't matter.  Those who needed help were able to get it. They helped feed the  firefighters risking their lives fighting the infernos, emergency  volunteers helping others, and even evacuees.   And even now, some 5 months after the worst of the fire's carnage,  the Klamath Tribes are still doing what they can to help those whose  lives were turned upside down by it. A GoFundMe account has been set up  to help any family who lost their home or their property to the Two  Four Two Fire rebuild and start to get back up on their feet again. The  distribution of the money raised by the account is still a work in  progress. The Tribes are fine-tuning the priority system and how folks  will apply for it. But once all of that is worked out, this is going to  be a tremendous help to so many of our friends and neighbors who have  endured such heartbreak and hardship.   ``We help each other; We will live good.'' There is no question that  the members of the Klamath Tribes have helped those in need across  southern Oregon through an unimaginably difficult time. We are all  deeply grateful for everything they have done, both during the Two Four  Two Fire and afterward. And we will all be better off as a State and as  a community because of their kindness and generosity of spirit.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this month our country is joining  together in celebration of Black History Month. It is a month for all  of us to recognize the indescribable impact that Black Americans have  left made on our Nation; to recommit ourselves to the struggle to  achieve and ensure racial justice throughout our land; and, of course,  to celebrate Black culture and all of its contributions to America  past, present, and future. Few institutions are more connected or have  been more central to Black culture than the barbershop and beauty  salon. As described by the Smithsonian's National Museum of African  American History and Culture, for generations, men and women have been  going to these businesses not just for hair care, but for the sense of  community and security they provide. Black Americans go to spend time  among peers, playing cards or chess, sharing the latest local news and  engaging in passionate debates about politics. Men and women go in to  these businesses for friendship and mentorship and to be engaged in the  affairs of their neighbors and their community.   For 30 years, this was particularly true of Geneva's Shear Perfection  Barber & Beauty Salon in northeast Portland. Since opening its doors in  1991, Geneva's has been a hub for Portland's African-American  community, welcoming over 1,000 people through its doors every month.  Folks from Michael Jordan and Muhammed Ali, to members of the Portland  Trailblazers, sat in its chairs. But more importantly, it stood as the  heart for three generations of Black Portlanders who first walked  through Geneva's doors as children with their parents and then went on  to bring their own sons and daughters for their first haircuts, even as  the area around this local institution underwent the kind of  gentrification that pushed Black families further and further away.   But it wasn't only the barbershop itself that is considered an  institution of the Portland community--so is the Knauls family who  owned and operated it for three decades. Geneva Knauls, who passed away  in 2014, was our State's first Black female barber. Throughout her  years as a businesswoman, Geneva supported all different kinds of local  grassroots projects and organizations, and become one of the most  beloved people in the northeast Portland community. Her status is only  equaled by her husband's, Mr. Paul Knauls, Sr., who is affectionately  known around town as the Mayor of Northeast Portland. From 1963 to  1970, Mr. Knauls owned and ran the Cotton Club, which was the place for  jazz and soul music, welcoming such big names as Etta James, Big Mama  Thornton, and Sammy Davis, Jr., to its stage to serenade music-loving  Portlanders. He sold the Cotton Club in 1970 and went on to open a  series of others throughout town before finally opening Geneva's. All  the while, throughout all of his business adventures, Paul has been  active in other ways throughout the community. He worked with the  Junior Achievement Program at both Humboldt and Jefferson schools,  tutored in the HOSTS--Help One Student to Succeed--program at King  School, and served for 6 years on the board of the Urban League.   Last year, Mr. Knauls and his son, Paul Jr., decided it was finally  time to take a break and close the doors of Geneva's. It was also a  decision made out of a recognition of the difficult new realities of  trying to operate a personal care business in the midst of an  unprecedented national and global pandemic. Sadly, the Knauls and  Geneva's are not alone. Many businesses have been forced to confront  life amid the COVID pandemic and BIPOC-owned businesses and communities  have been disproportionately impacted. Last year's announcement of the  closure of Geneva's Shear Perfection Barber & Beauty Salon was  understandably met with an emotional outpouring from local Portlanders.  Men and women who had been going to the shop their entire lives took to  the shop's Facebook page to thank the Knauls family for their  contributions to the community and to share some fond memories.  Statements came from local leaders and celebrities touting Geneva's  legacy, as one person put it, as ``one of the most important examples  of a black business that represented more to the community than just a  place to get a haircut.''   And a year after its closing, that legacy continues to endure.  Geneva's Facebook page is brimming with pictures of young men in  graduation robes in front of the salon, of a turkey giveaway in its  parking lot that took place this past Thanksgiving to help provide for  families in need, and announcements from other local Black business  owners who are moving into the space to continue the Knauls family's  entrepreneurial spirit. And the legacy of ``The Mayor'' and his iconic  standing in the community remains as strong today as it ever has; even  after celebrating Mr. Knaul's 90th birthday age and the pandemic have  not stopped Paul Knauls, Sr., from putting on two masks to go out for  daily walks in his neighborhood and around the Lloyd Center. For his  90th birthday last month, the nonprofit World Arts Foundation streamed  a live storytelling event, featuring decades of friends, employees, and  admirers to help him celebrate.   I know that Portlanders everywhere will join me in expressing the  immense gratitude to Geneva's Shear Perfection Barber & Beauty Salon  and to the Knauls family for all that they have done for the community.  Northeast Portland certainly won't be the same without Geneva's, but  everyone who walked through those doors over the last 30 years has had  their lives  [[Page S817]]  touched and impacted by it in ways both big and small. And it is  reassuring to know that, through each of them, Geneva's legacy, the  legacy of the Black barbershop and salon, the legacy of community and  friendship and looking out for one another, will continue to endure.                            ____________________
