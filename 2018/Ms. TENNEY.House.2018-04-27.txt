 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable  public servant and close friend in New York's 22nd District, Mr. James  Zecca, of Utica, New York.   At the end of May, Jim will retire from his position as the director  of the Madison County Department of Solid Waste and Sanitation, a  position he started and created in 1988. A few years ago, a colleague  of Jim's said that his ``forward thinking attitude and determination  has made Madison County a leader in recycling in New York State.'' He  ensured the county was open and transparent to everyone, always  including the community as a whole in every process.   Even though he works in Madison County during the day, Jim has served  his community, his own community in Utica, the city of Utica, for many  years. He served as a city councilman representing the Second District,  and also a councilman-at-large during his time on the Utica Common  Council.   Jim has always been a champion of the little guy, the small-business  owner, and the citizens who have been hurt by government incompetence,  overreach, and yes, even corruption.   It is my honor to congratulate Jim on 30 years of exceptional service  to Madison County and our entire community. His hard work, courage, and  compassion will be missed by all.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in  congratulating Jim on his retirement, and best wishes for the future,  and also, for his tireless effort in making America great again.   Congratulations, Jim.                            ____________________
