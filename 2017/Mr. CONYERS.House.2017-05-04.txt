 Mr. Speaker, I have been here for five decades, and I  can't recall a time when we have debated something so obviously harmful  to seniors and working people in this country. This bill strips health  care from 24 million people. It requires seniors to pay sometimes 100  percent or more of their income in premiums.   This legislation drastically and dramatically cuts Medicaid, directly  contradicting President Trump's claim not to.   In Michigan, half of all children rely on Medicaid. In my district  alone, 56,000 people will lose coverage, including 16,000 children and  3,200 seniors.   Let's be clear. If we pass this bill, people will die. Health care is  a right and not a privilege.
