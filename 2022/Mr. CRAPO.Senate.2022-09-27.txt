 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator Jim  Risch and Representative Russ Fulcher, we thank Dan Dinning for serving  as Boundary County commissioner for more than 20 years.   Dan Dinning began his service as Boundary County commissioner in 2001  and, throughout, worked steadily to strengthen his community. A native  of Boundary County who attended the University of Idaho, Commissioner  Dinning has been the longest serving commissioner for his county. This  comes as no surprise, given his deep commitment to his hometown,  Bonners Ferry, Boundary County, and Idaho.   Dan is extremely hard working, and we are told there has rarely been  a meeting in Boundary County that Dan did not attend. This dedication  is also apparent in the remarkable number of State and community groups  he has served in and led. This includes the Governor's appointment of  Commissioner Dinning to serve on the Idaho Roadless Rule Commission.  Dan served on the Selkirk-Cabinet Yaak Grizzly Bear Conservation  Subcommittee; multiple committees for the Idaho Association of  Counties; served as chair for the Idaho Department of Environmental  Quality Panhandle Basin Advisory Group; and so much more.   Natural resources issues in north Idaho, like in many parts of Idaho  and the West, tend to be very controversial, and Commissioner Dinning  has not shied away from those challenges. When meetings grew  contentious, Dan was always a calm voice reminding attendees that we  all care about the same things, just disagree on possible solutions. He  rarely is the first one to speak. Rather, he listens first and then  makes thoughtful comments. These productive characteristics have been  instrumental in his leadership in starting and sustaining the Kootenai  Valley Resource Initiative, KVRI. KVRI changed the tone of natural  resource conversations, and tensions eased as the community saw what  collaboration can accomplish.   In preparing this tribute, there was no shortage of great thoughts  and stories that have been shared about Dan Dinning. They include a  touching moment shared by Patty Perry about a trip to Washington, DC,  when Dan was adamant about visiting the Vietnam Memorial Wall. His  reason was to find a family's son's name on the wall and create a  rubbing to bring home to them in Boundary County, since they would  never get to see it. Patty recalled that, of course, it brought tears  and was a reflection of the kind of guy Dan is.  [[Page S5050]]    Dan is a man of high moral character, a salt of the earth, family man  devoted to his community. Of all his achievements, we hear that he  would cite his family as his greatest accomplishment. He and his wife  Mary have three children, Lisa, Brian and Kevin; two granddaughters;  and three grandsons. Thank you, Dan, for your service to your beloved  community, county, and the entire State of Idaho. We look forward to  continuing to hear your stories and you sharing your deeply valued  thoughts and perspective with us on how to continue to strengthen our  great State.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I honor Alex Irby, of Orofino, ID,  for his many years of natural resources and collaborative work in the  Clearwater Basin of Idaho.   More than 14 years ago, Alex Irby and Dale Harris asked for my help  with setting up and supporting the Clearwater Basin Collaborative, CBC.  They love this wonderful part of Idaho and put their hard work into  pulling together a collaborative effort to resolve natural resources  challenges in the area. Alex even dedicated 10 years to serving as  cochair of the CBC. The focus of the collaborative was to support the  Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests to get work done on the ground  and save the local sawmills in the area. We launched the CBC in May of  2008, and the CBC has had an important role in furthering discussions  about the management of the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests and  achieved much-needed restoration of landscapes, including water quality  improvements, which are also providing a supply of raw materials to our  local mills.   The accomplishments of the CBC and the fact it is still going strong  today is due in large part to the forethought and commitment of Alex  Irby, the Nez Perce Tribe, and the other partners in the collaborative  effort. Alex brought his decades of natural resources experience to the  collaborative table. In 1959, at the age of 16, Alex started fighting  fires for the Clearwater-Potlatch Timber Protection Association, C- PTPA, with roots in Idaho stretching back more than 100 years. Alex  worked for C-PTPA for 26 years. He also worked for Konkolville Lumber  Company from 1984 to 2000, and he served as an Idaho Fish and Game  Commissioner for 8 years, starting in 1999. After his service to the  Idaho Fish and Game Commission ended in 2007, Alex served as the Idaho  Fish and Game Representative to the Idaho Outfitters and Guides  Licensing Board, with his position ending in 2014. His other  contributions to the natural resources sector include his service with  his local soil and water conservation district and rural fire district.  Alex is also a founder of PLAY, Public Lands Access Year-Round, started  in 1999 to work with public land managers, to help ensure more roads  and trails remain open for continued motorized access for off highway  vehicles.   To this day, Alex is out cutting trail and hunting in the Clearwater  Basin. He has a wealth of knowledge and history of the area and backs  the responsibility of taking care of our public lands with hard work  and know-how. He is willing to work with anyone who is a team player.  Thank you, Alex Irby, for your remarkable contributions of your time  and talents to improving and sustaining an amazing part of our great  State and country.                            ____________________
