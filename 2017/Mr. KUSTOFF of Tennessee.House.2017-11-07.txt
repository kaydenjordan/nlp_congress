 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Save Local Business Act, legislation that will protect our small  business operations and end harmful and excessive government overreach.   For 30 years, small businesses operated successfully under a joint  employer policy that was fair, stable, and crystal clear.  Unfortunately, in 2015, the National Labor Relations Board, under the  previous administration, decided to insert itself and overcomplicate  the important employer-employee relationship. The unelected bureaucrats  at the NLRB stifled small businesses when they decided to step in and  blur the lines of responsibility.   Sadly, our working families were impacted when the NLRB decided to  empower labor union special interests. The last thing our independent  businessowners need is more government red tape that will prevent them  from reaching their full potential.   The NLRB's expanded joint employer scheme discourages large companies  from doing business with our smaller local companies. The effects are  incredibly far-reaching. The expanded joint employer rule harms  countless industries across the country, particularly small  franchisees, construction companies, and service providers.   For example, ServiceMaster, a global company with more than 33,000  employees, has chosen to locate its headquarters in Memphis, Tennessee.  A great deal of my constituents work for ServiceMaster Franchise  Service Group, and the NLRB rule change has put their job security in  jeopardy.   We have all heard concerns from our constituents, and now we can do  something to get government off our backs. We must look out for  hardworking Americans and roll back these oppressive job-killing rules.  I am pleased that the Save Local Business Act will undo this  unreasonable regulatory burden, and I thank Congressman Byrne for his  leadership in this effort.
