 Madam President, today, every Senator will be able to  take a clear moral stand. We will have the chance to proceed to  commonsense legislation that will move our Nation closer to the  international mainstream with respect to defending innocent human life.  There are only seven nations left in the entire world where an unborn  child can be killed by elective abortion after 20 weeks, and the United  States of America, unfortunately, is one of them.   Set aside all of the far-left rhetoric that will greet Senator  Graham's straightforward legislation and consider this simple fact: Do  our Democratic colleagues really believe that what our country needs is  a radical fringe position on elective abortion that we only share with  China, North Korea, and four other countries in the entire world?   The American people don't seem to think that is what we need. One  recent survey found that 70 percent of all Americans believe that at a  minimum--at a minimum--elective abortion should be limited to the first  3 months of pregnancy. That even includes about half of the respondents  who self-identify as pro-choice.   I hope this body will proceed to Senator Graham's Pain-Capable Unborn  Child Protection Act later today. I see no reason why at the very least  our Democratic colleagues should vote against even proceeding to this  legislation and having a debate. If there is a persuasive and  principled case why America should remain on the radical international  fringe on this subject, let us hear it. Let us have the debate. Few  Americans agree with that radical position, but let's have the debate.   If my Democratic colleagues block the Senate from even proceeding to  consider this legislation here today, the message they will send will  be chilling and clear. The radical demands of the far left will  drown out common sense and the views of most Americans.    The same goes for Senator Sasse's legislation, the Born-Alive  Survivors Protection Act. Even if most Washington Democrats persist in  their resistance to any commonsense protections for the unborn, surely,  we must  [[Page S1124]]  be able to agree that children who are born deserve protection. Surely,  that much cannot be controversial.   There is currently no Federal mandate that children who are delivered  alive following an attempted abortion should receive medical care.  There is no clear guarantee that every child born alive in the United  States, whether they were intended to be or not, is entitled to the  same life-giving medical attention.   The Kentuckians whom I speak with cannot comprehend why this could be  some hotly debated proposition. It almost defies belief that an entire  political party can find cause to object to this basic protection for  babies. Yet, today, we will see if our Democratic colleagues will even  permit the Senate to proceed to this legislation. We will see whether  even something this simple and this morally straightforward is a bridge  too far for the far left.   I would urge all of my colleagues: Let's advance these bills. Let's  take these modest steps. Let's have the courage to say that the right  to life must not exclude the most vulnerable among us.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a totally different matter, I have  a duty this morning that somehow ranks among my most favorite  activities and least favorite activities simultaneously. The good news  is that I get to recognize a key member of my staff whom I have come to  know and admire a great deal. The bad news is the occasion. This week,  after 15 years of outstanding service, he is bidding farewell to the  Senate. So I am unhappy with the circumstances, but I could not be more  happy to talk about Jay Khosla.   For just shy of 2 years, Jay has served as my chief economic policy  counsel. Trade, taxes, banking, and financial services; pensions and  retirement; housing--for 2 years, any answer I needed on any of these  subjects was one phone call, one email, or one quick meeting away. You  can go a long way in this town if you master either the policy details  of big issues or the politics surrounding those issues. Jay has  mastered both.   When you have a lot of talent and intelligence, major projects tend  to find their way to your desk. So consider the fact that Jay has been  at the center of practically every major economic policy achievement  over the past decade-plus.   Jay arrived as a young healthcare staffer for then-Majority Leader  Bill Frist. Talk about an opening act--not just working for a majority  leader, but one who is also an M.D. and who is focused on healthcare.  The bar was set high, but Jay, of course, exceeded it.   He moved to the Budget Committee and then crafted policy for Senator  McCain's Presidential campaign. Then, he returned to work for Senator  Hatch and the Finance Committee. Before long, Jay was Senator Hatch's  secret weapon. As he rose through the ranks to policy director and then  to staff director, he rapidly became a not-so-secret weapon. He was an  invaluable asset to the chairman, to the committee, and, really, to our  entire conference.   His relationships extended across the aisle as well. Our Democratic  colleagues respect him greatly. His colleagues on the committee  remember that, even when it might have been easier to pull back behind  party lines and just try to craft a bill within the majority, Jay  stayed stubbornly dedicated to the bipartisan process as long as  possible.   A team player, an honest broker, Jay doesn't want to just get big  things done, he wants to get them done the right way. From trade  promotion authority in 2015 and historic tax reform in 2017, to USMCA  this past year, these huge accomplishments and many more, like fighting  the opioid epidemic and fixing the dysfunctional sustainable growth  rate that has plagued Medicare--all of these issues had this staff  leader right at the center. In many cases, his work started months or  years in advance, meeting with leaders, pouring the foundation for new  policy, and staying on the case right through to the finish line.   Needless to say, this is a resume that, basically, anyone in  Washington would kill for, but effectiveness is only part of Jay's  magic. The colleagues whom Jay supervised at the Finance Committee  remember a boss who was kind, generous, patient, and unflappable, even  as he guided them through legislation of the highest consequence.   More recently, we in the majority leader's office have relished his  laugh-out-loud punch lines, his deadpan sarcasm, and his creative  nicknames. Jay is willing to take everyone down a peg when they need  it, including himself.   I have worked with all kinds of talented staff, but I have to say  that the demeanor that Jay brings to work is somewhat unique. Despite  being so knowledgeable, connected, and hard-working, Jay seems to flow  through all the challenges with a confidence and calmness that almost  borders on relaxation. If you didn't know better, you would almost be  suspicious. Somehow, you never see Jay sweat--well, at least not in the  office, anyway.   Jay's colleagues like to rib him about the personal training regimen  he maintains, along with the ultra-healthy diet and other enviable  aspects of work-life balance that he somehow manages to carve out in  this place that is so notorious for none of that. It is all part of the  unique Jay Khosla magic.   This is someone who has been known to reply to serious email  inquiries with a funny photo of a cat dangling from a tree branch,  captioned ``Hang In There!''   Jay is someone who frequently concludes his answers to pressing  questions, including from Senators, with a smile and this catchphrase:  ``I have a feeling it's all going to work out.''   Somebody less accomplished would never get away with this. From  someone with less mastery of the details, you would scoff and find  someone else to talk with, but when it is Jay, you know everything will  actually work out because he is the one on the case. Jay helps make  everyone around him as calm, confident, and cheerful as he is. It is  not just because of his charisma. It is because he is so good at what  he does. So, look, it is never fun to bid farewell to someone who is a  big part of the brains of your operation, and it is never fun to say  goodbye to someone who is a big part of the heart of your team either,  and it is really no fun to say goodbye to somebody who has managed to  be both.    Jay has only formally worked for me for a couple of years, but he has  been a trusted advisor and an honorary part of my team for a lot  longer. He has been a big part of the Senate for more than a decade.   When I say that Jay knows how to prioritize, I mean it, and his real  bottom line is family. He and his beloved wife Lisa have two boys, Shya  and Asher. They form a tight-knit unit together with Jay's parents,  Vijay and Suman, and his sister Anchal and beyond. Jay may have made it  look suspiciously easy all these years, but jobs like this are never  easy, least of all on your family. It turns out that the Khosla clan  would like to see a little more of this guy, and Jay doesn't mind the  sound of a new chapter and some new challenges either.   We are really going to miss him. We thank him for everything. We feel  certain his next chapters will bring new happiness all their own. As a  wise man once told me, ``I have a feeling it's all going to work out.''                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the  order of January 31 to allow Senators to have until Thursday, February  27, 2020, to have printed statements and opinions in the Congressional  Record, if they choose, explaining their votes and include those in the  documentation of the impeachment proceedings; finally, I ask that the  two-page rule be waived.    Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Thursday, February 27; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; finally,  following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and  resume consideration of the Greaves nomination, under the previous  order.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand  adjourned, under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:38 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, February 27, 2020, at 9:30 a.m.                            ____________________
