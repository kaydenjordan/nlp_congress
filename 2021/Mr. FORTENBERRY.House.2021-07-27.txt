 Madam Speaker, first, let me acknowledge the  leadership of our committee, the chair, Rosa DeLauro, and our Ranking  Member Kay Granger particularly, in this sense, for their attempt to  navigate this contentious process in which there really are areas of  mutuality but are, unfortunately, marked also by irreconcilable  differences.    With that said, the agriculture component of this bill does reflect  the cooperative spirit of both the American agricultural community as  well as this subcommittee.   Agriculture has the unique ability to unite across political, social,  and economic divides, and I am particularly grateful to Chairman Bishop  and his staff for producing a reasonable base bill here that we all  hope can be refined as it moves through the process.   Madam Speaker, production agriculture is a mainstay of America's  economy. The vastness of our land, our ingenuity, and our technological  prowess allow our Nation to provide the most abundant, low-cost,  nutritious, and diverse array of foods found anywhere. Our trade  imbalance would be so much greater were it not for this remarkable  success.   We are also empowered to meet our country's charitable impulse by  moving approximately $2 billion in aid to persons overseas facing food  insecurity. Investments in this bill build upon this amazing  productivity.   Here are some important highlights. There is:   Support for what I call the Farm of the Future to enhance efficiency,  regenerative capacity, and new forms of small-scale niche agriculture  that marry high-tech with high-touch and, again, connect the farm to  the family;   Support for the Farm to School program, bringing healthy, nutritious  food choices to children;   Strengthened partnerships between minority-serving institutions  within our land-grant system;   Increased support for rural broadband and what I call the ecosystem  of livability;   More resources for unannounced drug plant inspections in China and  India as well as a commitment to environmental security through  investments in better cover crop practices and control of fertilizer  runoff.                                time  1615    Now, here are the needed fixes. Ranking Member Granger has been right  and clear in her remarks that the proposed nondefense increases across  these bills are way too high, 10 percent in this bill alone.   The bill also contains an unauthorized nutrition program that grants  unlimited funding in the final quarter.  [[Page H4053]]  That is for the authorizing committee to take up.   The bill also has a provision that makes unnecessary changes to a  meat and poultry processing program that Secretary Vilsack originally  proposed in the Obama administration.   I believe that we can fix these matters and, hopefully, move toward  an agreement as this bill moves through the process.    Madam Speaker, there is another issue that I am  compelled to speak about regarding spending here. It is called the Hyde  amendment.   The Hyde amendment prevents taxpayer money for abortion, and this has  remained a bipartisan compact in this institution for decades. Before  now, little in Washington has been this stable or stabilizing, with the  American people in clear agreement. Nearly 60 percent of Americans  agree that taxpayer money should not be used for abortion. Now it is  gone.   When you look at the statistic regarding exporting abortion overseas,  which we will potentially do if all of this passes, the percent of  American people disagreeing with that jumps to 80 percent.   That is right, we are about to export our most divisive cultural  issue, our pain, our woundedness, on to the poor of the world. Pope  Francis has called this ideological colonization. It is unfair, it is  wrong, and it smacks of arrogance and elitism.   Madam Speaker, we really are living in an age of contradiction. We  say we want inclusivity, we say we want tolerance, we say we want to be  an authentic community and protect the dignity and rights of all  persons except one group of people, the expectant mother and her unborn  child. Today we will break a near 50-year-old agreement to not use  taxpayer dollars to fund abortion here or overseas. I am heartbroken.
