 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleagues,  Susan Davis, Scott Peters,   Mike Levin, and Chairwoman Maxine Waters,  to honor Mrs. Fahari Jeffers, who passed away on October 30, for her  outstanding actions as a tireless civil rights and labor leader and  motivator and as the cofounder of the United Domestic Workers of  America.   In 1977, Fahari Jeffers and her husband, Ken Msemaji, formed the  United Domestic Workers organizing committee under the mentorship of  Cesar Chavez. It was the first known labor organization for domestic  workers in the United States of America and only the third labor union  in U.S. labor history to be founded by Latinos or African Americans.   Additionally, Mrs. Jeffers served as United Domestic Workers'  secretary-treasurer and first general counsel until 2005.   Ms. Jeffers worked tirelessly as lead negotiator for all union  contracts throughout the State of California, pursuing life  improvements that helped millions of Americans in the State and  nationwide.   Her model collective bargain rights law of 1999 is patterned across  California and the Nation, where over 2 million home care workers enjoy  union rights. Fahari regarded writing this legislation as one of her  proudest accomplishments.   Asserting rights for our Nation's domestic workers gave way to the  passage of the first-ever Federal Domestic Workers Bill of Rights in  2013.   Mrs. Jeffers used her skills and experience to represent and defend  the rights of one of the most underrepresented and underpaid working  groups in our society: our home care workers, who clean, cook, and  provide personal care assistance to the sick and disabled.   In 2018, Fahari was inducted into the San Diego County Women's Hall  of Fame.   At home in National City, the devoutly Catholic couple adopted 16  children over the years. Survivors include her husband of 44 years, Ken  Msemaji; her siblings, Rose Glasford of Bermuda, Karama Broach of North  Carolina, Joe Jeffers of Colorado, Vickie Jeffers of North Carolina,  and Dr. Adam Jeffers of the United Arab Emirates; and her adopted  children.   We would like to honor Fahari Jeffers for her dedication and lifelong  commitment to civil rights, the labor movement, and the community.   I ask that Members and guests in the gallery rise for a moment of  silence.                            ____________________
