 Mr. Speaker, how is this unconstitutional?  H.R. 51 violates our Founders' intent, the actual writ of the  Constitution, the land itself, which should rightfully be returned to  Maryland if its original purpose as land for our Nation's Capital is  discarded by Congress and, finally, the required repeal of the 23rd  Amendment.   I have explained these constitutional barriers for 2 years in  committee, but there is more.   D.C. does not perform many of the roles of a true State. A prime  example, unlike every other State in the Union, D.C. is not responsible  for its prison system.   About 8,000 D.C. residents are inmates in Federal prisons, and the  Federal Government absorbs the huge expense. These are inmates who  would normally be in a State prison, but D.C. only has the capacity to  house inmates awaiting trial.   Three times in committee, I have offered an amendment that would  transfer this normal State responsibility to D.C. My amendment was  rejected by Democrats three times.   So, let's look at how D.C. has handled their inmates awaiting trial.  According to The Washington Post, D.C. is essentially torturing these  inmates with what experts say is mass solitary confinement, 23 hours a  day of solitary for every D.C. inmate ongoing for over 400 days.   That is certainly a violation of the Eighth Amendment. These are  human beings awaiting final adjudication. Many will ultimately be found  not guilty, yet they have been held in solitary confinement for 23  hours every day for over a year.   Is this what we can expect from a D.C. State?   D.C. is our Nation's Capital, was intended to be our Nation's  Capital, and must remain our Nation's Capital.
