 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Diesel  Emissions Reduction Act, a bill that will reduce diesel emissions and  protect public health by reauthorizing the EPA's DERA program.   Emissions from diesel engines are a significant source of our  nation's greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA has long linked direct  emissions from these engines to premature deaths, lung cancer, and  increased risk of asthma.   Since 2008, DERA has awarded over $600 million in funding to replace  or retrofit over 65,000 older diesel engines with American-made clean  diesel technology. The EPA estimates that the cleaner-burning engines  will reduce 5 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions and lead to $19  billion in health benefits over the lifetime of the affected engines.  Additionally, the EPA estimates that for every federal dollar spent,  DERA projects generate up to $30 in public health benefits and over $2  in fuel savings.   It is no wonder that DERA has enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan  support. The most recent DERA reauthorization passed unanimously in the  Senate and by voice vote in the House in 2010. While DERA's  authorization expired in FY 2016, I have been proud to work with  Representative's Matsui and Barragan to secure robust funding for the  program.   With an estimated 40 percent of our nation's heavy-duty diesel  vehicles operating without clean technology, the DERA program is still  desperately needed.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes to reauthorize this popular and  cost-effective program.
