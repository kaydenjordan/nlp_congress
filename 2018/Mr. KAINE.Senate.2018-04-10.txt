 Mr. President, the opioid and addiction epidemic continues  to devastate communities across our country today. One of the greatest  challenges for the 21 million Americans currently impacted by substance  use disorder is to obtain and maintain employment while sustaining  recovery. For the benefit of our Nation, we must work to implement  interventions to improve employment rates among this chronically  unemployed and underemployed population in treatment and recovery.   Research demonstrates that alignment of job training and treatment  services improves employment attainment, employee earnings, and  substance use disorder treatment outcomes, including lower rates of  relapse. By holding a job, an individual establishes a legal source of  income, structured use of time, and improved self-esteem, which in term  may reduce substance use and boost our economy.   The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) is the major  source of Federal support for workforce development. WIOA programs  provide education and training services to prepare individuals for work  and to help them improve their prospects in the labor market through  job search assistance, career counseling, occupational skill training,  classroom training, or on-the-job training; however, no dedicated  funding currently exists to integrate workforce training into recovery  and treatment services to enable individuals to secure and maintain  stable employment. Participants enrolled in WIOA--beyond core service-- achieve an adult entered employment rate overall of 82%, which rises to  87% for on-the-job training and apprenticeship.   I am pleased to introduce today with my colleagues, Senator Young and  Senator Jones, the Jobs Plus Recovery Act, which addresses barriers  individuals in treatment face when seeking employment opportunities.  The Jobs Plus Recovery Act amends WIOA to empower our primary workforce  development driver to better support the needs of individuals with  substance use disorders by including them in the definition of an  individual with a barrier to employment. The bill also supports  partnerships between substance use disorder treatment and recovery  providers, education providers, and job services providers, such as the  American Job Centers established in WIOA, to improve worker training,  employment opportunity and retention for individuals in recovery.   Throughout my time as a public servant, I have remained committed to  ensuring our Nation's workforce is as strong as possible. Virginia  businesses continue to share their desperate need for more applicants  with the necessary skills to thrive in their industries. I am proud to  introduce this commonsense, bipartisan legislation to provide critical  support services to equip workers with the training and supports  necessary to gain and retain meaningful employment.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the opioid and addiction epidemic continues  to devastate communities across our country today.
