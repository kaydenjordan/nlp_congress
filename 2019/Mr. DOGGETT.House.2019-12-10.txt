 Mr. Speaker, today's bill, which I am pleased to  cosponsor, accomplishes much good. While providing critical support for  minority-serving institutions like Huston-Tillotson in Austin, it  includes provisions from the bipartisan Student Aid Simplification Act,  which I introduced earlier this year. It will assist students in all  universities, and it is also mighty important to graduates repaying  student debt.   I salute the chairman, Mr. Scott, for the work of his committee;  College Forward and National College Access Network, who have worked  with me on this for months; and, certainly, Senators Murray and  Alexander for moving this through the Senate.   Too many students find the current Free Application for Federal  Student Aid, FAFSA, so complicated and the difficulty of getting all of  the financial information required so demanding that they never  complete the application. In fact, I was in San Antonio this past  weekend. The completion rate there is a mere 35 percent. So $2.6  billion in free money available for student  [[Page H9967]]  financial assistance goes unclaimed each year.   This bill will eliminate up to 22 FAFSA questions and require the  Department of Education and IRS to work together and do some of the  heavy lifting for the students by sharing the taxpayer information  required for FAFSA completion. This means an increase in access to Pell  grants and other educational opportunities, especially for first-time  students whose parents may work multiple jobs.   And the provisions included from the bill that we introduced earlier  this year will also eliminate problems that about 7 million students  who graduated have faced in the annual recertification process for  income-driven loans.                                time  1330    These are folks who may owe a lot, but they don't earn a lot. They  include many teachers who have been kicked out of the Public Service  Loan Forgiveness program for not recertifying each year. We eliminate  that. These borrowers will now be protected from payment spikes.   We do all this through administrative simplification, through greater  accuracy, so the bill actually raises the $2.8 billion that we need for  our minority-serving institutions.   When more students can access all the education that they are willing  to work for, the students win, their families win, and our economy  wins. Investing in our students is one of the best investments we can  make, and investing in our minority-serving institutions means that  opportunity is available for all.
