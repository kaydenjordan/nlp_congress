 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, before beginning my remarks, I would offer condolences  to the grieving families who lost loved ones in yesterday's terrorist  attack in New York City, and to have the people of New York know--and I  know I speak for all of us, and there will be a more appropriate  recognition at a time in the future, I am sure, but to have them know  that all of us grieve with them and are concerned not only for those  who lost their lives, but to assist in preventing measures of this type  in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Washington for yielding to me the  customary 30 minutes for debate.   This bill is a sweeping attack on responsible forest management  policy that upends key environmental safeguards, limits public  participation in land management decisions, and prioritizes commercial  timber harvest over transparent, science-based management. In other  words, this is business as usual for this Republican majority when it  comes to protecting our environment.   A footnote right there, my friend from the State of Washington does  highlight, rightly, concerns not only for his congressional district,  but areas throughout the country that have experienced wildfires.   Many of us have talked about this in conjunction with other disasters  and a need for this Congress to be able to address the shortfall in  funding for such important measures.   During this Congress alone, my Republican friends have brought to the  floor bills that undermine the ability of the Environmental Protection  Agency to issue independent and objective scientific conclusions,  weaken regulations of pesticides, and repeal rulemakings aimed at  effective, science-based management of public lands, just to name a few  things.    Repeatedly, my Republican friends ignore science and attack  environmental protections all in an all-too-obvious attempt to help  commercial interests over sound conservation policy. This focus not  only undermines our public lands, but it also harms the health and  safety of the American people.   This bill continues the assault on our Nation's environmental  protections, and it may be one of the most irresponsible examples yet.   Under the guise of responding to the recent tragic wildfires in  California and elsewhere in this Nation, this legislation attacks the  National Environmental Policy Act, known as NEPA, which requires  Federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their actions.   The bill also attacks the Endangered Species Act by requiring  redundant and unnecessary reporting requirements. It blocks access to  the courts and limits recovery in environmental justice cases. Just for  good measure, this bill effectively overturns President Obama's  administration's monument expansion.   The bill does little to fix the true problem of wildfire management,  namely the chronic underfunding of wildfire management. Any serious  proposal must address the constant funding shortages at the U.S. Forest  Service by increasing the amount of Federal funding available for  wildfire suppression. A successful solution needs to provide advanced  access to emergency funding.   Unfortunately, today's legislation does no such thing. Yesterday, the  administration offered its statement of administration policy, and, at  best, it is tepid. It says, ``The administration appreciates the intent  of H.R. 2936 . . . and is supportive of land management reforms like  those outlined in the legislation,'' and then comes the however. ``The  administration, however, has concerns about the legislation's revisions  to the Stafford Act, which would force competition for funding between  wildfires on Federal land and other disasters already covered by the  Stafford Act, including hurricanes.''   It goes on to say, `` . . . the administration supports a separate,  annual cap  [[Page H8311]]  adjustment for wildfire suppression operations, which will resolve  concerns about the sufficiency of funds for wildfire suppression and  avoid unnecessary competition for Stafford Act funds.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration  Policy.                     Statement Of Administration Policy   H.R. 2936--Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017--Rep. Westerman R-AR,                               and cosponsors         The Administration strongly believes that funding for       wildland fire management must be addressed in order to enable       the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to       better manage the Nation's forests and other public lands.       The Administration's second disaster funding request,       submitted to Congress on October 4, 2017, underscored this       belief. The request also noted the Administration's belief       that land management reforms are critical to solving the       problem of ``fire borrowing''--taking funds from forest       management programs to cover fire costs that exceed       appropriations--in a comprehensive manner, rather than       through a funding-only appropriations approach.        The Administration appreciates the intent of H.R. 2936, the       Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017, and is supportive of       land management reforms like those outlined in the       legislation. The Administration, however, has concerns about       the legislation's revisions to the Stafford Act, which would       force competition for funding between wildfires on Federal       land and other disasters already covered by the Stafford Act,       including hurricanes.      Wildland Fire Management Funding        Last year, Federal wildfire suppression spending reached       $2.9 billion, an amount that signals clearly the need for       Congress to address the rising cost of fire suppression       operations. The dependence on ``fire borrowing'' to cover       funding shortfalls in times of severe wildfire impedes the       missions of our land management agencies, including by taking       critical funding from programs that help reduce the risk of       catastrophic fire, restore and maintain healthy functioning       ecosystems, and yield timber production.        The Administration, however, has concerns with re-purposing       the Stafford Act to address wildfires. The purpose of the       Stafford Act is to assist State, local, tribal, and       territorial (SLTT) governments that become overwhelmed when       responding to and recovering from natural disasters affecting       their jurisdictions. H.R. 2936 would modify the Stafford Act       by creating a new type of disaster declaration to address the       cost of wildfire suppression on Federal land, thereby       changing long-standing principles governing Federal support       to SLTT governments. As we have seen in this year's historic       Atlantic hurricane season, the Federal Emergency Management       Agency (FEMA) must continue to be focused on its existing       mission, and the Stafford Act's Disaster Relief Fund must       remain dedicated solely to that mission.        Instead of the approach outlined in H.R. 2936, the       Administration supports a separate, annual cap adjustment for       wildfire suppression operations, which will resolve concerns       about the sufficiency of funds for wildfire suppression and       avoid unnecessary competition for Stafford Act funds.      Improving Forest Management        The Administration appreciates H.R. 2936's recognition that       fixing the funding component of fire borrowing will not, on       its own, stop the worsening trend of catastrophic wildfires.       Meaningful forest management reforms to strengthen our       ability to restore the Nation's forests and improve their       resilience to destructive wildfires must be a part of any       permanent solution. H.R. 2936's provisions that expedite       environmental approval for proactive forest management,       including hazardous fuel reduction and post-fire timber       salvage and reforestation actions, are important steps       forward. The Administration supports and will continue to       work with Congress on the details of the forest management       reform proposals.        Although the Administration has concerns with H.R. 2936's       modifications to the Stafford Act, the Administration will       continue working with Congress to enact a sustainable       solution to ``fire borrowing'' that does not adversely affect       FEMA's critical disaster relief funding and that recognizes       the need for a comprehensive solution to the problem of       wildfires.     Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, the bill does little to  fix the true problem of wildfire management. Any serious proposal, as I  have said, must address the constant funding shortages, and that is  what, among other things, the administration suggested.   Mr. Speaker, this year has been a wake-up call. We must do more to  respond to the natural disasters that face our Nation. After three  major hurricanes and devastating wildfires in my friend from  Washington's State, in California, in Montana, and even in the  Everglades of Florida we have experienced some wildfires, albeit not at  the magnitude of loss of life or property as existed in some of the  others, our resources and agencies are stretched to the brink.   Weeks after the storms, millions of people across the Virgin Islands  and Puerto Rico are without power and without reliable access to clean  drinking water. FEMA Administrator Brock Long testified just yesterday  that the response to these storms and wildfires and other disasters--we  have had tornadoes that have come along as well--is costing the Federal  Government $200 million a day.   Mr. Speaker, I understand that the Office of Management and Budget is  currently working to send a proposal to Congress for a third  supplemental spending package to address the recovery needs in the  affected areas. I urge them and my colleagues here in Congress to act  swiftly to provide the resources that so many people desperately need.  In the meantime, what have we gotten from Republicans? Bipartisanship?  Sound science-based proposals? No. Instead, the Republican majority has  ignored bipartisanship, and, yesterday, in the Rules Committee, a  bipartisan measure was offered that was a thoughtful proposal on this  topic, and was rejected, and presented this bill that we have here now  that doesn't address the real issues facing public land and wildfire  management, but, rather, guts environmental protection and overturns  President Obama's monument expansion.                                time  1245    Mr. Speaker, this is business as usual for House Republicans. But if  we are going to seriously address natural disasters and how we respond  to them, I encourage my friends on the other side of the aisle to put  aside their partisanship, reconsider their denial of climate change and  its effects on our environment, and join Democrats in working together  to address this and other important issues faced by all Americans.   There were two amendments that were offered yesterday by my  colleagues from California. Both of those amendments were not made in  order. I don't think it is right when people offer legislation,  particularly those that have just been damaged, as our colleagues,  Congressmen Thompson and Matsui, and others in the northern California  region. They at least should have had an opportunity to offer up their  amendment and have it voted against if people felt so here in this  body.   I would hope, in the future, we would make a correction of that kind  of undertaking. I would hope all Members of this body would have an  opportunity to present their ideas on any legislation, and something as  important as this could have allowed for an open rule, rather than for  partisan activity to reign supreme.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   If we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment  to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act. This bipartisan,  bicameral legislation would help thousands of young people who are  Americans in every way except on paper.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I might add, attendant to this, on  yesterday, my colleagues, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Carlos Curbelo,  Frederica Wilson, and myself, introduced legislation calling for giving  300,000 migrants in this country, from a variety of countries, an  opportunity for permanent residence--those from El Salvador, Haiti,  Honduras, and Nicaragua.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico  (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham), my good friend, to speak to the issue  that I just talked about, the Dream Act.   Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, it has been 57  days since the President abruptly and irresponsibly terminated the DACA  program.   For 57 days, students have been panicked about how much longer they  can go to school. Brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters, are terrified  that they might lose their loved ones any minute. Parents are afraid to  take their children to the hospital or to school, and breadwinners  don't know whether they will be able to continue to earn a paycheck to  support themselves and their families.   For 57 days, the Republican-controlled Congress has been silent,  doing nothing to provide certainty for 800,000 American DREAMers who  are caught up in Congressional dysfunction. Without a permanent  legislative fix, these young Americans, like Maritza from Texas, will  be at risk of detention and deportation.   Maritza works part time to help her pay for college so she can pursue  her dream career in journalism after graduation. Over months, she and  her family saved up $1,000 to pay for an attorney and the DACA program  application fee. All she needed was her school to provide her records  so she could finish her application.   But then Hurricane Harvey hit and flooded her family's home in east  Houston and shut down school for 2 weeks. While Maritza and her mother  were recovering from Harvey's devastation, they were the victims  of another disaster, but this one was created by their own government.    They watched Attorney General Jeff Sessions announce on live TV that  the Trump administration was ending DACA and cutting off new  applications for young immigrants just like her. The devastating news  crushed Maritza and her family. Now they and countless others have  waited 57 days for us to fix it.   Today we have the opportunity to uphold our values and to pass the  Dream Act so that these young Americans aren't waiting in fear any  longer.   Mr. Speaker, there is a quote directly above your chair from Daniel  Webster imploring us to do ``something worthy to be remembered.''   So how will we be remembered? Will the Republican-controlled Congress  continue to sit here and passively accept the Trump administration's  cowardly decision to eliminate protections for countless DREAMers  across the country? Or do we want to do something about it?   We have an opportunity to protect our neighbors, coworkers,  classmates, friends, constituents, and members of our military who have  done everything to try to contribute to this great country. One vote  would change the lives of nearly 800,000 Americans forever. One vote  would allow them to pursue the American Dream, to go to school, to  continue to work, to buy a house, or to start a business.   Mr. Speaker, isn't that why we were sent here? Wouldn't that be  something worthy to be remembered?   I ask my colleagues to vote against the previous question so that we  can immediately bring the Dream Act to the floor and provide certainty  for Americans like Maritza, who want to continue to work, learn, and  live in the country that they love, the only country they have ever  known. We cannot afford to wait another day.    Mr. Speaker, through you, I would advise my good friend  from Washington that I have no further speakers and I will be prepared  to close whenever he is. Until such time, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, through you, I would advise my good friend  from Washington that I have no further speakers and I will be prepared  to close whenever he is. Until such time, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I advise my friend that I am prepared to close. I have  no additional speakers, and I will go forward with your permission.   In the wake of the worst wildfires, as have been mentioned here by so  many  [[Page H8315]]  of our colleagues, that the U.S. has experienced in quite a while,  House Republicans, however, have responded by bringing to the floor,  really, a tired bill passed last Congress that went nowhere in the  Senate, a bill that does not fix the true problem of chronically  underfunding wildfire prevention but, instead, doubles down in creating  an unworkable system for wildfire suppression funding, a bill that  rolls back environmental protection and limits access to the courts.   It is dismaying to see the response to natural disasters in this  country hinge on the same thing so many other important debates do:  partisanship and ignoring facts and science.   Despite a year in which we have seen historic hurricanes and  wildfires, my Republican colleagues have yet again resorted to  continuing to push policies that repeal environmental regulations, all  the while denying the effects climate change is having on our  communities and our country's economy.   My friend from Oregon, a moment ago--and he is my friend--spoke about  the thunderstorms that we receive in Florida. In his version, it is  accompanied by rain, and that is true a lot. But we, too, have droughts  in Florida, and Florida is known as the lightning capital of the world.  Very occasionally, particularly in central Florida and in the  Everglades, those lightning strikes produce wildfires in the  congressional district that I serve and many others. Our response to  these events needs to improve, and it needs to happen quickly.   These disasters do not recognize congressional districts. These  disasters do not target one area of our country over another and do not  care about Republican or Democratic partisan gamesmanship. If we are  going to adequately respond to the needs of millions of American  citizens in the wake of these and future storms and future wildfires,  we need to be advocating for sound policies based on science. This is  the only way to protect future generations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and the underlying  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair  will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on  the question of adoption of the resolution.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 232,  nays 184, not voting 16, as follows:                               [Roll No. 592]                                 YEAS--232       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Estes (KS)      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Franks (AZ)      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gianforte      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Handel      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
