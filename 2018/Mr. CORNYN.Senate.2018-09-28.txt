 Mr. President, as the world knows by now, yesterday we  had another hearing on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be a  member of the U.S. Supreme Court. It was necessary to do so because an  allegation had been made by Dr. Christine Ford to the ranking member,  our friend Senator Feinstein from California, dated July 30, but  because Dr. Ford requested confidentiality and she wanted to remain  anonymous, none of this was brought to anybody's attention until some  time after the judge's original confirmation hearing occurred. The  judge visited with 60-plus Members of the Senate, including the ranking  member, and it was never mentioned to him. No questions were asked  about it.   Contrary to her wishes, Dr. Ford was thrust into the national  spotlight. She said she didn't agree to have her letter released to the  press. She did not consent to having her identity revealed. She did not  want to be part of what has turned into a three-ring circus. But, once  there, when she asked to tell her story, we consented to doing that,  and yesterday we heard from Dr. Ford as well as Judge Kavanaugh.   Judge Kavanaugh asked to be heard to clear his good name and speak  directly to the American people, and he did so forcefully yesterday.   Now we have heard Dr. Ford's story, and we have heard Judge  Kavanaugh's rebuttal. What we have learned is that there is no evidence  to corroborate Dr. Ford's allegation. All of the people she said were  there on the occasion in question said they have no memory of it or it  didn't happen--no corroboration.   As we all watched Judge Kavanaugh defend his personal integrity in  front of the Nation, we saw his righteous indignation. He choked back  his tears and aimed his fury not at Dr. Ford--none of us did that--but,  rather, at this unfair confirmation process, which, frankly, is an  embarrassment to me and should be an embarrassment to the U.S. Senate.  To take somebody who has requested confidentiality and leak that  information to the press and then to thrust her into the national  spotlight under these circumstances, I think, is an abuse of power. But  having made that request, once she was in the spotlight, we felt it was  very important to treat her respectfully and to listen to her story.   I told anybody who would listen that I wanted to treat Dr. Ford the  same way I would expect that my mother or my sister or my daughters  would be treated under similar circumstances. Conversely, I thought  that we should treat Judge Kavanaugh fairly, too, just as we would our  father, our brother, or our son. In other words, this is more than just  about Dr. Ford; this is about Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh.   We heard the judge respond with quite a bit of righteous indignation,  as I said, talking about his family having been exposed to the vilest  sorts of threats, including his two young daughters. I know it was a  hard pill for many of our Democratic colleagues to swallow to hear the  truth of what this terrible process has resulted in, both for Judge  Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford, but too much was on the line for Judge  Kavanaugh to withhold his defense of his good name. After all, his  reputation is on the line, his family is on the line, and his family,  including his wife and his two daughters, are all caught up in what  must be a miserable experience.   Still, I am glad we held the hearing, and I am grateful to Rachel  Mitchell for participating and asking her probing questions.   Some have questioned: Why would a Senator yield to a professional in  the sexual abuse field to ask questions of Dr. Ford? Well, it was  simply because we wanted to depoliticize that process and to treat Dr.  Ford with respect and gently, recognizing that somehow, somewhere, she  has been exposed to some terrible trauma. But it was important for Ms.  Mitchell to ask questions and to get answers to those questions so we  could do our job.   I appreciate Chairman Grassley for doing his best to keep order in  running the committee efficiently, as much as that is possible. At the  first hearing, after Senators would speak over each other and would  endlessly make motions that were out of order--when one Senator said,  ``I am breaking the confidentiality rules,'' I said, ``This seems like  a hearing by mob rule,'' not with the kind of demeanor and civility  that you would expect from the U.S. Senate. I think Chairman Grassley  has done the best anybody could do under difficult circumstances.   As I said, this hearing was not easy for either Dr. Ford or for Judge  Kavanaugh. It has been painful for everybody involved.   Thankfully, we are much closer to a resolution on this nomination.  Today, there was a markup in the Judiciary Committee, and I am glad we  were able to pass that nomination out of the committee to the Senate  floor.   Some are saying that we are moving too fast. To them, I would say  that it is pretty clear what the objective of the opponents of the  nomination is. Their objective is delay, delay, delay. Some have said  that their goal is to delay this confirmation past the midterm  election, hope that the election turns out well for them, and  essentially defeat the nomination and keep the Supreme Court vacancy  open until President Trump leaves office.   First, there was the paper chase; they needed more documents or,  perhaps, they said there were too many. But the question I always had  is this: If you have already announced your opposition to the nominee,  why do you need more information? Unless, of course, you are open to  changing your mind--but it is clear that is not the game that they are  engaging in here.   Now there are those who demand that the background investigation be  opened into two new allegations that appeared following Dr. Ford's.  Today, the majority leader and some of our colleagues have announced an  agreement to extend the background investigation for up to another week  for these witnesses to be interviewed by the FBI. But I would note that  the most recent allegations are so absurd, are so fantastic that not  even the New York Times would run a story about Judge Kavanaugh's time  in college as reported by Ms. Ramirez. They worked hard to try to  corroborate her story by interviewing dozens of potential witnesses.  None of them would confirm or corroborate Ms. Ramirez's story, but they  did find, as Ms. Ramirez was talking to one of those individuals who  was interviewed, where she admitted that she may have misidentified  Judge Kavanaugh. In other words, she admitted that she may have the  wrong guy--not credible, not serious, but dangerous.   It is dangerous in the sense that some of our colleagues take the  position that all you need to do is listen to an accusation, and that  is enough to make up your mind. You don't need to listen to the other  side. As Judge Kavanaugh said, in Dr. Ford's case, it didn't happen; he  wasn't there. If you listen to just one side of the argument, I guess  it does make making up your mind a lot easier because you don't  actually have to think about it and you don't have to think about what  a fair process is in order to decide whose arguments you believe or  whether somebody has met the burden of showing evidence that their  claim is actually true.   This has become so ridiculous that the newest claims made by a young  woman named Julie Swetnick, who is represented by Stormy Daniels'  lawyer, are riddled with holes. Why would a  [[Page S6379]]  woman continue to go to parties with high schoolers when she was in  college, and why in the world would she go to not 1, not 2, but 10 of  these alleged drug- and alcohol-infused parties where gang rape  occurred? It is just outrageous--incredible.   We have encouraged all of these individuals, no matter how incredible  the allegation may be, to work with the Judiciary Committee and submit  to an interview with the bipartisan representation of the Judiciary  Committee there. This is standard operating procedure for the Judiciary  Committee. The basic background investigation is done by the FBI. But  they are not investigating a crime; it is a background investigation in  which they take notes on their conversations with witnesses. They don't  tell you which witness to believe or what conclusions to draw from  that. They send that to the Judiciary Committee, and the Judiciary  Committee follows up with additional questions, if necessary. Lying to  the FBI--just like lying to the committee--is actually a crime  punishable by a felony, so both carry serious consequences and a  serious warning to those who might try to lie their way into a  background check.   What is so ridiculous about where we find ourselves is that in  addition to Dr. Ford's confidential letter to the ranking member being  released against her wishes and without her consent, contributing to  this circus atmosphere as we continue to try to investigate some of  these claims, the Democratic professional staff have been refusing to  cooperate or participate, even as they continue to make more and more  demands. It is clear that their appetite for delay is insatiable, and  delay is their ultimate goal.   For those who continue to say that they want the FBI involved, I will  tell them that the FBI has been and is involved. It has conducted its  background investigations just as it did on the six previous occasions  when Judge Kavanaugh was being vetted for other positions within the  Federal Government. You heard that right: Judge Kavanaugh has been  through six FBI background checks, and none of these matters have come  up previously.   What we were doing yesterday with the hearing was part of our job,  which is to continue the investigation. I think people have a very  narrow idea of what an investigation entails. It is not just a  background check by the FBI. It is the interviews by the professional  staff on the Judiciary Committee, and those are the hearings like the  one we had yesterday, all day, hearing from Judge Kavanaugh and Dr.  Ford. That is our job; that is our constitutional role, to provide  advice and consent.   Plus, if our colleagues across the aisle were really interested in a  background investigation of Dr. Ford's complaints in a confidential  manner, as she requested, they could have requested that be done and  the results reported to us in a closed setting. What happened to Dr.  Ford is inexcusable. To have a Senator sit on this allegation and  refuse to turn it in to the committee so it could be investigated in a  confidential way that would have protected her anonymity and would have  allowed the committee to question both Judge Kavanaugh and her--that  didn't happen, by design, perhaps because the goal really wasn't about  giving Judge Kavanaugh or Dr. Ford a fair hearing. It was about  delaying this confirmation vote.   When Judge Kavanaugh was interviewed about a week or so ago and again  yesterday, he talked about a fair process--in other words, hearing from  both sides of an argument. But under our constitutional system, if you  are accused of a crime--and, believe me, Judge Kavanaugh has been  accused of multiple crimes--you are entitled to the presumption of  innocence. In other words, there is a burden to come forward with  evidence to justify and support an accusation, and if you don't do  that, your accusation is not enough to meet that burden.   Usually what we have are corroborating witnesses--other people  present at the time who can corroborate what the allegation is. But all  of the witnesses who have been identified by Dr. Ford cannot  corroborate or confirm her allegation. They say that they have no  memory of that or it simply didn't happen.   Even the Bible talks about the importance of corroborating witnesses.  I didn't find this, but I vaguely remembered it, and someone on my  staff pointed out Deuteronomy 19:15:         One witness is not enough to convict anyone accused of any       crime or offense they may have committed. A matter must be       established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.    So this is a rule of ancient origin dating back to the Old Testament.  That is what we are talking about today. When Dr. Ford comes with an  accusation 35 or 36 years after the fact, and no one else can confirm  her story, it is not enough to carry the day.   The other thing we need to be wary of is false choices. This is not a  matter of he said, she said. Someone said this is a matter of he said,  she said, they said: Dr. Ford said one thing; Judge Kavanaugh said  another; the so-called corroborating witnesses said another. But what  they said did not corroborate Dr. Ford's story. Just the contrary, they  confirmed Judge Kavanaugh's denial of any participation in anything  remotely like that which Dr. Ford alleges.   So after 36 years, as Ms. Mitchell was able to develop, we know, for  perhaps obvious reasons, that Dr. Ford's account has some  inconsistencies and some gaps regarding the timing, location, and  details regarding these events. I think we need to listen to her. We  need to take her story into account. As I said, I want to treat her the  same way I would want my mother, sister, or daughters treated under  similar circumstances. But we can't ignore the inconsistencies and the  gap in her story and the fact that she has tried to tell it 36 years  after the fact.   We also can't ignore the full-throated defense and the heartfelt  denial of Judge Kavanaugh or the testimony that none of this is in the  character of Judge Kavanaugh. We have heard that from people dating all  the way back to 1982. Indeed, Ms. Mitchell--a professional prosecutor,  prosecuting sex crimes in Arizona--told us last night that with her  more than two decades of experience and the kind of case brought  forward by Ms. Ford, she would not file those charges against a  defendant because there simply is not enough evidence. In fact, the  only witnesses identified by Dr. Ford denied the event actually  occurred. As a matter of fact, she said that she couldn't even get a  search warrant or arrest warrant in a case like this. If you can't  identify the time or the place, you are not even going to be able to  get a search warrant. You certainly can't show probable cause, which is  required by law.   So here is where we are. If the allegations we discussed during  yesterday's hearing remain uncorroborated and unproven, if it never  came up in the context of six Federal background checks, if it has been  explicitly denied by the nominee, if the three alleged eyewitnesses  have no recollection of it or say that it didn't happen, if it  conflicts with the account of some 65 women who knew the nominee to  behave honorably in high school and countless more women who have known  and interacted with Judge Kavanaugh since--the timing seems unusual,  perhaps even politically motivated. And if our colleagues across the  aisle chose not to act on this information once presented but rather to  spring it on us and Judge Kavanaugh after the fact, there is no reason,  in my mind, that we should not move forward with the nomination because  we have seen what happens.   This is not just about Dr. Ford; it is about the subsequent  allegations by Ms. Ramirez and additional allegations by Ms. Swetnick,  each more salacious, each more incredible, and each more out of  character with what we know about Brett Kavanaugh. And it is going to  continue. The longer this nomination is unresolved, there are going to  be more and more people coming out of the woodwork to make accusations  that are uncorroborated and unprovable. You can imagine what this does  to Judge Kavanaugh and his family as he is left hanging like a pinata,  where people just come by and take another whack at him and his family.   We have to move forward. We can't establish a precedent by which a  nominee can be derailed by a mere accusation that is unproven. We are  never going to get good people to agree to serve in these important  offices, and we can't allow the nomination process to be a drive-by  character assassination that is unproven. The only ammunition our  colleagues across the aisle  [[Page S6380]]  need in order to shoot down any figure at any time would be innuendo-- innuendo, speculation, suspicion, unproven allegations, nothing more.  We are not going to let that happen. We are not going to establish that  precedent. It would be bad for the Senate. It would be bad for the  United States of America.   Please don't misunderstand me. I am glad Dr. Ford had a chance to  have her say. We owed her that much. I know it took some courage, and  it is a reminder to all Americans that victims can and should be heard.  As I said, I myself have two daughters. We all have a mother. Some are  fortunate to have sisters or a spouse. This can be a very personal  matter to every one of us. Yet we all know that all of us have fathers,  and many of us have brothers. Some have husbands and sons. In other  words, my point is, if this kind of uncorroborated allegation would  seem so manipulated in exploiting vulnerable people who made  accusations like this and we tolerate that, I think it will forever  poison the confirmation process and discourage good people from coming  forward.   We must always be fair to both the victims and those who stand  accused. It has to be a two-way street. I have supported Judge  Kavanaugh's nomination because I have known him since the year 2000. In  my experience, he has always been an upstanding and certainly he is an  incredibly well-qualified individual.   We have heard everybody--from his fellow lawyers to his law clerks,  to women he has worked with, to former Presidents of the United  States--say that. We know he has an incredible record on the DC Circuit  Court of Appeals, where many of his decisions have been affirmed by the  U.S. Supreme Court. I know he will judge fairly and carefully. I  believe he belongs on the Nation's highest bench. In a few more days,  after a few more delays, we will finally vote to put him there and say  enough with the games.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
