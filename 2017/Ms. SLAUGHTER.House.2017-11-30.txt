 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act was enacted  in 1994 as an amendment to the Truth in Lending Act. It is designed to  address predatory lending practices in refinancing and home equity  loans with high interest rates or fees.   Loans that meet these high-cost triggers are subject to disclosure  requirements and limitations on the loan terms. Borrowers are also  provided enhanced remedies if it is violated.   Now, the first bill before us, H.R. 1699, would amend the Truth in  Lending Act by exempting manufactured home retailers from being defined  as mortgage originators. In the process, it would exempt these  retailers from important consumer protection rules. That would  perpetuate conflicts of interest and restore incentives for these  retailers to steer customers into loans with high costs and fees. These  are precisely the type of loans that are more profitable for the  retailer even though they are bad deals for the customer.   My good friend from Georgia asked what could be wrong with this; how  can we protect those customers? I submit: You may not protect those  consumers by taking all regulation off for them. Obviously, it was  there for a reason, and we will see how it turns out.   Those may seem like arcane changes to existing law, but let me put  the issue in better perspective.   According to the Manufactured Housing Institute, 22 million Americans  live in manufactured homes today. That is equal to the entire State of  Florida.                                time  1245    Mr. Speaker, why in the world is the majority prioritizing a bill  that would undermine consumer protections for tens of millions of  Americans. We know the legislation would create more access to  affordable housing. It would only make the incredibly profitable  manufacturing housing industry even more money through predatory  lending.   Those who rely on manufactured housing as an affordable option  deserve the same antipredatory lending standards as every other family.  This bill fails that test. In fact, it was written specifically to take  the protections away from the housing industry.   The second measure before us today, H.R. 4182, is completely  unnecessary. It would extend the probationary period for members of the  Senior Executive Service and members of the competitive service from 1  year to 2. That would double the time that new civil servants are  essentially at-will employees without any employee protections or due  process rights.   There is no evidence to support the need for doubling the  probationary period for Federal employees. The bill would simply serve  to delay employees' access to worker protection laws that ensure that  they are treated fairly on the job. It would also undermine  whistleblower rights and prevent them from coming forward.   These are the people who are essential to getting to the bottom of  legal violations and waste and fraud in government agencies. Standing  up for their rights used to be a bipartisan priority, but the majority  is now prioritizing a bill that would undermine their rights and put  the integrity of our Federal civil service at risk.   This comes on the heels of the majority bringing a separate bill,  H.R. 3441, to the floor recently. That legislation threatened  collective bargaining rights for employees and allows employers to  evade liability for wage theft or even child labor violations. And just  like the bill before us today, it chips away at workers' ability to do  their job without retaliation or unfair treatment.   Mr. Speaker, there is a pattern here. The majority is bringing bills  to the House floor that threaten worker protections while they work to  advance a procorporate agenda at the same time.   There is perhaps no bigger giveaway on the agenda right now than  their tax bill. Under the guise of so-called reform, the majority on  the other side of the Capitol is crafting a tax bill that is nothing  but a giveaway to the rich and powerful.   And, please, don't take my word for it. On Monday, The New York Times  published a piece entitled: ``Senators Scramble to Advance Tax Bill  That Increasingly Rewards Wealthy.'' The very first line of the piece  gives away the majority's game plan. It said: ``The Republican tax bill  hurtling through Congress is increasingly tilting the United States Tax  Code to benefit wealthy Americans. . . .''   I believe that is beyond dispute by now. In fact, I think every major  economist and publication have told us that that is exactly what it is.  The scam will raise taxes on tens of millions of middle class families  in order to hand deficit-exploding giveaways to the wealthy and  corporations that ship jobs overseas. In fact, I heard an economist  last night, Jared Bernstein, saying that he thinks this bill encourages  moving jobs overseas.   The Republican plan eliminates the alternative minimum tax, which is  designed to prevent the very rich from gaming the system. And the bill  passed by the Chamber eliminates the estate tax, which will benefit the  wealthy, certainly--and very few of them, though, are even liable for  paying that tax.   According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congressional  Budget Office, under the Republican plan, persons making $40,000 to  $50,000 a year would pay an additional $5.3 billion in taxes, combined,  over the next decade. At the same time, those earning $1 million or  more a year would see a $5.8 billion tax cut.   Note, please, the similarity of those figures. If that isn't taking  money from the poor to give to the rich, I don't know of anything that  could describe it any better.   This is the third time America has tried trickle-down theory. It  didn't work with President Reagan; it didn't work under President Bush;  and, certainly, it did not work in Kansas. There is a word for doing  the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.  That word is ``insanity.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  distinguished leadership and for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I want to focus in particular on where we are and where  we have been. I think it is important, as we discuss these issues  dealing with the Ensuring a Qualified Civil Service Act of 2017, that  we really have the responsibility, as Members of Congress, to engage in  safe and fair workplaces all over the Nation.   Certainly, I want to speak particularly about the Civil Service Act,  which I am stunned that this would extend the period of time for a  probationary period from 1 year to 2 years. But what is most striking,  since I am a member of the Judiciary Committee, is that Federal  employees will remain at-will employees for a period of time with  virtually no due process protection.   I clearly want to try to understand an administration that, first of  all, wants to make skinny the government to disallow it to do its work;  and then, on top of that, it wants to have temporary employees with no  due process rights.   Yesterday, we stood on the floor of the House to insist that there be  mandatory training for sexual harassment and, as well, to recognize  that there should be zero tolerance for sexual harassment and, of  course, sexual assault.   As an African-American woman, over the years, historically, we, along  with women all over the world, have seen the plight, or the  devastation, of sexual harassment and sexual assault. I was  disappointed that this floor could not vote on that resolution. I would  really ask for that resolution to be called up again so that this House  could go on record for supporting mandatory training.   At the same time, I think it balances, with due process, the work  that we have to do to make sure that we have a workplace that is  tolerable and allows women who feel insulted, harassed, and, God  forbid, assaulted easy, quick access to a pathway of relief.   This legislation and the underlying bill on this rule specifically  dealing with taking away due process rights from civil servant women  strikes me as the wrong direction to go in light of where we are. So I  am questioning this legislation. I think it is the wrong direction to  go. I, frankly, believe it should be pulled.    And as that legislation is pulled, I believe that we would do  ourselves well to reassert the resolution from yesterday and to cast a  vote. Let's get on the record of where we stand on the issues  protecting women against sexual harassment and sexual assault.   Finally, let me indicate that we are in the middle of appropriations.  We have not been compensated for the devastation of Hurricane Harvey.  My constituents are suffering. They are suffering in Puerto Rico, in  the Virgin Islands, and in Florida. The appropriation, or the  recommendation from the White House, is insufferable, unacceptable, and  it is time for us to move as a Congress to bring relief to the people  who have suffered from the hurricane.    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I  will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream  Act. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would help thousands of  young people who are Americans in every way except on paper.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Norman). Is there objection to the  request of the gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Torres).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, funding for the government expires on December 8. That  is 8 days from now. We wonder why we are wasting time on unnecessary  bills before us today and running us toward another shutdown.    Let me remind everyone watching here today about the last shutdown in  2013. The majority shut down the government rather than fund the  Affordable Care Act, which was then and remains today the law of the  land. The shutdown lasted 16 days. In just that short time, it cost our  economy an estimated $24 billion. The shutdown cost the government $24  billion.   Federal facilities were not opened. The mom-and-pop stores and little  restaurants in Federal buildings all closed. The processing of  veterans' disability claims was stalled. Head Start grantees that serve  an estimated 6,300 children were forced to close their doors for 9 days  until some private philanthropists stepped in. Hundreds of patients  were unable to enroll in possible lifesaving clinical trials at the  National Institutes of Health.   Ninety-eight percent of the employees at the National Science  Foundation, nearly 75 percent of the employees at the National  Institutes of Health, and two-thirds of the employees at the Centers  for Disease Control were furloughed. That brought new Federal research  to a standstill.   An estimated $4 billion in tax refunds were delayed, denying middle  class families the money they expected and planned for. Even the  National Transportation Safety Board was impacted, unable to  investigate 59 plane accidents as swiftly.   Another shutdown will be devastating, but I am afraid that is what we  are headed for under the leadership here.   The President recently tweeted that he doesn't see a deal on the  horizon. This comes after he tweeted earlier this year that our country  needs a ``good shutdown.''   Instead of doing anything about that here today, we are frittering  away precious legislative time on bills that are, at best, not urgent  and, at worst, completely unnecessary and even damaging.   The greatest Nation on Earth will be struggling to keep the lights  on. This is no way to run the United States.   I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, on the rule, and the  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

He was an extraordinary friend who had the courage to  take on all of the tough issues.   We served 4 years together in the New York State Assembly and 20  years together in Congress. I watched him do what he did best: defend  the constituents and the land that he represented.   He is remembered as an environmental hero for his promotion of  renewable energy and for sounding the alarm on the risks of hydraulic  fracturing. Maurice did more to support the natural resources of the  Catskill Mountains and Hudson Valley than anyone else.   From his efforts to clean up the Hudson River to the establishment of  the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area, his legacy will endure.   To the millions of visitors who enjoy the Catskill Mountains or  explore the Hudson Valley, you have a champion to thank. His name was  Maurice Hinchey.                            ____________________
