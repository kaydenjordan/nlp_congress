 Mr. President, today I rise to honor and pay tribute  to my good friend Senator Johnny Isakson on his retirement from the  U.S. Senate.   Throughout the years, I have gotten to know Johnny as a colleague but  more importantly as a friend.   Together, we cochaired the National Prayer Breakfast and attended the  weekly Senate Prayer Breakfast. I always came away from those  breakfasts thankful for colleagues like Johnny, who reminded me that we  all share a common purpose and a common humanity and that, with faith  and forgiveness, we can start anew.   As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Johnny was  always a tireless champion for our Nation's veterans--leading on issues  that face all of our brave men and women who have stepped up and served  our country. Without Johnny, important legislation like the Harry W.  Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act--also known as the Forever  GI Bill--to increase the number of veterans who can access benefits  under the post-9-11 GI bill, would not have been signed into law in  2017. And  [[Page S6855]]  whether it was his work on the Finance, Foreign Relations, or Health,  Education, Labor, and Pension Committees, Johnny exemplified a fighting  spirit and an enduring commitment to service.   Not long after I was elected to the Senate, Johnny and I began  working together on legislation that was later signed into law to  advance research on muscular dystrophy and help strengthen a program  that provides information and education for people battling this  disease. I will always appreciate his willingness to put partisanship  aside in an effort to work toward a bipartisan proposal that would  protect Dreamers last year.   Beyond just our legislative work together, I will always think fondly  of Johnny as someone who is decent, caring, and kind. He even hosts a  prerecess barbeque that has everything from pulled pork to brisket to  mac and cheese and sweet tea and pecan pie. One year, you could smell  the hickory-smoked meats in the halls of the Senate for days--and I  loved it.   As we take this opportunity to honor Johnny, I also want to thank his  wife Dianne and their three children and eight grandchildren for  sharing so much of their beloved husband, father, and grandfather with  the U.S. Senate.   As much as I will miss Johnny's company in the Senate next year, I  know that this isn't his final chapter. He will continue to do good  work for the people of Georgia, and I am lucky to count him as a  friend.   Thank you Johnny.                            ____________________
