 Madam Speaker, here we are, 2\1/2\ weeks away from a  potential government shutdown. It is not 5 yet, and I am on the floor  of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress, and  there is functionally nobody here. I choose to address the body from  the podium, rather than the well, to illustrate this point.   Now, anywhere else in America, if you were facing some cataclysmic  event like a shutdown or a shutoff or a business losing a major client,  you would have the whole team here working, getting together,  workshopping solutions, offering amendments, ripening proposals and  actually doing the work that we are supposed to be doing for the  country.   With this 2\1/2\ weeks to the shutdown, it is notable to me that  Congress got into town last night and we are leaving tomorrow. It is  like we have got the French workweek around here. And the Democrats are  in control. They are driving, Madam Speaker.   So my call is to Speaker Pelosi:   If you have got a border security package, put it on the floor.   If you have got an idea on how to make sure that our country is  safer, respecting the rule of law, creating a climate of rising wages  for our workers, making sure that people in their neighborhoods are  safe and not having to face the gangs and the cartels and the criminals  and MS-13, let's see it.   Democrats often were right to criticize Republicans during the 115th  Congress that we had constrained rules, limited debates. We had  diminished opportunity for Members to offer amendments. But we don't  even have a bill. It kind of makes me wonder why.   It may be the Democrats can come to no consensus on border security.  I mean, heck, we have got a group of them who probably are from Rust  Belt States, from the Midwest, where a lot of their constituents voted  for President Trump and believe that we ought to have physical  barriers, believe that we ought to be a nation of laws and borders-- pretty rational stuff. And then you have got this other wing of the  Democratic Party, Madam Speaker, that thinks that walls and borders are  racist and immoral.   How is it that the country is expecting us to lead--you to lead, in  the majority--if we aren't able to at least come to this floor and  offer concrete solutions?   You know what we voted on these last couple of days? We have been  voting on whether or not we are going to establish studies on the  potential harms of cryptocurrency. Now, that may be a virtuous  objective, but it seems less poignant and less timely than the  impending shutdown we potentially have in 2\1/2\ weeks.   We took votes on whether or not the Department of Homeland Security  should offer more mentorship and training to law enforcement on Tribal  lands--also virtuous, but certainly not what we ought to be doing here.   Madam Speaker, each and every day, when we walk these Halls, we stand  under the busts and statues and murals of some of the greatest  Americans to have ever lived. There are times when I feel we are  unworthy to cast our gaze upon them and upon their likeness because  here we are, trusted to fulfill the promise of the country, and it is  not even 5 yet on a workday, and I am the only one here and everybody  is packing their bags getting ready to go home.   It is a travesty and it is a shame brought upon this House. I  certainly hope in the coming weeks we can do better.   Madam Speaker, I thank your indulgence, and I yield back the balance  of my time.                            ____________________
