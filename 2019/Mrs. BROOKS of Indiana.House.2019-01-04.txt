 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Tyler Trent, a remarkable young Hoosier from Carmel, Indiana, who  lost his battle to bone cancer at only 20 years.   Tyler Trent is a name known in households across the Nation for his  love of Purdue football and his inspiring passion and energy as a fan.   Tyler always dreamed of becoming a Boilermaker and refused to allow  cancer to get in his way. After beating cancer once and being diagnosed  again in 2017, Tyler started school at Purdue on a presidential  scholarship, as planned, in the fall of `17. He would drive home on  weekends for treatment. Even still, Tyler would show up to cheer on his  Boilermakers every chance he got.   The Purdue superfan was featured on ESPN and named the honorary team  captain when they won the Old Oaken Bucket game this past year. He  received the Sagamore of the Wabash and formed an organization which  helps families affected by cancer, called Teens With a Cause.   In December, he won Disney's Wide World of Sports Spirit Award. When  he received that award, he said: ``There is always a light at the end  of the tunnel.''   It is with that optimistic and positive outlook on life that Tyler  inspired the Nation. He has united Americans far and wide to be  Boilermakers, and I hope we can all continue to be grateful and live  every day as he did--Tyler strong.                            ____________________
