 Mr. President, 7 of the last 10 debt limit increases  were attached to bipartisan government spending deals. All three of the  debt limit increases from 2017 through 2020 were attached to bipartisan  government spending deals.   So there is no reason why our country should be drifting toward  crisis. The solution is clear; it has been clear for months. President  Biden needs to negotiate on spending with Speaker McCarthy.   The Speaker has been at the table since February. House Republicans  are the only people in town who have passed any bill that prevents  default. President Biden has been MIA.   House and Senate Democrats have no plan, no proposal. They have no  bill to raise the debt ceiling that could pass either in the House or  the Senate, let alone both.   So the choice is President Biden's: Either he drives the country into  default or he comes to the table.   Four years ago, in 2019, the roles were reversed. Republicans held  the White House. Democrats held the White House. I was the majority  leader. And my advice to the President then was the same as my advice  to the President now: raise the debt limit by negotiating spending  levels with the Speaker.   That administration listened. They sent Secretary Mnuchin to hammer  out a debt deal with Speaker Pelosi. They struck a compromise. Spending  levels were set, and the debt limit was raised.   That is what a responsible Senate majority leader would be telling  the Biden White House today: Sit down with the Speaker and strike a  deal.   Any compromise flushed out by the Republican House and the Democratic  White House will pass the Senate easily. So President Biden's actions  will either prevent default or guarantee default.   It is just that simple. It is up to the President.   Either President Biden causes an economic disaster of his own  creation or he picks up the 2019 playbook and negotiates with Speaker  McCarthy.   Everybody knows this is on President Biden. Rank-and-file House and  Senate Democrats have publicly called on the White House to negotiate.  [[Page S1554]]    The Washington Post--the Washington Post--ran an entire editorial  entitled, ``It's time for Biden to call McCarthy!''   Last week, an entire news story detailed how the White House is  garnering no support from nonpartisan leaders or experts for their  bizarre strategy of sleepwalking into disaster.   The people around President Biden, including the Senate Democratic  leader, seem to think they can wish away the results of the midterm  election. They want to pretend the American people didn't flip the  House.   That is not how it works. In divided government, you negotiate. The  President and the Speaker need to talk, just like in 2019. We need a  bipartisan spending agreement, just like 7 of the previous 10 debt  limit deals. I will be joining the White House meeting later today, and  I will continue to support the Speaker.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, from the early days of the steam- powered locomotive to the modern era's high-speed rail, Kentucky's  railroads have been at the heart of our Commonwealth's growth and  development. Though railways are no longer our primary mode of  transportation, they remain an essential ingredient of Kentucky's  economic success, transporting the goods and resources that power our  lives. The R.J. Corman Railroad Group, stationed out of central  Kentucky, has been a driving force in propelling the rail industry  forward. Today, I would like to recognize this organization's  contributions to our Commonwealth on its 50th anniversary.  [[Page S1563]]    The story of this Kentucky railroad empire begins in 1973 with my  good friend and Nicholasville native, Mr. Rick Corman. It was just  after high school when Rick founded his first business venture, R.J.  Corman Railroad Construction, and, like its founder, the company hailed  from humble beginnings.   At 18 years old, Rick started out making track repairs for major  railroads equipped with nothing more than a backhoe and a red dump  truck. Thanks to his tireless work ethic and shrewd instincts, Rick  grew his humble operation into what is now the R.J. Corman Railroad  Group, a diversified portfolio of railroad companies. Rick would grow  his business across 23 States, employ over 1,600 workers, and expand  into a host of verticals that ranged from short-line railroad  operations to emergency and natural disaster response.   Amid some of our country's most horrific floods, blizzards, and  hurricanes, Rick's team was on the ground to assist in recovery and  cleanup efforts. When Hurricane Katrina struck the central Gulf and  devastated railroad infrastructure across the South, Rick mobilized his  emergency response crew to repair railways in record time.   In his personal life, Rick and his company were avid donors to St.  Joseph Hospital in Jessamine County, so much so that the hospital  recognized Rick as its largest philanthropic donor. The hospital  established the R.J. Corman Ambulatory Care Center in 2008, which  continues to serve the community of Nicholasville to this day.   Tragically, the company lost its seemingly unstoppable founder 10  years ago to a hard-fought battle with multiple myeloma, a blood  cancer. Rick was just 58. Despite his cancer diagnosis, Rick would  continue to enjoy life, travel the world, and even run the Boston  Marathon. To this day, his infectious laugh, warm demeanor, and  irresistible spirit for life are deeply missed by his family and loved  ones. In honor of Rick, the company and its employees contribute to the  Richard J. Corman Multiple Myeloma Fund each year, which helps support  research work at Harvard's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.   Despite losing its torchbearer, the company and Rick's legacy  prevailed. R.J. Corman continues to operate as one of the leading  railroad service providers in the U.S., serving all seven major  railroads in North America. Most recently, the company added a 19th  railroad to its wide-spanning portfolio. R.J. Corman's iconic red train  cars are an unmistakable fixture of central Kentucky, and the company's  impact on our Commonwealth continues to extend beyond its railway  business.   The company remains a worthy custodian of Rick's name and his legacy  of generosity, compassion, and hard work. I am proud to honor this  classic American success story and celebrate its many contributions to  the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in  recognizing R.J. Corman Railroad Group for 50 outstanding years.                            ____________________
