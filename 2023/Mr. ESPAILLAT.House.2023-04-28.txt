 Mr. Speaker, Harry Belafonte was a lifelong public  servant and civil rights advocate who selflessly used the power of his  voice to entertain us through songs, as well as to build awareness and  bring attention to numerous social and political causes for vulnerable  communities across the United States and the world.   He was a hitmaker and changemaker. From New York City to Hollywood,  he broke barriers. His efforts helped propel the civil rights movement  and created an appetite for justice across the country.   Harry Belafonte was an entertainer, an ambassador for humanity, and  an advocate for goodwill across this planet.   An alumnus of George Washington High School in my district, Mr.  Belafonte was a Harlem treasure, an ambassador for humanity, and he  will never be forgotten.   Today, I honor his life, his legacy, and the contributions he made to  the global community.                            ____________________
