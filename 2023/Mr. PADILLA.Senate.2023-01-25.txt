 Madam President, I rise today to honor the life  of Walter Ulloa, a trailblazing figure in the media and entertainment  industry, a role model to many in California, and my personal friend.   Walter grew up in Brawley, CA, at a time when Latinos were still  segregated in his community. He graduated from the University of  Southern California in 1970, before earning his law degree from Loyola  School of Law in 1975.   After earning his degrees, Walter embarked on what would become a  nearly five-decade career in media, playing a pivotal role in the  growth of Spanish-language television and radio across the United  States.   At KMEX in Los Angeles, there were some early signs that Walter's  work ethic, intellect, and mind for media would make him successful.  During his 13 years there, he worked as operations manager, production  manager, news director, local sales manager, and account executive  before venturing out to create his own projects.   In 1996, he cofounded Entravision, a now global Latino media,  marketing, and technology company. For over 25 years, he served as  chairman and chief executive officer at Entravision, where he grew his  young company to own over 100 television and radio stations, as well as  digital platforms throughout the United States. Whether in Los Angeles  or across the country, if you watched or listened to Spanish-language  media in the last five decades, there is a very good chance you have  Walter Ulloa to thank.   But away from his industry impact, communities in California knew him  for his generosity and his commitment to public service. So respected  was Walter for his expertise and appreciation of the arts, that  President Barack Obama appointed him to the board of trustees for the  John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.   For more than 20 years, I had the privilege of knowing and working  with Walter. I always admired how he generously gave his time and  contributed resources to help increase Latino civic engagement and  voting in California. The fact that after growing up in a segregated  community in the 1950s, Walter could go on to not only an  extraordinarily successful career, but to help future Latino  communities prosper time and time again is a testament to his  character.   The life of Walter Ulloa is nothing less than the American dream come  true, from his educational and economic success, his philanthropy, and  his service to our country. He will be missed.   Angela and I send our love to his wife Alexandra Seros and son Bruno  Seros-Ulloa and to all those whose lives were touched by his  service.                            ____________________
