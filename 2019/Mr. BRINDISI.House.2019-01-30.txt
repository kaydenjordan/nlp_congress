 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to stand here today as a  Representative of New York's 22nd Congressional District.   When I talk to upstate New Yorkers, there is one thing I hear time  and time again: that Washington is broken.   We are all tired of Washington's partisanship, and I am here today to  reiterate my promise to work with anyone who is willing to solve  problems.   I will work with Members of both parties to address skyrocketing  healthcare costs and make sure everyone has access to high-quality,  affordable care.   I will work to bring good jobs to upstate New York, strengthen our  schools, and improve job training programs.   I will fight to make sure our local farmers have the support they  need to get a fair price for their goods, succeed financially, and make  an honest living.   And I will stand with servicemembers and veterans to ensure they have  the support and resources they need when wearing our country's uniform  and when they return home.   I will fight for everyday people and take on companies that use power  through monopolies to abuse consumers.   Above all else, my top priority will be to listen to my constituents,  to be a voice for upstate New Yorkers.   I know that, by working together, we can deliver real results for  hardworking people.
