 Mr. President, I was deeply saddened to learn of  the loss last week of Christopher T. Bacon, a beloved husband, father,  resident of my State of North Dakota, and an agent with the Customs and  Border Protection, CBP, Office of Intelligence.   Chris was a wonderful person. His career and service make it clear  that he was a man who was guided by strong values and commitment to  service. Through his actions, he embodied our Nation's tradition of  serving others, dedicating his energy to protecting families all across  our Nation.   He was born in San Antonio, TX, and traveled all over our Nation and  world. He started his service in the Army and joined CBP in 1995 as a  border patrol agent. He advanced through the ranks during his 22 years  with the agency. His final posting was as an intelligence collection  operations manager, stationed at the National Air Security Operations  Center in Grand Forks, ND.   Our Nation, my State, and his family were all fortunate to have him  in our midst. He raised a great family and will always be remembered by  his colleagues, friends, and neighbors. Through his courage, skill, and  commitment, he has left his community and Nation a better and safer  place for all who follow.   My heart goes out to his wife, Rhonda, and his children, Kristen,  Christopher, Jr., Jake, and Jasmine, in this time of grief. On behalf  of my own family and the State of North Dakota, I extend my sincere  condolences to Chris's family, friends, and colleagues. I pray that all  who knew him can find comfort in their memories of Chris and the  positive impact he had on so many lives.                            ____________________
