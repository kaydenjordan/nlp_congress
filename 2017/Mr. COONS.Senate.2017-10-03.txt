 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor Lou Amabili, a true  Delawarean, a fantastic, dedicated, and tireless volunteer, a gentleman  who dedicated his life and service to others.   Mr. Louis J. Amabili, the son of Italian immigrants, rose from  volunteering at his local volunteer fire company to become one of the  most important and trusted voices in the American fire service. Lou  passed away last Thursday, September 28.   Lou was a giant in the fire service community, and his decades of  dedicated service are a testament to how much he cared about his  calling and his neighbors. Lou was a legend in the Delaware  firefighting community, especially in my small hometown of Hockessin,  DE. Lou proudly served the Hockessin Fire Company for 70 years, holding  every position one could possibly hold--chief engineer, first and  second assistant chief, along with vice president, president, president  emeritus, and director.   Lou was a humble, down-to-earth, passionate, and caring gentleman. He  rarely sought the limelight, even as he was often thrust into it. He  could walk into any event, whether a national convention or just a  local meeting, and know an individual's name, making them feel as if  they were the most important person in the room.   Lou embodied the term ``public servant,'' which so many of us aspire  to, yet he quietly and with dignity achieved this for decades. He heard  his calling to serve his community, and he embraced it with dedication  and a quiet passion.   There was no greater ally of firefighters in Delaware or across the  country than Lou. His continued service of seven-plus decades set the  highest standard of dedication to the volunteer fire service.   I first had the honor of meeting Lou around 2000 when I was county  council president. Over my decade of service in New Castle County  government, Lou was a frequent source of powerful advice,  encouragement, insight, and occasional correction. I always looked  forward to seeing him, whether at a county meeting, a State meeting, or  at a national organization meeting. I was always certain I would get  honest, direct, and constructive feedback from Lou about how things  were going at home and how things were going nationally for America's  firefighters.   Lou's nationally recognized service is long and impressive. He first  gained national recognition in the fire service when President Richard  Nixon appointed him to serve on the National Commission for Fire  Prevention and Control in 1970--the Commission that produced the  landmark report, ``America Burning.''   A graduate of Conrad High School and of the University of Delaware  with a degree in chemistry, Lou was appointed the first director of the  Delaware State Fire School in 1964 and served in that capacity for more  than three decades through 1996. Upon his retirement, then-Governor Tom  Carper, my senior Senator, signed a resolution naming the Delaware  State Fire School the Louis J. Amabili Fire Training Center.   From 1973 to 1980, Lou served as president of the International  Society of Fire Service Instructors. From 1978 to 1986, he served as a  charter member of the National Fire Academy Board of Visitors. Lou also  served on the NFPA board of directors for 6 years in the 1980s and was  chairman of the Fire Department Instructors Conference in 1979 and  1980.   Widely respected by his colleagues, the president of Congressional  Fire Services Institute, William F. Jenaway, said:         Throughout his entire career, Lou was fully committed to       the health and safety of the men and women who have served in       the fire service. He was always willing and eager to share       his knowledge with both aspiring and veteran firefighters and       cared deeply about preserving the fire service's rich       heritage. It was an honor to serve with him for many years on       the CFSI Board of Directors. I valued his friendship as did       my fellow board members. . . . His contributions to our       organization and to the nation's fire service will preserve       his legacy as a legendary leader for many years to come.    While the fire service and the safety of his fellow firefighters was  his passion, his family was his love. Lou's wife of nearly 60 years,  Carmella, was his constant companion as he traveled extensively to  national conventions, local meetings, or speaking engagements. Lou's  daughter Janice; his son Louis Junior and his wife Bridget; his  grandson Louis J. Amabili III and his wife Lacie; and Lou's great- grandchildren, Lyza and Silas, will be forever proud of his legacy of  service to Hockessin, to Delaware, and to our Nation.   Lou was an inspiration to generations of volunteers, first  responders, and firefighters, not just in his home company in our small  town of Hockessin but to all the firefighters of Delaware and our  country.   Lou Amabili was exactly the sort of man on whom the safety of our  Nation has been built and whose service and dedication to his community  and his neighbors will never be forgotten.   I yield the floor.
