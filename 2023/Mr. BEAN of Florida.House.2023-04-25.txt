 Mr. Speaker, the secret is out. People have  discovered the beauty of Amelia Island and Nassau County.   I rise today to recognize National Travel and Tourism Week in my neck  of the woods, in Nassau County, Florida. I want to congratulate and  celebrate everyone who is in the tourism industry.   Seventy percent of Nassau County's economy comes from visitors. Some  say they come for the great beaches, parks, or golf, but the real  secret sauce is the warm southern hospitality.   Tourism is the largest creator of jobs and tax dollars in Nassau  County. This week is a chance to celebrate our tourism community and  highlight the people who work in this important sector.   Through their customer service and positive interactions with  visitors, they are helping promote Amelia Island and Nassau County not  only as a top 10 island destination but as a beloved destination for  travelers to make memories.   Today, it is fitting that on its 40th anniversary, we recognize May 7  through May 13, 2023, as National Travel and Tourism Week in Nassau  County, Florida.    Recognizing the 170th Anniversary of the Duval County Medical Society     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 170th  anniversary of the Duval County Medical Society, a remarkable  organization that has greatly improved the medical community and health  of northeast Florida.   In the 1800s, Jacksonville was suffering from a series of outbreaks  of smallpox, dengue fever, and malaria. Struggling to come up with a  solution and with no public health system in the State, a group of  eight local physicians decided to come together and do something about  it.   On May 25, 1853, they chartered the Duval County Medical Society, the  first medical society in the State of Florida, to bring physicians  together to solve the public health crisis.   Today, the Duval County Medical Society's more than 1,800 members  guided by Dr. Steven Kailes, continues to lead and research data to  promote quality health outcomes throughout Duval County, the State of  Florida, and the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and privilege to celebrate the voice of  organized medicine, the Duval County Medical Society, on their 170  years of exceptional service.                            ____________________
