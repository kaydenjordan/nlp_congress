 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we recently passed the first anniversary of  the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, and despite the White House's  showy anniversary celebration, this legislation is not aging well, and  that is not exactly a surprise.   It was clear from the beginning that this bill had problems. It was  called the Inflation Reduction Act. Yet before the bill had been signed  into law, the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model was noting that the  bill's impact on inflation was ``statistically indistinguishable from  zero.'' In other words, the Inflation Reduction Act would do nothing to  reduce inflation. Even President Biden has essentially admitted that  the bill's name was misleading.   It was also clear from the outset that the bill's claims of deficit  reduction were extremely shaky, relying on accounting gimmicks and  fuzzy math. Then, of course, there were the hundreds of billions of  dollars in tax hikes on American businesses--rarely, I might add, a  strategy that produces economic growth or benefits for working  Americans. There was a massive funding infusion to the IRS focused not  on improving taxpayer services, interestingly enough, but on increasing  audits to help fund the Democrats' Green New Deal agenda--and more.   The best that could be said for the Inflation Reduction Act when it  passed, which isn't much, was that it was less damaging than the  staggering multitrillion-dollar spending spree Democrats had originally  tried to implement, their so-called Build Back Better Act.   So it is not exactly a surprise that the Inflation Reduction Act  isn't aging well, but it has become clear over the past year that the  bill is even worse than it appeared originally. It was already an  expensive piece of legislation, but the bill's costs have ballooned  alarmingly.   The bill's Green New Deal provisions, which were originally projected  to cost around $400 billion, are now expected to cost somewhere in the  range of $660 billion to more than $1 trillion. Let me repeat that. The  bill's Green New Deal provisions, which were originally projected to  cost around $400 billion, are now expected to cost somewhere in the  range of $660 billion to more than $1 trillion.   If Democrats' deficit reduction plans for this bill were shaky  before, they are really, really shaky now. It is not hard to imagine  that the steep increase in the bill's costs could mean that it ends up  adding to the deficit instead of reducing it, and now it has emerged  that some of the biggest beneficiaries of the bill's green energy  subsidies are not American companies but foreign companies. Not only  that, but billion-dollar companies are expected to receive the lion's  share of the bill's green energy tax subsidies--ironic for a President  who claims he wants to make big companies ``pay their fair share.'' It  also turns out that the bill's provisions are actually driving up the  cost of green energy projects and inflating the cost of project  materials and labor. It is no wonder that President Biden recently said  of the Inflation Reduction Act:         I wish I hadn't called it that.    And I haven't even mentioned other aspects of this legislation like  the bill's price controls for prescription drugs, which will curtail  medical innovation and the development of new medications. When the  Biden administration originally proposed this policy, research from the  University of Chicago projected that price controls on prescription  drugs in Medicare would result in 135 fewer new drugs available to  patients. Now, we are seeing those projections come to fruition as  multiple drug companies have indicated that they are halting research  into new treatments for cancer and other diseases as a result of the  Inflation Reduction Act.   President Biden has been spending a lot of time recently talking  about his economic philosophy, or lack thereof, which he has taken to  calling Bidenomics. According to the White House, it is a philosophy  based on ``growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up,''  while also spending responsibly. It is a nice-sounding vision, but it  has little to do with the economic reality in the Biden administration.   The so-called American Rescue Plan Act--the massive Democrat spending  spree that helped plunge our economy into a 2-year-plus inflation  crisis--is proof enough that ``spending responsibly'' is not exactly  the modus operandi for Democrats and President Biden. And as for  ``growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up,'' well, if  the President really thinks he is doing that, I have a nice piece of  oceanfront property in South Dakota to sell him.   In fact, it is lower and middle-income Americans who have suffered  the most in the Biden economy. Prices have increased by more than 16  percent since the President took office, by more than 20 percent for  groceries, and inflation is costing the average household more than  $900 per month--$900 per month. Show me a working family who finds that  affordable.    Bidenomics, according to the President, is supposed to be about  lifting up working families, but, in reality, working families in the  Biden economy are struggling just to get by.   A grim line in a news story the other day noted:         With 60% of people in the United States living paycheck to       paycheck, households are  [[Page S4214]]       turning to credit cards and retirement savings as lifelines.        With 60% of people in the United States living paycheck to       paycheck, households are turning to credit cards and       retirement savings as lifelines.    That is the reality of life under Bidenomics. But you only need to  listen to one of the President's speeches to know that the President  isn't overly troubled by economic reality. Lately, the President has  been taking credit for the recent moderation in the inflation rate.  Well, that takes a lot of gall. It is a little bit like punching a hole  in a boat and then taking credit for rescuing the occupants from  drowning--except, in this case, the President isn't even doing the  rescuing.   The rate of inflation has slowed in spite of the White House, not  because of it. In fact, if the President had his way, Congress would  have passed a lot more reckless spending, and inflation would likely  have gotten even worse.   As it is, Americans are having to deal not only with the ongoing  effects of Democrats' self-inflicted inflation crisis but with the  steep rate hikes the Federal Reserve has imposed to dig us out of the  Democrats' inflation mess. These rate hikes have made borrowing more  expensive, putting the dream of homeownership or necessities like  replacing an aging car out of reach for many Americans.   And there may be more economic pain on the way if Democrats have  their way. The Democratic leader recently promised--or perhaps I should  say threatened--to pass an even bigger Green New Deal bill than the  Inflation Reduction Act if Democrats regain full control of Washington  in the next election. I don't even want to think about how much that  kind of legislation could cost taxpayers or what damage that kind of  legislation could do to our economy.   The President can talk all he wants about Bidenomics as building the  economy from the bottom up and the middle out. To Americans who have  lived under the Biden economy, Bidenomics means something very  different. Perhaps the President should check in with the 58 percent of  workers who say the economy has gotten worse over the past 2 years  before he gives his next celebratory speech.
