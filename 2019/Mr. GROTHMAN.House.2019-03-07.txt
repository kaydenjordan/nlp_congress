 Madam Speaker, today I would like to address the status  of abortion in America.   In the past 2 months, there have been two stories that show a  significant shift, I believe, in America regarding the status of  abortion.   In New York, one of our original 13 Colonies, they recently expanded  the right to have abortions up to 9 months and, as a practical matter,  left it to be okay for a baby born alive not to receive protection. The  Governor of New York was so proud of this situation that he lit up the  World Trade Center and people applauded in the Senate chamber.   In Virginia, another one of our original 13 States, the Governor came  out for a bill that also allows 9-month abortions. The morally bereft  Governor said that, if a baby was born alive, that baby would only be  resuscitated if the mother wanted.   By the way, I want to point out here there is this myth out there  that late-term abortions are only for babies who may not survive.   I once heard a speech from a woman who quit a late-term abortion  clinic in Ohio. She was there only one day. At that time, there were  six babies delivered. Five had no health problems whatsoever, and the  other had either spina bifida--I think it was spina bifida. And, of  course, many people live productive lives with that disease.   Only 10 years ago, Kermit Gosnell of Philadelphia was convicted of  delivering babies alive and killing them after they were born--perhaps  hundreds, perhaps thousands.                                time  2045    You can read about them in a book by that name, ``Gosnell.'' There is  a movie out as well; kind of very interesting to see the mindset of the  abortion industry.   But Gosnell was defiant. When they talked to him after he was  convicted, as a practical matter, put in prison for life, he said, in  the end, he would be vindicated. And I think when he said vindicated,  he meant in 10 years that he felt America would come around to the  position that it would be okay to kill a baby born alive.   Who would dream that less than 10 years later, Gosnell may be on the  verge of being proven right, and that the moral compass of America had  shifted so much that it would be okay to allow a born-alive baby to  die.   How did we get here? There are a variety of culprits to blame. Part  of it, of course, is the thinly disguised racism of our old friend,  Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood. And I should point out  that even Margaret Sanger, feminist hero, was opposed to abortion  because as recently as 60 years ago, even among people of that ilk,  that would have been considered something that you could never be for.   But she did want her organization to reduce people from races she  considered inferior, and this was typical of the views of the early  progressives.   We also have people viewing it also as a way to hold down the people  that we consider undesirable.   Justice Ginsberg was quoted in the New York Times that she thought  Roe was decided, in part, because of a concern about population growth  in populations we don't want too many of. Now, she was subsequently  allowed to say that that quote was taken out of context, but that was  the quote that was listed. They kind of gave her a chance to try to  walk that thing back; a chance that wasn't given   Steve King.   Later, the same point was made by an article in the Harvard Journal  crediting abortion with the reduction in crime rates.  [[Page H2579]]    Part of the problem is the usual weight of promiscuous politicians  who would obviously be for abortion; people like the Ted Kennedys or  Bill Clintons or Bob Packwoods of the world; and, obviously, there are  a given number of men who have a vested interest in making sure  abortion is always available.   Part of the problem is the pernicious influence of Hollywood. The  ``Me Too Movement'' has opened up eyes as to the mindset of powerful  people in Hollywood and that, perhaps, is one of the reasons why the  popular culture would be all largely pro-choice to the extreme or pro- abortion to the extreme.   But still, why is it in America that we are such an outlier? John  Adams said that this country--that the Constitution was put together  for a morally and religious people. The Pilgrims came from Europe to  found a more devout country. Yet, in Europe, a much less religious  country than ours, the norm is no abortions after 12 weeks. You look  around. Germany, 12 weeks; France, 12 weeks; Italy, 90 days; Portugal,  10 weeks.   How did America wind up, in States like New York saying, okay for 9  months?   And you look south of the border. Mexico, most of their states don't  allow abortion to this day; and it is 12 weeks in the area of Mexico  City.   So, we will have to look further why did this happen.   I had originally felt, with the advent of the ultrasound, America  would become overwhelmingly pro-life. I had toured abortion clinics  when the ultrasound was a little bit rare, and I could see the language  that was used to mislead America as to what was going on.   In the abortion industry, they don't use the word ``abortion.'' They  talk about ``procedures.'' They don't even use the word ``fetus,'' much  less ``baby.'' They use the word ``tissue.''   But I felt the ultrasound would overcome that language that I felt  was one of the reasons abortion was still so common.   So who else can we blame?   Obviously, politicians have dropped the ball. Obviously, we have  horrible judges who can look at the Constitution, a document founded  for a moral and religious people, and claim that when our forefathers  put together that Constitution, they apparently expected abortion to be  legal, and abortion being illegal for so much of this country's  history.   To a certain extent, when you look at the judges, I think we have to  blame the law schools, you know. Americans, whatever polls you look at,  bounce back and forth between what people would say is 50 percent pro- abortion, 50 percent pro-life.   I wonder, in the law schools, the law school students, the law school  faculty, what those numbers are, which is maybe one of the reasons why  so few of the judges seem to be able to get the appropriate answer  here.   But where I would like to put the attention is, where are the  churches?   You know, it must be kind of difficult to be a minister or a priest.  You have got to come up with 50 or 52 different topics a year to talk  about.   Now, we have a situation going on in this country where we peaked out  at over a million abortions a year, and we are still over 600,000. You  look what is going on in Virginia, and you look at what is going on in  New York; and it seems to me there is fertile ground for the priest or  minister looking for something to say.   Nevertheless, I have taken to spending the last few weeks kind of  talking to people at random as to how often in the past year, when the  priests and ministers are looking for 50 different topics to talk  about, how often they have addressed the abortion issue.   It is not unusual, as a matter of fact, I would say the majority of  people I talked to who go to a church, it is not brought up at all. I  mean, I will tell you, it would be very difficult to come up with 50  different topics a year. But how you can come up with 50 different  topics a year, and with 600,000 abortions in this country every year,  and not deal with that?   But I think a lot of the blame has to lie there. Whenever there are  great tragedies in human history, I think people expect the clergy to  step up and provide some moral guidance.    So I end this speech by saying three things:   First of all, I ask the pro-life groups not to give up.   Secondly, I ask the politicians to bring forth bills like the Born- Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which, by the way, in itself,  shows some weakness, and we have a relatively weak bill. And that is, I  guess, what our pro-life position is today, or the bill we can bring to  the floor.   It is kind of sad that we didn't even get a final vote on that in the  Senate, but the bill should be brought up to educate America on the  state of abortion in America right now.   And finally, and most importantly, I ask the churches to finally step  up.   You know, I look on a calendar, and this June there will be five  weekends. Okay. So your average priest, your average minister out there  is going to have to think of five topics to talk about.   So I would like to ask the people of this country, and any clergy who  happen to hear this speech, to devote at least one of those 5 weeks in  June to this stain of over 600,000 abortions in this country every  year, and ask yourself, what is the right or wrong thing to do?   And if you are one of those clergymen who, over the last year has not  addressed this issue--see, I am making your life easier for you, you  only have to think of four other things to talk about, rather than the  five weekends in June--I ask you to spend one week in June addressing  this issue and encouraging people to finally say no more of this  scourge in the United States.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
