 Mr. President, I want to express my strong support  for the bipartisan resolution--54--that is before us today. The strong,  bipartisan support we are seeing on the floor--most recently from my  colleague Senator Lee of Utah--shows how necessary and important this  resolution is to end the complicity of the United States in the  murderous war waged by Saudi Arabia in Yemen.   The United States is complicit because we are providing fuel,  intelligence, and other support that is only increasing the barbaric  power of the Saudis in that civil war--murderous activities that are  taking a toll on civilians. The blood will be on our hands if we  continue to support the Saudis in this brutal effort.   The resolution before us is carefully crafted to preserve our  national security and our national interests while at the same time  removing our involvement from the Saudi war crimes. There seems to be  no other word for what we are seeing the Saudis do. The arguments made  by the administration for our support and participation carry no  weight. We should never compromise our national value for the sake of  arms sales. In fact, the arms contracts are a pittance or a fraction of  what the administration claims. So I am proud to support this  measure. It will do too little and too late what should have been done  long ago: Renounce our moral and legal responsibility, as well as our  practical involvement for the murderous and brutal Saudi attacks on  civilians and others in Yemen.
