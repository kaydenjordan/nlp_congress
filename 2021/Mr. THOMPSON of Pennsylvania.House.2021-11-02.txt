 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember  the life and legacy of Martha Breene, a staple figure in Pennsylvania  Republican politics.   Martha has been involved in politics since the 1960s. She was a  phenomenal grassroots organizer, where she worked tirelessly on both  local and national campaigns.   Martha did what she did because she loves this Nation and the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. She worked so hard to see that people are  better served, and she did that through politics.   In 2004, she was the first women elected to serve as the Venango  County Republican chairman. She retired in 2013, only to return to that  role in 2017 where she served up until her passing this year.   I had the privilege of working with Martha and her late husband,  Charlie, during my first election starting in 2008. Martha has always  had the ability to motivate, and it is that quality that made her an  exceptional leader. She was a force to be reckoned with and will be  deeply missed in Venango County.   Mr. Speaker, my deepest condolences go to Martha's family and friends  during this time.  [[Page H6084]]                                ____________________
