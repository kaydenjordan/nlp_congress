 Mr. President, I rise today to share news with the  Senate. Dennis Gray Maxwell--Gray to all of us--my floor director and  most senior legislative adviser since I arrived in the Senate almost 17  years ago, is retiring at the end of December. For many of us, Senators  and staff alike, this is heartbreaking news, as we will miss Gray's  good counsel, impeccable speechwriting skills, remarkable knowledge of  Senate history, and award-winning home brew. He always has a relevant  story, whatever the circumstance. And, of course, Gray was the one who  got us to finally put the Senate Democratic Conference rules in  writing, so it is no wonder that he knows them inside and out better  than any Senator or parliamentarian.   Gray loves the Senate. He loves it for all it was meant to be, as  drafted by the Founding Fathers, and all that it should be in modern  times--a respected  [[Page S5631]]  entity dedicated to upholding the values and ideals that drive this  great Nation forward. Year after year, Gray has dedicated himself to  finding ways to preserve the Senate's role as the world's greatest  deliberative body, which has not always been easy. It pains him to see  the rules abused or when 10 years of work to pass a significant law,  like the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, is undone in 10  minutes. But he does cherish the days when we finally clear a record  vote-a-rama or come together in a landmark bipartisan vote.   Gray has worked for so many Senators over the years that his love of  this institution should not surprise anyone. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,  John Heinz, Jim Jeffords, Bill Cohen, Moynihan again, Dianne Feinstein,  Carl Levin, Frank Lautenberg and, since 2007, he has been part of Team  Cardin. This impressive list, nearly 40 years in the making, is why I  jumped at the opportunity to hire Gray.   A registered Independent his whole life, Gray lives the words of John  F. Kennedy: ``Men of goodwill and generosity should be able to unite  regardless of party or politics.''   I hired Gray because, on January 3, 2007, despite being a State  delegate, including speaker, for a total of 20 years, and a Member of  the House of Representatives for 20 years, I had zero direct experience  in the U.S. Senate. Gray Maxwell had more than two decades of  legislative service in the Senate with some of the most consequential  Senators to walk these halls. I wanted to learn from him. I had brought  over some core staff from my House office, but I knew that if I had  Gray on my team, he would help me quickly translate my previous  legislative experience into this new arena. Today, I love being a  Senator, and I credit Gray for sharing his fever for the institution  and showing me what great things we could accomplish.   Gray's path to public service perhaps was unexpected. The summer  after he graduated Stanford University, he came to Washington, DC, to  work at a branch of his father's law firm before starting law school.  His life would change though, when his roommate, who worked for Senator  Moynihan, told Gray there was an opening as a legislative  correspondent, or LC. Gray loved everything about the job and the  position. He was promoted quickly within the office and even met his  future wife, Eileen, during this time. Eileen, a fifth-generation  Washingtonian, came from a long line of public servants and had joined  the Foreign Service. Some may not know this, but Gray passed both the  written and oral Foreign Service exams in an effort to join his wife  for her new posting in Bolivia. In the end, they decided to stay in  Washington, and Gray's long career in the Senate would take off.   I have been told that there were quite a few conversations with  Gray's dad to explain that he would not be returning home to  Connecticut or going to New York to become a lawyer. But life would be  okay. His dad came around eventually. He would become one of Gray's  greatest cheerleaders and immensely proud of everything his son would  accomplish--despite not being a lawyer.   During the late 80s, Gray worked for Senator John Heinz and served as  legislative director of the Northeast-Midwest Institute, of which Heinz  was a cofounder. Gray was serving as the Senator's legislative director  at the time of his tragic plane crash in 1991. He went on to work for  Senator Jim Jeffords as his legislative director and then worked for  another Republican who made a career working across the aisle, Senator  Bill Cohen. He later would rejoin Senator Moynihan's staff as  legislative director.   Gray and Senator Moynihan had a close, almost father-son  relationship. This is obvious to anyone who has heard Gray tell a story  from his Moynihan days. Every tale, even something that might seem  embarrassing, like slipping on the floor while walking with the Senator  through the Senate, is coated with a sense of care and respect for the  man and lawmaker. I know it was a difficult task for Gray when he had  to call the then-recently retired Senator on September 11, 2001, to  tell him that New York and our Nation was being attacked.   Gray has been a witness to history during his nearly 40 years in the  Senate, and he has done his part to make history, as well. As a  lifelong public servant, Gray has become one of the most vociferous  champions for public service unions and Federal workers, generally. He  meticulously combs through data annually from the Office of Personnel  Management and other official sources to create the most accurate  snapshots of Federal workers in every State and the District of  Columbia. Among other uses, these charts have been invaluable each time  one of my colleagues dares to attack Federal workers or attempts to use  veterans and civil servants as pawns in yet another partisan game or  government shutdown. Gray relishes every opportunity to lift up stories  about Federal workers, serves as a watchdog for attacks on well-earned  benefits, and consistently advocates for the rights of all Federal  employees and retirees.   During the Trump years, Gray led the charge to pass S. 24, the  Government Employee Fair Treatment Act, which guarantees back pay to  Federal workers furloughed during a government shutdown. Thanks to  Gray's doggedness, if and when we have another shutdown of the Federal  Government, no longer will hundreds of thousands of Federal workers  have to wait and see if Congress will provide relief to those workers  caught in the crossfire.   Another project Gray helped carry over the finish line was the  National Memorial to Fallen Journalists. Based on his work and  coordination with stakeholders, days before the 1-year anniversary of  the fatal ``Capital Gazette'' shooting in Annapolis--the most deadly  newsroom shooting in American history--Gray helped finalize legislation  I introduced with Senator Rob Portman. Our bill authorized a privately  funded memorial within the District of Columbia to honor journalists,  photographers, broadcasters, and media workers killed in the line of  duty. In later stages, he would identify the ultimate location of the  memorial, across the street from the Voice of America and,  coincidently, across the street from the National Museum of the  American Indian, where Gray's wife Eileen would work until her  retirement in December 2022.   Far too many pieces of legislation that have become law have Gray  Maxwell's fingerprints on them for me to name every one. But let me  talk briefly about one recent bill that goes to the heart of Gray's  integrity and strong belief that Congress should be a leader in  protecting civil rights and values. Back in 2020, Senator Chris Van  Hollen and I introduced legislation in the Senate that would remove  from the U.S. Capitol a statue of fellow Marylander and Supreme Court  Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney. Taney was the author of the infamous  Dred Scott decision that ruled that African-Americans were not U.S.  citizens and that Congress could not prohibit slavery. In addition to  removing the Taney bust, our bill authorized the placement of a new  bust of Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first African- American to serve on the Nation's highest Court, and also a Marylander.  The bill was reintroduced this Congress and approved unanimously by the  Senate in 2022. Following House passage, President Joe Biden signed the  measure into law, and the massive Taney bust was removed in February of  this year. If not for Gray's legislative acumen and pure persistence,  the bust of a man who actively helped prolong slavery would still greet  visitors to the Old Supreme Court Chamber.   I am thankful that Gray shared his knowledge of the Senate with me. I  also am grateful that he shares this bounty with every new staffer and  intern that walks into our office. Capitol Hill can be a magnet,  attracting young people. If we want them to stay, we need more people  like Gray to share their experiences and adventures. He is teaching the  next generation about how they fit into the history, and the future, of  our legislative branch of government. He also is constantly learning,  with an understanding that these young people bring with them new  perspectives and different ways of solving age-old problems.   I would ask unanimous consent that, after my remarks, the full text  of Robert F. Kennedy's ``Ripple of Hope'' address, which was delivered  June 6, 1966, at the University of Capetown, South Africa, be entered  into the record. Gray  [[Page S5632]]  gives a copy of this speech to every new intern in our office and takes  time from his hectic schedule to discuss it with each group. Anecdotes  and surveys from interns year after year mention this discussion and  how it stays with them long after their semester is complete. RFK's  words echo throughout our work.   He said: ``It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief  that human history is shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal,  or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice,  he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a  million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a  current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and  resistance.''   Gray is proof positive that one person can make a difference.   Finally, I would like to thank Gray for being there for me and for  the Senate even when everyone else was home or working elsewhere. Maybe  they were asleep because the Senate was voting at 2 a.m. Maybe they  were teleworking because of the pandemic. Yes, as media reports have  recounted, Gray was one of the few people who worked in his Senate  office throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. He actually insisted that he  come in so that his wife could be comfortable teleworking from their  apartment. Truth be told, traffic was easier, and there were very few  people around at that time, so it was seemingly a safe thing to do. We  still took precautions. Even if he and I were in the office at the same  time, he stayed in his office, and I stayed in mine, and we talked by  phone. We wore facemasks and used antibacterial wipes on every door or  item we touched.   In another extreme case, Gray was one of only two staffers who were  in our Hart office on January 6, 2021. He and our chief of staff, Chris  Lynch, sheltered in place together all day while the Capitol was being  overrun. Gray charged through the Trump years and the pandemic, but the  days and months after January 6 definitely took their toll. I can  understand why he and Eileen began to spend more and more time out in  rural Rappahannock County, Virginia, where they rented a cottage during  the pandemic. They now have a beautiful home on 6 acres of land and are  surrounded by wheat and cornfields and dairy farms. I would try to  entice them to Maryland, but they have been visiting this area for 40  years, ever since Gray bought Eileen her very first riding lesson as a  birthday gift. Even from Virginia, he will forever be a part of Team  Maryland and the Cardin family.   I wish Gray all the best in his retirement. He is a good man with a  good heart, who has done phenomenal things for the Senate and our  Nation. He will be missed, especially by this Senator.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         [From University of Capetown, South Africa, June 6, 1966]    Day of Affirmation Address, University of Capetown, Capetown, South                                   Africa                           (By Robert F. Kennedy)         Mr. Chancellor, Mr. Vice Chancellor, Professor Robertson,       Mr. Diamond, Mr. Daniel, Ladies and Gentlemen: I come here       this evening because of my deep interest and affection for a       land settled by the Dutch in the mid-seventeenth century,       then taken over by the British, and at last independent; a       land in which the native inhabitants were at first subdued,       but relations with whom remain a problem to this day; a land       which defined itself on a hostile frontier; a land which has       tamed rich natural resources through the energetic       application of modern technology; a land which was once the       importer of slaves, and now must struggle to wipe out the       last traces of that former bondage. I refer, of course, to       the United States of America.        But I am glad to come here, and my wife and I and all of       our party are glad to come here to South Africa, and we are       glad to come here to Capetown. I am already greatly enjoying       my visit here. I am making an effort to meet and exchange       views with people of all walks of life, and all segments of       South African opinion--including those who represent the       views of the government. Today I am glad to meet with the       National Union of South African Students. For a decade, NUSAS       has stood and worked for the principles of the Universal       Declaration of Human Rights--principles which embody the       collective hopes of men of good will around the globe.        Your work, at home and in international student affairs,       has brought great credit to yourselves and your country. I       know the National Student Association in the United States       feels a particularly close relationship with this       organization. And I wish to thank especially Mr. Ian       Robertson, who first extended this invitation on behalf of       NUSAS, I wish to thank him for his kindness to me in inviting       me. I am very sorry that he can not be with us here this       evening. I was happy to have had the opportunity to meet and       speak with him earlier this evening, and I presented him with       a copy of Profiles in Courage, which was a book written by       President John Kennedy and was signed to him by President       Kennedy's widow, Mrs. John Kennedy. This is a Day of       Affirmation--a celebration of liberty. We stand here in the       name of freedom.        At the heart of that western freedom and democracy is the       belief that the individual man, the child of God, is the       touchstone of value, and all society, all groups, and states,       exist for that person's benefit. Therefore the enlargement of       liberty for individual human beings must be the supreme goal       and the abiding practice of any western society.        The first element of this individual liberty is the freedom       of speech; the right to express and communicate ideas, to set       oneself apart from the dumb beasts of field and forest; the       right to recall governments to their duties and obligations;       above all, the right to affirm one's membership and       allegiance to the body politic--to society--to the men with       whom we share our land, our heritage and our children's       future.        Hand in hand with freedom of speech goes the power to be       heard--to share in the decisions of government which shape       men's lives. Everything that makes man's lives worthwhile--      family, work, education, a place to rear one's children and a       place to rest one's head--all this depends on the decisions       of government; all can be swept away by a government which       does not heed the demands of its people, and I mean all of       its people. Therefore, the essential humanity of man can be       protected and preserved only where the government must       answer--not just to the wealthy; not just to those of a       particular religion, not just to those of a particular race;       but to all of the people.        And even government by the consent of the governed, as in       our own Constitution, must be limited in its power to act       against its people: so that there may be no interference with       the right to worship, but also no interference with the       security of the home; no arbitrary imposition of pains or       penalties on an ordinary citizen by officials high or low; no       restriction on the freedom of men to seek education or to       seek work or opportunity of any kind, so that each man may       become all that he is capable of becoming.        These are the sacred rights of western society. These were       the essential differences between us and Nazi Germany as they       were between Athens and Persia.        They are the essences of our differences with communism       today. I am unalterably opposed to communism because it       exalts the state over the individual and over the family, and       because its system contains a lack of freedom of speech, of       protest, of religion, and of the press, which is       characteristic of a totalitarian regime. The way of       opposition to communism, however, is not to imitate its       dictatorship, but to enlarge individual human freedom. There       are those in every land who would label as ``communist''       every threat to their privilege. But may I say to you, as I       have seen on my travels in all sections of the world, reform       is not communism. And the denial of freedom, in whatever       name, only strengthens the very communism it claims to       oppose.        Many nations have set forth their own definitions and       declarations of these principles. And there have often been       wide and tragic gaps between promise and performance, ideal       and reality. Yet the great ideals have constantly recalled us       to our own duties. And--with painful slowness--we in the       United States have extended and enlarged the meaning and the       practice of freedom to all of our people.        For two centuries, my own country has struggled to overcome       the self-imposed handicap of prejudice and discrimination       based on nationality, on social class or race--discrimination       profoundly repugnant to the theory and to the command of our       Constitution. Even as my father grew up in Boston,       Massachusetts, signs told him that ``No Irish Need Apply''.       Two generations later, President Kennedy became the first       Irish Catholic, and the first Catholic, to head the nation;       but how many men of ability had, before 1961, been denied the       opportunity to contribute to the nation's progress because       they were Catholic, or because they were of Irish extraction?       How many sons of Italian or Jewish or Polish parents       slumbered in the slums--untaught, unlearned, their potential       lost forever to our nation and to the human race? Even today,       what price will we pay before we have assured full       opportunity to millions of Negro Americans?        In the last five years we have done more to assure equality       to our Negro citizens and to help the deprived, both white       and black, than in the hundred years before that time. But       much, much more remains to be done.        For there are millions of Negroes untrained for the       simplest of jobs, and thousands every day denied their full       and equal rights under the law; and the violence of the       disinherited, the insulted and the injured, looms over the       streets of Harlem and of Watts and Southside Chicago.        But a Negro American trains as an astronaut, one of       mankind's first explorers into outer space; another is the       chief barrister of the United States government, and dozens  [[Page S5633]]       sit on the benches of our court; and another, Dr. Martin       Luther King, is the second man of African descent to win the       Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent efforts for social       justice between all of the races.        We have passed laws prohibiting discrimination in       education, in employment, in housing; but these laws alone       cannot overcome the heritage of centuries--of broken families       and stunted children, and poverty and degradation and pain.        So the road toward equality of freedom is not easy, and       great cost and danger march alongside all of us. We are       committed to peaceful and non-violent change and that is       important for all to understand--though change is unsettling.       Still, even in the turbulence of protest and struggle is       greater hope for the future, as men learn to claim and       achieve for themselves the rights formerly petitioned from       others.        And most important of all, all the panoply of government       power has been committed to the goal of equality before the       law--as we are now committing ourselves to achievement of       equal opportunity in fact.        We must recognize the full human equality of all of our       people--before God, before the law, and in the councils of       government. We must do this, not because it is economically       advantageous--although it is; not because the laws of God       command it--although they do; not because people in other       lands wish it so. We must do it for the single and       fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do.        We recognize that there are problems and obstacles before       the fulfillment of these ideals in the United States as we       recognize that other nations, in Latin America and in Asia       and in Africa have their own political, economic, and social       problems, their unique barriers to the elimination of       injustices.        In some, there is concern that change will submerge the       rights of a minority, particularly where that minority is of       a different race than that of the majority. We in the United       States believe in the protection of minorities; we recognize       the contributions that they can make and the leadership they       can provide; and we do not believe that any people--whether       majority or minority, or individual human beings--are       ``expendable'' in the cause of theory or policy. We recognize       also that justice between men and nations is imperfect, and       that humanity sometimes progresses very slowly indeed.        All do not develop in the same manner and at the same pace.       Nations, like men, often march to the beat of different       drummers, and the precise solutions of the United States can       neither be dictated nor transplanted to others, and that is       not our intention. What is important however is that all       nations must march toward increasing freedom; toward justice       for all; toward a society strong and flexible enough to meet       the demands of all of its people, whatever their race, and       the demands of a world of immense and dizzying change that       face us all.        In a few hours, the plane that brought me to this country       crossed over oceans and countries which have been a crucible       of human history. In minutes we traced migrations of men over       thousands of years; seconds, the briefest glimpse, and we       passed battlefields on which millions of men once struggled       and died. We could see no national boundaries, no vast gulfs       or high walls dividing people from people; only nature and       the works of man--homes and factories and farms--everywhere       reflecting man's common effort to enrich his life. Everywhere       new technology and communications bring men and nations       closer together, the concerns of one inevitably become the       concerns of all. And our new closeness is stripping away the       false masks, the illusion of differences which is at the root       of injustice and hate and war. Only earthbound man still       clings to the dark and poisoning superstition that his world       is bounded by the nearest hill, his universe ends at river's       shore, his common humanity is enclosed in the tight circle of       those who share his town or his views and the color of his       skin.        It is your job, the task of the young people in this world       to strip the last remnants of that ancient, cruel belief from       the civilization of man.        Each nation has different obstacles and different goals,       shaped by the vagaries of history and of experience. Yet as I       talk to young people around the world I am impressed not by       the diversity but by the closeness of their goals, their       desires, and their concerns and their hope for the future.       There is discrimination in New York, the racial inequality of       apartheid in South Africa, and serfdom in the mountains of       Peru. People starve to death in the streets of India; a       former Prime Minister is summarily executed in the Congo;       intellectuals go to jail in Russia; and thousands are       slaughtered in Indonesia; wealth is lavished on armaments       everywhere in the world. These are different evils; but they       are the common works of man. They reflect the imperfections       of human justice, the inadequacy of human compassion, the       defectiveness of our sensibility toward the sufferings of our       fellows; they mark the limit of our ability to use knowledge       for the well-being of our fellow human beings throughout the       world. And therefore they call upon common qualities of       conscience and indignation, a shared determination to wipe       away the unnecessary sufferings of our fellow human beings at       home and around the world.        It is these qualities which make of our youth today the       only true international community. More than this I think       that we could agree on what kind of a world we want to build.       It would be a world of independent nations, moving toward       international community, each of which protected and       respected the basic human freedoms. It would be a world which       demanded of each government that it accept its responsibility       to insure social justice. It would be a world of constantly       accelerating economic progress--not material welfare as an       end in of itself, but as a means to liberate the capacity of       every human being to pursue his talents and to pursue his       hopes. It would, in short, be a world that we would all be       proud to have built.        Just to the North of here are lands of challenge and of       opportunity--rich in natural resources, land and minerals and       people. Yet they are also lands confronted by the greatest       odds--overwhelming ignorance, internal tensions and strife,       and great obstacles of climate and geography. Many of these       nations, as colonies, were oppressed and were exploited. Yet       they have not estranged themselves from the broad traditions       of the West; they are hoping and they are gambling their       progress and their stability on the chance that we will meet       our responsibilities to them, to help them overcome their       poverty.        In the world we would like to build, South Africa could       play an outstanding role, and a role of leadership in that       effort. This country is without question a preeminent       repository of the wealth and the knowledge and the skill of       the continent. Here are the greater part of Africa's research       scientists and steel production, most of its reservoirs of       coal and of electric power. Many South Africans have made       major contributions to African technical development and       world science; the names of some are known wherever men seek       to eliminate the ravages of tropical disease and of       pestilence. In your faculties and councils, here in this very       audience, are hundreds and thousands of men and women who       could transform the lives of millions for all time to come.        But the help and leadership of South Africa or of the       United States cannot be accepted if we--within our own       countries or in our relationships with others--deny       individual integrity, human dignity, and the common humanity       of man. If we would lead outside our own borders; if we would       help those who need our assistance; if we would meet our       responsibilities to mankind; we must first, all of us,       demolish the borders which history has erected between men       within our own nations--barriers of race and religion, social       class and ignorance.        Our answer is the world's hope; it is to rely on youth. The       cruelties and the obstacles of this swiftly changing planet       will not yield to obsolete dogmas and outworn slogans. It       cannot be moved by those who cling to a present which is       already dying, who prefer the illusion of security to the       excitement and danger which comes with even the most peaceful       progress. This world demands the qualities of youth: not a       time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a       quality of imagination, a predominance of courage over       timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the life of       ease--a man like the Chancellor of this University. It is a       revolutionary world that we all live in; and thus, as I have       said in Latin America and Asia and in Europe and in my own       country, the United States, it is the young people who must       take the lead. Thus you, and your young compatriots       everywhere have had thrust upon you a greater burden of       responsibility than any generation that has ever lived.        ``There is,'' said an Italian philosopher, ``nothing more       difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more       uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the       introduction of a new order of things.'' Yet this is the       measure of the task of your generation and the road is strewn       with many dangers.        First is the danger of futility; the belief there is       nothing one man or one woman can do against the enormous       array of the world's ills--against misery, against ignorance,       or injustice and violence. Yet many of the world's great       movements, of thought and action, have flowed from the work       of a single man. A young monk began the Protestant       reformation, a young general extended an empire from       Macedonia to the borders of the earth, and a young woman       reclaimed the territory of France. It was a young Italian       explorer who discovered the New World, and 32 year old Thomas       Jefferson who proclaimed that all men are created equal.       ``Give me a place to stand,'' said Archimedes, ``and I will       move the world.'' These men moved the world, and so can we       all. Few will have the greatness to bend history; but each of       us can work to change a small portion of the events, and in       the total of all these acts will be written the history of       this generation. Thousands of Peace Corps volunteers are       making a difference in the isolated villages and the city       slums of dozens of countries. Thousands of unknown men and       women in Europe resisted the occupation of the Nazis and many       died, but all added to the ultimate strength and freedom of       their countries. It is from numberless diverse acts of       courage such as these that the belief that human history is       thus shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts       to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against       injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing       each other from a million different centers of energy and       daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the       mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.        ``If Athens shall appear great to you,'' said Pericles,       ``consider then that her glories  [[Page S5634]]       were purchased by valiant men, and by men who learned their       duty.'' That is the source of all greatness in all societies,       and it is the key to progress in our own time.        The second danger is that of expediency; of those who say       that hopes and beliefs must bend before immediate       necessities. Of course if we must act effectively we must       deal with the world as it is. We must get things done. But if       there was one thing that President Kennedy stood for that       touched the most profound feeling of young people across the       world, it was the belief that idealism, high aspiration and       deep convictions are not incompatible with the most practical       and efficient of programs--that there is no basic       inconsistency between ideals and realistic possibilities--no       separation between the deepest desires of heart and of mind       and the rational application of human effort to human       problems. It is not realistic or hard-headed to solve       problems and take action unguided by ultimate moral aims and       values, although we all know some who claim that it is so. In       my judgement, it is thoughtless folly. For it ignores the       realities of human faith and of passion and of belief; forces       ultimately more powerful than all the calculations of our       economists or of our generals. Of course to adhere to       standards, to idealism, to vision in the face of immediate       dangers takes great courage and takes self-confidence. But we       also know that only those who dare to fail greatly, can ever       achieve greatly.        It is this new idealism which is also, I believe, the       common heritage of a generation which has learned that while       efficiency can lead to the camps at Auschwitz, or the streets       of Budapest, only the ideals of humanity and love can climb       the hills of the Acropolis.        A third danger is timidity. Few men are willing to brave       the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their       colleagues, the wrath of their society. Moral courage is a       rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence.       Yet it is the one essential, vital quality for those who seek       to change the world which yields most painfully to change.       Aristotle tells us ``At the Olympic games it is not the       finest or the strongest men who are crowned, but those who       enter the lists . . . so too in the life of the honorable and       the good it is they who act rightly who win the prize.'' I       believe that in this generation those with the courage to       enter the conflict will find themselves with companions in       every corner of the world.        For the fortunate amongst us, the fourth danger is comfort;       the temptation to follow the easy and familiar path of       personal ambition and financial success so grandly spread       before those who have the privilege of an education. But that       is not the road history has marked out for us. There is a       Chinese curse which says ``May he live in interesting       times.'' Like it or not, we live in interesting times. They       are times of danger and uncertainty; but they are also the       most creative of any time in the history of mankind. And       everyone here will ultimately be judged--will ultimately       judge himself--on the effort he has contributed to building a       new world society and the extent to which his ideals and       goals have shaped that effort.        So we part, I to my country and you to remain. We are--if a       man of forty can claim the privilege--fellow members of the       world's largest younger generation. Each of us have our own       work to do. I know at times you must feel very alone with       your problems and with your difficulties. But I want to say       how impressed I am with what you stand for and for the effort       you are making; and I say this not just for myself, but men       and women all over the world. And I hope you will often take       heart from the knowledge that you are joined with your fellow       young people in every land, they struggling with their       problems and you with yours, but all joined in a common       purpose; that, like the young people of my own country and of       every country that I have visited, you are all in many ways       more closely united to the brothers of your time than to the       older generation in any of these nations; you are determined       to build a better future. President Kennedy was speaking to       the young people of America, but beyond them to young people       everywhere, when he said ``The energy, the faith, the       devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our       country and all who serve it--and the glow from that fire can       truly light the world.''        And, he added, ``With a good conscience our only sure       reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go       forth and lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His       help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be       our own.''        I thank you.                            ____________________
