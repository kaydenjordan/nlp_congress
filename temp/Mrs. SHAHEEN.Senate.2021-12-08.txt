 Madam President, I rise today to acknowledge that the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will soon lose a fine  public servant to retirement. The National Weather Service's director,  Dr. Louis Uccellini, is retiring at the end of this year. The National  Weather Service--NWS--produces the weather forecasts and products that  we rely on a daily basis. These predictions are critical for protecting  lives and property around the country, and Dr. Uccellini has played a  big part of this work for the last several decades. Before I mention  any specific accomplishments, let me share a couple of numbers: 43  years of public service, 70 published scientific articles and chapters  in books, and more than 4,500 employees working out of some 168 units  or offices.   Dr. Uccellini--or Louis, as he urges people to call him--has been  passionate about weather since he was a small child. A tremendous  snowstorm caught his attention during his youth, and even now, he is  still fascinated by winter weather, so much so that among the many  offices, teams, and even organizations he founded is the Winter Weather  desk at the Weather Prediction Center. Among his many scientific  accomplishments, Dr. Uccellini co-wrote what has been deemed the most  authoritative study on winter weather, appropriately called ``Northeast  Snowstorms.''   There is no aspect of today's weather forecast that Dr. Uccellini  didn't either pioneer, or improve, from models that focus on individual  phenomena or areas, to the first ensemble models, to seasonal  forecasting models and even space weather. Louis established unified  workstations that let forecasters view and assimilate multiple data  inputs, and he took an entire forecast division from analog to digital.  His ability to look at and integrate multiple types of data inputs and  computer systems is why we as a nation can look from a daily forecast  to weekly to subseasonal to seasonal. He introduced and integrated  ocean, wave, water, air quality, and space models with weather models  and oversaw all nine of the NWS's National Centers for Environmental  Prediction before being tapped to lead the entire National Weather  Service.   Yet Louis is much more than a scientist. His leadership of NWS and  pioneering cultural and organizational changes led the Federal  contracting trade publication FCW to name him in 2020 as one of  America's top 100 Government Executives, and he was selected to serve  as a National Academy of Public Administration Fellow. The ability to  lead and manage an organization is difficult even when administration  is one's primary profession. It is a large secondary hat for a  scientist to wear, and Louis wore it with aplomb, taking the National  Weather Service to new heights of organization, service, and  professionalism.   In 2013, Louis took the helm of the Weather Service. He improved the  organization's financial management by creating a budget and  organizational structure that mirrored the forecast process. All of NWS  is now in alignment: the forecast process, budget portfolio and  management structure, creating a stronger sense of mission, and  delivering transparency both internally and externally. He truly  righted the ship. He actually embraced external audits and advice from  consultants and proactively circled back to review changes he was  leading at NWS.   One event comes to mind when I think of what will define Uccellini's  most lasting legacy. In April 2011, a dramatic and devastating tornado  outbreak that struck our southern States killed 316 people even though  the NWS had been warning partners and the community for days in  advance. The tragic number of lives lost, despite multiple warnings,  led Louis to lead the Weather Service into a new model for  communication called Impact-based Decision Support Services, IDSS. The  launch of IDSS was a sea change in NWS operations in which the forecast  is not an end product but a starting point for forecasters to help  emergency managers advise communities. By deepening Weather Service  partnerships with emergency managers, IDSS has increased forecast  effectiveness and saved lives. Louis led the NWS toward its goal of  creating a Weather-Ready Nation, increasing community and individual  readiness and resilience.   There are few public servants like Louis Uccellini. He has  strengthened our Nation's research on and resilience to extreme weather  events. On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire, I thank Dr.  Uccellini for his decades of excellent service to our Nation and wish  him well in his retirement. He will be missed.                            ____________________
