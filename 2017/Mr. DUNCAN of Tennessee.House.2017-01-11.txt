 Mr. Speaker, some people have expressed  concern that President-elect Trump will start a trade war if he gets  tough on trade. But what they are not admitting, or perhaps it has  never occurred to them, is that we have been in a trade war for many  years, and we have been losing.   China has followed a China-first policy for years to their great  benefit, while we have sent millions of good jobs to other countries  and several million of our young people now can find jobs only in  restaurants.   With only 4 percent of the world's population, we buy 21.7 percent of  the world's goods. We used to buy about 25 percent, but we have more  competition around the world now as most countries are trying to move  away from socialism while we seemingly move toward it. But we still  have tremendous leverage on trade that we have not used because every  country wants desperately into our markets.   We need to negotiate trade deals that will create more jobs in this  country. We need, Mr. Speaker, to tell foreign leaders that we want to  buy things from them, but they need to start buying from us, too.  Friendship is a two-way street.                            ____________________
