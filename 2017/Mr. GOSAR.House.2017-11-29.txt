 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and H.R.  3905, the Minnesota Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest  Act.   17,000 jobs, $3 billion for education, $1.5 billion in annual wages,  and $2.5 billion annually for our economy are at risk if we don't pass  H.R. 3905. Further, there are more than 4 billion tons of ore  containing copper, nickel, and other metal resources within the area  the previous administration tried to shut down, which represents the  largest known undeveloped deposit of strategic and critical minerals in  the world.   If left unchallenged, these political anti-mining and anti-education  actions set precedent for a sweeping executive power grab that  threatens communities throughout the country. Education will be  significantly harmed, as Minnesota is projected to lose up to $3  billion in royalty revenues for the State's permanent school trust fund  that would support nearly 900,000 K-12 students statewide if the  withdrawal application and canceled leases are not rejected.   As the President, on January 19, was leaving office, he actually  proposed a massive land withdrawal in northern Minnesota, immediately  placing 245,000 acres off limits to development potentially for 20 more  years in the future.   In conjunction with this massive mineral withdrawal, the Obama  administration's Bureau of Land Management inappropriately rejected  Twin Metals Minnesota's application to renew two hard rock mineral  leases in Minnesota's Superior National Monument.   Finally, I want to put to rest the false claim raised by the  extremist groups that this bill would affect the 1.1-million-acre  Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness that already has a significant  buffer between it and the forest.   No one is advocating to mine in the wilderness or the surrounding  buffer zones. In fact, the bill clearly states on page 4: ``Nothing in  this section may be construed as permitting the prospecting for  development and utilization of mineral resources within the Boundary  Waters Canoe Area Wilderness or Mine Protection Area.''   Congress has authorized mining in the forest by law two different  times, and the 1986 Forest Service and 2004 Forest Plans both concluded  mining is a desired condition in the Superior National Forest.   Mr. Speaker, I ask Members to support this commonsense, job-creating  bill and to support the rule to bring this bill to the floor for proper  adjudication.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons why many of us are opposed to H.R.  3905 is because we see it as a corporate giveaway that puts treasured  public lands in the hands of a Chilean mining conglomerate.   So much of what comes out of this Congress is about rewarding those  who are well-connected and well-off, rewarding corporations at the  expense of average citizens.   I will go back to our previous question, which would force a vote.  Everything would still move forward, but it would force a vote on a  bill that was introduced by Ms. Eshoo that would require Presidents and  Presidential nominees to release their tax returns.   It is not just the connections between the Trump family and this  mining company that we have concerns about; it is the connections  between this President and his administration and the tax bill that is  being proposed that we know would raise taxes on millions and millions  of middle class families and basically give a big tax cut to the  wealthiest individuals and to corporate special interests and to  corporations. We think that is all backwards, but I think the American  people deserve to know who benefits and who doesn't.   Again, for the life of me, I don't understand why so many of my  Republican friends have circled the wagons in opposition to  transparency, in opposition to letting the American people know where  this President's conflicts of interests are, and basically protect what  I think may very well be multiple conflicts of interest and maybe  conflicts of interest that lead directly into a collision course with  corruption. This is a big deal.   All this legislation that we are talking about here today, there is a  good piece of legislation, the brownfields legislation; a bad piece,  that is this mining bill. This still goes forward, but vote with us to  defeat the previous question so that we can bring up this other bill.   Now, my Republican colleague from Wyoming may say: Well, that is not  what we are talking about here today. The Democrats are just trying to  muddy up the discussion.   The reason why we have to resort to a procedural motion to bring up  this bill to force the President and Presidential nominees to release  their tax  [[Page H9487]]  returns is because the Rules Committee shuts everything down that this  leadership doesn't want to see come to the floor. We can't bring this  bill to the floor to require the President to release his tax returns  under regular order and our normal process. They won't let us. We can't  offer it as an amendment. They won't let us. This is the only way we  can do it.   I would urge my Republican friends to stop defending the indefensible  here.   This thing would apply not just to Donald Trump, it would apply to  every President. We have never had to do this before because every  other President has released their tax returns. This President, for  some reason, doesn't think it is anybody's business.   Given the nature of the legislation coming out of this House of  Representatives, I think the American people need to know and have a  right to know.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 631, I call up  the bill (H.R. 3905) to require congressional approval of any mineral  withdrawal or monument designation involving the National Forest System  lands in the State of Minnesota, to provide for the renewal of certain  mineral leases in such lands, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 631, an  amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules  Committee Print 115-41 is adopted, and the bill, as amended, is  considered read.   The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:                                 H.R. 3905         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Minnesota's Economic Rights       in the Superior National Forest Act''.       SEC. 2. CONDITION ON MINERAL WITHDRAWAL OF NATIONAL FOREST                     SYSTEM LANDS IN MINNESOTA.         Minerals within the National Forest System lands in the       State of Minnesota shall not be subject to withdrawal from       disposition under United States mineral and geothermal       leasing law unless the withdrawal is specifically approved by       an Act of Congress enacted after the date of the enactment of       this Act.       SEC. 3. CONDITION ON MONUMENT DESIGNATION ON NATIONAL FOREST                     SYSTEM LANDS IN MINNESOTA.         Section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, is amended       by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(e) Limitation on Extension or Establishment of a       National Monument in Minnesota.--No extension or       establishment of national monuments on National Forest System       lands in the State of Minnesota may be undertaken except by       express authorization of Congress.''.  [[Page H9499]]            SEC. 4. CLARIFYING THE NATURE OF MINERAL RIGHTS ON FOREST                     SYSTEM LANDS IN MINNESOTA.         (a) Mineral Leases Issued Within Forest System Lands in       Minnesota.--        (1) In general.--All mineral leases issued within the       exterior boundaries of National Forest System lands in the       State of Minnesota under the authority of the Act of June 30,       1950 (16 U.S.C. 508b), or section 402 of Reorganization Plan       No. 3 of 1946 (5 U.S.C. App.), are indeterminate preference       right leases that--        (A) shall be issued for an initial 20-year period; and        (B) as provided in paragraph (2), shall be renewable after       the period described in subparagraph (A) for 10-year renewal       periods.        (2) Requirements for renewal.--A lease shall be renewed       under paragraph (1)(B)--        (A) if the lessee has complied with the terms and       conditions of the lease during the preceding lease period;       and        (B) on the condition that, at the end of each ten-year       renewal period, such reasonable readjustment of the terms and       conditions of the lease may be prescribed by the Secretary of       the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of       Agriculture, for the purpose of--        (i) encouraging production; or        (ii) addressing changing conditions within the lease area.        (b) Suspension of Operations.--The Secretary of the       Interior may suspend operations under a lease described in       subsection (a) when--        (1) the lease can only be operated at a loss due to market       conditions; or        (2) operations are interrupted by strikes.        (c) Permits for Use of Surface Lands.--With respect to       lands subject to a lease pursuant to subsection (a), the       Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary       of Agriculture, may issue permits for the use of surface       lands not included in the lease for purposes connected with,       and reasonably necessary to, the exploration, development,       and use of the deposits covered by the lease.        (d) Applicability to Mineral Leases.--This section shall       apply with respect to all mineral leases described in       subsection (a), including--        (1) leases that on the date of the enactment of this       section are not in effect; and        (2) the hard rock mineral leases for the Superior National       Forest in Minnesota identified as MNES-01352 and MNES-01353.        (e) Applicability of National Environmental Policy Act of       1969.--The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42       U.S.C. 4331 et seq.) shall apply with respect to a mineral       lease described in subsection (a). In the case of the renewal       of the existing hard rock mineral leases referred to in       subsection (d)(2), the Bureau of Land Management shall       complete the pending environmental assessment no later than       30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.        (f) Exclusion of Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.--      Nothing in this section may be construed as permitting the       prospecting for development and utilization of mineral       resources within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness or       Mine Protection Area.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for  1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committee on Natural Resources.   After 1 hour of debate, it shall be in order to consider the further  amendment printed in House Report 115-429, if offered by the Member  designated in the report, which shall be considered read, shall be  separately debatable for the time specified in the report, equally  divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, and shall not  be subject to a demand for a division of the question.   The gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar) and the gentleman from  California (Mr. Lowenthal) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H.R. 3905.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arizona?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H.R. 3905.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arizona?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), the originator of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, as a Californian who lives in a very rural  part of the State that is economically in huge pain, when I see an  opportunity for people in rural America to prosper, to do well, I see,  in H.R. 3905, again, this opportunity for the people in Minnesota.   The MINER Act, introduced by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Emmer), will put it on the right track toward being able to extract the  minerals that are needed for production of taking raw materials and  making them into finished products here in the United States.   This bill addresses a 230,000-acre mineral withdrawal from Superior  National Forest in Minnesota, which, really, it is about jobs and  economic growth, while also maintaining clear standards for all  projects across the Nation.   Indeed, this is a very narrow bill. It explores the possibilities,  which is only a small step. Indeed, if mining was to occur, there is a  litany of permits, years of process required to take that following  step.   Indeed, the arbitrary decision, the day before President Obama left  office, halted a $400 million project, jeopardized 17,000 American  jobs, cut $3 billion from K-12 schools, and slashed $2.5 billion  annually from local governments and the State.   These types of effects I feel in my own district where our industries  have been taken away. Any time there is a proposal to do anything like  that, whether it is timber harvest, mining, or whatever, you then hear  about how the whole zone is pristine and unique, never been touched.  These operations can happen environmentally correctly, environmentally  soundly, and that is the standard for which we have in this country, is  that we will do things correctly now, and we will put them back when we  are done.   Though a 20-year moratorium was imposed on the area, similar plans  for mining have previously been approved by Congress twice. Mining  operations across the country already commit to a strict environmental  review process to ensure the public safety and the protection of  natural resources, as we all expect. You mine an area under the strict  guidelines, and you reclaim it.   In most cases, mining companies must also put up bonds to pay for  cleanup, sometimes for billions of dollars before a single shovel is  ever turned. In this case, we are talking about exploration of the area  to see what the potential is.   This bill does not overturn existing Federal, State, or local  environmental reviews. Instead, it ensures all projects are held to  clear, consistent requirements, not arbitrary political decisions.  Allowing politicians to prohibit one project or another, based solely  on a whim, goes against American ideals of fairness and equal  opportunity.   These minerals are essential to our economy. To those claiming that  mining will damage the environment, I would ask you this: Where would  you prefer that these minerals come from? Do you want the mining to  occur here in America, under these kinds of strict guidelines, bring  American jobs to the front; or do we want to do it elsewhere in the  world, places like China and others that have little respect for the  environmental process or review or operations that are sustainable?   I think we should have it here. Where would you have us get our  minerals? Where would you have us get the rare earth materials that are  needed for production of new technologies?   H.R. 3905 protects Minnesota's economy, schools, and State budget; it  protects the rule of law; and it protects the domestic access to these  important materials and minerals we need to have our economy get  stronger--a very narrow scope; it is sound legislation and sound  policy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge swift passage of this important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), the originator of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to remind everybody I am wearing a copper tie,  and that is because I come from Arizona. We are known as the 5 Cs: for  the cotton, for the climate, for the cattle, for the citrus, and for  copper. It is a critical mineral.   We have seen these displays here in the well this morning, diverting  the public's attention about what truly is actually here.   This is actually a cite to explain to people exactly the clear  definition. Let's look at this.   What you see in red and yellow, just like a light that you see red,  stop; yellow, caution; green, go, the red is the Boundary Waters. The  red is the Boundary Waters: no mining, no mining whatsoever. The yellow  is a buffer.   By the way, the only place in the United States in which a monument  is surrounded by a buffer: no, don't proceed.   They confused you with that map. This is where we are talking about,  down in here, in the green area. It is not the Boundary Waters. The  pictures you saw that were in the well so eloquently shown to us were  of the Boundary Waters, not where the mining is going to take place.   Let's dispel the rumors. Let's get back down to facts.   Red, no mining; yellow, no mining; green, okay. But that is following  rules. That is following all rules.   Once again, just to remind folks back home that are watching, the red  is the Boundary Waters. There is no mining in the Boundary Waters. The  pictures you saw in the well are of the Boundary Waters. No mining  occurs in the Boundary Waters.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the charge is Minnesotans strongly oppose mining near  the  [[Page H9509]]  Boundary Waters, so let's go back, remind everybody back at home about  the red. We are not talking about the red or the yellow in the previous  document. Let's go through what we see.   Minnesota's Democratic Governor was for mining in the area before he  was against it. Several polls over the years consistently show strong  support for copper-nickel mining in general and for allowing companies  to explore and propose projects.   In November of 2016, a poll of 400 registered voters in the Eighth  Congressional District found, among other results, by greater than a 3  to 1 margin, survey respondents support environmentally responsible  mining in the region.   By greater than 2-to-1 margins, respondents support the building of a  new copper-nickel mine and believe copper-nickel mining can be done in  an environmentally responsible way. They demand that. More than 60  percent support an underground copper-nickel project, the Twin Metals  mine.   In October 2013, a poll of more than 600 registered Minnesota voters  statewide found, among other results, a majority of voters, 56 percent,  favor expanding Minnesota's mining industry.   A plurality of voters, 48 percent, support expanding the nickel- copper mining industry in the State.   All mayors, State legislators, the county commissioners that  represent the Iron Range region, and the area proposed for the  withdrawal are pro-mining advocates. Fifty-three bipartisan State  legislators, including leadership of both parties, have endorsed the  bill and support the passage.   Why is that?   These aren't just your average jobs. They don't pay service wages of  $20,000. These are $100,000 plus and, additionally, have benefits.  Those are jobs that Americans sink their teeth into. That is what built  America.   Stay tuned. I am going to show you some other photos of how they  really look at mining.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This bill alters no current environmental laws or protections. Mining  companies will still have to comply with the Clean Water Act, Clean Air  Act, NEPA, and all State and Federal laws.   In fact, the local communities--everybody wants clean water. These  people actually live in the area. These local communities actually want  mining in Minnesota. It results in cleaner water. This is actually a  viewpoint of an actual mine site. This is a long time ago. This is a  pit. What ends up happening is, they are very proud, because Minnesota  is proud of their water.   This picture is before, and this is after. Can you imagine local  municipalities and towns lining up for this water? This is the cleanest  water in Minnesota. This is how they will actually reclaim the water.  This isn't me. These are the people from the area who gave us these  photos. And if you want to see an in-depth video, go to YouTube and  look up the video that the people back in this region put together.  This actually shows you, this is clean water. This is where you have  pristine fisheries. They line up for this water.   There are no environmental hazards. Minnesota's mining industry has  been proud of what they have actually built. Once again, before and  after, it is an inconceivable difference.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    That is a taconite pit.    That is a taconite pit.    Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman is talking about this whole  aspect, the gentleman is right, but it is about all mining. This isn't  just about copper mining. This is about taconite and all other mining.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a question of the  gentleman from California. Can the gentleman give me an example of a  mine that he actually supports?    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Reclaiming my time, once again, the gentleman can't  identify a single mine that is permissible to the opposition.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We have heard some other charges that H.R. 3905 changes five Federal  laws for Minnesota's national forests. This bill alters no current  environmental laws or protections. The Federal Land Policy and  Management Act, NEPA, and all other environmental laws still apply to  Minnesota.   Let's go through this history. In 1950, Congress took action to make  land available for mineral exploration and development within the  Superior National Forest. Congress did. Then again, in 1978, Congress  passed the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act, a compromise that  prohibited mining within the 1.1 million acre Boundary Waters; once  again, the red area and the yellow. No mining.   But again, it specifically authorized mining in the Superior National  Forest, the green. Once again, red, no; yellow, no; green, go. But that  is fulfilling all current legislative and environmental laws.   The General Mining Act of 1872 that we heard about earlier governs  most mining on Federal lands. However, in this case, it does not. It is  the Weeks Act that controls projects in this area because they are  located on acquired National Forest mineral leases on these lands.  There are no indefinite agreements. They typically retain a  nondiscretionary right--nondiscretionary right, once again--to renew  every 20 years. The two leases for the mineral deposit in question  began in 1966, were renewed in 1989, and again in 2004, without  controversy.   The MINER Act halts last-minute political mineral withdrawals by  requiring congressional approval. Once again, the magical words are  ``congressional approval.'' The return to federalism--amazing--renews  those two mining leases that were denied for political reasons under  the same terms they were renewed twice previously and ensures any  future mining projects will have to satisfy all existing environmental  permitting requirements, including NEPA.   These people demand that they do it in a righteous way. There is no  digging right now. These are proposed. The Minnesotans whom I came up  to visit, they happily shared their history and their area with me.  They want it done right because they have to live with the  consequences; not somebody who comes from Twin Cities once in a blue  moon.   Once again, let's go back. This is the Boundary Waters. This is what  you have heard misrepresented all the way around. There is no mining  going on in the Boundary Waters. There is no mining going on in the  buffer area. Once again, no other buffer exists around a national  monument except this. This is hallowed ground. Green, go.   Now, it is also very unfortunate that we hear rumors going around  from Members of Congress that the Department of the Interior actually  is against this. That rumor is far from the truth. We just received an  email from the Secretary of the Interior that they are not opposed to  this bill.   I include in the Record a list of over 150 groups, individuals, and  community leaders who now want to be on record as supporting the lawful  aspects of returning this back to the folks in Minnesota for mining.

Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Arizona has 1\1/2\  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, what transpired here was a travesty. As I  outlined, historically, Congress dictated twice in a usual fashion this  green area for go. They designed the Boundary Waters and a buffer area  for protection.   Once again, no Boundary Waters--you are being misled--no Boundary  Waters are having mining. This is as clear as it gets. What ended up  happening was in an illegal action by the President last year, or  earlier this year, he wiped this away.   This doesn't wipe away any environmental laws. What it does is, it  returns it to the way it was. The way that it should be; the way that  Congress dictated. Federalism, a return to the people in that State.   Mr. Speaker, I ask everybody to vote for this bill and support this  bill. I also ask everybody to go to a video that has been produced by  the people in this iron-ore range to see exactly how the people of that  area of Minnesota actually feel about it. It is magnificent.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.                   Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Grijalva     Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for  5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for  5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, in July, the Subcommittee on Energy and  Mineral Resources heard all about how royalties, if ill-constructed,  serve only to disincentivize investment in self-sufficiency and  increase our reliance on imported critical minerals.   This amendment is a hallmark example of such a poorly designed  royalty. This amendment doesn't specify what the royalty will be  applied to, when in the mining process it will be assessed, and it  doesn't even have a cap, for that matter. This amendment is just a  thinly veiled means to prevent this important mining project from  getting off the ground. The author actually stated that in his  comments.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this amendment. I ask all Members to vote  against it, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, once again, we may want to go back to misinformation.  This does not pertain to the Mining Act of 1872. In fact, this is under  the Weeks Act, which controls projects in this area because they are  located on acquired natural forest land. Mineral leases on these lands,  though not indefinite agreements, typically retain nondiscretionary  right for renewal every 20 years.   The two leases for mineral deposits in question began in 1966, were  renewed in 1989, and again in 2004 without controversy.   I would also like to take the opportunity to go through a number of  groups that actually are against this amendment and endorse the bill.   Fifty-three bipartisan State legislators from the State of Minnesota  are for this bill: ``As elected leaders of the Minnesota Legislature,  we are writing in strong support of H.R. 3905. This legislation  supports jobs, economic development and industry in northeast  Minnesota, and will reverse an onerous, overreaching, and politically  motivated decision by the Obama administration. H.R. 3905 has  bipartisan support, and it is our sincere hope that it will become law  for the well-being of our State and its citizens.''    A second one from the Range Association of Municipalities and  Schools:         The results of the withdrawal and a potential 20-year       moratorium would have a devastating impact on the financial       support for our statewide public school system and future       generations of Iron Rangers who would be employed in any       future mining developments. It has been estimated that within       20 years of mining for precious metals, our Permanent School       Trust Fund would reap nearly $3 billion in royalties if       allowed to go forward. The Miner Act does not infringe or       restrict these very strenuous and stringent environmental       review processes, and we emphasize there will be no mining in       the Boundary Waters or the buffer zone specifically       surrounding the Boundary Waters.    Let's go to the next one from the American Exploration & Mining  Association: ``H.R. 3905 will eliminate delays, return to good  stewardship of fair process and restore the opportunity to explore  strategic metals critical to our economy and national security in one  of the richest mineral deposits in the Nation. . . . The emerging  mining industry is an investment in the future well-being of our State  and Nation; without this legislation, that future is at risk.''   Here is another one from the Competitive Enterprise Institute: ``The  bipartisan H.R. 3905 is a welcome reassertion of congressional  authority over public lands. Article 4 of the Constitution vests  Congress--not the President--with plenary power over public  [[Page H9512]]  lands. Members on both sides of the aisle should take umbrage at  President Obama's lameduck machinations to withdraw from the multiple- use framework more than 230,000 acres of public lands in Minnesota-- with the mere stroke of a pen. By treating public lands regulation as a  means to build a Presidential legacy through midnight regulation, the  previous administration flouted the spirit of participatory and  inclusive lands-use statutes as designed by Congress. Lawmakers should  correct the course by passing the excellent H.R. 3905.''   Finally, the Associated General Contractors of Minnesota:         H.R. 3905 changes no environmental review processes,       relaxes no environmental standards, and specifically restates       Congress' prohibition on any mining activity in the Boundary       Waters and surrounding protective buffer areas. H.R. 3905       would reaffirm longstanding congressional intent that       actually espouses that this area be designated for mining and       timber sales.    Mr. Speaker, I ask everybody to vote against this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Gallagher). Pursuant to the rule, the  previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended, and on the  amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).   Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further consideration of H.R.  3905 is postponed.                            ____________________
