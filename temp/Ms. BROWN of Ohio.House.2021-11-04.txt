 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Kaptur for  her kind introduction.   I rise as the newest Representative for Ohio's 11th Congressional  District.   First, I thank my family, including my mom and dad; my siblings, Ray  and Nick; my nieces and nephews; aunts; uncles; cousins; and a special  birthday shout-out to my cousin, Stephanie. I am guessing this is the  best birthday present she has ever received.   I also thank my friends Azuree, Lisa, and Kelly, and their parents;  my team; and all of my incredible supporters who helped me along the  way.   But most importantly, I thank the great people of my district for  placing their trust in me.   I am humbled and honored to have the privilege of serving you, the  people of Ohio's 11th Congressional District, in the House of  Representatives. I take this responsibility seriously.   I ran for Congress because I believe in the resilience of the  community I love and call home; because I believe that public service  is always about putting the people first; because I believe that now,  with the eyes of history upon us, it is time to build a more just and  more equitable future. These are the values I promise to hold close  every day as I make your voice heard in Congress.   I enter these hallowed Halls on the shoulders of my predecessors,  leaders like Louis Stokes; Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones; and my  mentor and my friend, HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge. I vow to do the same  work that she did as I vow to work for the people and be a voice of the  people.   As a proud Clevelander, I know that we are strong and that our work  is to emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever. Our work is to  rebuild an economy that puts the dignity of working people first, to  protect the most vulnerable among us, to ensure every child has access  to quality public education, to fight for a day when every person has a  roof over their head and food on their plate, to protect the right to  vote, and to tackle the other great challenges of our time.   I cannot wait to get to work with my colleagues in Congress to  deliver results for the people of northeast Ohio and this great  country.                            ____________________
