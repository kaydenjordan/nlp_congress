 Mr. President, on January 6, 2017, the U.S.  intelligence community released a shocking report.   It stated: ``We assess with high confidence that Russian President  Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016, aimed at the U.S.  presidential election, the consistent goals of which were to undermine  public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary  Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.''   This wasn't just one intelligence agency, it was a unanimous  conclusion of the entire intelligence community.   It sent shockwaves throughout our entire government. This isn't about  Republicans versus Democrats, it is about a foreign President ordering  an attack on our democracy.   President Putin's goal was clear: to sow division and discord and to  undermine public faith in our democratic processes and the rule of law.   Almost immediately we saw concerns and calls for action from both  sides of the aisle.   Bipartisan congressional investigations were initiated to figure out  exactly what happened and how to prevent it from happening again.   However, despite this promising beginning, the commitment to uncover  the facts and protect our country from outside attacks has devolved  into an inside attack on our own democratic institutions.   Sadly, rather than serving as a unifying force, President Trump has  done all he can to undermine the intelligence community's assessment.   What is worse, he has utterly failed to take strong actions against  Russia--and in some cases has rewarded Russia by changing U.S. policy.   Instead of supporting a robust and independent investigation into  what Russia did and who was involved, the President instead is working  to halt the investigations altogether.  [[Page S645]]    Unfortunately, the President hasn't been alone in these efforts.   Last week, Congressman Devin Nunes, chairman of the House  Intelligence Committee, pushed for the declassification of a  transparently political memo written by his staff.   Here are some things we know about the memo and the process to  release it: We know that the memo confirms the FBI's Russia  investigation was not triggered by the dossier or by Carter Page.   In fact, the investigation started because another Trump campaign  foreign policy adviser, George Papadapolous, was told in April that  Russia had ``dirt'' on Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.   We also know that, while Carter Page was not the reason the Russia  investigation started, the government had a reasonable belief that Page  was acting as an agent of a foreign power.   We know that Congressman Nunes did not review the underlying  classified documents himself.   These documents include the FISA warrant renewal applications, which  must show what the government was learning about Carter Page.   Instead of reviewing these documents himself, the chairman relied  solely on his staff, who may or may not have been coordinating this  campaign with the White House. We don't know because Congressman Nunes  refuses to answer that question.   We know that Chairman Nunes refused to allow the Department of  Justice and FBI to brief all Members on the underlying documents before  and after the memo's release.   We know that Congressman Nunes refused to allow Democrats to issue  their own analysis of the classified documents along with his memo.   And we know that Russian social media bots assisted in the efforts to  influence American public opinion concerning the memo.   The drafting and release of this partisan, misleading memo was  particularly disturbing to me.   As Senator McCain stated last week, ``If we continue to undermine our  own rule of law, we are doing Putin's job for him.''   Intelligence and law enforcement oversight should never be used as a  political weapon.   I have served on the Senate Intelligence Committee for 17 years, and  I can't recall a single instance when an intelligence report was  handled in this manner or a situation where additional views were  actively blocked from being released.   This has been true even with the most controversial issues like the  Intelligence Committee's investigation of the Benghazi attacks or the  report on the CIA's use of torture.   In both of these instances, the committee held bipartisan meetings  and shared drafts of report language between the majority and minority.   For the torture report, the CIA was offered and accepted  opportunities to respond and request changes. The committee revised its  report where appropriate and even cited disagreements in footnotes.   Once public, the committee included additional views from Republicans  on the committee. The CIA's response was made public. There was a very  thorough declassification process to ensure the summary was safe to  release.   In fact, even though the final report was completed in 2012, the  executive summary wasn't made public until December 2014 in order to  ensure the process was properly followed.   There were disagreements, but the minority party was not cut out of  the process.   That is not how the Senate works, that is not how democracy works,  and it is not how any congressional committee or investigation should  operate.   What I have described so far was the process and political  implications of the Nunes memo, but it is just one part of an extensive  pattern of abuse of power.   What we are seeing is a sustained, coordinated effort to diminish,  weaken, and destabilize our top law enforcement officials, and we all  should take exception to that.   Both the rushed manner and the disputed contents of the Nunes memo  are a case in point.   After the memo was released on Friday, House Intelligence Committee  Ranking Member Adam Schiff hit the nail on the head.   He called the public release of misleading allegations against the  FBI and the Justice Department ``a shameful effort to discredit these  institutions, undermine the Special Counsel's ongoing investigation,  and undercut congressional probes.''   He is absolutely right.   And this is just the latest in a long pattern of attempts to undercut  the FBI and Justice Department.   Some of the efforts were blatant.   After FBI Director Comey refused to pledge his loyalty to the  President, the President fired him, an action the President himself  admitted was tied to the Russia investigation.   The President has engaged in a series of tweets attacking the  Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General and Deputy Director of the  FBI, among others.   There have also been media reports that the President has considered  firing both Robert Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, but  many of the efforts by the President and his team weren't quite as  obvious.   We have seen multiple reports that the President demanded personal  loyalty from top law enforcement officials including Comey and  Rosenstein.   In fact, President Trump frequently calls the Attorney General  ``his'' Attorney General and refers to ``my FBI'' and ``my Department  of Justice.'' In fact, they aren't his, they are American people's.   Media reports also say that President instructed White House Counsel  Don McGahn to keep the Attorney General from recusing himself from the  Russia investigation.   Two heads of intelligence agencies, DNI Director Dan Coats and NSC  Director Michael Rogers, said they felt pressure from the President to  say there was no collusion with Russia.   And it has become apparent that many of the actions taken by the  White House, Congressman Nunes, and others have been coordinated with  conservative media like FOX News.   Objectivity and nonpartisanship are core components of the FBI and  the Justice Department. To either attempt to co-opt them or punish them  for not kowtowing to the President's political whims is egregious.   Our Founding Fathers placed enormous trust in the legislative branch  to serve as an effective check on the President, and it is time to do  our job.   Congress needs to work alongside Special Counsel Mueller to get  answers for the American people.   The Nation deserves to understand exactly what happened and who was  involved, and all of us need to believe the President isn't above the  law and will not be allowed to abuse his position for personal gain.    Mr. President, I wish to speak in opposition to  President Trump's proposal to open all offshore waters in the country  to oil drilling.   This proposal has been met with outrage from every corner, as my  colleagues are making clear here on the Senate floor today.   I would like to take a minute to remind everyone of what is at stake.   Before the Deepwater Horizon and Exxon Valdez spills, Santa Barbara,  CA, experienced the worst oil spill in U.S history.   In 1969, an offshore oil rig in Federal waters spilled more than 3  million gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean.   The environmental disaster killed thousands of marine mammals and  birds. Our local beaches were coated by a thick layer of oil. Tourists  were turned away, and commercial fishing operations were shut down,  hurting the local economy.   After that spill, California decided that enough was enough. State  agencies blocked all new offshore oil drilling in State waters up to 3  miles from the shore. The State reinforced this ban with the California  Coastal Sanctuary Act in 1994.   Through a combination of local ordinances, congressional opposition,  and moratoria imposed by Presidents from both parties, our State has  also fought off any new drilling in Federal waters beyond 3 miles from  the shore since 1984.   The Trump administration has now proposed undoing our progress by  opening all Federal waters, including the waters off California's  coast, to new gas and oil drilling.   If his proposal is allowed to go through, it would lead to the first  new offshore oil drilling leases sold in the Pacific Ocean in more than  30 years.   So far, an exception has been made for Florida, hastily announced by  Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in response  [[Page S647]]  to concerns from Florida's Republican Governor.   That is completely arbitrary and not acceptable.   It is clear California also staunchly opposes this plan. According to  the latest polling, nearly 70 percent of Californians oppose new  drilling off our coast.   Senator Harris and I, together with our colleagues in the House of  Representatives, have repeatedly shared our concerns with Secretary  Zinke.   The Secretary has even received statements of opposition from  California's Governor, senate, assembly, attorney general, coastal  commission, fish and game commission, State lands commission, and more  than two dozen counties and cities.   So why are we not being given the same deference as Florida?   Unlike this administration, California understands that offshore oil  drilling belongs in the past. We are making smarter investments in  clean energy and renewable sources. Our State is on target to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by the year  2050.   The President's proposal would undermine that progress.   The Trump administration's proposed six new lease sales off the  California coast would lead to new oil rigs that would continue to  produce oil for decades to come.   That is well past the time we will need to have moved away from  fossil fuels altogether.   Even though California has fought off new Federal drilling for three  decades, there are still 43 leases that remain active from Federal  lease sales prior to 1984.   In State waters, there are still nine active rigs that were built  before the Santa Barbara oil spill.   We are still dealing with the legacy of last century's drilling, but  it is our responsibility to leave a better legacy for the next century.   California won't allow new offshore oil rigs to create another  generation of dirty carbon emissions and disastrous oil spills.   California, along with our coastal State friends, has rejected  President Trump's offshore drilling proposal.   It is time to respect our local opposition and completely scrap this  plan.                            ____________________
