 I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise today to support the people from the great State  of Texas.   It has been 2\1/2\ years since Hurricane Harvey. Many of my  constituents are still struggling to finance their rebuilding. And it  is not as if Texans simply waited on Federal aid. We passed a local  bond for $2.5 billion to address recovery and future prevention.  Additionally, many took out SBA loans, a low-cost loan to get  themselves back on their own feet.   Here is the problem: My constituents never thought that taking out an  SBA loan, a loan that they would be paying back, would prevent them  from also receiving other Federal aid.   This problem of dual benefits was addressed in law recently by my  friend Representative Garret Graves from Louisiana, but the fix came  too late for some. Many victims of disasters who would be eligible for  Federal aid such as CDBG-DR are not able to access that aid.   This amendment will not be able to provide the estimated nearly $3  billion that the Texas General Land Office believes would be needed to  help all of those affected, but my amendment will solve this problem  for some of the most vulnerable people who unfairly fell through the  bureaucratic cracks.   I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Madam Speaker, I was unavoidably detained and missed  the vote. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall  No. 54.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
