 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise on behalf of  those who cannot speak for themselves--the unborn.   Since 1973, over 60 million American children have lost their lives  to the atrocity of abortion, the greatest human rights violation in  history.   We often boast that we are a nation of life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness. Yet, we deny this sacred right to the most innocent among  us.   Last year, the Supreme Court gave the unborn a monumental victory  with the Dobbs ruling, returning the issue of abortion to Congress and  the States. That is why today I am introducing a series of three bills  designed to further protect the most vulnerable among us--the unborn.   First, the Love Them Both Act would prevent the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission from exploiting the Pregnant Workers Fairness  Act to cover abortion or abortion-related services. The Pregnant  Workers Fairness Act is designed to protect pregnant women from  discrimination in the workplace, and it should not be used for  political purposes.   We have a responsibility to ensure both women and their unborn  children are treated equally and fairly, and the Love Them Both Act  does exactly that.   Second, the Pregnancy Is Not an Illness Act would correct a  longstanding but erroneous conclusion of the FDA. In 2000, the FDA  fast-tracked approval of dangerous abortion-inducing drugs. To do so,  they declared abortion to be a life-threatening illness. As a mother of  seven, I can assure you that pregnancy is very much not an illness or  disability, but rather, nothing short of a miracle from the hand of  God. The Pregnancy Is Not an Illness Act would prohibit the FDA from  ever calling pregnancy an illness again for the purpose of approving  abortion-inducing drugs.   Lastly, I am introducing the Woman's Right to Know Act so that women  seeking abortions are fully aware of the consequences of their actions.  This bill would require an abortion provider to perform an ultrasound  and then describe the development of the unborn child to the mother. My  bill would also ask for a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion is  performed. These are simple, commonsense steps aimed to prevent a woman  from making a decision she will regret for the rest of her life.   In Psalm 139:13-16, David writes: ``For you created my inmost being;  you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am  fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that  full well. My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the  secret place, when I was woven together in the depths of the Earth.  Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were  written in your book before one of them came to be.''   Life is the most precious gift we have. Without it, we have nothing.  If we don't protect the right to life, all of our other rights are in  danger of being taken away. We cannot call ourselves a nation of  liberty and justice for all when we deprive this most sacred right from  the most vulnerable among us.   We are in the midst of the most joyous time of year, Christmas.  Although this is the season of parties, concerts, and family time, that  is not why we celebrate. We celebrate Christmas because of God's  greatest gift to mankind, Jesus. Without him, there would be no  Christmas. What better time to protect the cause of life than this  special season of Christmas?   Make no mistake, the world is watching, and so is Almighty God. They  are watching to see if we will live up to our promise of providing  freedom and a bright future to anyone born here. They are watching to  see if we truly want everyone to achieve the American Dream. They are  watching to see if we really are that shining city set on a hill that  John Winthrop and Ronald Reagan proclaimed us to be.   To quote one of my favorite Presidents, and accurately, I might add,  Ronald Reagan famously said: ``I have noticed that everybody that is  for abortion has already been born.''   Mr. Speaker, you and I had the chance at life. We have been given the  chance to live fulfilling lives, and I believe God has called each one  of us to this body for a specific purpose.   Mr. Speaker, 60 million of our children have not had that chance, and  if we really want to create a bright American future, that is the least  they deserve.   I believe these three bills will go a long way toward protecting the  most vulnerable among us, and I urge the House to act swiftly in  passing them.                            ____________________
