 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have spoken frequently about the  clear links between the biggest national security challenges facing our  country and about what we need to do to address them, but let's not  lose sight of a few overarching points.   America's adversaries don't ease up when we lose our resolve. In  fact, they press their advantage. How many of our colleagues would  disagree that withdrawing from Afghanistan caused America's friends and  foes to question the credibility of our commitments?   How many would disagree that failing to respond decisively to  hundreds of terrorist attacks against U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq has  weakened our deterrence against Iran?   How many Senators would disagree that the Biden administration  shouldn't have withheld lethal assistance to Ukraine in the summer of  2021 or that they should have shipped lethal weapons more quickly as  Russia's preparations became glaringly obvious that fall and winter?   How many would disagree that the President's caution and hesitation  to provide critical weapons--like HIMARS, Patriots, tanks, and ATACMs-- has prolonged the conflict in Ukraine?   Over and over again, history has taught us that the costs of  disengaging from the world are far higher than the costs of engaging.  And just as the threats we face aren't isolated, neither are the  benefits of investing in American leadership.   So here is the plain truth: The overwhelming majority of the  resources approved by the Senate as security assistance for Ukraine  has, in fact, gone directly--directly--to American manufacturers,  supporting American jobs, expanding the American industrial base, and  producing new weapons for America's military, with almost $70 billion  in investments spread across at least 38 different States. The  production of artillery rounds alone has distributed multiple billions  into facilities from Arkansas to Virginia and Texas to Ohio--all to  improve our ability to equip the United States and our allies for the  growing challenges we face.   These investments are not just replacing what is being used to  destroy Russia's military strength; they are expanding production  capacity to meet the soaring demand from allies. NATO countries have  invested $90 billion in capabilities produced here in America since  last February, and they are helping equip U.S. forces for our own long- term competition with China.   Take the Patriot interceptor. This air defense system is arguably the  most in-demand weapon in the United States' arsenal. It has saved  thousands of American and allied lives. It is deployed across Europe,  the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific. It is produced in Tucson, AZ,  with components coming from all over our country; and the supplemental  resources we are working on could expand production capacity by nearly  20 percent.   Or take the 155-millimeter round. It is relevant in nearly every  conflict imaginable. More than 75 percent of our investments marked for  this munition has gone toward capacity expansion. Today, U.S.  manufacturers are able to produce double what they could before our  response to the Russian aggression last year. With the further  investment of so-called Ukraine spending, American production would  reach 1 million rounds per year.   The notion that this money is distracting from America's other  security priorities is nonsense. Anyone making this claim doesn't  understand how critical production lines work. The truth is the  investments we have made in expanding production capacity to respond to  Putin's escalation are helping American manufacturers produce more of  the weapons Israel and Taiwan need.   I have spoken at length about America's clear national security  interest in helping Ukraine demolish Russian military strength and in a  secure and peaceful Europe. I have spelled out the glaring and  immediate threats we face from Iran-backed terror and of the importance  of supporting our closest ally in the Middle East. I have emphasized  the gravity of strategic competition with China and the urgency of the  threat facing our friends out in the Indo-Pacific.   But, as foolish as it is to deny the clear link between America's  adversaries and the threats we face, it is every bit as dangerous to  pretend that, as a global superpower, our Nation cannot or should not  face each of them down. We have the means to lead the free world and  ensure our own security. In the face of coordinated aggression from our  adversaries, we have the clearest possible objective: We win. They  lose.                               Border Security    Now, Mr. President, on a related matter, as I mentioned last week,  illegal crossings at our southern border are setting alltime records.  In just 3 years, under the Biden administration, the CBP has recorded 6  million border encounters--6 million. And yet, in the face of these  astonishing statistics, the Secretary of Homeland Security continues to  say: ``Our approach to managing the border . . . is working.''   The White House Press Secretary has reiterated this insanity, saying:         It's not like someone walks over [the border]. . . . That's       not how it works.    Well, of course, we know that is exactly--exactly--how it works. The  Border Patrol has been tracking 1,000 known ``got-aways'' per day-- 1,000 ``got-aways'' per day.   The facts on the ground send a clear message: The Biden  administration's handling of the border crisis is a complete and utter  failure.  [[Page S5272]]    Yesterday, Senator Cruz and Senator Barrasso both shared an encounter  they witnessed on the border, over the weekend, of a 10-year-old girl  and a man claiming to be her father. They described the terror on the  girl's face as the man attempted to use the Biden administration's  family unit loophole to cut the line at the border. As Senator Cruz put  it, ``the cartels are renting children to grown men.''   The crisis that has unfolded on President Biden's watch is inhumane  and dangerous. Fiscal year 2022 was the deadliest year on record at the  southern border, and fiscal year 2023 set an alltime record for terror  watchlist encounters. We are watching a humanitarian crisis that has  become a glaring national security vulnerability.   The solution is pretty clear. The solution isn't billions of dollars  to make it easier and faster to process illegal immigrants or ``money  for a welcome wagon,'' as Senator Barrasso put it yesterday. The  solution is a clear and commonsense policy that forces the Biden  administration to enforce the law and treat the border with the legal  consequences that it demands.   So I am grateful to my Republican colleagues who are working hard on  a policy proposal to deliver actual border security and drawing on  ideas put forward by Senator Lankford, Senator Cruz, Senator Grassley,  and others.   Washington Democrats have proved that their border security approach  is simply not working. President Biden's border supplemental request is  just more of the same. It is time to wake up and embrace policy changes  that will keep Americans safe.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
