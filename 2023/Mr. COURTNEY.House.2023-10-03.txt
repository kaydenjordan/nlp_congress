 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor Neil McKiernan,  an outstanding public servant who just recently announced his  retirement from the House of Representatives where he has worked for  over 20 years; 17 of those years in my office and 7 of those years as  chief of staff.   Neil is a native of the State of Connecticut and began his journey  over 20 years ago on the Hill as a young assistant working in  Congresswoman Linda Sanchez' office. He then worked for a short period  of time for my colleague,   John Larson. Then when I was first elected  in 2006, Neil joined my office.   Neil worked on a variety of issues during his time there. I see my  friend Mr. Kelly from Pennsylvania here. We worked together to repeal  the Cadillac tax in 2019, and Neil was part of that really massive  bipartisan effort to protect and stabilize the health benefits of union  and nonunion workers all across the country, which passed by a margin  of 419-6 on the floor.   Mike and I were here that day, and Neil--actually, one of his rare  visits to the House floor--was there to join us.   The centerpiece of Neil's work was the fact that I have the honor of  representing the submarine capital of the world. It is the home of the  oldest submarine base, the Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton,  where there are 16 attack submarines tied up and doing great work for  our Nation every single day, as well as General Dynamics Electric Boat  Shipyard, a 120-year-old company that is building submarines for the  Navy to this day.   This is a picture in 2014 of myself and some staff from the House  Committee on Armed Services. Neil is the gentleman on my far right with  the glasses and the cup of coffee. It is before dawn at the naval port  facility in Cape Canaveral, Florida. We were about to embark on the USS  Missouri, the submarine right behind us, which was built in Groton and  commissioned back in 2011. It is over in the Indo-Pacific region doing  great work for our Nation.   Again, when I first came into office, the shipyard was in a dangerous  downward spiral. After the Cold War, procurement for submarines had  totally collapsed. The shipyard, which once had 28,000-plus workers,  was down to roughly 6- or 7,000.   Beginning that year, we got a plus-up, working again with Neil's  incredible work, Ike Skelton, and Jack Murtha, and others to turn  around that spiral.   Today, the shipyard employs over 21,000 workers. We now again have a  build rate of two attack submarines and now the Columbia-class  ballistic submarine program is beginning its work. They just laid the  keel for the second of those vessels.   It is a great legacy that Neil leaves behind him in terms of really  reversing what really would have been a tragic loss of an industrial  base with unique talents, but also making sure that our Navy has an  undersea fleet, which today, with the threats from China and Russia, is  still our strongest card in terms of rebutting and creating real  deterrence to keep the world safe.   Admiral Gary Roughead once said our submarine fleet is the queen on  the chessboard in terms of being able to go anywhere undetected with  stealth and  [[Page H4957]]  with the might and potency to make sure our enemies and our competitors  abide by international rule of law.   Again, as Neil begins the next chapter in his life, let me express my  deep gratitude personally, but also take a moment on the floor of this  Chamber to remind people that people like Neil are great staff people  and are so essential in terms of doing great things that benefit our  country.   Neil, best wishes to you and your family and your future.                            ____________________
