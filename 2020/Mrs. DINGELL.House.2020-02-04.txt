 Mr. Speaker, as I walked over to the floor, I left a  group of workers in my office who were scared to death that we were  going back to the days that people with diabetes, high blood pressure,  or heart issues, must fear being denied coverage, or have premiums too  high that they could not afford.   Tonight, House Democrats are bringing more than 80 patients, doctors,  and healthcare advocates from across the country as guests to the State  of the Union to shine a light on our fight to improve the ``State of  Healthcare.''   We must stop this disastrous lawsuit that strikes down protections  for people with pre-existing conditions, but also would eliminate every  last protection and benefit provided by the Affordable Care Act.   At the same time, House Democrats have passed 11 bills to lower  prescription drug prices, protect people with pre-existing conditions,  and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid.   We are ready and willing to work with anyone who will come to the  table. Please work with us to improve the State of Healthcare in this  country.                            ____________________
