 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Equality Act  because equality and fairness are core American values.   Right now, fairness is not codified in our justice system, and it is  long past time to end discrimination.   When half of Americans live in a State without legal protections for  LGBTQ individuals, that is not equality.   When LGBTQ Americans can be fired, evicted, and discriminated against  because of who they are, who they love, or how they identify, that is  not justice.   The opportunity before us is a historic one. I want to thank my  colleagues who have led the effort to bring this bill to the floor.   My colleagues who vote ``no'' on this will be judged.   Mr. Speaker, this is something that we should be working on together.  We will pass the Equality Act for the dignity of all Americans.
