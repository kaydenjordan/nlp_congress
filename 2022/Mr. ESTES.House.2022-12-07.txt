 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Promoting Local  Management of the Lesser Prairie-Chicken Act. Kansas energy producers  and ranchers are excellent stewards of the land and resources. They  work tirelessly to feed, fuel, and clothe our Nation while taking  voluntary proactive measures to protect the lesser prairie-chicken's  habitat.   The U.S. Fish and Wildfire Service's inclusion of the lesser prairie- chicken on the threatened and endangered species list is nonfactual and  disregards the preservation efforts of our energy producers and  ranchers who best know their land.   After a yearlong species status assessment, the Federal Government  spent millions to conclude that the lesser prairie-chicken population  is stable and has grown.   Its inclusion on the threatened and endangered species list is  detrimental to our robust ag and energy industries, blatant  bureaucratic overreach, and is another example of the Biden  administration's hindering American energy independence.   My legislation stops Washington elites from undermining voluntary  public-private conservation practices and ensures Kansans control our  land.                            ____________________
