 Mr. President, this week, the Senate will continue to  confirm President Trump's well-qualified judicial nominees. This  President and this Senate have prioritized confirming impressive men  and women to these lifetime appointments--talented individuals who  believe in the quaint notion that the job of a judge is to apply our  Nation's laws and Constitution as they were actually written, not as  they might wish they were written.   At the close of business today, it so happens, one in every four  judges on the Federal courts of appeals will have been nominated by  President Trump and confirmed by us here in the Senate.   There is nothing about this that ought to be viewed as a partisan  accomplishment or an accomplishment only for this President or only for  one side. That is the wrong way to look at it. Every American should be  proud of this. Citizens deserve a judiciary of fairminded men and women  who don't confuse their jobs with the job of a legislator. Every Member  of this body should be proud to confirm Federal judges who understand  that our job is to make the laws, and their job is to apply them  fairly.  [[Page S6454]]    If the concept of faithful judges fulfilling their proper role  strikes anyone as a partisan development or a threat to their political  agenda, I would suggest it is their agenda that needs modifying and not  the judicial branch that our Founders intended.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, one of the untold  stories of the Obama administration was the dramatic geographic  inequality that deepened on the Democrats' watch.   From 2010 to 2016, the Nation's largest metro areas captured nearly  75 percent of the new jobs and 90 percent of the population growth. Big  cities did OK, but unfair and regressive policies, like the War on  Coal, left many other communities--smaller cities, small towns, and  rural areas--literally in the dust.   Homegrown American energy, including coal, has supported entire  communities in Kentucky and throughout the country for generations, but  even before he took office, President Obama declared a war on coal.  Here is what he said: ``If somebody wants to build a coal-fired power  plant, they can; it is just that it will bankrupt them.''   Of course, that approach didn't only hurt American businesses, it  hurt American workers. In 2009, 23,000 Kentuckians made their living  mining coal. By the end of 2016, that number had dropped to barely more  than 6,500. It went from 23,000 to 6,500 during the Obama years. Nearly  three-quarters of the State's coal jobs were gone in the span of one  Presidency.   So since the earliest days of the Trump administration, we have  prioritized ending the War on Coal and trying to repair the damage. We  have repealed hostile regulations and created tailwinds instead of  headwinds for America's energy dominance. But 8 years of damage is not  easy to unwind. Many coal communities are still suffering. There are  more mine closures and more bankruptcies. Workers' paychecks and  retirees' pensions are thrown into uncertainty. So our work continues.   A few years back, I worked to secure permanent health benefits for  thousands of retirees. Yesterday, a bipartisan group here in the  Senate, led by Senators Capito, Manchin, and me, took a major step  toward addressing the emergency of underfunded pensions for thousands  of miners, retirees, and their families. We introduced new legislation  to expand that healthcare fix to include 13,000 more miners and protect  the pensions of nearly 92,000 miners into the future.   Earlier this week, I personally raised the subject with President  Trump. We discussed the importance of working toward a solution for  these retirees.   Just yesterday, I hosted Kentucky miners here in the Capitol to hear  their concerns and discuss a potential path forward.   I have spent my entire career in the Senate fighting for all  Kentuckians. I have worked to protect coal communities from bad ideas  and to promote their future, and I will keep working with the Trump  administration and my colleagues on both sides to support our mining  families.                            ____________________     Now on another matter, Mr. President, earlier this  week, the Securities and Exchange Commission took a significant step  into the 21st century. When public companies put business decisions up  for a vote by their shareholders, it stands to reason that large asset  managers who own many shares on behalf of their clients have enormous  power to determine the outcome. Since these institutional investors  lack the bandwidth to study every single company in great detail, many  rely heavily on outside advisory firms.   In principle, there is nothing wrong with institutional investors  getting advice, but in practice, things get pretty interesting. This  cottage industry of proxy advisory firms is extremely concentrated in a  very few hands. I believe the two largest firms have something like 97  percent market share between them, and their advice is often taken  uncritically. One analysis of major asset managers found that 95  percent of their voting followed one advisory firm's recommendation.   So we have a small concentration of voices wielding enormous power  over American business, and questions have arisen about whether they  really exercise that power to serve the best financial interests of the  investors. In some cases, the proxy advisers seem less interested in  the particular interests of the particular company and more interested  in advancing a preconceived ideological agenda. In other words, these  firms are accused of leveraging their incredible influence to force  corporations to conform to their own vision of social justice.   That is why, as the Chairman of the SEC explained, he receives  letters from ordinary American investors expressing ``concern that  their financial investments, including their retirement funds, were  being steered by third parties to promote individual agendas, rather  than to further their [own] primary goals'' of saving for retirement  and leaving something behind for their kids and grandkids.   These proxy advisers are regulated by the SEC, and as it happens,  some parts of these rules had not been updated since 1954. So this week  the SEC has updated these Eisenhower-era guidelines for the 21st  century. The new rules will enable more transparency and  accountability. They will help ensure that these powerful voices have  meaningful skin in the game and are not simply searching for a  convenient vehicle to advance their preconceived interests.   I applaud the step forward by Chairman Clayton and the SEC.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on one final matter, on Monday, our  Nation will observe Veterans Day. Some will gather here in our Nation's  Capital at the proud monuments that pay enduring tribute to the service  and sacrifice of generations of brave servicemembers. Many more will  mark the day in ceremonies in small towns and cities across our  country. And, of course, many Americans will have veterans to thank  firsthand in their own families and neighborhoods.   My own father's Army service took him to the heart of the battle for  Europe in 1945. His company sustained heavy losses. When he returned  home, he traded his uniform for a briefcase and went back to work in  our community.   Perhaps the only thing more remarkable than the heroic service that  generations of veterans have offered at home and overseas is the fact  that they come home and keep right on serving in new ways--as fathers  and mothers, as skilled workers, as entrepreneurs, or as educators, and  in every case, as a custodian of a unique part of our Nation's  collective memory.   It is a cliche, but it is a cliche for good reason: the land of the  free because of the brave.   The Senate will not be in session on Monday, as we honor Veterans  Day, but I hope that each of our Members will be remembering and giving  thanks for all veterans and for those brave men and women serving  today. Their efforts are the reason why this Chamber exists, why it  still stands, and why American self-government and American freedom  endure.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
