 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment to  this troubling bill, a bill that proposes to erode the separation of  power safeguards in the United States Constitution. My amendment would  exempt from this bill rules that protect children and older Americans  from cancer, premature mortality, asthma attacks, and respiratory  disease so that such rules are not irresponsibly delayed or denied.   H.R. 5 unreasonably condemns every major rule, no matter its subject,  to an early bureaucratic demise at the hands of the special interests.  Many laws and regulations that are adopted and developed to protect the  public health and protect costly chronic diseases really shouldn't be  put on the back burner just because special interests can oftentimes  muck up the gears of government here in Washington.   For example, the Clean Air Act, which has been in place for over 40  years, has been one of the most effective public health laws on the  books. In 1970, at a time when smog was dense and visible in our cities  and towns and industrial areas, our leaders took an important step to  protect the public health and regulate emissions of hazardous air  pollutants by adopting the Clean Air Act, with only one ``nay'' vote  here in the entire Congress. Since then, agency rules and regulations  have been adopted to implement the act based upon the best science.  Those vital policies have improved our health, protected all Americans  from harmful air pollution, such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur  dioxide, and particle matter.   This Republican bill, H.R. 5, largely, would end our ability to  develop future safeguards for clean air. Toxic pollutants like ozone,  which is a major component of smog, are linked to asthma, lung and  heart disease, and result in thousands of deaths every year and up to 1  million days of missed school. Our kids are particularly susceptible to  this type of pollution because their lungs are still developing, and  they are more likely to spend long periods outdoors, placing them at  higher risk.   The American Lung Association states that inhaling smog pollution is  like getting a sunburn on your lungs and often results in immediate  breathing trouble. The University of South Florida's Department of  Child & Family Studies did a study in 2014 and said, in the State of  Florida alone, there were 48,674 asthma emergency room visits by  children and over 6,500 asthma hospitalizations.   Any American who has been alive since the adoption of the Clean Air  Act in the 1970s has an appreciation for the benefits of clean air.  America is stronger and Americans are healthier because of the Clean  Air Act.   Let's not go backwards. This bill, if adopted, would undermine the  Clean Air Act and so many other policies that lift and protect our  neighbors.   We still have work to do when it comes to the air that we breathe  because, even with all of the progress we have made, many working class  communities continue to bear the brunt of environmental pollution  because oftentimes the only homes that are affordable are located near  industrial sites. According to the NAACP, 78 percent of African  Americans live within 30 miles of an industrial power plant and 71  percent of African Americans live in counties that violate Federal air  pollution standards; and the Environmental Defense Fund found that our  Latino neighbors are three times more likely to die from asthma, often  for the same reasons.   If you establish such barriers to cleaning our air, it is not only  our families and neighbors that will suffer, but it will also be the  American economy. Far from being an economic burden, clean air  protections in the U.S. have a great track record, demonstrating that  economic growth and pollution reduction can go hand in hand. Since  1970, we have cut harmful air pollution by about 70 percent, and the  U.S. economy has more than tripled.   I urge my colleagues to side with hardworking American families and  not corporate polluters who love this bill. Don't prioritize polluter  profits over science and the health and safety of the public,  especially the most vulnerable among us.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on the Castor amendment to protect children's health, to  protect the health of our older neighbors. We value the air that we  breathe.   H.R. 5 would inject unnecessary barriers into the ability of our  environmental agencies--heck, all of the agencies of government--to  protect us.   When it comes to the final bill itself, if you believe in checks and  balances as a foundation of our constitutionally-based government, I  urge my colleagues to oppose the bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
