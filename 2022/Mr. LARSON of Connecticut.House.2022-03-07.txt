 Madam Speaker, I am here to commend  Chairman Neal and the Racial Equity Initiative headed by Terri Sewell,   Steve Horsford, and   Jimmy Gomez, and also to recognize Joyce Beatty,  for the work that they have done in bringing forward the inequity that  has existed in this country for far too long.   More than 5 million of our fellow Americans get below poverty-level  checks from Social Security because the Congress of the United States  has not done anything to enhance Social Security in more than 50 years.   Whom does that affect the most? It affects women of color and women  specifically--people who held jobs who weren't earning the same kind of  salary or wages and people who were caregivers at home for their  children.   Help is on the way. Social Security 2100 is coming to the floor, and  finally, millions of Americans who get below poverty-level checks after  having worked all their lives and paid into a system are going to get  what they richly deserve.                            ____________________
