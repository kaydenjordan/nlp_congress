 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4591) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit  to Congress periodic reports on the costs of the Department of Veterans  Affairs Electronic Health Record Modernization program, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 4591, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4591, the VA Electronic  Health Record Transparency Act of 2021, as amended.   The Department of Veterans Affairs has struggled to produce reliable  cost estimates and reporting on the infrastructure needs associated  with its $16 billion electronic health record modernization project.  This bill is a good governance measure which will enable Congress to  conduct better oversight and hold VA accountable for its spending.   It is essential that we ensure that taxpayer funds meant to serve  veterans are being used properly and that VA is maintaining detailed  records of its IT and physical infrastructure expenditures. We owe that  to the veterans who get their care from VA and to the American  taxpayer.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 4591, as  amended, which was unanimously supported in committee.   I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Mrvan), who is my good friend and a member of the House  Committee on Veterans' Affairs and chairman of the Subcommittee on  Technology Modernization.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 4591, the VA Electronic Health Record Transparency Act of  2021, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5516) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit  to Congress a report on the Veterans Integration to Academic Leadership  program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5516         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

VETERANS INTEGRATION TO ACADEMIC LEADERSHIP PROGRAM                     OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the       House of Representatives and the Senate a report on the       Veterans Integration to Academic Leadership program of the       Department of Veterans Affairs. The report shall include the       following:        (1) The number of medical centers of the Department,       institutions of higher learning, non-college degree programs,       and student veterans supported by the program, and relevant       trends since the program began.        (2) The staff and resources allocated to the program, and       relevant trends since the program began.        (3) An assessment of the outcomes and effectiveness of the       program in--        (A) supporting student veterans;        (B) connecting student veterans to needed services of the       Department or services provided by non-Department entities;        (C) addressing the mental health needs of student veterans;        (D) lowering the suicide risk of student veterans; and        (E) helping student veterans achieve educational goals.        (4) An assessment of barriers to expanding the program and       how the Secretary intends to address such barriers.        (5) An assessment of whether the program should be expanded       outside of the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention       to support students veterans with needs unrelated to mental       health or suicide.        (b) Uniform Best Practices, Goals, and Measures.--The       Secretary shall establish best practices, goals, and measures       for the Veterans Integration to Academic Leadership program       of the Department that are uniform among the medical centers       of the Department.        (c) Outreach.--The Secretary shall conduct outreach among       the Armed Forces, veterans service organizations,       institutions of higher learning, and non-college degree       programs with respect to the Veterans Integration to Academic       Leadership program of the Department.        (d) Assessment.--The Secretary shall assess the feasibility       and advisability of including the suicide rate for student       veterans in the National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual       Report of the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention       of the Department.        (e) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) The term ``institution of higher learning'' has the       meaning given that term in section 3452 of title 38, United       States Code.        (2) The term ``student veteran'' means the following:        (A) A veteran or member of the Armed Forces using       educational assistance under any of the following provisions       of law:        (i) Chapter 30, 31, 32, or 33 of title 38, United States       Code, or chapter 1606 or 1607 of title 10, United States       Code.        (ii) Section 116 of the Harry W. Colmery Veterans       Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-48; 38       U.S.C. 3001 note).        (iii) Section 8006 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021       (Public Law 117-2; 38 U.S.C. 3001 note prec.).        (B) A veteran who is enrolled in an institution of higher       learning or other training program, without regard to whether       the veteran is using educational assistance specified in       subparagraph (A).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 5516, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5516, the VITAL  Assessment Act, as amended, which is sponsored by our newest House  Veterans' Affairs Committee member, Congressman Ellzey.   This bill requires that VA submit a report on the Department's  Veterans Integration to Academic Leadership, or VITAL program. VITAL is  designed to support student veterans in their academic settings, and it  is a key component of VA's work to ensure that veterans thrive after  completing their military service.   VITAL is a longtime program at VA, and this report will provide a  timely  [[Page H6280]]  opportunity to examine outcomes for student veterans and academic  institutions supported by VA.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5516, the VITAL  Assessment Act, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers and I am prepared  to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 5516, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2433) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to take  actions necessary to ensure that certain individuals may update the  burn pit registry with a registered individual's cause of death, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2433         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Burn Pit Registry       Enhancement Act''.       SEC. 2. BURN PIT REGISTRY UPDATES.         (a) Individuals Eligible to Update.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall take actions necessary to ensure that the burn pit       registry may be updated with the cause of death of a deceased       registered individual by--        (A) an individual designated by such deceased registered       individual; or        (B) if no such individual is designated, an immediate       family member of such deceased registered individual.        (2) Designation.--The Secretary shall provide, with respect       to the burn pit registry, a process by which a registered       individual may make a designation for purposes of paragraph       (1)(A).        (b) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) The term ``burn pit registry'' means the registry       established under section 201 of the Dignified Burial and       Other Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2012 (Public Law       112-260; 38 U.S.C. 527 note).        (2) The term ``immediate family member'', with respect to a       deceased individual, means--        (A) the spouse, parent, brother, sister, or adult child of       the individual;        (B) an adult person to whom the individual stands in loco       parentis; or        (C) any other adult person--        (i) living in the household of the individual at the time       of the death of the individual; and        (ii) related to the individual by blood or marriage.        (3) The term ``registered individual'' means an individual       registered with the burn pit registry.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2433.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the passage of Representative Ruiz's  Burn Pit Registry Enhancement Act.   As the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and our Senate  counterparts close in on providing much-needed, comprehensive  assistance to veterans exposed to burn pits and other airborne hazards,  this measure from Dr. Ruiz is an important step in the right direction.   As VA continues to study the effects that burn pit and other airborne  hazard  [[Page H6281]]  exposures have on our veterans, the collection of data is critical.  Without data, important patterns are not identified, and decisive  conclusions cannot be made.   This bill ensures that VA researchers and their partners will have  more information to evaluate as they strive toward final determinations  on issues and additional presumptive service-connected conditions.   VA's burn pit registry is for veterans and servicemembers who may  have been exposed to airborne hazards caused by open burn pits while  deployed in support of Operations Desert Storm, Desert Shield, New  Dawn, Iraqi Freedom, or Enduring Freedom. Through this registry,  veterans may report on their symptoms or illnesses, providing  researchers with invaluable information used to determine potential  links between veterans' exposures and their current health conditions.   The Burn Pit Registry Enhancement Act will strengthen this registry  by authorizing a designee of a registered veteran or an immediate  family member to update the registry with the veteran's cause of death.   While this additional information can no longer assist those who  sadly pass away as a potential consequence of burn pit exposure, their  cause of death data may someday assist their fellow veterans. This will  be an honorable and incredibly valuable last act of service.   So, Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the passage of the Burn Pit  Registry Enhancement Act, H.R. 2433, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 2433, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4626) to amend title 38, United States Code, to require an  independent assessment of health care delivery systems and management  processes of the Department of Veterans Affairs be conducted once every  10 years, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4626         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 4626, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4626, as amended, the VA  Assessment by Independent Measures Act, or VA AIM Act.   This bill would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to  contract with one or more private-sector entities to conduct  independent assessments of its healthcare delivery systems and  management processes once every 10 years.   This bill would make permanent an independent assessment process that  is nearly identical to the one that was mandated by the Veterans  Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014.   Among other things, the review would examine VA patient demographics  and healthcare needs now and in the future; the accuracy and  reliability of the models used to project VA's healthcare budget;  veterans' access to healthcare through community providers and other  Federal facilities; VA's healthcare appointment scheduling processes;  and VA's process for determining its staffing needs and recruiting and  retaining clinical staff.   I am pleased that Ranking Member Bost and Representative Bergman were  open to incorporating my feedback when this bill was considered by our  committee this summer. We added a provision to the bill that requires  VA to submit to Congress a report outlining the feasibility and  advisability of implementing any recommendations made through these  independent assessments. This will help us hold the Department  accountable for improving its delivery of the healthcare benefits our  Nation's veterans have earned.  [[Page H6283]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4626,  as amended, the VA AIM Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing this important piece of legislation, H.R. 4626, as amended, and  I yield back the balance of my time.

SEC. 3. IMPROVEMENTS TO ASSISTANCE PROVIDED FOR CERTAIN                     FLIGHT TRAINING AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF                     EDUCATION.         (a) Use of Entitlement for Private Pilot's Licenses.--      Section 3034(d) of title 38, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1) by striking the semicolon and       inserting the following: ``and is required for the course of       education being pursued (including with respect to a dual       major, concentration, or other element a degree); and'';        (2) by striking paragraph (2); and        (3) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (2).        (b) Accelerated Payments for Flight Training.--Section 3313       of such title is amended by adding at the end the following       new subsection:        ``(m) Accelerated Payments for Certain Flight Training.--        ``(1) Payments.--An individual enrolled in a program of       education pursued at an institution of higher learning in       which flight training is required to earn the degree being       pursued (including with respect to a dual major,       concentration, or other element of such a degree) may elect       to receive accelerated payments of amounts for tuition and       fees determined under subsection (c).

SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 5603, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5603, as amended, the  Protections for Student Veterans Act, introduced by Representative  Underwood.   This bill amends the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which provides  broad protections for Active Duty, reservist, and National Guard  servicemembers during deployments.   H.R. 5603, as amended, enhances protections for members of the Armed  Forces who must suspend their education to fulfill military orders.   Many States, including Illinois and Washington, have stronger student  protections for servicemembers than those that exist at the Federal  level. There are currently few Federal protections for members of the  armed services who are enrolled in higher education when they receive  Active Duty orders. These servicemembers can be held liable to repay  tuition and may also receive failing or incomplete grades as a result  of suspending their education for military duty.   I hope we can all agree that this is an unfair penalty to those  members of the Armed Forces who are preparing for their future through  education while also serving our country.   The protections proposed in this bill would cover unexpected  withdrawals due to military orders and can provide restoration of  benefits and reimbursements for classes.   This bill takes the best practices from around the country to make  sure student veterans aren't left with debts or incomplete classes  outside their control due to military orders.   This legislation is supported by numerous VSOs, including Student  Veterans of America.   I thank Speaker Pelosi and Leader Hoyer for bringing this legislation  to the floor, and I urge the rest of my colleagues to support this  legislation to protect GI Bill benefits for servicemembers fulfilling  their duty to our country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am distressed that the ranking member has chosen this particular  moment to inject comments about the REMOTE Act, sponsored by the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Trone), and to imply that there is  obstruction in taking action to help our veterans, our student  veterans, with their housing allowances--which we took action on during  the pandemic, which still we are not completely out of yet. I would  argue that we are still in a national emergency. We are seeing COVID  infections rise in Europe, and we are seeing vaccine resistance and  hesitancy in many parts of the country, which still necessitate the  need for a policy which allows for student veterans to still get their  housing allowances while they are taking classes virtually.   I will remind the minority that three times under the Trump  administration, we passed something like the REMOTE Act, the authority  to allow student veterans to receive their housing allowances while  taking virtual classes. They were not in residence at the school where  they would do in-person learning. We allowed this three times under  emergency spending. Why? Because emergency spending fits the moment.  And it still fits the moment. This nonsense about we have to pay for  something that should be an emergency is nonsense.   I recall times on this floor when we had Members arguing that we  should not pay for the damage done for hurricanes in one State because  it didn't happen to the rest of the States, that we need to find a pay- for for hurricane damage in this country and for certain other kinds of  natural disasters.   A pandemic is a type of natural disaster. In this case, it has killed  700,000 Americans. I would argue that we saved lives, and we relieved a  lot of suffering of our veterans who would have been turned out in the  streets if we did not give them this housing allowance.   And now at the eleventh hour when we intended to bring Representative  Trone's bill to the floor, suddenly we had to meet a pay-for demand of  the  [[Page H6286]]  minority, and to set a precedent for future disasters that we would  have to have this very argument.   Instead of the precedent being that we spend emergency funds for  emergency situations, we now are in a situation where the minority is  arguing a ridiculous ideological argument about how we pay for things  during a time of a national emergency.   I am disappointed that the minority has brought up its objections and  also sought to use my University of California, Riverside as part of  this pawn. I just received a message from my chancellor correcting the  position that they took on their public letter. They are the only  university to submit such a detailed letter regarding the pay-for. No  other university has sought to take that position. I have questions as  to how my university reached a point where they issued such a letter so  that it could be used on the floor. I now have a correction that was  issued to me just hours before.   This is about America's veterans, and this is about serving America's  veterans during an emergency situation in which 700,000 Americans have  already died. I want to keep those veterans safe. I want to keep them  in housing. And, yes, I believe it is appropriate to keep the precedent  of using emergency funding and not have this silly political  gamesmanship over the pay-for.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  will just reply that it is political gamesmanship. I hate seeing  universities used as pawns in this game. I hate seeing our student  veterans being used as pawns.   What is at stake here is the principle, the precedent that this  Congress will pay for emergencies out of emergency funding. The need to  help our veterans, who must take their classes remotely, pay for their  housing because of the national emergency that we are still in, is part  of a precedent that we need to preserve.   This is not a political game to me. This is about protecting our  veterans. This is about protecting our Nation in the future.   The idea that when a national disaster, whether it occurs in the form  of a hurricane, an earthquake, or some other calamity like a pandemic  that has killed 700,000 Americans, that the principle stands that that  is an emergency and that we as a Nation stand together as one American  from whatever State we are in to help an American in another State,  even though that disaster didn't happen in that State. But this  disaster was omnipresent throughout our country. I don't understand the  logic.   Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing this very important legislation, H.R. 5603, as amended, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 796) to codify maternity care coordination programs at the  Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(c) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``Tribal       health program'' and ``urban Indian organization'' have the       meanings given those terms in section 4 of the Indian Health       Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1603).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on S. 796.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 796, the Protecting Moms  Who Served Act of 2021, sponsored by Senator Tammy Duckworth. The House  companion to this bill, H.R. 958, was championed by the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. Underwood) and unanimously passed the House this  past May.   The Protecting Moms Who Served Act of 2021 will codify the maternity  care coordination program that the Veterans Health Administration first  established in 2012 and updated in a November 2020 policy directive.  This will help ensure that veterans across the Nation receive high- quality, culturally competent healthcare throughout their pregnancies  and immediately afterward.   The majority of veterans' maternity care is delivered by a contracted  network of non-VA community providers. However, many veterans have  coexisting medical or mental health conditions for which they receive  ongoing care from VA providers. This means it is absolutely critical to  ensure pregnant veterans' care is coordinated among all healthcare  professionals involved in it. Such information sharing is crucial for  patient safety and positive health outcomes--for parents and newborns.   In addition to codifying VA's maternity care coordination program, S.  796 will require the Department to provide training for community  providers on the unique needs of pregnant and postpartum veterans and  on behavioral health conditions related to service in the Armed Forces.   Today, women veterans are the fastest growing cohort in the veteran  population, and more than 40 percent of women veterans using VA  healthcare are of reproductive age. Black women serve in higher numbers  and represent nearly one-third of women using VA for their healthcare.   In the population at large, Black, American Indian, and Alaska Native  moms die from pregnancy-related complications at approximately three  times the rate of White, Latina, Asian American, and Pacific Islander  women, regardless of income or education levels.   However, little is known about whether pregnant and postpartum  veterans have better, worse, or equal rates of maternal mortality  compared to nonveterans. That is why S. 796 also mandates a U.S.  Government Accountability Office study on maternal mortality and  morbidity among pregnant and postpartum veterans, with a particular  focus on racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes for  veterans.   Last year, approximately 6,000 veterans using VA became new moms.  Moms who have served our Nation exemplify strength and resilience.  Supporting moms means ensuring gender equity, and that begins with  healthcare equity. I therefore ask my colleagues to join me in  supporting final passage of S. 796, the Protecting Moms Who Served Act  of 2021.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing this important piece of legislation, S. 796, the Protecting  Moms Who Served Act of 2021, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4233) to amend title 38, United States Code, to furnish Vet  Center readjustment counseling and related mental health services to  veterans and members of the Armed Forces using certain educational  assistance benefits.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4233         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Student Veterans Counseling       Centers Eligibility Act''.       SEC. 2. EXPANSION OF VET CENTER SERVICES.         (a) Veterans and Members Using Educational Assistance       Benefits.--Section 1712A of title 38, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) by striking ``clauses (i) through (vi)'' both places it       appears and inserting ``clauses (i) through (vii)'';        (2) by striking ``in clause (vii)'' both places it appears       and inserting ``in clause (viii)'';        (3) in subsection (a)(1)(C)--        (A) by redesignating clause (vii) as clause (viii); and        (B) by inserting after clause (vi) the following new       clause:        ``(vii) Any veteran or member of the Armed Forces pursuing       a course of education using covered educational assistance       benefits.''; and        (4) in subsection (h), by adding at the end the following       new paragraph:        ``(6) The term `covered educational assistance benefits'       means educational assistance benefits provided pursuant to--        ``(A) chapters 30, 31, 32, or 33 of this title;        ``(B) chapters 1606 or 1607 of title 10;        ``(C) section 116 of the Harry W. Colmery Veterans       Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-48; 38       U.S.C. 3001 note); or        ``(D) section 8006 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021       (Public Law 117-2; 38 U.S.C. 3001 note prec.).''.        (b) GAO Report.--Not later than one year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the       United States shall submit to the Committees on Veterans'       Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Senate a       report assessing--        (1) the mental health needs of veterans pursuing a course       of education using covered educational assistance benefits       (as defined in section 1712A(h)(6) of title 38, United States       Code, as added by subsection (a)); and        (2) the efforts of the Department of Veterans Affairs to       address such mental health needs.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 4233.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4233, the Student  Veterans Counseling Centers Eligibility Act from Congressman Murphy.   We all know that student veterans may face challenges as they begin  this new phase of their lives following military service, and we want  them to be able to seek and find support at vet centers.   We also encourage VA to continue monitoring the need for increased  funding, staffing, and resources for vet centers as a result of demand  for these services.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4233, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 4233, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 147) to amend titles 10 and 38, United States Code, to make  certain improvements to transitional services for separating members of  the Armed Forces and educational assistance under laws administered by  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 147         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Bringing Registered       Apprenticeships to Veterans Education Act'' or the ``BRAVE       Act''.       SEC. 2. EDUCATION FOR SEPARATING MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES                     REGARDING REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIPS.         Section 1144(b)(1) of title 10, United States Code, is       amended by inserting ``(including apprenticeship programs       registered under the Act of August 16, 1937 (50 Stat. 664;       commonly referred to as the `National Apprenticeship Act')       and approved under chapters 30 through 36 of title 38)''       after ``employment opportunities''.       SEC. 3. WEBSITES REGARDING APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS.         (a) Website Under the Jurisdiction of Secretary of Labor.--      The Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Employment and       Training, in coordination with the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs, shall establish a user-friendly website (or update       an existing website) that is available to the public on which       veterans can find information about apprenticeship programs       registered under the Act of August 16, 1937 (50 Stat. 664;       commonly referred to as the ``National Apprenticeship Act'')       and approved under chapters 30 through 36 of title 38, United       States Code. Such information shall be searchable and       sortable by occupation and location, and include, with regard       to each such program, the following:        (1) A description, including any cost to a veteran.        (2) Contact information.        (3) Whether the program has been endorsed by a veterans       service organization or nonprofit organization that caters to       veterans.        (4) Whether the program prefers to hire veterans.        (5) Each certification or degree an individual earns by       completing the program.        (b) Coordination With Other Website.--The Assistant       Secretary shall update all information regarding programs for       veterans listed on apprenticeship.gov (or any successor       website) to include the information specified under       subsection (a).       SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 147, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 147, the Bringing  Registered Apprenticeships to Veterans Education Act, or BRAVE Act, as  amended.   This bill increases access to information regarding registered  apprenticeships for veterans. Registered apprenticeships are an  important component of our workforce system. They provide on-the-job  training with an employer that teaches workers the practical and  theoretical skills they need to succeed in a field, all while earning a  paycheck.   The Department of Labor validates registered apprenticeships to  ensure that participants are receiving high-quality instruction and  training.   At the end of their program, apprentices receive a national,  industry-recognized credential in their field.   This bill would require the Department of Labor to improve access to  registered apprenticeships for transitioning servicemembers and  veterans by maintaining a searchable website that connects them with  employer programs that are endorsed by VSOs and other veteran-specific  groups.   Registered apprenticeships provide a unique pathway into in-demand,  high-quality jobs, and the BRAVE Act will make it easier for veterans  to learn and earn when training for their careers.   This legislation is supported by numerous VSOs, including Iraq and  Afghanistan Veterans of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and  Paralyzed Veterans of America.   I thank Speaker Pelosi and Leader Hoyer for bringing this legislation  to the floor, and I urge the rest of my colleagues to support this  legislation to improve employability for veterans through  apprenticeships.   I also thank Chairman Adam Smith of the House Armed Services  Committee, who has agreed to forgo committee action on H.R. 147, as  amended, so that it can be considered on the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Veterans' Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, November 15, 2021.       Hon.

I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Armed Services under House       Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H.R. 147       to expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge that       the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill does       not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the matters       contained in the bill that fall within your jurisdiction. I       will also support the appointment of Committee on Armed       Services conferees during any House-Senate conference       convened on this legislation.         Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill.

The Committee on Armed Services takes this action with our       mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R.       147 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation and       that our committee will be appropriately consulted and       involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so       that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction.       Further, I request your support for the appointment of       conferees from the Committee on Armed Services during any       House-Senate conference convened on this or related       legislation.         Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the       Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on       the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in       which you have worked regarding this matter and others       between our respective committees.             Sincerely,                                                        Adam Smith,                                                          Chairman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Norcross), my good friend and the author of this  legislation. Congressman Norcross serves on the House Armed Services  Committee; Education and Labor Committee; and the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 147, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 3730, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, H.R. 3730, sponsored by Mr.  Sablan and Mrs. Radewagen, which would create an advisory committee on  veterans living in outlying areas and freely associated States,  including island territories.   The advisory committee would have a variety of members, including  experts from the covered geographic areas. The Secretary will be able  to consult regularly with, and receive the input of, this advisory  committee regarding the administration of benefits and VA programs.  Once established, the advisory committee will report annually on the  needs of the covered veterans and provide much-needed recommendations.   This bipartisan legislation is supported by the American Legion,  Veterans of Foreign Wars, Minority Veterans of America, Iraq and  Afghanistan Veterans of America.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from the  Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan), my good friend and valued member  of the Committee on Veteran Affairs, who serves on the Health  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 3730, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
