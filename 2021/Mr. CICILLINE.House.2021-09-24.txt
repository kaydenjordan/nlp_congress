 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Women's Health Protection Act.   If we truly value women, we must protect their right to control their  own bodies and their freedom to make their own healthcare decisions.   This includes the right to safe abortion, guaranteed by the Supreme  Court in Roe v. Wade almost 50 years ago--not more, nothing less.   But this right is under fierce attack. We have seen wildly  restrictive abortion bans, a $10,000 bounty on people who help women  who are seeking abortion care. This is unconstitutional and dangerous.   This bill will guarantee women all across this country the freedom to  make their own healthcare decisions, a basic and well-established  constitutional right.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it.
