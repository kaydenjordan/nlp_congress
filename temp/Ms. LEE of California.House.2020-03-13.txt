 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  Families First Coronavirus Response Act.   I want to thank our Speaker for her remarkable and steady leadership,  our entire leadership team, the committee chairs, and our  Appropriations Chair, Nita Lowey who helped to craft this package.   We must boldly fight this pandemic with all the science-based tools  and resources we have. And we must put families first.   The bill before us does exactly that by:   Providing free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs it,   Establishing an emergency paid leave program,   Enhancing state unemployment benefits,   Strengthening food assistance programs for seniors and school kids.   I urge all members to support this critical legislation to help  address the needs of families across this nation facing the impact of  this pandemic.   Lastly, I want to thank the Governor, State Officials, our Mayor,  Local Officials, Port of Oakland, our workers, Federal Partners, and  our residents who have pulled together so that public health protocols  were put in place to ensure the health and safety of everyone including  the West Oakland community.  [[Page H1690]]    The West Oakland community has been significant challenged by  environmental racism and injustice in the past. I am proud of the  community their compassion and competence and for stepping up during  these challenging times.
