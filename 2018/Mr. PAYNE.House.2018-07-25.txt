 Mr. Speaker, since 1987, the number of pilots in the  United States has decreased by 30 percent. Demand for pilots is up and  the supply of trained pilots is down. Throughout the aviation industry,  there is a desperate need for trained aviation employees.   One way we can help end the shortage is to create paths for minority  training. African Americans are significantly underrepresented in the  aviation industry. They represent only 9 percent of airline mechanics  and service technicians, 2 percent of aircraft pilots and flight  engineers, and 12 percent of air traffic controllers. Creating  opportunities to diversify the aviation field will help the critical  shortage of pilots and aviation employees.   Soon, I will be introducing a bill to establish an African American  advisory board within the FAA. The advisory board will engage African  American students through aviation training, mentorship, education, and  outreach programs.   I urge my colleagues to join me in my effort to decrease our Nation's  pilot shortage by tapping into an underutilized population and creating  a more inclusive aviation industry                            ____________________
