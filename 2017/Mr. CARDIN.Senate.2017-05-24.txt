 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, on Tuesday President Trump sent his  proposed fiscal year 2018 budget to Congress. A budget is supposed to  reflect the President's priorities and the values our country holds  dear. Unfortunately, President Trump's full budget shows how much  disdain he has for supporting American families here at home, how  little he values America's strong leadership around the world, and how  much he misunderstands the essential role the Federal Government has in  keeping our air and water clean, roads and bridges functioning, and the  public safe from deadly diseases and other threats.   This President's budget shows how much he values corporate profits  and polluters over children's health and demonstrates an irrational  ignorance of basic principles that have worked for and against the  American economy throughout the years. The budget wastes money on a  border wall and deportation force that will not make America any safer  and will tear apart families and communities.   President Trump fails to uphold the promise he made as a candidate to  protect American workers and seniors, and he breaks new ground in the  level of uncertainty he is willing to inject into our economy, our  local communities, and relationships with our historical allies and  economic partners. More than any other Presidential budget in recent  memory, this budget must be considered dead on arrival.   President Trump's full budget for fiscal year 2018 is an exercise in  extremism. President Trump wants to ax $610 billion from Medicaid--the  program that lifts up America's veterans and the most vulnerable men,  women, and children, capping the funding in order to finance tax cuts  for big businesses and the wealthiest among us. The budget further  slashes the social safety net by cutting the food stamp program and  eliminating critical social services programs. It directly hurts  children by cutting $6 billion from the Children's Health Insurance  Program. The President wants to choke off funding for essential  scientific research at the National Institutes of Health and infectious  disease detection and response at the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, while also slashing funding for key global health  initiatives that ensure economic stability.   Further demonstrating his misunderstanding of the ripple effect  Federal investments can have, the President inexplicably wants to end  the economic development assistance programs to rural and economically  distressed communities. I was particularly disappointed that he would  eliminate the Appalachia Regional Commission, which is very important  to the people in the western part of my State as an economic tool that  can bring badly needed jobs to Appalachia country.   He wants to put the American dream out of reach for would-be  homeowners and seekers of safe and affordable housing with the  elimination of HUD's rental assistance and homeowner partnership  programs. The President calls for shifting more than $143 billion in  additional student loan payments to hard-working students and their  families. And he recommends ending a vital program that helps first  responders, law enforcement, teachers, nurses, librarians, public  safety, and military have a chance to reduce the burden of their  student loans so that they can continue to serve their communities. The  President also continues the ill-conceived Republican assault on  Federal workers and retirees with his proposal for wholesale slashing  the programs and staff, such as the economic and environmentally  important EPA and Chesapeake Bay Program, making it nearly impossible  for many departments to carry out their basic mission.   I want to talk a few minutes about the foreign assistance budget. I  have the privilege of being the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee. In terms of our Nation's foreign policy, if the  budget is a reflection of values, then what the Trump administration  values is an American retreat from the world that would make the United  States less safe and secure. The numbers speak for themselves in the  narrow-minded budget release we have received.   What is most perplexing about the administration's combined 31.7  percent gutting of international affairs spending--as Secretary Defense  Mattis has said: If you don't fund the State Department Diplomacy  Center, you had  [[Page S3117]]  better give the Defense Department more bullets and soldiers. This is  counterproductive to making the world a safer place for America.   America is safer when the United States helps feed millions of  starving people in Africa and the Middle East, helps Europe defend its  democratic institutions from Russia interference, helps support  countries and international organizations caring for vulnerable refugee  populations, helps train farmers and other technical workers, helps  lead the world in fighting climate change and promoting global health,  and helps fund programs to protect human rights and promote democracy.  In each of these areas, the administration has taken a penny-wise and  pound-foolish approach that will cost lives abroad and endanger  Americans here at home.   Each of the programs I mentioned are either eliminated or there are  significant cuts, making it impossible for our dedicated Foreign  Service officers to carry out the critically important missions they  undertake.   As I look at the massive spending cuts put forward by the White House  for vital national security, it is impossible to conclude that this is  anything but an ``America alone'' budget--one that, if enacted, will  have disastrous effects on our standing in the world.   Luckily, the majority of Members of Congress know this budget is dead  on arrival. I look forward to working with like-minded Republican  colleagues to make sure nothing remotely close to this budget is  enacted.   Fortunately, our Founders developed a system of checks and balances  with the Constitution providing that Congress appropriates public  funds. It is our responsibility to pass the appropriations bill. I  intend to do everything within my power to work with Republicans, using  the model of the fiscal year 2017 Omnibus appropriations, to prevent  enactment of this outlandish executive branch attempt to cripple our  economy and do lasting damage to our Nation's global leadership.  Congress has a responsibility to ensure that we have a more realistic  budget that helps the American public, contributes to genuine economic  growth, and furthers America's true values.   I want to cite some examples in some areas as to how detrimental this  budget is. First of all, there are economic assumptions made by the  President's budget that are just not realistic. He assumes there is  going to be a 3-percent economic growth rate, which economists tell us  is simply not realistic. What does that mean? That means there is about  $2 trillion that is being used by economic assumptions which have no  justification, meaning that we are going to see significant budget  deficits increase if this budget were to become law. The budget double  counts some of these gains in order to offset tax reductions. He is  putting our economy at risk.   In healthcare, the President's budget continues the administration's  misguided and ill-conceived efforts to jeopardize the health and well- being of our constituents under the Affordable Care Act. Make no  mistake about it, President Trump is trying to make sure that the  healthcare system in this country does not work. He is deliberately  putting at risk the cautionary provisions that are in the Affordable  Care Act, which ensure that many of our constituents have affordable  health rates without outrageous deductibles or copays. The Trump  administration is jeopardizing that.   The Trump administration is jeopardizing the Medicaid system--$610  billion cut in the Medicaid system, which is critically important for  some of our most vulnerable people. There are 280,000 Marylanders who  gained essential health coverage through the Medicaid expansion who  will be left without access to care. There are an estimated 1.25  million Maryland Medicaid enrollees who will no longer be able to  depend on benefits like mental health and substance abuse, pediatric  dental services, or maternity coverage.   Our President is recommending a $6 billion cut in the Children's  Health Insurance Program, the CHIP program. That is absolutely  outrageous. There is a bipartisan effort in Congress to make sure the  children of America have the health they need.   Then there is a $7 billion--22-percent--cut in the National  Institutes of Health. Democrats and Republicans have come together,  recognizing that America has provided the true leadership and basic  research to deal with the mysteries of illness, and the President wants  to reverse that trend. That will not only cost us in terms of our  health advancements, but it will also hurt our economy.   The President cuts the funds to the National Institute on Minority  Health and Health Disparities. I thought we had made a commitment that  we are going to narrow the gap of discrimination in our healthcare  system. The President's budget moves in the opposite direction.   In Social Services and Social Security, the President, on his  campaign trail, promised not to cut the Social Security system. He  broke that promise with this budget. These cuts are a ``Robin Hood in  reverse'' budget. His cuts in the Supplemental Security Income Program  and Social Security Disability Insurance Program will be devastating  for low- and modest-income individuals, as well as persons with  disabilities and those over 65 years of age.   So we have seen cuts to programs the President claimed he would not  cut when he was a candidate. The budget cuts nearly $200 billion from  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, or food stamps,  which helps low-income Americans with food purchases. He also cuts the  TANF Program, which helps people who are in need of assistance. The  budget eliminates the LIHEAP, Low Income Home Energy Assistance  Program, the Weatherization Assistance Program, and State Energy  Program. I guess Donald Trump wants low-income Americans to freeze in  the dark. This is shameful and reprehensible.   Yes, there is money for some advancements--the advancement of the so- called border wall with Mexico. I visited Mexico just a few months ago.  I visited the U.S.-Mexico border. I couldn't find one border security  guard, security personnel, who felt that building a wall made any  sense. It will not keep out the illegal flow of people or drugs, and it  will compromise our ability to work with our neighbors in the south to  control immigration and to control drugs. The President's Executive  order on immigration and the President's fiscal year 2018 budget ramp  up deportation forces inside the United States, which will do more to  harm our national security and public safety than to help. We shouldn't  be moving in that direction.   Legal Services is one of the areas I worked on for a long time with  my Republican colleagues to make sure we fund the Legal Services  Corporation. The Trump budget completely eliminates that funding. The  late Justice Antonin Scalia said at Legal Services Corporation's 40th  Anniversary Conference in 2014: ``LSC pursues the most fundamental of  American ideals, and it pursues equal justice in those areas of life  most important to the lives of our citizens.''   We believe in equal justice under the law. If a person cannot get  legal help, they cannot get equal justice under the law. And the  President says there is no Federal role for this. I hope that we will  soundly reject that.   The President's budget eliminates the Community Development Block  Grant Program. That is very troubling. Here is one of the more flexible  programs we offer the local government in order to be able to make  their own decisions, and the President's budget eliminates that  program.   The President's budget eliminates many of our programs under  agriculture, which will hurt our rural areas and hurt our farming  community. The budget proposes to eliminate new enrollment in the  Conservation Stewardship Program and funding for the Regional  Conservation Partnership Program. I am very familiar with the Regional  Conservation Partnership Program. It was put in the last farm  reauthorization bill. It was done as an effort to help deal with  conservation in critically important areas, including the Chesapeake  Bay watershed. It is a very important program to preserving our bay and  preserving farm land so that we can have both a healthy bay and healthy  agriculture. The President eliminates those programs. I could go on and  on about agriculture--the many programs that are either severely  restricted or eliminated under the President's budget.   In education, the fiscal year 2018 budget released by President Trump  [[Page S3118]]  may be entitled ``A New Foundation for American Greatness,'' but  President Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos have severely  undercut our students, educators, and public schools. The budget  proposes to eliminate the Preschool Development Grant Program, a  program that has successfully placed more than 2,700 additional 4-year- olds in high-quality preschool programs across my State. The vulnerable  children in this program get a boost that helps them to lower the  achievement gap among students of color, low-income children, and  children with disabilities across my State. We should be expanding  these programs, not reducing them. And 85 Members of this body voted in  favor of the Every Student Succeeds Act and the Student Support and  Academic Enrichment Grant Program. That progress is jeopardized by the  President's budget.   Yes, he finds money for a new program to help school choice programs,  which will undermine the progress we have made in public education. Mr.  President, 95 percent of our students get their education through the  public schools, and that is jeopardized by the $1.25 billion the  President has included in his budget for school choice programs.   Maryland families understand the value of higher education. For too  many, the cost of higher education means that it is difficult, if not  impossible, for their children to have the higher education they need.  Yet the President's budget takes away some of the tools we have in  order to afford higher education. That is just not right. We should be  making higher education more affordable, not less affordable.   In the environment, the President's proposed budget would eliminate  the Chesapeake Bay Program. The Chesapeake Bay Program and related  efforts are delivering encouraging results throughout the watershed and  have built a tremendous movement forward. Yet President Trump has still  targeted them for elimination. The local governments are doing their  job in stewardship of the bay. The States are doing their job. Our  stakeholders are doing their job. We depend upon the Federal Government  to monitor and make sure that the programs are there--that all  stakeholders are doing their fair share. The elimination of the  Chesapeake Bay Program would jeopardize all of that progress. We cannot  let that happen.   The President's budget would cut the EPA budget by 31.4 percent, the  most severe cut of any major Federal agency. The investment in our  Nation's water and waste water infrastructure has been flatlined  through this budget proposal.   What in the world makes President Trump think that our Nation's  drinking water infrastructure shall be kept at status quo? Don't we all  remember what happened in Flint, MI? We have discovered similar things  in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In Baltimore, our public school system  cannot connect their water fountains to the water supply because of  lead contamination. We need to have a greater commitment to make sure  that the water supply to America is safe.   Under the budget, the Office of Compliance would be cut by one-third  of its budget. That is EPA not being able to enforce the law. Aren't we  a country of the rule of law? You would not think so under President  Trump's budget.   The President's budget also does not contain a critical  infrastructure plan. We heard that during the campaign. But nowhere in  this budget is he providing for that increase. Instead, it proposes  cuts in some of the highway trust programs.   Every day, civil servants perform countless tasks that help support  and defend and protect America. Civil servants are saving lives,  empowering small businesses, keeping America safe from harm, and  otherwise ensuring a safe and prosperous future for our country,  including our children and families. We know that our Federal employees  often perform the type of work that no one else can do. It is a highly  qualified Federal workforce. On May 5, Donald Trump issued a  proclamation declaring May 7 through 13, 2017, as Public Service  Recognition Week. He stated:         Throughout my first 100 days, I have seen the tremendous       work civil servants do to fulfill our duty to the American       people. At all levels of government, our public servants put       our country and our people first.    He has a bizarre way of showing his appreciation. Earlier this week,  he released a budget that punishes Federal workers by making them pay  much more for their pensions, an additional $5,000 for an average  Federal worker, while making these pensions much smaller.   The relentless assault on the Federal workforce must end. The  civilian workforce was smaller last year than it was 40 years ago,  according to data from the Office of Personnel Management. Federal  workers increasingly have been asked to do more and more with less and  less. They have already sacrificed financially, contributing $190  billion to deficit reduction just since 2011.   Workers hired in 2012 already are paying more for smaller pensions.  Sequestration-related furloughs cost Federal workers $1 billion in lost  pay, and there was a 3-year pay freeze from 2011 to 2013, and  substandard rises since then. Salaries and wages have fallen 6.5  percent since 2010, adjusted for inflation.   Now comes the latest attack on the Federal worker's pension, on top  of continued attacks on pay, healthcare and other benefits, collective  bargaining, and due process rights. President Trump would eliminate the  annual cost of living adjustments for people in the Federal Employees  Retirement System, including current retirees, and reduce them by half  a percentage point for people in the old Civil Service Retirement  System, including current retirees.   According to certified financial planner Art Stein, the annuity would  lose one-third of its value over 20 years if inflation averages between  2 and 3 percent annually, and nearly half of its value if inflation  averages 4 percent. According to the National Active and Retired  Federal Employees Association, the average FERS annuitant would lose  $99,471 over 20 years, and the average CSRS annuitant would lose  $60,576 over 20 years under the Trump budget.   That is outrageous. That is outrageous. We are talking about people  who are already retired. They can't reenter the workforce. They have no  choice. Yet we are telling them that they are not going to get what we  promised. It is important to understand that 85 percent of the Federal  workforce is located beyond the Washington metropolitan area. Federal  workers are in big cities and small towns across America, striving to  make things better for their neighbors.   Do we really want to engage in a race to the bottom with respect to  our Federal workers? These are the people who make sure our parents'  Social Security checks arrive on time. They make sure the air we  breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat are safe. They are  trying to find a cure for our spouse's cancer and our sibling's type 1  diabetes.   They support our sons and daughters in harm's way, and they care for  the wounded warriors at home. They patrol our borders and discover and  disrupt terrorist threats aimed at our community. They are working to  ensure that our grandchildren inherit a habitable climate. When we  punish Federal workers--30 percent of whom are veterans, by the way--we  are not just harming them and their families, but we are harming each  and every American.   I intend to do everything within my power to work with Republicans,  using the model of the fiscal year 2017 omnibus appropriations, to  prevent the enactment of this dangerous executive branch attempt to  cripple our economy and do lasting damage to our Nation's global  leadership. Congress has the responsibility to ensure that we have a  more realistic budget that helps the American public, contributes to  genuine economic growth, and furthers America's true values.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The Senator from Utah.
