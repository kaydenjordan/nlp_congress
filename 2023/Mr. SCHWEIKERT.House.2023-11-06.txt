 Mr. Speaker, this is fun to have one of these where  we all sort of agree on it.   Let me put in a little character--you heard some of the basic  mechanisms. The Salt River Project is a waterpower quasi-municipality.  It is very unique. It actually predates statehood for us. Think about  that. It actually was put together before we actually became a State.   What is unique in Arizona is--many of you have heard the discussion  of the thing called the duck curve. In the late afternoon you get lots  of photovoltaic power and then the sun goes down, and you don't get  lots of photovoltaic power, but we still run our air conditioners.   We need some ginormous batteries for those of us that live in the  desert Southwest, hence, comes the concept of pumped storage. Where  this is at is actually where I live. I live probably 25 minutes away  from this. It is the lake I grew up on.   To try to get this visually, picture a series of lakes that are our  water reservoirs for the Phoenix area, and then these cliffs that are  just tremendously high--it is a very impressive area--and the concept  of using gravity as a battery.   I appreciate everyone from our delegation who has been very, very  helpful on this, but this is one of those occasions where it makes  sense. It is environmentally sound. It actually allows us to take care  of something that is somewhat unique for us in the Southwest; and that  is the solar power we produce.   Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is, I do hope all of our brothers  and sisters here, later on, vote ``yes'' in suspension.
