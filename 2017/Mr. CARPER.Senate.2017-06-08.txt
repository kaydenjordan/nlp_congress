 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, when I came onto the floor, you were not  presiding; you were on the floor talking about the Visa Waiver Program.  It is an agreement we have with almost 40 other nations that allows for  the free flow of visitors from those countries to our country. It is  viewed, in part, as a way to promote tourism and help grow that part of  our economy and the economies of the other 38 or 39 nations with which  we already have this agreement. Some people believe it is a gaping hole  for fomenting terrorism and giving terrorists the ability to infiltrate  our countries and do mischief here and other places around the world.   I applaud the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Missouri, for  actually explaining how the system works. It is actually not just a way  to enhance and promote tourism, which is important to all of our  economies, it actually enhances our security if done well, done right,  and done correctly. I say to the Presiding Officer, the former chairman  of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, I appreciate very much  your making those comments today.                Resolution Condemning Recent Terrorist Attacks    I am going to do something today, Mr. President, that I have never  done before. I have never come to the floor and actually read a  resolution or a piece of legislation that we are going to be voting on  later today. This is a resolution that came out of discussions  yesterday as we were contemplating voting on additional sanctions with  respect to Iran--sanctions not related to violations of the joint  agreement on nuclear weapons. They appear to be in full compliance with  what they professed to do, promised to do a year or two ago. There  doesn't seem to be a question that they are doing what they promised to  do, and that is good.   There is what we believe is an obvious violation of U.N. requirements  that say the United Nations doesn't believe that Iran should be testing  ballistic missile systems. Even though they have no nuclear weapons--we  don't believe they are going to have them anytime soon; hopefully not,  because that would help spark a nuclear arms race in that part of that  world--we still have, along with the U.N., this prohibition against  them developing and testing ballistic missiles. They have violated that  a number of times, and a lot of other nations, including us, are  concerned about that. We have before us this week and again next week  legislation dealing with that.   My hope is that next week we will consider that legislation and have  a chance to offer amendments to it. My strong hope is that we will not  only be talking about our desire to see Iran fully comply with the U.N.  guidelines but that we will also couple with that legislation sanctions  dealing with Russia. This is a country that continues to make mischief  in this country and countries around the world.   Today, a lot of attention was riveted on the testimony by former FBI  Director Jim Comey on whether there was an attempt by the Russians to  influence our Presidential election last year. All 17 intelligence  agencies in this country have decided unanimously that the question is  not only did they attempt or want to influence the outcome of the  Presidential election--they all say yes. The answer is yes. All those  intelligence agencies say yes. The second thing they said is that they  feel the Russians succeeded in what they wanted to accomplish because  the person they wanted to see defeated--Secretary Clinton--lost, and  the person they wanted to see win--Donald Trump--won and now serves  as President of the United States.    The issue that is going on right now in the hearings before the  Intelligence Committee involve whether there was collusion between the  Trump organization and the Russians during or prior to the time of the  election. Ultimately, we will find out the truth, and we will let the  chips fall where they may.   I think we make a mistake in simply going forward and admonishing the  Iranians for testing ballistic missile weapons while at the same time  this effort by the Russians to really make a mockery of our election  system and change the governance of this country is a far greater  threat.   My hope is that when we come back and take up these issues next week,  that we will not address only the one involving Iran but that we will  address in a thoughtful way the actions the Russians have taken and not  let them get away with this. That is the debate for next week.   In Iran, actually 2 or 3 weeks ago, they had elections. I have spoken  about this before on the Senate floor. The elections they had were  Presidential elections. Here in this country, we have Presidential  elections every 4 years. As it turns out, in Iran they have them every  4 years as well. In this country, most people age 18 and older are  eligible to vote. The percentage of people among the electorate who  actually vote is not great. Actually, for the longest living democracy  in the history of the world, it is sometimes a bit disappointing. But  the percentage of people who turned out to vote in the Presidential  election in Iran a few weeks ago approached 75 percent, which is a good  deal higher, I believe, than what we have accomplished in recent years.  They have a lot of young people in that country, and the average age of  the 80 million people who work there is under the age of 25. It turns  out that the young people--not like the young people in Vietnam and a  bunch of other countries--they like our country. They want a better  relationship with our country, and the voting that occurred in Iran 2  or 3 weeks ago actually reflected that.   President Ruhani ran on a campaign that included better relations  with,  [[Page S3356]]  among others, the United States. And I think the election of a lot of  mayors in places like Tehran, the capital of Iran, which has changed  from a hardliner who didn't agree with President Ruhani's views on this  matter--they were turned out of office. That is all a very encouraging  development.   There are still people in that country who don't like us, and they  wish us harm, wish us ill, and they support terrorism. This is a source  of concern. But, particularly with the younger people there, it is a  new day there, and I think that is encouraging. We shouldn't be blind  to the mischief that some in their country would create, but we also  shouldn't be blind to the encouraging things happening among the young  people, especially reflected in the voting. We congratulate them on  actually having an election where that many people voted.   In some other countries around the world where Muslim is the  principal faith, they don't allow women to vote. They don't allow women  to participate in the elections, and they don't allow them to get  elected. In Iran, the elections in I think Tehran, in the city council  alone--women do vote in Iran. They get to run for office. I think in  the city council in Tehran alone, six women were elected to serve on  the city council. So that is a positive.   We commend them for having elections, and it is their job to figure  out whom they are going to elect. I am personally encouraged by the  turnout and the participation, especially of women, the election of  women, and the President and a lot of young leaders in that country who  have different view of us and their willingness to work with us and  other like-minded nations in the future.   On the heels of the election, roughly 2 weeks later, there were  terrorist attacks in London, in Britain, I think in Australia in the  last couple of weeks, and, in the last few days, in Iran. Their  Parliament was attacked. You can imagine terrorists coming in and  attacking those of us who work in this building, whether they happen to  be the pages or Senators or staff. That is what happened in Tehran a  couple of days ago at 10 o'clock in the morning, with folks breaking  into Parliament and trying to kill folks. They also attacked a sacred  site--I think a mausoleum--in another part of the country. Close to 15  people were killed, and many times that number were wounded, some very  seriously.   On the heels of that attack and on the heels of the election, on the  heels of the attack by ISIS--in both of the attacks on Iran, the  attacks were masterminded apparently by ISIS. We don't know for sure  given that ISIS tries to take credit for attacks they had nothing to do  with or little to do with. But there are people in Great Britain who  have lost loved ones, family members, friends. They are suffering, they  are hurting, and they are mourning today, and the same is true of Iran.   Great Britain is one of our two or three closest allies in the world.  They are like brothers and sisters to us, and we feel a special kinship  and extend our condolences to those whose lives have been ended, whose  lives have been shattered, and whose lives will be forever changed.   While we do that with our friends and allies in Britain who suffered  from these attacks by ISIS, on the heels of a different kind of  election in Iran--an encouraging election in Iran--and similar attacks  by ISIS on Iran--some suggest it is because they have a willingness to  actually have a better relationship with us, and maybe that is what  drew the attacks by ISIS. In any event, we certainly express our  condolences to the good people in Iran who lost their brothers,  sisters, parents, aunts, uncles, and sons, and we remember them today.    The resolution has been drafted by Senator Corker, the chair of the  Foreign Relations Committee, and by Senator Cardin. It is a resolution  that is not very long. I am going to read it. It is a resolution that  dates to these attacks and mentions both countries I just mentioned-- Great Britain, our ally, and Iran, with which we have had difficulty  for the last 30, 40 years but which is now interested in a new day with  us. To the extent that we can find a way to work together, especially  in commerce, the Iranians want to buy aircraft from us. They want to  buy Boeing aircraft. They don't want military aircraft. They have an  airline which is just awful. It is decrepit, old, aged, and they want  to buy $10 to $12 billion worth of Boeing aircrafts, passenger  airlines. I would say let's sell to them. The idea is, if we would do  that, we would not just put 5 or 10,000 people to work, we would  provide job employment opportunities for even more people than that in  this country. Why wouldn't we be interested in that? I hope we will  allow that to go forward. It would be good for us and also it would be  good for them, and maybe it would provide a foundation for working more  closely together. I don't know if we would have the kind of  relationship that we have with Britain, but as a veteran of the Vietnam  war, I can state that when I go for a run some mornings--when I stay  down here and go for a run early in the morning, I run down to the  Lincoln Memorial. I always run by the Vietnam Memorial. I take my  fingers, and as I go along the wall, I let my fingers brush over the  names of the people with whom I served, and there are 55,000 who died  in that war. They were our friends, our colleagues, our family members,  people we literally served with at that time, and they are gone. Yet  somehow we have been able to let bygones be bygones and develop a  close, august friendship with the Vietnamese. We are their strongest  trading partner. They are buying a lot of aircraft from us these days,  and we are now going to sell weaponry to them.   We are not going to do anything like that with Iran, certainly with  respect to weaponry, but if we can get over finally our difficulties of  war and hostilities and so forth with the Vietnamese, maybe we can  someday, with a change in leadership with Iran, begin to look more  toward a constructive relationship in the future.   The other thing I want to do is, I just want to take this resolution  and actually read that which Senators Corker and Cardin and their  staffs have worked on and thank them for their good work.   There will probably be a vote later this evening in wrapup, where  there will be a unanimous consent request that this bipartisan  resolution be approved. I think it is a good thing, it is the right  thing, it is a fair thing. How would we want to be treated by other  countries if ISIS attacks us and kills our people? We want them to be  sympathetic and have some feeling for us and not be quiet about it.  That is essentially what we want to do here.   The resolution goes something like this:         Condemning the recent terrorist attacks in the United       Kingdom, the Philippines, Indonesia, Egypt, Iraq, Australia,       and Iran.    It offers ``thoughts and prayers and sincere condolences to all of  the victims, their families, and the people of their countries.''         Whereas since May 22, 2017, the Islamic State of Iraq and       Syria (ISIS) has claimed responsibility for multiple       terrorist attacks against civilians that have left more than       180 dead and many more wounded.        Whereas ISIS frequently claims attacks perpetrated by       individual actors or other groups for propaganda purposes.        Whereas the people of the United Kingdom are grieving       following two terrorist attacks claimed by ISIS in London on       June 4 and Manchester on May 22 that targeted and killed       innocent men, women, and children.        Whereas government forces in the Philippines are currently       fighting ISIS militants in Mindanao, including ISIS-      affiliated fighters from the Philippines, Indonesia,       Malaysia, Chechnya, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, who launched an       assault in Marawi City on May 23 in an apparent effort to       establish a caliphate in Southeast Asia.        Whereas ISIS has claimed responsibility for two explosions       in Jakarta, Indonesia, killing three policemen.        Whereas ISIS targeted Coptic Christians in Egypt during an       attack on a bus on May 26, killing 29 people.        Whereas 22 people were killed when ISIS detonated a car       bomb at a Baghdad ice cream parlor, killing Iraqi families       gathering with their children to break the Ramadan fast, and       then detonated a second bomb killing elderly Iraqis       collecting their pensions.        Whereas a terrorist attack claimed by ISIS killed one       person in Melbourne, Australia, and wounded three police       officers.        Whereas on June 7, in an attack claimed by ISIS, at least       12 people were killed when gunmen and suicide bombers       targeted Iran's parliament and a shrine--    I believe it was a mausoleum or where one of their earlier leaders  was entombed, enshrined--       in two coordinated attacks across Tehran.        Whereas these reprehensible attacks have no place in a       peaceful world: Now, therefore, be it  [[Page S3357]]         Resolved, That the Senate--        (1) condemns ISIS' horrific terrorist attacks in the United       Kingdom, Philippines, Indonesia, Egypt, Iraq, Australia, and       Iran;        (2) expresses its deepest condolences to the victims of       these attacks and their families;        (3) expresses solidarity with the people of the United       Kingdom, the Philippines, Indonesia, Egypt, Iraq, Australia,       and Iran;        (4) recognizes the threat posed by ISIS and recommits to       U.S. leadership in the Global Coalition working to defeat       ISIS.    My father served in World War II. He was a chief petty officer. Most  of my uncles served in World War II and/or Korea. One of my uncles I  never met. My mom's youngest brother served in the U.S. Navy. He was  stationed on a ship called the USS Suwannee. It was an aircraft  carrier.   They were on duty in the Western Pacific in 1944, and their group of  ships came under attack by Japanese kamikaze pilots, dive-bombing and  crashing their aircraft into several ships, including the USS Suwannee,  the ship on which my uncle Bob was stationed. He was 19 years old. I  think he was on the ship and they were trying to launch aircraft to  take on the kamikaze pilots before they could do much damage and  several of the aircraft apparently crashed into the aircraft carrier on  which my Uncle Bob was doing duty up on the deck of the aircraft  carrier.   His body, along with the bodies of a number of people who were on the  deck, were never recovered. They were killed, missing in action for an  extended period of time, and their bodies were never recovered.   I told folks back in Delaware about my grandmother during one of the  Memorial Day observances. I don't know if the Presiding Officer has  this in Missouri, but in Delaware, during some of our observances, we  have a place of honor where some of our Gold Star families sit. I told  the Gold Star families at a bridge ceremony in Wilmington near the  Delaware Memorial Bridge--I pointed out where the Gold Star families  were sitting, and I said: My grandmother, if she were still alive,  would be 110 today, and she would be sitting right over there with all  the Gold Star families and mothers.   She never saw her son again after he went off to serve in the war.  There was a lot of sorrow in that family for years and years and years.  They had pictures for as long as I can remember. There was a picture of  my Uncle Bob, age 19, posing, at the time, in his dress blue uniform.   I was a dead ringer for him. My sister and I, after we were born in  West Virginia, grew up in Danville, VA. I went off to high school and  then became a Navy midshipman and then went off to Southeast Asia. I  would go home to visit my relatives in West Virginia, including my  grandparents. I would go back to that house. I would go back to the  picture and look at him because as I grew older, the resemblance was  pretty remarkable. My grandmother, from the time I was a little boy  until I grew up, would always call me Bobby. That was his name, not  mine. I was Tommy, but she would call me Bobby. It was kind of eerie.  She would never try to correct it. She would just call me Bobby.   Sometimes people would have nicknames for us as kids, and my  grandfather always called me Joe. So we would go spend time, a week or  two, with them in the summer, and my grandmother called me Bobby and my  grandfather called me Joe. I wasn't sure who I was when I would go back  to their home in Danville or Roanoke, VA, but I know my grandmother  loved her son Bobby, and the folks who took his life were Japanese.  They were Japanese.    In the Navy, I flew missions with Japanese forces during the Vietnam  war and the Cold War when I was a naval flight officer. Japan is among  our best friends today, one of our closest allies, despite the hundreds  of thousands of lives which were lost in the attack on Pearl Harbor and  the war that ensued.   Germany, at the other side of the world, was a bitter enemy during  World War II and is among our closest allies and has been for years the  bulwark in that part of the world.   I just mention them to say that the folks that might be our  adversaries today--Vietnam, where I served, was a great adversary for a  number of years, and today, as I said earlier, is one of our closest  trading partners, and they are one of our partners. We had, I thought,  a wonderful trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership should have  been approved by us and never was. It was negotiated in the last  administration. I think in history they will say that it was a huge  mistake we made not to approve it after negotiating it over a period of  several years with 11 other countries, including the Vietnamese.   The Vietnamese are amazingly close. They love Americans. God, they  love Americans. They love us more than we love us, and you can feel it.  Every time I go over there, I am reminded of that.   Things have a way of changing. Leadership changes, people change, the  attitudes of people toward the rest of the world, including us, will  change. The results of the Iranian election give me some encouragement.  I hope they give the rest of us encouragement. I hope someday some of  those young Iranian people who admire this country and love this  country will have a chance to come here and visit.   Ironically, today is the last day we have a lot of young people here  in this Chamber who are leaving us. We call them pages. Some are  sitting down here. I walked up to them earlier today. We have doors-- seven doors--and when we are having votes, people and Senators come in  and out, and we have two pages stationed at every door. We have pages  down here at the foot of the Presiding Officer on either side. What I  tried to do was just go around to the pages and shake their hands, say  goodbye, and thank them for their service during what has been really,  as the Presiding Officer knows, a challenging time for all of us. I  would say I had to have a chance to address these pages as well as the  rest of our colleagues here, but I want to say to the pages, thanks a  lot for your service, and we hope you have been inspired not by our  shortcoming but by the potential you see here for us continuing to send  this ship of state into the future.   A lot of people are concerned about the direction our country has  taken. I would like to remind them, especially these pages, that 150  years ago we fought a civil war in this country. I grew up in Danville,  VA, the last capital of the Confederacy. I think some people were still  fighting the Civil War when I got there. I was 9 years old and my  sister was 10. So 150 years ago, the Civil War was fought, where  hundreds of thousands of people were killed, many more were crippled,  wounded, and maimed.   After that, we saw our President assassinated. President Lincoln was  assassinated. After that, our President who succeeded him, Andrew  Johnson, was impeached, and somehow we got through all of that in the  19th century.   When we finally made it to the 20th century, what happened? World War  I--we fought it, won it, and led our allies to victory. Then World War  II, we fought it, won it, and led the allies to victory in World War  II. The Cold War--won it, led our allies to victory in the Cold War.  The Great Depression--we fought our way out of it and led the world to  a much stronger economy.   When the 21st century dawned on January 1, 2001, here is where we  were as a nation: the strongest economy on Earth, the most productive  workforce on Earth, a nation of peace, four balanced budgets in a row.  We hadn't balanced our budget since 1968, but the last 4 years of the  Clinton administration we were 4 and 0 in terms of a balanced budget.   Since the century began, we were the world's mightiest Nation--the  mightiest force for justice--and we were the most admired Nation on the  planet. I would just keep in mind the words of Harry Truman: The only  thing new in the world is the history we have forgotten and never  learned. He was a guy from Missouri, as I recall, like our Presiding  Officer.   We are going through a tough time now, and we will get through it. My  hope is that our pages, who have provided a great service here in the  recent months of their service, will someday come back as interns,  maybe someday as staff members, maybe someday as Senators and  Representatives and chiefs of staff, and will play other roles in  guiding our country.   We thank all of you.   My hope is that, as time goes by, the tensions around the world, the  hatred, the vitriol, and the murder and the mayhem will have  dissipated. Countries just like Japan in World War II,  [[Page S3358]]  like Germany in World War II, and like Vietnam in the Vietnam war were  our bitter enemies at one time but are now our friends. Maybe we can  turn the page with Iran, and they can turn the page with us. They will  be better for it, and in the end, we will too.   Your generation, especially, will be better for that.   I thank Senator Corker and, again, Senator Cardin and their staffs. I  thank our leadership--Senator McConnell and Senator Chuck Schumer--for  making sure that this resolution was taken up and written. It worked  out, and we will have a chance to vote on it. I just do not want  somebody sometime later--this evening or tonight--when asking for  unanimous consent to adopt a Senate resolution with a certain number on  it, to ask: What was that all about? I want people to know that this is  about something that is important, and I am grateful to all who had a  hand in it.   Thank you very much.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
