 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of former  Panama City Fire Chief and United States Navy veteran Robert  Richardson. Chief Richardson passed away at the age of 79 on January 5.   Chief Richardson proudly served our Nation as a submariner in the  Navy, and he went on to serve his community in Bay County for 33  years--first as a firefighter and then as the Panama City Fire Chief.   He was honored by the State of Florida for his work, earning the  distinction of Florida's Firefighter of the Year and Florida's Fire  Chief of the Year.   Chief Richardson was appointed by Governor Bob Graham to serve on the  Florida State Fire Board and used that position to fight for stricter  building codes. He dedicated his entire life to protecting others.   Madam Speaker, I can attest that Panama City is a better place  because of the lifelong service of Chief Richardson. Please join me in  honoring the life of Chief Richardson.                            ____________________
