 Mr. Speaker, my flight to Washington, D.C. was delayed  this evening. As a result, I was absent in the House Chamber for the  first vote in the series, roll call vote 130, on Tuesday, April 10,  2018. Had I been present, I would have voted aye on roll call vote 130.                            ____________________
