 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for the bold  legislation and for her legacy of service.   Members, we cannot rest, we cannot be asleep at the switch. The  countries that innovate and commercialize new  [[Page H826]]  technologies the fastest will be able to set the political, military,  and economic agenda for the 21st century. We must prevail.   The global microchip shortage is only a symptom of a broader  challenge, which is that the United States' share of global  semiconductor production has fallen from 37 percent to just 12 percent  over the last 30 years.   President Putin recently said the country that becomes the leader in  AI will reign the world. Think about that. It is all about artificial  intelligence. In the field of AI, China now surpasses the United States  in the global share of research papers and consistently files more AI  patents than any other country.   The America COMPETES Act will reset our focus. We need to invest in  research; we need to invest in application; and we need to invest in  talent.   The decline in American technology, innovation, and competitiveness  is a national security challenge. We must avoid it.
