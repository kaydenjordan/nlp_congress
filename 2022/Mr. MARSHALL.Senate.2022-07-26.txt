 Madam President, this week, after waiting more than 20  years, Amelia Earhart's statue will replace fellow Atchison, KS, native  and former U.S. Senator John Ingalls in the National Statuary Hall  Collection.   Amelia will join President Dwight D. Eisenhower, our Nation's 34th  President and Abilene, KS, native, as one of Kansas's two tribute  statues in the Capitol Building. President Eisenhower's statue was  placed in the Capitol Rotunda in 2003, but Amelia's journey to our  Nation's Capitol has taken much longer. Kansans, and especially the  people of Atchison, persevered, just as Amelia did in her pursuit of  flight, to coordinate and create a bronze statue and limestone base--an  appropriate nod to our State's signature natural stone.   It was 85 years ago this month that Amelia Earhart vanished over the  vast Pacific Ocean. She had already completed more than three-fourths  of her trip, which would have made her the first pilot ever to circle  the Earth at its equator. Amelia had already made history before this  flight. She was the first person to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S.  mainland, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, and the  first woman to fly nonstop across the United States. In defying odds  and expectations with each new accomplishment, she became a global  superstar and one of the most accomplished pilots in history.   While Amelia was a pioneer for aviators everywhere, she is still  today a role model for every person but especially for women and young  girls who strive to break barriers and achieve their dreams despite the  odds being against them.   In my home State of Kansas, Amelia's legacy lives on and continues to  know no limits. Kansas is home to the Air Capital of the World for good  reason. Our State has been home to many aviation manufacturers over the  course of a century, and on any given summer's day, with eyes to the  sky, you can see crop dusters flying low, dodging trees and power  lines, diving upon acres and acres of cropland. Looking farther upward,  you might see hobby pilots or executive jets, and often, you will hear  screeching fighter bombers and giant jet refuelers, but to see them,  you have to strain your eyes forward of the booming sound. Indeed, our  spacious land is well fitted for spacious runways, and our faraway  horizons that provide endless visibility go on for miles on end,  signaling Kansas will remain the Nation's leader in aerospace and drone  development.   I want to go back for a moment to a young Amelia being brought up in  the heartland. Yes, Kansas is where 9-year-old Amelia first took to  flight. Listen to this story.   Inspired by an exhibit she saw at the 1904 World's Fair, she built by  herself a makeshift roller coaster. Recall again she is 9 years of age  in this story. She launched her coaster off the roof of her house.  After tipping over the edge of the roofline, she said: ``It felt like I  was flying.'' Sixteen years later, she purchased her own plane and flew  to new heights.   Today, I also want to honor the people of Atchison, who have taken  great lengths to preserve and tell Amelia's story for all Americans to  hear. My wife and I not too long ago enjoyed a great day visiting her  perfectly preserved birth home, but the star of the show for our  visit--a ``must go see'' for everybody but especially for American  history buffs--was the new Amelia Earhart Hangar Museum, which honors  Amelia's aviation legacy and inspires all generations in the pursuit of  flight. The centerpiece is Muriel, the world's last remaining Lockheed  Electra 10-E, an aircraft identical to the plane Amelia flew on her  final flight. Muriel is named for Amelia's younger sister, Grace Muriel  Earhart Morrissey.  [[Page S3673]]    What I am really excited about at the museum is the immersive STEM  exhibits, which take visitors through Earhart's adventurous life, from  growing up in Atchison, KS, to the height of her worldwide fame as the  first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. Every school within  busing distance has to plan a field trip to Atchison in the coming  year. Parents should be fighting for the chance to chaperone.   Finally, I want to salute Atchison's annual festival in honor of  Amelia, which I attended just a couple of weekends ago, celebrating her  life and achievements with history lessons, concerts, downtown arts and  crafts, a world-class fireworks extravaganza, and a luncheon honoring  the Amelia Earhart Pioneering Achievement Award recipient. It was there  for the first time that I connected with the legend of Amelia and why  the hometown folks, nearly 130 years after her birth, fight to preserve  her legacy and especially how much she means to the ladies of the  community.   Amelia flew to new heights and traveled longer distances than ever  before, and today, Americans everywhere are joining Atchisonians and  Kansans as we all honor Amelia this week out of a shared admiration for  her innovative, pioneering spirit.   Her fellow Atchison native and statuary predecessor, John Ingalls,  coined the motto for our State, ``Ad Astra per Aspera,'' which means  ``to the stars through difficulties.'' Amelia Earhart personified that  motto by pushing against social boundaries set for women and breaking  new records in flight not just for a woman but for all aviators.   For generations to come, her spirit and her likeness in Statuary Hall  will inspire not only Kansans but also visitors from around the world.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today to honor and  recognize FC Wichita's 12-year-old youth girls' soccer team.   FC Wichita's 12-year-old youth girls' soccer team recently took the  first place title at the U.S. Cup Championship in Blaine, MN. This win  is one of the most prestigious victories a youth team can attain,  making their team the first in the history of the FC Wichita program to  win a U.S. Cup Championship title. FC Wichita went undefeated in five  games, which included a 2-1 victory over JaHbat FC in the semifinals  and a 3-2 victory in penalty kicks over Minnesota's Manitou FC in  Saturday's championship game. The U.S. Cup title was the cherry on top  of an outstanding summer for the FC Wichita girls' team in which they  also won the Real Colorado Cup.   It is my honor to congratulate FC Wichita on such a wonderful season,  and I would like to recognize both the players and the coaches for  their hard work in this season. Their numerous accomplishments have  made the great State of Kansas proud.   I now ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the FC Wichita's  12-year-old youth girls' soccer team for their outstanding athletic  accomplishments and the determination displayed during their U.S. Cup  Championship victory.                            ____________________
