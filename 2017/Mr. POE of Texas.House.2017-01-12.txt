 Mr. Speaker, recently in Sacramento, California,  Uber driver Keith Avila picked up three passengers. They were two women  and what looked like to him to be a very young girl, about 12 years of  age. The ride would be short. The total fare was only $8.   The young girl, sitting in the front seat with him, was dressed  inappropriately in such a short skirt. Here is what he said about her:         You could see all of her legs, and it struck me as odd       because she was so very young.    What happened next was even more disturbing to him. One of the women  passengers in the vehicle said to the young girl in a controlling,  coaching voice:         First thing you do, you ask this question: Do you have any       weapons? When you're hugging him, just ask, ``Do you have any       weapons?'' Pat him down. Pat him down while you're hugging on       him. Get the money first. Before you start touching him, go       in there, get the money first.    Avila, a father himself, knew something was not right about that  conversation. The two older women taking a girl inappropriately dressed  to a hotel, talking about exchanging money, did not make sense to him.   This had the hallmark of sex trafficking. He later said to police:         I was 100 percent sure I knew what was happening.    So Avila dropped off the three individuals at the Holiday Inn Express  and immediately called the police, even though he didn't have to. He  alerted them that there was a child sex trafficking occurring right  under their noses.   The two alleged women traffickers were later identified as 25-year- old Destiny Pettway and 31-year-old Maria Westley. They now have been  charged with pimping and threatening a minor. The buyer, 20-year-old  Disney Vang, was also arrested and charged by the police with  soliciting a child prostitute.   Mr. Speaker, this girl turned out to be 16 years of age, but her life  was saved because of this individual, Mr. Avila.   Elk County Police Officer Chris Trim said it best:         He could've said nothing, went on his way, collected his       fare, and then that child victim would have been victimized       again by who knows how many different people over the next       days, weeks, or even months.    Mr. Speaker, America cannot ignore sex trafficking in this country.  Individuals, citizens, no matter who they are, need to be able to  recognize what is taking place amongst sex trafficking.   What happened in Sacramento with this child is not an isolated  incident. This incident just happened to end well because someone saw  something and said something.   Last Congress, we took the historic step of passing several pieces of  comprehensive, bipartisan trafficking legislation, supported by most  Members of the House of Representatives and the Senate.   One of those bills was my own and Carolyn Maloney's, the Justice for  Victims of Trafficking Act. This bill did a number of things, but most  importantly, it went after the root problem: the demand, the customer  that buys minors on the marketplace of sex trafficking.   The bill did a lot of other things to help promote the enforcement of  the sex trafficking laws in America. The Justice for Victims of  Trafficking Act also went after the trafficker as well as rescuing the  victim, and, of course, it prosecuted the buyers.   The bill also set up a fund to pay for grants to help the victims and  victim shelters and to educate police. The fund is funded by money that  goes into that fund by fees, ordered by Federal judges. In other words,  let the criminals pay the rent on the courthouse and pay for the system  that they have created and help fund shelters and police training to  recognize the trafficking that takes place.   The enforcement of the bill is taking place throughout the country.  Going after human sex trafficking is something that this country needs  to recognize, and we need to be able to recognize it when we are  individuals, law enforcement, and Members of the House of  Representatives as well.   Sex trafficking takes place not only on the individual basis, but at  big  [[Page H394]]  events such as the Super Bowl and the Final Four. Just this week, the  Department of Homeland Security had a briefing for Members of the Texas  delegation on the Super Bowl, talking about the security that will be  implemented in Houston. It was quite impressive. But during that  briefing for Members of Congress--and I see two of them here, Mr. Al  Green and Mr. Farenthold, who were at that briefing--they talked about  how probably sex trafficking will be at that location, and how they are  going to try to prevent it.   It is quite impressive, the Blue Campaign that is taking place by the  Department of Homeland Security. We are going to be ready for those  people who want to try to promote sex trafficking in Houston because of  the Super Bowl, making sure that there is not going to be sex  trafficking in our town, in our country, and that our children are not  for sale.   So it is important that we recognize it when we see it, and it is  because of awareness of citizens like Mr. Avila that America is turning  the tide and making sure that we enforce our sex trafficking laws.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Americans nationwide are interested in  watching the Supreme Court at work, but only a handful on any given day  are allowed to have access to the courtroom. The courtroom is small and  seating is limited. Well, why not give the public the ability to view  the proceedings in their entirety on television or through live  streaming?   Public court hearings are the bedrock of American justice. Americans  want to know what is going on behind those closed doors. A simple  nonintrusive camera would allow for greater transparency and greater  faith in the decisions made by the most powerful Court in the world.   I was one of the first judges in Texas to allow cameras in the  courtroom. All the naysayers said: oh, it won't work. But it did. It  benefited everyone.   The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) and I are once again  cosponsoring a bill to allow cameras in the Supreme Court. It is better  to show all of the proceedings to the public than to rely on a 30- second sound bite from a news reporter on television during the 6:00  news. It is time for cameras in the Supreme Court.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
