 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Bishop Jimmy W. Glenn,  Sr., who was recently elevated to Auxiliary Bishop of Texas' Northeast  Fourth Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction of the Church of God in Christ.   Bishop Glenn first embraced the call to serve at the young age of 8  years old when he began singing at revival services around Texas. By  the time he was 21, Bishop Glenn was licensed and ordained to serve as  minister and began to travel across the State of Texas to help spread  the word of Christ.   Bishop Glenn has served in various Fort Worth churches, including  Gethsemane Church of God in Christ, St. Mary Church of God in Christ,  and Greater Love Chapel Church of God in Christ.   A true servant with a heart for others, he took on a major leadership  role within the Church of God in Christ and now serves as the vice  president of the National Evangelist Department.   On May 5, Bishop Glenn will be recognized for his recent elevation to  Auxiliary Bishop of Texas' Northeast Fourth Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction  during their inaugural banquet.  [[Page H2733]]    I hope you will all join me in congratulating Bishop Glenn on this  momentous achievement.                            ____________________
