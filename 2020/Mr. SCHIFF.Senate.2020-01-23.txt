 Colonel Vindman, if I could turn your attention       to the April 21 call, that is the first call between       President Trump and President Zelensky, did you prepare       talking points for the President to use during that call?        Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. Yes, I did.         But I was struck by something else you said in       your deposition. You said that it shed some light on possible       other motivations behind the security assistance hold. What       did you mean by that?         But it raised a question in your mind as to       whether the two were related.
