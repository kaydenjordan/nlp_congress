 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for the  important reforms that have been included in this bill, very  thoughtfully, to reform our Bank Secrecy Act.   The United States puts heavy burdens on banks to know their  customers, to protect our country and our financial system, and to make  it easier for the folks in law enforcement, and, frankly, all layers of  national security to defend America.   It is an important way that our sanctions regime works. It is an  important way that we detect and prosecute crime. And it has worked  very successfully for years in the current form.   The biggest complaint is often that we required too much of banks.  And so that led to this consumer due diligence rule that FinCen put out  that put an extra burden on banks, some would say a redundant burden on  banks, to report the beneficial ownership of their companies.   And so that created this provision that is now blended into a single  bill rather than a standalone bill that was known as the Corporate  Transparency Act. This is a horrible solution to a real problem. And  the solution is horrible because it presumes that everyone that would  own a company that has fewer than 20 employees is somehow part of an  illicit finance scheme in America. The smallest, least-sophisticated  businesses are now required to report annually and more frequently if  they change the composition of the beneficial owners.   This is a violation of civil liberties and constitutional rights that  our body should take seriously. Historically, that has been something  that has united the parties.                                time  1445    When Congress did the reforms to the PATRIOT Act and the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act, they put these provisions in place with  great hesitation because it created a big database and collected a  great deal of information.   This data would not be subject to subpoena or control. It is a  horrible solution to a real problem, and I urge greater consideration  of alternatives in opposition to this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, today, I offer an amendment to  address the serious flaws within the underlying bill.   Under the guise of tracking money laundering, this bill imposes a  crushing paperwork burden squarely targeted at small business owners.  It creates a massive new Federal Government database containing the  addresses of innocent American citizens and will do nothing to track  down criminals.   Under the Obama administration, FinCEN issued regulations that banks  collect the beneficial ownership information of these businesses. The  regulations have proven so confusing, burdensome, and unnecessary that  banks have sought relief from these regulations.   This bill effectively shifts the reporting burden onto mom-and-pop  businesses that have never even heard of FinCEN.   The bill adopts a different definition of beneficial ownership that  is even more confusing and vague than the one used by Treasury's rules,  which has already puzzled regulators and banks for years.   According to the Congressional Budget Office, the bill would generate  25 to 30 million new filings every year. Failure to comply could result  in jail time up to 3 years, thousands of dollars in fines, compromise  of private information, and more.   The bill also raises serious privacy concerns by creating yet another  database that is effectively the first-of-its-kind Federal registry of  small businesses and small business ownership. It contains no subpoena  or warrant-type restrictions for Federal law enforcement to access.   In the era of naming and shaming of companies and owners for  political purposes, and findings that Federal law enforcement have  abused their existing authorities in accessing section 702 FISA data,  this bill should give serious pause about how we as Members of Congress  protect civil liberties for American citizens.   My amendment would simply strike the underlying bill's burdensome  mandate, nullify the Obama-era regulations on banks, and instead  require FinCEN to go back to the drawing board by reviewing how already  existing Federal datasets from banking know-your-customer and anti- money laundering rules can assist law enforcement in determining the  beneficial owners of businesses.   As my colleague French Hill has offered, the IRS already contains all  of this information.  [[Page H8339]]    Lastly, I would say that if we are going to criminalize private  ownership of businesses, why not do that in the beginning rather than  criminalize failure to report to an agency that doesn't exist.   All of these questions have failed to be addressed directly by the  executive branch, and they are blown through with the way this bill  addresses the problem.   This type of information already exists. We do not need another  Federal database prone to be abused or a crushing mandate that will  harm law-abiding Americans and be ignored by criminals.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for my amendment and opposition to the bill  without it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the balance  of my time.    I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. McHenry).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my  time to close.   In closing, I would simply say that this would presume that criminals  are somehow going to cease their criminal activity, all because they  have to file a report.   The reality is this is going to criminalize business ownership,  violate the civil liberties of business owners across America, and make  them vulnerable to further abuse by criminals.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for this amendment and opposition to the  underlying bill without its adoption.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the  desk.    I am in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit is about  defending freedom. Civil liberties have historically united this great  body.   Do any of my colleagues, regardless of party affiliation, really want  law enforcement to access the data of small business owners and farmers  without cause and without a warrant or subpoena?   Surely, this bill's sponsor would like to see these provisions  restored to the current version of the bill so that due process and  privacy rights of everyday Americans are protected.   Let's reiterate what this bill, H.R. 2513, does. This bill subjects  small business owners, the smallest, 20 or fewer employees, to criminal  penalties up to $10,000 in fines or 3 years in prison.   This bill creates yet another Federal Government database containing  personally identifiable information of private U.S. citizens. This one  collects the addresses and driver's license numbers of owners of legal  and legitimate business operations.   A little-known Federal agency, FinCen, and law enforcement will have  unbridled access to the database, which has fewer protections than any  other existing Federal surveillance programs.   This motion to recommit is a commonsense proposal to require a  subpoena so that Federal law enforcement officials do not query the  sensitive information of American citizens without cause. The majority  should not be opposed to this motion. Treasury already requires similar  reporting of beneficial ownership information by banks through the  Customer Due Diligence rule, and under the CDD rule, law enforcement  must obtain a subpoena.   In fact, the version of the Corporate Transparency Act introduced in  the 115th Congress, sponsored by the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Carolyn B. Maloney), only allowed disclosure to federal law enforcement  agencies if it had a subpoena, but this language has now been dropped  from the bill.   I question why this iteration of the bill would remove the subpoena  requirement and why Democratic leadership would reject this amendment  when I offered it at the Rules Committee.   On October 8, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court published  its previously classified opinion detailing systemic abuses of the FISA  program. Federal law enforcement officials at the FBI have improperly  queried Section 702 FISA databases to spy on innocent Americans.   This abhorrent behavior violates the privacy rights of American  citizens. Collectively, we must ensure that this database is  safeguarded from any bad actor, including unauthorized access by  Federal employees.   In light of these existing FISA abuses, it is imperative that  Congress take steps to restore privacy protections for all Americans.   Starting with more robust safeguards in this bill is a great first  step. After all, this bill will require the smallest businesses to file  beneficial ownership information with FinCen, creating an estimated 30  to 40 million new filings each year. That is a really big database full  of valuable information.   This motion to recommit ensures due process and gives farmers and  small business owners confidence that their constitutionally protected  right to privacy is not violated.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
