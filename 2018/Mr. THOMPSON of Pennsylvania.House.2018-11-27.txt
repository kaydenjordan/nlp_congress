 On behalf of the entire Pennsylvania  delegation, Susan, we are just pleased to welcome you to the 115th  Congress. Congratulations.    Madam Speaker, I rise today on ``Giving  Tuesday'' to recognize the importance of charitable giving, especially  during this time of year.   With the Christmas and holiday season upon us, we recognize and  celebrate many blessings. As we reflect on all that we have achieved  and accomplished, we must also remember the less fortunate among us.   ``Giving Tuesday'' began in 2012 as a day to encourage charitable  giving on the heels of shopping-focused days like ``Black Friday'' and  ``Cyber Monday.'' It is a dedicated day to give back.   Americans are compassionate people who care about their neighbors on  ``Giving Tuesday'' and all year long. Through monetary donations or  gifts of time through volunteering, we are always finding ways to give  back to our communities.   But today, on ``Giving Tuesday,'' we find ways to lift up our fellow  citizens. These acts of kindness and generosity highlight our American  values. The best way to celebrate your blessings is to share them with  others. No gift is too small and no gesture too insignificant to  someone in need.   It is the American way.                            ____________________
