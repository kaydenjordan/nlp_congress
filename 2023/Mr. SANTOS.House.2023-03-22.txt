 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the dedicated men  and women of the United States Coast Guard Sector Long Island located  in NY-3 that stretches from Eatons Neck and just beyond Kings Point. It  is one of the oldest Coast Guard stations in New York and the fourth  oldest in the United States.   They carry out humanitarian services, such as search and rescue. They  are maritime security, which is their top priority, along with port  security. They are the law enforcement service branch of the United  States Armed Forces. The United States Coast Guard is the largest and  most powerful coast guard in the world, and it rivals most navies.   During 9/11, these unsung heroes evacuated some 565,000 people from  Manhattan who chose the water route to escape NYC. In addition, their  search and rescue ops increased by 35 percent during the pandemic, with  a 22 percent increase in fatalities.   While keeping vigilant of our coast, they also take the fight to gun,  drug, and human smugglers out on the high seas.   Their mission-related activity is being carried out despite a $4  billion backlog in infrastructure, including the old station building  at Eatons Neck, structural issues with the U.S. Coast Guard station in  Saugerties, as well as flooding, mold, lead, and asbestos issues at  each of the U.S. Coast Guard stations on the South Shore. Because of  these conditions, the Coast Guard staff must clean up the basements  late at night instead of getting proper sleep after handling search and  rescue operations all day.   As you can see, these are the conditions behind me of what the men  and women who serve our country honorably have to endure.   All of this is being carried out with about 100 reservists from New  York and 40,000 members nationwide, some of whom have difficulty  receiving mental health services. Being stationed at some of these  facilities can become a long and lonely mission due to long winters and  very little social life.                                time  2000    Sadly, there are also pay and housing issues, some U.S. Coast Guard  staff are utilizing food pantries and have difficulties finding  affordable housing within enough driving distance of their station.  This results in morale and recruiting issues.   Lastly, there are some 3,000 offshore wind turbines that are coming  and posing a major concern for the Coast Guard when it comes to  performing search and rescue. Their helicopters would have to carefully  navigate a waterway during a rescue operation without getting caught up  in the wind turbines in addition to Coast Guard vessels having  difficulties with their radar capabilities navigating in and around  these windmills.   I would also add that the construction of these turbines can take up  to 15 to 20 years to build, resulting in an expected 1,800 transits up  the Hudson River from the Port of New York and out to sea. This places  a huge responsibility on the shoulders of the Coast Guard to ensure the  safety of all those types of boaters and vessels.   Madam Speaker, I highlight these concerns because they operate under  a limited budget. They deserve proper pay, rest, housing, medical, as  well as mental health, and above all, our sincere gratitude.   These dedicated men and women are truly the unsung heroes of our  military force who protect our coasts, protect our economic and  security interests abroad, saving thousands of lives a year at sea, and  providing emergency response to both manmade and natural disasters.   The Coast Guard ethos are:    In Service to our Nation   With honor, respect, and devotion to duty   We protect,   We defend,   We save,   We are semper paratus.   We are the United States Coast Guard.    I thank the U.S. Coast Guard for their dedication to protecting other  coastal borders and keeping those at sea safe from harm.                             Safe Drinking Water     Madam Speaker, most of us would take this for granted and  never think twice about the water we drink. We assume it is safe and  that the contaminants have been filtered out. I am here to address the  water contamination concern that is affecting communities within New  York's Third Congressional District.   The Village of Farmingdale is an incorporated village on Long Island  in Nassau County. The Village is serviced by two different water  utilities: the Village of Farmingdale Water Department that serves  approximately 9,500 residents, and the South Farmingdale Water  District, which serves approximately 45,000 residents. One of the water  plants is already impacted by contaminants and the second is in danger  of approaching contamination within 11 months.   PFAS substances, which are commonly known as PFAS are chemicals used  for their waterproofing and stain resistance. They typically can be  found in a variety of products, such as fabric conditioners,  firefighting foam, and older styles of Teflon. They are also known as  ``forever chemicals'' that never break down in water and soil, and  accumulate and persist in the human body. Health effects from PFAS can  vary. According to the CDC, PFAS may lead to high cholesterol,  increased risk of kidney cancer, liver problems, and decreases in birth  weight.   Currently, the Village of Farmingdale is trying to address these  emerging contaminants, including 1,4-dioxane and PFAS that are  emanating from plumes in the aquifer from various hazardous waste sites  outside of the boundaries of the Village. The Village is in the process  of constructing an advanced oxidation plant, AOP, and granulated  activated carbon filters to remove PFAS and 1,4-dioxane compounds at  this location.   The reality is, in 11 months 9,500 people in the Village of  Farmingdale are at risk of having no access to clean water if we do  nothing about it.   Unfortunately, these contaminants have already impacted one of the  water supply wells located at Eastern Parkway where the Village  operates a 1.73-million-gallon per day well, also known as well 1-3. As  a result, well 1-3 has been offline since July of 2021, and the Village  of Farmingdale has declared an emergency.   In December of 2019, the New York State Department of Environmental  Conservation directed the installation of sentinel wells near the  Village of Farmingdale's boundaries, which is a  [[Page H1324]]  short distance of approximately 1,500 feet of both water plants to  monitor the toxic plume and the impact.   A sentinel well is a groundwater monitoring well located between a  known area of groundwater contamination and a drinking water supply  well. This pending contamination necessitates that the Village of  Farmingdale implement costly filtration systems not just for well 1 but  also for the two remaining operational wells, 2 and 3.   Farmingdale's most recent sample indicates a significant increase in  contamination concentrations of the two remaining operational wells.  Concentrations in these sentinel wells exceed the current standards.  Concentrations of 1,4-dioxane have risen from 1.7 ppb, parts per  billion, in June of 2021 to 3.4 parts per billion in March of 2022.   In 2017, a nonprofit known as the Environmental Working Group  collaborated with scientists, aggregated, and analyzed data from 50,000  local water utilities in all 50 States. For the Village of Farmingdale,  the group discovered six contaminants across the supply between 2012  and 2017. The following contaminants include chromium, nitrate, nitrate  and nitrite, radium, arsenic, and radium.   For the Village residents and businesses to have a safe supply of  potable water, the Village is preparing contingency plans which will  also have a significant financial impact on the small Village. This is  just one small community facing contaminated water and, unfortunately,  they are not alone.   While I am pleased that New York became the first State in the Nation  to adopt drinking water standards, at the Federal level we should be  doing more to invest in our water infrastructure improvement projects.    Clean water should never be a luxury to any community. In fact, clean  water should always be a right to every American citizen.                   Defending the Taxpayers of Nassau County     Madam Speaker, today, I have to defend the taxpayers  living in Nassau County. As Long Island becomes less affordable and  inflation disrupts our everyday lives, Long Islanders are struggling to  pay taxes.   Our homeowners in Nassau County are now being required to pay an  additional 2.06 percent in school taxes for 2023 through 2024. Nassau  County ranks among eight counties nationwide with the highest median  property tax, which consists of 60 percent in school tax. One of the  more affluent school districts in New York's Third District, Jericho,  is proposing a 2.77 percent tax increase.   The district will pay an additional $2.6 million in health insurance,  along with $700,000 more for public school bus transportation. This is  why the taxpayers of Long Island would greatly benefit from my bill,  H.R. 1360, the SALT Relief Act.   All taxpayers need a buffer, especially during times of economic  hardship. My bill is designed to keep money in taxpayers' wallets while  keeping residents on Long Island.   I am calling on my colleagues to cosponsor my bill and consider what  is at stake for all American families.               Congratulating Students Emily Kim and Kevin Zhu     I would like to take the time to congratulate Emily Kim  and Kevin Zhu of Jericho High School on becoming finalists in the 2023  Regeneron Science Talent Search.   Both Emily and Kevin had the experience of presenting their research  for a week in the Nation's Capital and were awarded $25,000 based on  their research skills and promise as scientists.   Emily and Kevin were chosen to compete out of 1,949 students from 628  high schools across 48 States, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, and four  other countries.   Emily's project studied activated carbon and its potential to treat  the wastewater produced by the fast-fashion and textile industries.   Kevin Zhu's project studied change in DNA associated with  neurological disease and how the changes can serve as a measurable  indicator for future cancer blood tests.   These extraordinary students, although very young, have set the bar  for the many likely to follow in their footsteps. Now, more than ever,  scientific research and STEM skills are vital to solving some of the  world's most complex problems.   Bright minds such as Kevin's and Emily's are on the cutting edge of  breakthrough discoveries.   Congratulations to you both, and may you have great success in the  future and in your career.         Congratulating the Manhasset Indians Girls' Basketball Team     Madam Speaker, I congratulate the Manhasset Indians  girls' basketball team for their outstanding performance this month. On  March 11th, they played an impressive game and, what many may argue,  was their most competitive game all season.   With just 70 seconds left and what appeared to be their certain  defeat, the girls gave it their all and scored six straight points,  including an astonishing free throw from senior grad Caitlin Barrett.   Their junior forward Lauren Perfetto scored 12 points and grabbed 11  rebounds in what some have called the best game of her career. The  girls tied the game at 45 and went into overtime, then wrapped the game  with a three-point lead.   With demonstrated composure, resilience, and teamwork, the Manhasset  Indians set the bar in athleticism. I know that you work so hard and  thank you for making this historic mark in Manhasset's history. Keep  your chin up, ladies.   Congratulations to the Manhasset Indians Girls' basketball team.                               Honored to Serve     Madam Speaker, it is an honor to serve in the House of  Representatives and it is an honor to represent the constituents of the  Third Congressional District of New York and to come here every day and  fight for the interests of our constituents.   I thank the Speaker and the staff for all your work and for all the  dedication to the American people.   I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 13 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, March 23, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
