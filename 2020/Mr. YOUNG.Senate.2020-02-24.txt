 Mr. President, I rise to recognize 175 years of tourism,  history, and hospitality that the French Lick Resort has brought to my  home State of Indiana.   In 1832, two Hoosier brothers, Thomas and Dr. William Bowles,  purchased 1,500 acres of property near French Lick, IN. Part of the  property's allure was the abundant mineral springs loaded with Epsom  salt and sulfur. As a physician, Dr. Bowles became intrigued by the  medicinal benefits that the mineral springs possessed, which famously  turned into the Hoosier tonic Pluto Water. In 1845, the brothers  welcomed their first guests after building a unique, three-story, wood- framed hotel.   In 1901, a small group of investors, including former Indianapolis  mayor Tom Taggart, bought the property from the Bowles brothers. Mayor  Taggart's vision and political expertise aided in the development of  the hotel and the expansion of the Monon Railroad from Chicago to the  front entrance, encouraging more tourists to ``take to the waters.'' By  1905, the French Link Springs Hotel had become a grand destination, and  its services were greatly sought after by all of Indiana society. Soon  enough, it had gained worldwide recognition. With the hotel's stunning  success, Donald James Ross, ``the Michelangelo of golf course design''  and a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame, was hired to build the  French Lick Springs Golf Course. In 1924, the course hosted a PGA  championship, attracting more national attention and further success.  By 1931, the hotel became the unofficial headquarters of the national  Democratic Party and became the site for the 1931 Democratic Governor's  Conference. As a socialite destination, numerous notable guests visited  the springs, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Ronald  Reagan, John Barrymore, and Howard Hughes.   Because of its heritage of tourism and hospitality, in 2003 the  French Lick Springs Hotel was added to the National Register of  Historic Places--a distinction of notable merit. In 2005, the French  Lick Springs Hotel and its former competitor, the West Baden Springs  Hotel, were purchased by the Cook Group, Inc., a family-owned company  headquartered in Bloomington, IN. After a complete 1-year renovation,  the French Lick Resort was born, continuing its legacy of attracting  visitors from the around the world to Southern Indiana with a variety  of events.   The French Lick Resort and its world-class amenities have served  millions of guests and has greatly added to the cultural history of the  United States. On behalf of the State of Indiana, I wish the resort  continued success for another 175 years and beyond.                            ____________________
