 Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Hoyer), for the purpose of inquiring from the majority leader the  House floor schedule next week.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for walking through  the schedule.   As we have been hearing about the CR, I express similar  disappointment that we have not been able to get the full-year  appropriations bill agreed upon by both the House and the Senate, as we  worked incredibly hard to get a 2-year budget deal, a very bipartisan  agreement.   The objective of getting a 2-year budget deal in last year's Congress  was to ensure that we could agree on levels of funding for our troops,  which we did to make sure that, instead of having CRs, we were actually  able to have a full-year spending bill that is agreed to by both sides  so that we can get certainty to our troops. They are not getting the  tools they need.   We already agreed on the levels of funding, and yet, there is still  not an agreed negotiation. This is not a case where the House can just  sit back and wait for the Senate to do something. We are in a CR now  where there is a limited amount of time. I understand this CR will go  through December 20, so for a few more weeks.   It is not a matter of waiting for the Senate to come to an agreement  between Republicans and Democrats there. It is a matter of getting the  House and the Senate to get an agreement.   At some point, somebody in the leadership of the House majority is  going to have to go sit down with somebody in the leadership of the  Senate majority. Everybody has their different parties and their  different ideas, and they are going to have to stay in that room until  they get an agreement. It has happened before. It has to happen this  time. It hasn't happened yet.   I don't know if those honest, earnest negotiations are going on  between whoever in your House majority is going to be in the lead  position to head that negotiation and whoever it is on the Senate side.  It might be their appropriations chairs and your appropriations chairs,  whoever has been designated by the House.   There has to be a commitment that they are just going to go sit in a  room until they figure out their differences. We agreed on a number. We  passed a bipartisan 2-year budget deal for the purpose especially of  making sure our military doesn't go in limbo, and these other Federal  agencies that are important, too, that need to get the agreed numbers  that they can come to an agreement on to spend.   But, ultimately, we know the cost--we are hearing the cost from our  military generals--of the CR. It is probably $1.5 billion a month that  they lose, that they are not able to properly go and buy the equipment  our troops need when we are operating under a CR.   I hope we get to that agreement soon where whoever it is on your side  that is going to be the point person that is authorized to get a deal  can go sit down with the Senate and just stay until they get that deal.                                time  1215    And I know there are a lot of other things going on over here. We are  not going to get into the impeachment infatuation and what it has taken  away from. I hope it has not taken away from the ability to get this  agreement.   This is something both sides are going to have to do: House, Senate,  Republican, Democrat. Until both sides get that agreement, we are at an  impasse. And the most disappointing thing is, we already agreed on the  budget numbers. That is usually the big fight.   We had that fight and we had an agreement. Bipartisan. This is how  much we are going to spend on defense. This is how much we are going to  spend on nondefense and, yet, even with that agreement, we can't get  the final bills brought to the floor. Not partisan bills, but  bipartisan bills that can ultimately get signed. And so I hope that  gets done soon.   It is both sides that are going to have to do it: House, Senate,  Republican, Democrat. I would yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, let's be clear that we both know the  Senate operates differently than the House. The Senate has a 60-vote  requirement, which means for the Senate to move anything, it actually  takes Republicans and Democrats to come to an agreement.   The gentleman can talk about issues where Republicans are in  disagreement. I could surely go through areas where Democrats are in  disagreement; for example, funding over border security, which is a  clear sticking point, one of the holdups in getting an agreement.    We probably have a pretty good agreement on defense, even though  while the gentleman says the House did its job, the House's job is to  pass bills that can ultimately become law to advance all the things  that we agree upon, and there is a President that is part of this  process.   So like in previous administrations, when we have these negotiations,  oftentimes it is not just the House and Senate. Clearly, we need more  serious agreements and negotiations between House and Senate leaders to  come to an agreement. But, ultimately, you also have to produce a bill  that the White House is in agreement with where they will sign. It  doesn't mean you take what they want. In fact, the President is not  getting many of the things he requested. But at some level, if the  President is going to veto a bill, it is probably worth having  negotiations to see if you can get beyond that.   So this would not be the first administration where the House and  Senate negotiated with the White House. The gentleman has been in  meetings, as I have been in meetings, with many Presidents where we  negotiate and try to come to an agreement. It doesn't mean they all end  up being signed into law. It might be vetoed.   The President has the power of veto, so it is worth all of our time  to see if, not only the House and Senate can get an agreement, but also  we can get an agreement with the White House, too. This is not the  first time that has happened. Those negotiations are going on, but the  wall is a big sticking point.   We are building a wall. Probably about $8.5 billion this previous  year was allocated, and we are going to negotiate what that is going to  be next year. That is part of the negotiation. And, hopefully, we can  come to an agreement over it. It shouldn't be that difficult to do it,  but it is one of the sticking points. There are a number of sticking  points, but as those sticking points happen, we all acknowledge it  costs us.   It costs our defense. Our Nation's defense suffers when we operate  under CRs. The CR that is being talked about currently goes through  December 20. My question to the gentleman is: Currently, the week of  December 16, the House is scheduled not to be in session. And that  would be the same week that the CR that is being contemplated would  expire.   Are we planning on coming back into session that week of December 16  if December 20 is going to be the expiration of this current CR that is  being negotiated? I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate that update from the  gentleman on the schedule. Obviously, next week we will have a number  of other items. I yield to the gentleman.    So the week of December 16, you are suggesting we should  keep that open?    Madam Speaker, I was just working with Mr. Mulvaney  yesterday on USMCA, something I would hope to see us bring to this  House floor. Clearly, by the end of this year, it should have been done  a long time ago, but something I know he and many others in the  administration--Mr. Lighthizer has been taking the point on trying to  get a negotiation concluded so that we can create more jobs in this  country and create better trade opportunities for our families that we  represent.   Even if Mr. Mnuchin were to get an agreement, we all know that Mr.  Mnuchin doesn't have a vote in the Senate. And even if every Republican  in the Senate agreed with Mr. Mnuchin, you still can't pass a bill in  the Senate because it takes Democrats working as well.   The families that we represent are much less concerned about whose  side thinks they are right, as they are about saying, just go in a room  and work it out. It has been done before. It ought to be done this  time. And I would just encourage that between now and December 20--we  don't have to wait until December 16--I would hope that those leaders  on your side in the majority would go get with the leaders in the  Senate and come to an agreement.   I am sure they will have conversations along the way with the White  House, too, but at a minimum, to get the House and Senate to come to  agreement, not complain about who passed bills and who didn't.   The NDAA was passed here in partisan way. It never had happened  before in the history of Congress. The gentleman's side chose to do a  partisan bill where there was a bipartisan bill to be had, and, yet,  that was put on the side.                                time  1230    So there is a bipartisan way to do it or a partisan way to do it.  Ultimately, you are in the majority; you get to decide that.   The Senate has their own different set of rules, and we might want to  change them, but that is how they operate.   At the end of the day, both sides have to get in a room and work it  out, and I would just encourage both sides to do that.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Every Republican.    Because it had poison pills in it. The level of funding  wasn't the issue. It was the limitations on the Defense Department to  be able to do their job properly that were added in, when everyone knew  those were partisan additions that had never been in previous bills.   So we can get it done without partisan bills. If you want to do the  partisan poison pills, it is your prerogative, but it is not going to  get signed into law. Our job should be to make law and to put the  differences on the side and work through and get it done.   It has always been done before, by the way. NDAA has never been a  partisan bill until this year.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, again, we know the rules of the Senate.  They operate differently. We might both agree that we would do things  differently. We do things differently in the House than they do.  Ultimately, both sides have to come to an agreement, and, hopefully,  that happens in the next few weeks, not at the midnight hour by  December 20.   Madam Speaker, unless the gentleman from Maryland has anything  further, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
