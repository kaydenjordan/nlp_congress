 Mr. President, just about 2 years ago, roughly 76,000  Afghans--those who served alongside American forces during two decades  of conflict--and their families were evacuated here to the United  States on military planes and given 2 years of humanitarian parole. The  Biden administration has worked to extend that parole, but we have to  ask ourselves: To what end?   These are our allies, those who served and fought alongside our  troops, those who supported our mission and our engagement in  Afghanistan and who worked an incredible array of jobs--interpreters,  medics, security guards, mechanics, intelligence officers, journalists,  bomb technicians, and pilots.   And I know that today one family in Newark, DE, is waiting urgently  to hear that we have taken up and passed this amendment to the National  Defense Authorization Act. The head of household served as a bomb  technician, as an EOD specialist in the Afghan forces, and I had the  chance to have the blessing of meeting the mother of a Delaware soldier  whose life he saved.   I have heard over and over from our veterans, from our veterans'  families, from Afghans and from their families that we have to pass  this bill so that they have certainty, so that the strengths and  talents that they have brought to our country they can use to put down  roots and to have a foundation on which to build a family in peace in  our Nation.   An interpreter--an Afghan interpreter--now living in North Carolina  has said:         Permanent residency is linked to everything. What will       happen [to my family] if our status fails? How will I provide       for my family [in this new country]?    Another interpreter living now in Nebraska describes their current  situation as being ``trapped like in a prison.''   This uncertainty, this lack of clear status, harms the ability of our  Afghan partners and friends to advance their careers, to put down  roots, to start their new lives here in America with confidence. This  uncertainty must end.   These are folks who believe in the promise of America and who came  here confident we would keep our word. On my phone, I was just looking  a moment ago at a family celebration that I joined with Sher and Shkira  in Newark, DE. I don't want to give more details on them, other than to  say that I remember that they and their children are waiting and  watching to see what we will do here in the Senate.   I want to thank my colleagues Senators Klobuchar, Moran, and  Blumenthal and many others--Senators Graham, Shaheen, Murkowski,  Durbin, Wicker, and Tillis--who have been cosponsors of this bill from  the last Congress. It also has support from the Iraq and Afghanistan  Veterans of America, Blue Star Families, the American Legion, and many  other veterans groups; and from some of the most prominent leaders in  the American military: Mike Mullen, Jim Stavridis, Stan McChrystal,  William McRaven. Forgive me for skipping their titles and ranks, but  some of the most respected leaders in our military have endorsed this  legislation.   If you are worried, as some of our colleagues have said, that the  folks brought here by the American military were not thoroughly vetted,  this is the way to address it. It requires in-person interviews,  oversight, and consultations that will ensure that everyone currently  here comes back in for one more in-person interview, vetting, and  clearing.   It also expands the opportunities for SIV visas for Afghan  combatants. It helps those still stuck in a hell outside our country.  That would allow families to be reunited.   At the end of the day, I just have to thank two people and make one  plea. I have to thank the family in Delaware who continues to inspire  me and push me to support Senator Klobuchar in her tireless work to get  this bill the vote it deserves. I want to thank my colleague Senator  Klobuchar for hearing the voices of American veterans, for hearing the  voices of Afghans now in our country who deserve legal status, and I  join her in demanding a vote on this amendment to the National Defense  Authorization Act.   I yield the floor.
