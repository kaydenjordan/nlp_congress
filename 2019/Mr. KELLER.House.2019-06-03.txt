 Thank you, Madam Speaker. Thank you, fellow Members of  Congress. Thank you to the folks of Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional  District.   Before I begin, I just want to make note of the gentleman whose  position I am replacing, and that is Congressman Tom Marino, a  dedicated public servant. We want to thank him for that service, and  also wish him and his family all the best in the future.   I also would like to take a few moments to thank my family who are  here with me tonight, my granddaughter, Carson, standing next to me,  and up in the gallery, my wife, Kay, of 34 years, our daughter, Jamie,  and her husband, Ron, our son, Freddie, and our other granddaughter,  Camrie.   There are a lot of things that go into public service, but having  your family and friends support you, it can't be any better than that.   I also would like to thank the outstanding folks of Pennsylvania's  12th Congressional District who have placed the privilege of  representing them in me here in Congress.   I also look forward to working with all the Members of the United  States House of Representatives under Speaker Pelosi's leadership. I  also look forward to working with the United States Senate and our  President to positively impact the lives of all Americans.   Again, I thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to  working with everybody.   May God bless you. May God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
