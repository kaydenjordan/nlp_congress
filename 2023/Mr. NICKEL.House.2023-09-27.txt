 Mr. Speaker, right now, we are on the path to a  government shutdown caused by extremist Members who are unwilling to  put politics aside, to do what is right for the country.   A government shutdown would be a disaster for North Carolina. It  would leave 6,574 Federal workers in my district without a paycheck, it  would jeopardize benefits for over 49,000 veterans in my district, and  it would hurt our economy.   The last shutdown permanently cost our country $3 billion. That was  only a partial shutdown. We can't afford to do that again.   That is why I have introduced the No Budget, No Pay Act. This bill  has a simple idea: Members of Congress shouldn't get paid if we don't  do our jobs.   I am proud to say this bill now has bipartisan support in the House.  I came to Congress to get things done, and I will continue to work in a  bipartisan way to avoid a government shutdown and do what is right for  North Carolina.                            ____________________
