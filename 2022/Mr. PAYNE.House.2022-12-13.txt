 Good morning, everybody.   Dennis, thank you very much. It is an honor to be here on the House  floor, and especially with many of my former colleagues and Members who  are retiring from the Congress. Thank you all.   On behalf of the U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress,  which we will call FMC as I move through this, I very much appreciate  the Speaker's invitation to return to this very important place and to  present the Congress FMC's annual report, which this year we are  presenting specifically under the theme ``Life After Congress'' for our  new former Members who are not returning for the 118th Congress. We  will share with them how they can continue their public service through  work with FMC. I will be joined by some of my colleagues to report on a  few of FMC's premier programs.   As I prepared for today's report, it brought back a lot of memories,  many happy memories, of my decade serving in the U.S. Congress.   For all of us, the Congress is one of the highlights of our  professional lives. And I know that for each and every one of us, there  are memories that will ever remind us of the great privilege that we  have had as Representatives of our constituents.   For me, these memories include great friendships with colleagues from  both sides of the aisle, working with terrific and very talented young  people who were on my staff and others, and pushing forward pieces of  legislation that I know have made a positive difference in the lives of  Americans.   By serving in Congress, we were given the opportunity to serve our  country and its citizens, and I am very proud that through FMC we can  continue in an important way the public service that has brought us to  Congress in the first place. There is, indeed, life after Congress, and  today, we will share with you how FMC members continue to give back.   FMC is the premier NGO focused on our legislative branch, involving  both current and former Members from the House and Senate in our work.   We are dedicated to strengthening representative democracy at home  and abroad, we strive to encourage public service in the next  generation, and we support and promote Congress as an institution and  current Members in their important work.   The U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress was created over  50 years ago. It was a social organization akin to a university's  alumni association. And while we retain that mandate, we have also over  the years added many substantive programs that make great use of the  unique skill set and experience inherent in our membership.   Some of these programs we will explain in some detail over the next  hour. As you learn more about FMC, please keep one fact in mind: We are  100 percent a bipartisan organization.   Our strength lies in the fact that Republicans and Democrats work  together for the good of our organization and our country and are  united as they continue their public service.   It is within that spirit that I now introduce your colleagues, Derek  Kilmer of Washington State and William Timmons of South Carolina, who  lead the House Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress. They  will tell you how, as former Members, you can support the momentum that  the bipartisan committee has created through their 200 recommendations  to help improve the Congress.    Chairman Kilmer, thank you very much, and Vice Chairman  Timmons. You have done a tremendous job with your leadership on this  very important initiative for the Congress and the country.   In New York in June, we had an opportunity to recognize both of them  with the Distinguished Service Award. Thank you again.   What you just heard is really a prime example of how we at FMC can  support Congress as an institution. We are really very proud to be  invited to do so.   At this juncture, let me give you a little more background on FMC. As  I said, we were incorporated over 50 years ago as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit  charitable and educational organization. We are chartered by Congress,  but we receive absolutely no funds from Congress or the government. No  taxpayer dollars are earmarked for any FMC program, and that is a fact  and one that we are very proud of.   Everything we do is self-funded through membership dues, through  fundraising events, and through program-specific grants. Our most  recent audit proclaimed us fiscally sound and financially healthy.   One of the most immediate and most impactful ways you, as returning  Members, can support FMC financially is by considering to be a  sustaining member of FMC.   We now have more than five dozen, almost six dozen former Members who  have made this notable commitment to FMC. They are ensuring that not  only we can present our important and numerous programs to the public,  but they are also contributing to the longevity and continuity of this  organization, as half of the sustaining membership contribution is  earmarked for our long-term, rainy-day fund.   I am pleased to add a list of our sustaining members to the Record,  and I thank them for their tremendous support of FMC.                         Sustaining Members of FMC          The Hon.

Thanks to Mr. Kilmer and Mr. Timmons, you have already  gotten a flavor of how we support the Congress as an institution.   I now yield the floor to FMC board member Tom Graves of Georgia, who  will tell you about FMC's many different programs to keep us connected  as former colleagues and to create media opportunities for our members  to share their insights. He will be followed by FMC board member Donna  Edwards of Maryland to tell you about our most important domestic  undertaking, the Congress to Campus program.    Madam Speaker, thank you very much for visiting with us,  and thank you, especially, for your great leadership of the Congress.   The Speaker mentioned Don McEachin, our fellow Virginian, and she  also mentioned Norm Mineta, both of whom passed away recently.   I would also like to say a few words about our good friend Jim Kolbe.  As many of you may know, Jim passed away about a week ago. It was quite  sudden and quite unexpected.   With his passing, we and FMC lost a good friend, a longtime board  member, and a voice of reason and compassion during these tumultuous  political times that we are currently experiencing. All of us at FMC,  from the staff to the board, loved working with Jim. We will certainly  miss him greatly.   As you may know, and many of you participate in this service, we,  each year, organize a memorial service in Statuary Hall. The Speaker  just talked about it. This is to honor the Members whom we have lost in  the previous year. It is a fitting tribute to their public service.   I include in the Congressional Record the names of all the Members  whom we honored in Statuary Hall this past September.   List of Former Members Who Passed Away Fall October 2021-December 2022         The Hon. Todd Akin (Missouri), Brad Ashford (Nebraska), Dan       Benishek (Michigan), Bill Brewster (Oklahoma), Clarence       ``Bud'' Brown Jr. (Ohio), Albert Bustamante (Texas), Max       Cleland (Georgia), Barbara-Rose Collins (Michigan), John       Cooksey (Louisiana), Bob Dole (Kansas), Harris Fawell       (Illinois), Vic Fazio (California), James Florio (New       Jersey), Ed Foreman (Texas and New Mexio), George Gekas       (Pennsylvania).        The Hon. Jim Hagedorn (Minnesota), Orrin Hatch (Utah),       Kaneaster Hodges Jr. (Arkansas), Larry Hopkins (Kentucky),       Carroll Hubbard (Kentucky), Johnny Isakson (Georgia), Timothy       Johnson (Illinois), Dale Kildee (Michigan), James ``Jim''       Kolbe (Arizona), Bob Krueger (Texas), Claude ``Buddy'' Leach       (Louisiana), Gary A. Lee (New York), Romano ``Ron'' Mazzoli       (Kentucky), Jack H. McDonald (Michigan).        The Hon. A. Donald McEachin (Virginia), Carrie Meek       (Florida), Norm Mineta (California), Dennis Moore (Kansas),       John Porter (Illinois), Harry Reid (Nevada), J. Roy Rowland       (Georgia), Norman D. Shumway (California), Neal Smith (Iowa),       Mark Souder (Indiana), James Stanton (Ohio), Standish       ``Fletcher'' Thomson (Georgia), Esteban Torres (California),       Jolene Unsoeld (Washington), Jackie Walorski (Indiana), Don       Young (Alaska), Bill Zeliff(New Hampshire).     For them, and for Jim Kolbe, I am asking that you in the  Chamber and any visitors in the gallery please stand, if you are able,  so that we can show our respect to these Members with a moment of  silence.   As you can see, FMC is an active and impactful organization that  empowers Members to continue their service after leaving Congress. We  are energized, and we are having tremendous success for, really, three  reasons.   One is the outstanding work that our board and our staff have done to  solidify our mission, to put in place achievable goals and strategize  how to best move FMC forward.   The second reason is our amazing group of partners. These are the  corporations that donate to us, especially by way of the Statesmanship  Awards Dinner, because they believe in our purpose and recognize the  positive impact we are having. They have meant so much to FMC and to  allowing us to achieve our purpose.   You have heard of these entities. Connie mentioned them previously.  They have done so much, and we so appreciate all that they have done.  They believe in our capabilities, and they believe in giving us the  opportunity to grow and create long-lasting programming and to allow us  to do all the things that we are able to do. So, we thank them again.   The third and the most important reason for FMC's success is all of  you, the former Members of Congress who are my colleagues who donate  your time, expertise, wisdom, and leadership. You do this by becoming  dues-paying, active members of FMC.   I hope that you retiring Members have found the insight that we have  shared today helpful. We hope that you would also consider becoming  part of us and help us continue this mission. We would love to connect  with you in person, and I hope you will join us immediately after this  downstairs in H-120. We will have a reception, and we would like to  have you be part of that.   I would also like to thank our staff: Pete, who is here, and our  staff members there, if you would all stand, please. Let's give them a  round of applause.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the proceedings during the  former Members program be printed in the Congressional Record and that  all Members and former Members who spoke during the proceedings have  the privilege of revising and extending their remarks.
