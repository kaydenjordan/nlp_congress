 Mr. Speaker, American voters deserve to have confidence  in their election process. This is not it.   A few basic principles: voter ID so we know who is showing up and who  is receiving ballots; a clean set of voting rolls so the people who are  eligible--of all types, the people who are truly eligible in this  country--are voting from their proper domicile; we know they are  citizens; and we know they are the right age.   But somehow we find these things to be problematic and somehow this  is going to be suppressing votes--what, for people being eligible to  vote being the actual voters that they live in the right State, that  they are the right age, and that they are citizens?   It is ridiculous the lengths that the Democrats want to go to upset  our election process and the confidence people have in it. It could be  really quite simple. Have the election end on election night. In one  place in my district, they found a box 30-something days after the  election. They had to open back up the certified election to take care  of a box that had drop-off ballots in it.   We are making a farce out of our elections in this country. And this,  by nationalizing them, will make it that much worse. In the  Constitution, the Congress established the States will run their  elections. We only need to have very narrow guidelines for how our  Federal ones are conducted.
