 Madam Speaker, Republicans are refusing to raise the  debt ceiling, manufacturing a crisis to push their extreme agenda. They  are ready to allow our government to default on its debt for the first  time in our history, even though Republicans raised the debt ceiling  three times during the Trump administration after passing almost $2  trillion in tax cuts for large corporations and the ultra-wealthy.   The default should matter to average Americans because if the  government runs out of cash, it won't be able to make Social Security  payments to seniors who rely on them; families on food assistance will  go hungry; veterans won't get the care and the benefits they have  earned.   Defaulting on our debt will destabilize the U.S. financial system  resulting in a recession, job loss, and spiking interest rates. This  means it will be more expensive for people to get loans to buy cars,  buy homes, attend college, or invest in their small businesses.   It is time for Republicans to stop holding our economy hostage and to  do their job.                            ____________________
