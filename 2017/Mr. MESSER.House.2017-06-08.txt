 Mr. Chairman, despite the rhetoric and whatever its  intentions, since Dodd-Frank's passage, big bank profits are shattering  records, and home ownership is down, way down, to the lowest level seen  in over 20 years. Car loans and small-business loans are much harder to  get, too. Simply put, Dodd-Frank has been great for Federal regulators  and even big banks but very bad for Hoosier consumers.   The Financial CHOICE Act changes that. It ends too big to fail and  enables Hoosier financial institutions to escape the one-size-fits-all  regulatory regime of Dodd-Frank. That will help hardworking Hoosiers  get more affordable loans.   The Financial CHOICE Act also includes my bill, the RIGHTS at the  CFPB Act, which ensures that anyone pursued by this Federal agency will  have their rights protected and get their day in court.   I urge support of the Financial CHOICE Act.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, we have already debunked  what we have been told by the opposition about the oversight, CFPB's  supervision and enforcement. Of course, we have told you about that.  Let's take a moment to tell you that community banks have showed  strength in residential, commercial, industrial loans, and small- business lending. In fact, overall loan growth at community banks has  been faster than at bigger banks. In the fourth quarter of 2016,  lending was up 8.3 percent for community banks and 4.8 percent for  larger banks.   Mr. Chair, with that, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. Foster), a member of the Financial Services Committee.
