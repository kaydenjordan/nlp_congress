 Mr. Speaker, tonight, we stand in this great Chamber and  mourn our friend, a civil rights icon and the conscience of Congress.   John Lewis towered over his era, and his loss is deeply felt across  this country and across the globe. From marching for freedom in  Montgomery to being beaten and bloodied on a bridge in Selma, John's  life showed us all the fundamental need for good, necessary trouble.   As John would often say:         We have a moral obligation, a mission, and a mandate to do       what we can to make our country and our world a better place       and to help usher in a loving community where no one is left       out or left behind.    His words and his life ring through eternity.   We will honor John's legacy with an unshakeable determination to  fight for what is right and what is just. He served the Nation in love.  Rest in peace, my friend. We love you. I love you.
