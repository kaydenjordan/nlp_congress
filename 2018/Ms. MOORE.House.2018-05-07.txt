 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Evans for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate having time here on this Congressional  Black Caucus hour to discuss so-called welfare reform and efforts on  the part of the majority to shred the safety net.   Mr. Speaker, I think you just have to sort of sympathize with the  majority, given the conundrum that they have put themselves into. What  they did, in an effort to have some sort of win and to take advantage  of having the majority in the House of Representatives, in the United  States Senate, to be holding power in the White House with the new  President, even seizing the Supreme Court, this was a very opportune  time to do what the majority thought, and I give them credit for  thinking that they wanted to implement and execute their greatest  policy imperative, and that was to provide tax cuts to the wealthiest  Americans and to corporations. They wanted to take this one opportunity  to do that because, in their opinion, that is what would move our  economy forward.   In December, they were able to accomplish it over the protests of  economists, over the protests of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget  Office that said if, in fact, these $1.9 trillion in tax cuts are given  to the wealthiest Americans and corporations, that we would see  deficits for the next decade at about $1.5 trillion, and that would add  to the deficit we are already experiencing.   Of course, that is the conundrum for the majority party, which out of  one side of their mouth they have always been concerned about deficits,  and now they were implementing a policy that would add to the deficit.  Well, the explanation for that was that somehow this $1.9 trillion  would materialize in a brand-new concept called trickle down; that  somehow by cutting these taxes for the wealthiest Americans, that  somehow this would create jobs, that wages would be raised, that there  would be new capital expenditures; and although trickle down had not  worked for 30, 40 years, that somehow this was going to happen.   Well, the supposition is that these tax cuts would just sort of  magically pay for themselves and that we should just give it a little  bit of time. So when these tax cuts were put into place, we saw  companies immediately lining up to provide bonuses, one-time-only  bonuses--not raising the wages of workers, not building new factories.   Now we see one of our favorite companies, one of my favorite  companies--we all own a nice Apple phone--they just paid $100 billion  buying back shares. Of course, shareholders are not Americans who live  on Main Street. They are the wealthiest people not only in America, but  all over the world. You don't know who the shareholders are. They are  probably not your next-door neighbors.   Well, you have to empathize with the majority party, because they now  have to figure out how to pay for these tax cuts. They have got to pay  for them.   We don't have to guess how they are going to pay for them. The  Speaker has told us how he plans to pay for them. The President has  told us how they plan to pay for these tax cuts.   I was so happy that the gentlewoman from Alabama was here earlier,  and I just want to remind you of what she shared with us. She reminded  us that the President, in his budget, his proposed budget, proposed  cutting $1.4 trillion--that is ``trillion'' with a T; that is like 12  zeros after that 1--out of Medicaid.   I know from sitting on the Budget Committee with the Speaker for so  many years that this is a dream come true for our Speaker, who has  always wanted to block grant--as in put on the chopping block-- Medicaid, a program that provides security mostly for our seniors for  them to have a dignified end-of-life experience instead of living like  a dog in the back room somewhere living out their last days.   We know from what they have put on paper--you can't make this stuff  up--they want to cut $500 billion--that is ``billion'' with a B--out of  Medicare, the program that has reduced and almost eliminated poverty,  between that and Social Security, for our elders.   You have heard it said time and again that a nation is judged by how  it treats its young and its elderly. We know now that the White House  and our President is fuming because this $1.9 trillion problem that  they have created has now got to be solved.   Well, that is just not enough money. That is only $2 trillion between  Medicare and Medicaid. So they said, ``Wait a minute. We can cut some  out of Social Security,'' this so-called sacred  [[Page H3769]]  cow. They say, ``We can cut, from Social Security Disability, $72  billion,'' but that is not enough.   We have in front of us a farm bill, and proposals in that bill would  cut $23.8 billion out of it, pushing 9.5 million people deeper into  poverty, food insecurity, and hunger.                                time  2000    That is the framework for paying for the wealthiest people, for these  poor corporations that we have got to provide a safety net for, for  these poor 1 percent of our population rich, the wealthiest 1 percent  who need relief from the government. We are going to pay for it by  cutting Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and food stamps.   Well, it doesn't sound like that is enough for the majority. The  President has said we are going to just review any program that  targets, aids, and supports low-income or hardworking people.   How about housing vouchers? So many Americans--there was a book  written about my community by Mr. Matthew Desmond, titled, ``Evicted,''  and it pointed out how so many Americans work hard, but 50 percent, 60  percent of their income has to go toward housing because, in fact, we  haven't seen a raise in the minimum wage for over a decade. People are  working two, three jobs.   I have known people who have gone to work and go home at night to the  homeless shelter. People cannot afford to pay 50 percent of their  income, so there are hardworking Americans who have benefited from  housing vouchers, Section 8, subsidized Community Development Block  Grant funds.   But, of course, we have heard from our Secretary of HUD that we want  to reform that program and require disabled folks, elderly folks,  perhaps some of our veterans who live in subsidized housing, to pay 35  percent of their income versus 30 percent of their income.   This doesn't increase the pool of people who are eligible for  housing. It does two things: It reduces the number of people who are  eligible for subsidized housing, and then it raises the costs for those  who are squeaking by every single day.   So I just am inflamed about this, and I guess I want to ask the  gentleman from Pennsylvania some questions because I might have the  wrong perspective on this.   I am a person who has benefited from these programs. I have fed my  family with SNAP, food stamps. I have used Medicaid to take my children  to the doctor and to give birth. I have paid my rent using welfare  benefits.   I am wondering if the gentleman doesn't think that vilifying poor  people is an insidious and nefarious effort to create the atmosphere  where Americans would be much more willing to take these programs away  from them.   I mean, there is this notion, somehow, that there are just lazy  people who refuse to go work who need SNAP; that there are just lazy  people who are ne'er-do-wells, and they are fraudulent, they have 80  Social Security numbers, and they are welfare queens.   I was just wondering if the gentleman could just get it straight for  me, share some things with me:   How many families receive Temporary Assistance to Needy Families?   Are people eating lobsters on SNAP?   Are these homes filled with able-bodied people who refuse to work and  they just want to get SNAP?   Can the gentleman just give me a profile of the kind of people who we  are trying to help.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that.   I just want to tell him how outraged I am by the propaganda against  poor people. I am outraged by it.   If you look at a family that uses SNAP, formerly called food stamps,  this program works perfectly well in a capitalist society, in a  countercyclical economy. When we almost had a depression in 2008, the  food stamp rolls went up, and now they are coming back down because  people are more connected with work.   Two-thirds of these families that receive SNAP have at least one  working person in it. And guess what. They have veterans in them and  elders, children and disabled people. Eighty percent of the people who  receive SNAP, someone has worked the year before or the year after, so  it is not an issue of people not wanting to work.  [[Page H3770]]    And think about it: we now have given $1.9 trillion in tax cuts to  the wealthiest people. We hear the White House bragging about how we  have increased those jobs, we have increased jobs by 164,000 people.  Let me tell you, I happen to know in my own community people got two or  three of those jobs because that is what they need to hold it down.   Before I finish, I will just say that we ought not fall for the  okeydoke, because poor people are not those other people. They are you;  they are your cousins; they are people who go to your church; they are  your kids' classmates; they are people who worked every day and lost  their jobs due to technology or downsizing. And when you are 50 years  old, it is not because you don't want to work. You can't work.
