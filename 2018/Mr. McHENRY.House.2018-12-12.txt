 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this is the first time, as a Member, I have given a  speech like this. I have to say, in this body, Members understand that  an essential ingredient for a successful Member of Congress and for  this institution to function is our staff.   With good, talented staff, Members can be successful, the legislative  process can work, and we can serve our country.   We have many faithful public servants here in the House of  Representatives, and I rise today to recognize one of them.   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize my chief of staff of 12  years, Parker Hamilton Poling. She has served this House of  Representatives in many different capacities, but for the last 12  years, she has been my personal office chief and my leadership office  chief.   She sits behind me today, and she is easily embarrassed. But if she  looks at the gallery, her husband, Todd, and her two beautiful  daughters, Barrett and Eliza, are here to recognize her service and the  hard work she has put in for this country.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today because my chief of staff, Parker, has been  an essential ingredient to my success as a Member of Congress, to  serving the people of North Carolina's 10th District as a Member of  Congress, to being a successful member of the House Financial Services  Committee.   She has been an essential ingredient for House Republicans on getting  the key votes over the last 4\1/2\ years for our agenda. She has worked  tirelessly to count the votes on the House floor to get our agenda  passed. She has worked tirelessly to build relationships with other  chiefs of staff and Members, as well as other staff, to further this  operation in the House of Representatives.   Eight years ago, Parker got a group of female chiefs of staff,  Republican chiefs of staff, who were mothers together and said: We need  to actually have an organization so we help each other and coach each  other along the way through mentoring.   She has developed that into a very solid group that exchanges  information and helps each other.   What I want to say here on the House floor and publicly is that my  success in the last 12 years is as a direct result of Parker's work.   I met her 22 years ago through an organization called College  Republicans. We both cut our teeth in the rough and tumble of that  political operation. I was a student at NC State, and she was a student  at Brown University. She grew up in upstate New York and took this sort  of different background and perspective, and I realized her ingenuity,  her creativity, her strength, and her passion for the cause. And I  learned so much from her.   Then, 10 years after that, as a Member of Congress, I invited her in,  between her law school classes. She thought I was trying to ask for  free legal advice. She had, with coaching from her husband, a really  set answer on how she could not, because she had not passed the bar  yet, give me legal advice, much less free legal advice.   She came in, sat down. She put her book bag down, wearing a pair of  jeans. I said: Well, I would like to hire you as my chief of staff. And  she says: I didn't interview for it, and I am not sure I want it.   After she had a conversation with her husband, and some, you know,  negotiation, she became my chief of staff, and my world as a Member of  Congress changed much for the better.   But I am not the only one that Parker has had an impact on as a  Member of Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, and I thank Kevin and  Richard for their kind comments regarding the counsel they have  received from Parker and the relationship they have with her.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Parker's favorite Member  of Congress, notwithstanding that that includes the majority leader and  my friend, Mr. Hudson, and I on that list. We may be friends with  Parker, and she may like and respect us, but her favorite Member of  Congress is Bruce Poliquin from Maine.    Mr. Speaker, if I may close. I want to thank Congressmen  Poliquin and Hudson, and the majority leader, Mr. McCarthy, for their  kind comments. I just want to close with that.   Parker grew up in upstate New York but has done a fantastic job for  the last 12 years working for the people of North Carolina's 10th  District. She is a New Yorker but gets the South.   She is a Republican who has friends across the aisle. She is a  Republican through and through and committed to our party, our  ideology, and the work that we are trying to achieve. While she could  be a partisan in her role here counting votes for Republicans, she  never lost sight of those relationships across the aisle that could  make this place work.   While I will miss her counsel on a daily basis, while I will miss her  words of encouragement and also the tough words when you need them,  when Members need them--and I have certainly needed them over the last  decade--I am grateful for her service. I am grateful for what she has  done for this institution, for me, and for the countless staff that she  has mentored along the way. I wish her well.   I say to her two daughters watching that they have a fantastic  example in their mother. While she may be tough with us at work, I know  she cares about them and loves them dearly.   The life that Parker and Todd have built together is a great example  of a loving family, while also both being professionals who have quite  challenging careers.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the indulgence of my colleagues and the kind  comments for Parker, and I encourage folks to wish her well in her new  endeavors.                                time  1645
