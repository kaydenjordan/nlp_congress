 Mr. President, I rise to commend the outstanding  charitable efforts of the Farmers Feeding Utah campaign, a project of  the Miracle of Agriculture Foundation and the Utah Farm Bureau  Federation. As the pandemic brought new challenges to farmers,  ranchers, and families everywhere, volunteers and community leaders  across the State joined together to help our neighbors in need.   Last year, disruptions to our food security and supply chains led to  uncharted economic hardship for both producers and consumers. For many,  this included putting food on the table. Nevertheless, Utahns were  determined to chart new opportunities for creative and charitable  giving.   Recognizing an alarming increased demand in food pantries statewide,  the Utah Farm Bureau Federation launched a campaign to deliver food to  disadvantaged Utah families. To achieve this, the Farmers Feeding Utah  program collects generous donations used to purchase commodities from  Utah farmers facing pandemic-related market shortages and losses. These  products are distributed to food pantries with the help of numerous  community-based organizations, which in turn sustains our farms and  ranches.   To date, the Farmers Feeding Utah campaign has collected over 1.5  million pounds of food, worth over $3.2 million, from donations by  individuals and organizations passionate about alleviating hunger.  These extraordinary acts of kindness have provided nutritional relief  to more than 23,000 Utah families along the Wasatch front, northern  Utah, the Navajo Nation, and across southern and rural Utah.   The success of this initiative underscores Utah's excellence in  fielding solutions to complex problems, to the benefit of individuals  and families in need. The collaboration of diverse partners across the  agriculture industry, health sector, and religious and academic  institutions highlights our State's esteemed tradition of charity. In  addition to the Utah Farm Bureau Federation, partners like Utah State  University's Hunger Solutions Institute and Create Better Health  programs, the Utah Department of Agriculture & Food, the Farm Bureau  Financial Services, the Utah Petroleum Association, the Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter-day Saints, and scores of generous Utah companies and  individuals have provided invaluable support to this effort.   There is more work to be done, which is why the Farmers Feeding Utah  program continues to organize food drives and deliver critical  assistance in cities all over Utah. With every additional meal donated  to a hungry family, our Utah family grows ever stronger. Thank you to  all involved in this tremendous public-private service initiative, with  special gratitude for the strong leadership of Ron ``The Milkman''  Gibson as Farm Bureau president. Keep up the great work.                            ____________________
