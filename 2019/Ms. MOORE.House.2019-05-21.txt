 Madam Speaker, I am so honored to join my colleagues in  commemorating the 100th anniversary of House passage of the 19th  Amendment to the United States Constitution, guaranteeing women the  right to vote everywhere in our country.  [[Page H4024]]    My State, Wisconsin, was the very first State to ratify the 19th  Amendment, and I am wearing this yellow rose today in honor of the  remarkable women who fought for their seat at the table.   They persevered; they resisted; they persisted; and the face of  Congress is different because of them. Women like Ida B. Wells, Susan  B. Anthony, and Sojourner Truth said that, if women want rights, we  must be sisters in arms and fight for what is right.   Wisconsin was the first State to ratify the 19th Amendment, and,  unfortunately, they are now leading in the efforts to disenfranchise  people. But it is because of the powerful legacy that I will continue  to fight to make sure that no one is denied access to the ballots due  them as citizens.                            ____________________
