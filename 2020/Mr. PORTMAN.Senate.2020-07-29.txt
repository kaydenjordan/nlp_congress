 Mr. President, I am here on the floor to talk about some  of the steps that Congress should take in response to the coronavirus  pandemic. I am going to start with talking about the legislation that  the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, introduced yesterday.   One of the aspects of it that hasn't gotten much attention and that,  I think, is very positive and a very effective way to get the economy  moving in a safe way is with some tax legislation. These are tax  credits and tax deductions that help to encourage the hiring of new  workers but that also do so in a safe way. These are the kinds of  things that make a lot of sense and that have a lot of bipartisan  support and appeal, so I think it should be part of whatever final  package we end up with.   The goal of these tax incentives is to say that we want people to  reenter the workforce but to do it in a safe and sustainable way. For  example, in the McConnell proposal is legislation I have introduced,  called the Healthy Workplaces Tax Credit Act. It is very simple. It  says there will be a credit on the employer's side of payroll taxes  against qualified employee protection expenses and workplace  reconfiguration expenses to ensure employers can afford additional  safety measures.   As I travel around the State of Ohio, I see the Plexiglas dividers.  You have probably seen those in offices where there are more open  settings. You see it in a lot of retail places now. There is a cost to  that, but there is also a cost to personal protective gear--the masks  and the gowns and the gloves and the other things that people are  needing in order to have a safe workplace. As I have been in some of  the factories around Ohio, I have also seen that they have had to  reconfigure the factory spaces in order to provide more social  distancing. At one plant, in its floor plan, it had expanded the  lunchroom in order to provide more social distancing, and that, of  course, meant there was less space for manufacturing. These are costs,  and these are the kinds of things that could be part of this credit.   So my hope is, whether it is a thermometer check or whether it is  more testing or whether it is PPE or whether it is more hand sanitizer,  that we could encourage people to use these things by having a tax  credit. It would provide an immediate stimulus to the economy as well,  which is a good thing because many businesses would be operating at a  loss and not have taxable income, but they would have payroll tax  liability, and this is a credit to the payroll tax.   It also applies, by the way, to nonprofits, as it should, and to the  501(c)(3)s. I was at one of the alcohol and drug addiction entities in  one of our counties the week before last, and it had Plexiglas up.  Frankly, it is hurting in terms of its budget right now, but it felt  like it had to have a safe place for people to work. We want everybody  to have a safe place. We want  [[Page S4576]]  people to go back to work and to go back safely.   I commend Senator McConnell for including that bill in the CARES 2.0  package that was released this week. This tax credit will support  efforts to make the workplace safe and healthy and build consumer  confidence in that all of the appropriate measures are being taken. It  is important to get consumers back in the mix. Whether it is going back  into a restaurant and feeling safe or going back to a retail  establishment, if people feel safe, they are more likely to go back,  and this economy can get going again. So I think it is something,  again, both sides of the aisle should be able to support, and it will  show we are doing everything we can to get people back to more normal  lives.   Second, with the unemployment rate still at about 11 percent, we need  to encourage hiring and employee retention as this virus continues to  affect our economy. In the McConnell proposal, we have a way to create  this incentive that builds on legislation we have already passed in the  form of the work opportunity tax credit. This is an existing law that  gives employers an incentive to hire individuals who might not  otherwise be able to get a job.   Categories now include, as an example, our veterans. So, if you are a  veteran and are having a tough time getting a job, you can go through  the work opportunity tax credit, and the employer can get a credit for  hiring you initially. By the way, almost everyone I talk to says these  people end up being hired full time and being paid their full wages. In  the meantime, they get a credit to bring them on during a first  transition period, so it works.   Another category, as an example, is the folks who have been let out  of prison. Second chance individuals have a chance under the work  opportunity tax credit, WOTC, to get a job.   We have proposed adding a new category, which is qualified COVID-19  employees--those who are on unemployment insurance immediately prior to  their hiring date. It increases the work opportunity tax credit amount  for this new targeted group of individuals from 40 percent of the first  $6,000 in qualified wages to 50 percent of the first $10,000 in  qualified wages. Again, it encourages us to help get people off  unemployment insurance and back to work. Let's say they work for a  company that is not going back because of COVID-19. Let's say it is a  movie theater or a bowling alley or, maybe, a bar. Those individuals  would qualify.   Third, I support a proposal in this McConnell draft that builds on  what is called the employee retention tax credit. That is already in  law. We put it in law in the first CARES Act. The credit was a good  start, but it needs to be updated and expanded given the course of our  economy since March and what has happened with the coronavirus. This  credit applies to employers who have operations partially or fully  suspended due to COVID-19 and any related government order saying that  one has to shut down but has chosen to retain one's affected employees.  It is a credit that increases from the CARES 1 from 50 to 65 percent  per employee--from $10,000 under current law for the whole year and  $10,000 per quarter. It also helps businesses that have had a 25- percent decline in revenues, not a 50-percent decline in revenues.   It is for the group of companies that may not have qualified for a  PPP credit or a PPP loan--they may not have gotten one--but is having a  tough time keeping their workers. This would encourage them to keep  those workers and to bring on new workers. Again, it is the kind of  support that our workforce needs as the economy reopens and companies  resume ramping up operations. It helps to bring people off the  unemployment rolls. It is a pull into the workforce, and that is a good  thing.   These are commonsense proposals. What is more, historically, they  have been policies that have had bipartisan support. I worked with my  friend Senator Ben Cardin, on the other side, in designing the employee  retention tax credit back in March, and expanding the work opportunity  tax credit has always had bipartisan support.   On the healthy workplace credit, Senator Sinema, of Arizona, has a  similar bill that goes a little further, but it is very similar. I see  no reason we can't take what we all agree on works and make it even  better in this new package.   Again, these tax incentives are the kind of bipartisan consensus- builders that we ought to be looking at right now to get into a new  package, hopefully, by the end of this week. We have to ensure--I think  all of us agree--the safe reopening of our economy, and these tax  provisions do that    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
