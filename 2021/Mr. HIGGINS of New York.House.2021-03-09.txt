 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2021.   The pandemic has made clear that we need to strengthen worker rights  and expand union participation.   Across this Nation, frontline and essential workers have had to work  in unsafe conditions with insufficient pay because of their inability  to negotiate with their employers.   The economic fallout from the pandemic has laid bare the costs of  severe income inequality in America, where corporations and the  wealthiest individuals are able to thrive at the expense of everybody  else.   Labor is the backbone of middle America and the key to addressing  income inequality.   Protecting the right to organize and to collectively bargain ensures  access to better wages, more robust benefits, and safer working  conditions for hardworking Americans.   When workers are able to stand together and demand their fair share,  we will all be better off.    I strongly support passage of the PRO Act and encourage my colleagues  to do the same.                            ____________________
