 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud Governor Deal's plan  to begin construction on the Georgia Cyber Innovation and Training  Center in Georgia.   Cyber is the new frontier in warfare. In order to field the threats  of today and tomorrow, a 21st century military is essential. Our  community back home in Georgia is proving to be a major influencer and  champion in the cyber arena. With the U.S. Army Cyber Command's  transition to Fort Gordon, numerous tech companies and jobs investing  in our area, the creation of local cyber institutes substitutes, and  now the establishment of the Georgia Cyber Innovation and Training  Center, Georgia's 12th District has the potential to become the  security, technology, and innovation hub of the southeast.   Because of the work that will be done here, we will be leading the  charge in creating the cyber workforce and leading our Nation. The  battlefields don't look like they used to. We have got to adapt fast. I  am thankful to Governor Deal for his efforts to not only create jobs,  but to strengthen our national security and invest in our community.
