 Mr. Speaker, we are here, almost 10 months into this  congressional session, and what has been accomplished? While TrumpCare  supporters have gone back and forth on a plan that would take  healthcare away from millions of Americans, raise out-of-pocket costs  for people with preexisting conditions, and force too many rural  hospitals to close their doors, they have completely missed a real  healthcare crisis that is coming tomorrow. That is when Federal funding  runs out for thousands of community health clinics and for millions of  low-income children and for pregnant women across our country.   For years, community health clinics and the Children's Health  Insurance Program have enjoyed strong bipartisan support from both  sides of the aisle here.   So why aren't we voting to protect these critical programs right now?  Mr. Speaker, we were sent here to help the hardworking families that we  serve and offer them a better deal. Now that the TrumpCare package has  thankfully failed again, I hope we can start doing that.                            ____________________
