 Madam Speaker, I stand here today in strong support of  H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act of 2019, a product of  decades-long advocacy, grit, and compromise.   I am extremely proud to stand with Dreamers and recipients of  temporary protected status and deferred enforced departure. We are here  because of their hard work, as well as the steadfast determination of  immigrant rights groups, faith-based organizations, labor unions, civil  rights groups, business associations, and so many of my colleagues who  have worked tirelessly to bring this bill to the floor today.  [[Page H4238]]    Our work has paid off. There is widespread, bipartisan support across  the country for protecting Dreamers and passing the American Dream and  Promise Act.   Just yesterday, over 100 business leaders urged us to vote in favor  of the bill, including household companies such as eBay, Hewlett- Packard, IKEA, Chobani, and Levi Strauss. They support the bill because  the United States will benefit economically from its passage.   The Chamber of Commerce says that it supports the bill, and it may  make the vote on the American Dream and Promise Act a key vote.   Even now, more than 70 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies,  which generate $3 trillion in annual revenue, employ Dreamers. Even the  conservative Cato Institute found that allowing Dreamers to remain here  would add an extra $350 billion to our economy and an additional $90  billion in tax revenue.   On the other hand, failure to support lawful status for Dreamers will  directly undermine our competitiveness and subject them to permanent  exile. That makes no sense.   We have waited long enough. It is time for us to pass the American  Dream and Promise Act in the House of Representatives.   It was 2001 when the first iteration of the Dream Act was introduced.  Eighteen years later, we are finally poised to pass it.   We have seen the benefit of President Obama's DACA announcement, a  temporary initiative that allowed these young people to temporarily  work and to stay without looking over their shoulders. The courts have  kept us from seeing the destruction of DACA that President Trump had  ordered, even though polls show that almost 90 percent of Americans  support legal recognition for Dreamers.   Dreamers are Americans. All they lack is the paper to prove it. They  live in every one of our 50 States. Their families hail from every  region of the world. Their contributions are felt all across the  landscape of this country.   Among them are future industry leaders; nurses; doctors; chefs;  construction workers; teachers, including 5,000 teachers in California;  and care providers for our children and parents.   Dreamers are joined in their efforts by TPS and DED brethren. In the  same month that the administration announced the end of DACA, they also  announced the termination of TPS for six countries and, a few weeks  later, the termination of DED for Liberians, even though many of them  have been here for 30 years.   More than 400,000 nationals of seven countries now face exile from  the United States. The majority have lived here for at least 20 years,  building their lives, raising families that include more than a quarter  of a million U.S. citizen children.   The future for Dreamers and longtime TPS and DED recipients does not  have to be uncertain. We have the opportunity to pass the American  Dream and Promise Act in the House of Representatives today and, by  doing so, put those Dreamers and strivers on the path to legal  recognition.   Let's put partisan fights aside for the good of our Nation, for the  good of our economy and our communities. Approve this rule and, later  today, vote for the American Dream and Promise Act.    Madam Speaker, today, we have the privilege of voting  for the American Dream and Promise Act of 2019. This vote will bring  Dreamers, young immigrants who came to the country as children, as well  as individuals who have lived here lawfully for years under temporary  protected status or deferred enforced departure, another step closer to  being fully recognized as American.   Many of us, both inside and outside this room, have been working to  advance this legislation for almost two decades. It is hard to believe  that 18 years have passed since the Dream Act was first introduced, and  9 years have passed since the House last voted on it.   Yet, despite bipartisan support in Congress as well as the support of  almost 90 percent of the American people, we have thus far been unable  to get this bill enacted into law.  [[Page H4274]]    I am proud to stand here with so many colleagues who worked with  determination over the years to bring this bill to the floor, as well  as all the young people and their allies who persisted through setbacks  and never gave up on their call for lawful permanent residence.   Madam Speaker, our work has paid off. Today, I urge my colleagues to  support the American Dream and Promise Act.   In September 2017, President Trump announced the end of the Deferred  Action for Childhood Arrivals program, otherwise known as DACA, which  provided temporary relief from removal to approximately 800,000  Dreamers. Over the next few months, the administration announced plans  to terminate the TPS designation for six countries, as well as DED for  Liberia. These actions have upended the lives of hundreds of thousands  of Dreamers and TPS and DED holders.   They have come to the United States in different ways, and they have  had different opportunities once they arrived. But today, they are  united not only by the passage of time but also by the uncertainty of  the future. Congress has the power to bring certainty to their lives by  passing this act.   The bill provides a fair and reasonable opportunity for Dreamers to  apply for lawful permanent residence with tough eligibility standards  and discretion to consider unique situations on a case-by-case basis.  The TPS and DED holders must continue to meet the strict eligibility  requirements that already apply to them.   Based on comments made earlier during the rules debate, comments that  I assume may be repeated during this debate, I feel the need to remind  everyone just how tough this bill is.   To begin with, the bill applies criminal bars that apply to any other  immigrant seeking admission to the United States. It then adds to  current law by disqualifying anyone convicted of any felony or more  than two misdemeanors.    On top of that, it authorizes the Secretary to deny individuals who  pose a threat to public safety based on a single misdemeanor  conviction, a juvenile delinquency adjudication, or proof of gang- related activities.   This is a very tough bill. Anyone who poses a threat to public safety  is simply ineligible under this bill.   This legislation should not be controversial. The Dream Act has  enjoyed bipartisan support in the past, with many of the same  provisions. TPS and DED holders are integral parts of our communities  and have been contributing to our economy for years, if not decades.   On this point, I also want to stress the important economic benefits  that Dreamers and TPS and DED holders provide to our country.   Immigrants eligible for the American Dream and Promise Act own  215,400 homes in the United States and pay an estimated $2.5 billion in  annual mortgage payments. If these individuals were to lose their  homes, be deported, and default, it would certainly shock housing  markets around the country and cause serious damage to cities, States,  and the economy as a whole.   Eligible immigrants and their households currently contribute around  $17.4 billion per year in Federal taxes and $9.7 billion per year in  State and local taxes.   Annually, these households generate over $75 billion in spending  power. That money helps to fuel local economies, creating new jobs and  bringing new economic prosperity to everyone living and working with  H.R. 6 beneficiaries across the country.   Without this bill, these individuals would lose their status and be  kicked out of the workforce, creating a major hole in the American  economy.   That may be why the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has indicated it may  make this bill a key vote for its scoring purposes and why hundreds of  major business leaders are urging us to pass this bill in order to grow  the economy and bolster our global competitiveness.   We must set aside partisanship and move this bill forward so that  Dreamers and long-term TPS and DED recipients can finally have the  peace of mind they deserve and so that our country can have the  contributions that they are ready to make.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote for the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Clarke), the sponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal), the vice chair of the Immigration  Subcommittee, and a fierce proponent of this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), my colleague, the Speaker of  the House.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct a couple of things that have  been said in the course of this debate.   Unfortunately, there are those in our country who try and claim that  immigrants are criminals, and that is really incorrect. But for those  who have said that this bill was loose for people who have committed  serious crimes, it is simply not the case. We have tough restrictions  in this bill.   Under the bill, an applicant is disqualified if any one of the  following apply:   There is reason to believe the applicant is a national security risk;   The applicant has a felony conviction of any kind other than  immigration status related;   The applicant has a single misdemeanor conviction involving moral  turpitude with a sentence of more than 6 months, whether or not that  has been served;   An applicant has two misdemeanors involving moral turpitude,  regardless of sentence;   An applicant has more than two misdemeanors of any kind, excluding  offenses that should not bar anyone, like minor traffic offenses; and   The applicant has a single misdemeanor conviction for domestic  violence.   A lot has been said, I think, incorrectly, about the provision in the  bill that says the Secretary's authority to deny applicants who pose a  threat to public safety--and that is our failsafe in this--the  Secretary can deny an applicant if he determines, or she, that the  applicant poses a current threat to public safety, that somehow that is  unworkable. But that is not true.   Let's be clear. Members of Congress are the only ones who can  introduce bills and sign letters. But do we do every single aspect of  that? Of course not. We have staff who assist us.   That is how that would work in the Department of Homeland Security.  The staff would help, and they would prepare something for the  Secretary, who would not be able to delegate it. And this is how it has  worked in the Immigration and Nationality Act before.   I draw your attention to INA's 236(a), which is the mandatory  detention of suspected terrorists at habeas corpus and judicial review.  This section provides that this decision cannot be delegated, and yet  it is workable because a lot of the staff work is done to present to  the Secretary who, himself, must make that decision; similarly, with  public law 110-301, the Libyan Claims Resolution Act, and 8 U.S.C. 1522  that provides nondelegable activities.    Now, there has been discussion that somehow the language that we have  in the bill about databases means you can't use that evidence. That is  simply incorrect.   Mr. Speaker, if we had wanted to prevent the Department of Homeland  Security from using or referring to gang databases, we would have said  so. The bill would clearly state that DHS could not use, rely on, or  refer to gang databases. That is not what the bill says.   The bill says ``it shall not establish disqualifying gang  participation.'' It can be evidence, but it can't be the establishment  of that fact.   Now, why would that be the case? We value our law enforcement  community. They keep us safe. They are hardworking. But these databases  are populated by people way beyond law enforcement, people in school  police, school security. They can result in people being mistakenly  tagged as gang members when they are not.   I will give an example.   There was an audit done of California's gang database, CalGang. When  the auditors went through, they found out there were 42 individuals who  were under the age of 1 year old who had allegedly self-reported that  they were part of a gang. Obviously, that was incorrect. So we would  not want to make that the determining factor.   I want to mention a little bit about the comments that were made  about DUI. DUI is a very serious matter, and no one wants to see  individuals who are threats to public safety obtain relief under this  bill.   First, anyone who is convicted by an offense punishable by a maximum  term of imprisonment of more than 1 year is barred from relief. So  anyone who would commit a serious offense is barred.   If you have one conviction for DUI with a suspended license and you  knew your license was suspended, you have committed a crime of moral  turpitude, because section 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act  still applies.   Some have said that a single DUI conviction should be enough to  disqualify you. Well, we have provided for that as well. If the  Secretary finds that you pose a serious public safety threat, he can  deny your application.  [[Page H4291]]    I will just say this. There are Members of the House of  Representatives who have a single DUI. We didn't exile them from a  single DUI, and I don't think if someone has turned their life around,  we should exile them as well.   Now, I want to talk about the value of this bill.   It is interesting to hear the bill has been jammed, because we have  waited for 18 years for this moment to pass this bill.                                time  1745    Mr. Speaker, over 400 diverse organizations, associations, and  industry leaders support this bill, including United We Dream, NAACP,  National Organization for Women, Interfaith Immigration Coalition,  United States Chamber of Commerce, and National Education Association.   Yesterday, more than 100 business leaders, including Walmart, Koch  Industries, Coca-Cola, Starbucks, and General Motors all came out in  support of this bill. They had full-page ads in The New York Times,  asking us to please pass this bill.   H.R. 6 is the solution we have been waiting for. Passage of this  measure is long overdue. Dreamers and TPS and DED recipients do not  have the luxury of time. President Trump terminated DACA. He terminated  TPS for six countries. He extended DED only through March 2020.   While the courts have stopped the President on DACA and TPS, these  individuals are living on borrowed time.   We can vote on their futures now. To a great extent, we are deciding  their fates, and we are also deciding our fates. Are we the America  that made us great, who opened our doors to those who wanted to become  Americans with us, who understood that those who have done no wrong  should not receive punishment? I say that we are.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the American  Dream and Promise Act of 2019, and I yield back the balance of my time.
