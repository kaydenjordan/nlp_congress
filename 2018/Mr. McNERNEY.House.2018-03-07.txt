 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the ranking member, and  I thank the chairman for his work on this, but I am going to rise in  opposition to H.R. 1917, the BRICK Act.   This bill will delay the implementation of the EPA's final Brick and  Structural Clay Products rule and the final Clay Ceramic Manufacturing  rule by extending all compliance deadlines based on pending judicial  review.   So what does that mean? That means it will delay implementation until  judgment becomes final and not subject to review or appeal. This is a  blanket extension that could have lasting negative impacts on the  public's health.   Brick and clay plants, if unregulated, can be major sources of toxic  air pollutants like hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, and hazardous  metals, pollutants that are associated with a variety of acute and  chronic health effects, including cancer. It is estimated that the  final Brick and Clay MACT rule will reduce nationwide air toxics by  approximately 375 tons per year.   Last Friday, the OMB issued a report showing that regulations have  high benefit and low cost. The aggregate benefits of Federal  regulations is between $219 billion and $695 billion; whereas, the  aggregate costs are $59 billion to $88 billion. Many regulations spur  innovation that benefit the economy as well as human health.   Now, it is no surprise to me that this administration and the  Republicans are targeting air pollution regulations. The OMB noted that  EPA rules ``account for over 80 percent of the monetized benefits and  over 70 percent of the monetized costs'' of Federal regulation between  2006 and 2016.   Since regulations protect human health and safety and have more  benefits than costs for industry, I stand in opposition to bills like  this one that seek to undermine these protections. I ask my colleagues  to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1917.
