 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the lifetime  achievements of Angelo K. Tsakopoulos.   Mr. Tsakopoulos' story is a story of the American Dream. Angelo  immigrated to the United States from Greece at the age of 15. He worked  hard. He didn't have a whole lot but went into the real estate business  to help pay for his education at California State University,  Sacramento. He built a real estate company.   Angelo helped shape Sacramento over his life. The Sacramento Bee has  identified Mr. Tsakopoulos potentially as the most influential  Sacramentan since John Sutter. His contributions, not just to our  community but to philanthropy, to education, and to the arts are  outstanding.   Mr. Tsakopoulos also never forgot his roots in Greece. This Monday he  will receive lifetime recognition for his service to Hellenism. He  established multiple foundations and organizations to celebrate the  values and the culture of his homeland.   He also, through his family, continues to do public service through  his daughter Eleni who is our Lieutenant Governor in California. On  Monday, February 6, all of us in Sacramento, the United States, and all  Greek Americans recognize the contributions of Angelo Tsakopoulos and  his family; contributions to preserving Greek culture.
