 Mr. Speaker, on October 2, the Dade County Farm  Bureau is proud to honor Paul and Swanee DiMare, an agriculture  powerhouse couple hailing from our south Florida community.   For more than 90 years, the DiMare family has graced south Florida by  providing some of the best quality produce our Nation has to offer, so  much, in fact, that they have earned the title of Mr. and Mrs. Tomato.   But where some may know them for their tasty and nutritious products  alone, others know them for their world-class philanthropy and public  service. From protecting our beautiful botanical gardens, to advocating  for organizations like the Red Cross, Paul and Swanee continue to serve  as an inspiration to all those who call our slice of paradise home.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize this extraordinary couple, and  I thank Paul and Swanee for their tireless work in our community.                     Annual Miami Walk to End Alzheimer's     Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the Alzheimer's  Association 2018 Walk to End Alzheimer's in Miami-Dade, being held in  my congressional district on November 3.   According to the Alzheimer's Association, more than 5.7 million  Americans are battling this brutal condition, 200,000 of whom are under  the age of 65.                                time  1015    Moreover, this disease is the sixth leading cause of death in our  Nation. Sadly, Alzheimer's, currently, cannot be cured, cannot be  prevented, and cannot be slowed. That is why advocacy and awareness are  paramount.   Although scientific and medical advancements to fight the effects of  dementia have made significant progress, we must not, and we cannot,  rest. That  [[Page H9095]]  is why this walk is being held to remind us all that the struggle  continues. Day after day, we must continue to raise the benchmark and  ensure that progress toward effective treatment and a cure continue.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my south Florida community to soak up some  Sun--safely--on November 3 for a good cause, and participate in the  Alzheimer's Association Miami-Dade Walk. Together, we can take the  first step in a world without Alzheimer's.                     Raising Awareness of Alopecia Areata     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize September as  Alopecia Areata Awareness Month.   Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease, resulting in the loss of  hair on the body, affecting about 7 million Americans. Additionally, of  the 7 million Americans battling alopecia, almost 15 percent--or just  over 1 million--are under 12 years of age. This is because alopecia  often presents itself at an early stage in life, with no warning and no  prevention to be had. It appears on the skin, most often as one or more  small, round, smooth patches of hair loss on the scalp, and can  progress to total hair loss.   My constituent, Deirdre Nero, first informed me of the effects and  seriousness of alopecia. Deirdre, who has alopecia, is a legislative  liaison and secretary of the board for the National Alopecia Areata  Foundation. Earlier this month, Deirdre and her fellow NAAF  participants were on Capitol Hill advocating on behalf of a bill, H.R.  2925, that is called Legislation to Provide Coverage for Wigs As  Durable Medical Equipment under the Medicare Program. That bill title  says it all.   It is a commonsense reform bill that will make a simple change to the  definition of durable medical equipment under the Social Security Act  to include cranial prosthetics, alleviating large out-of-pocket  expenses for patients.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have championed this cause during my time  in Congress, and I am thankful for the work that the National Alopecia  Areata Foundation continues to do on behalf of all patients.   Furthermore, I humbly ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  join me in recognizing Alopecia Areata Awareness Month and support this  important legislation.                            ____________________
