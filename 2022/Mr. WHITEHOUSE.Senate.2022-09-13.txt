 Mr. President, before I start my planned remarks, let  me thank Senator Portman for his remarks and all his effort. There is  considerable bipartisan consensus about the need for support of  Ukraine's efforts. The mantle of freedom in the world right now is  carried by Ukraine against Russian oppression. I am delighted to have  been present for his remarks.   Very early on, there were a few of us here in the Senate who, on a  bipartisan basis, decided that the U.S. policy ought to, at a minimum,  contemplate the possibility of Ukrainian victory, that writing it off  was simply a bad mistake. At the time, it looked like it was a very  small prospect, but the courage of the Ukrainian military, as they have  pushed back in Kharkiv with counteroffensive and the abundant supply of  military hardware that they have received from the West has made what  seemed a fantastic, hopeful notion something that actually could be  real, and it could be real in a fairly short time.   I, again, thank Senator Portman for his remarks.    Mr. President, we revert now to the closing script,  and I will ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, the  Senate consider the follow nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 921,  1101, 1102, 1040, and 1042; that the Senate vote on the nominations en  bloc without intervening action or debate; that the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; and that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning  business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes  each.    Mr. President, I have four requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.
