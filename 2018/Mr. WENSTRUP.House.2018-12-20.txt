 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation at  hand, which includes the Retirement, Savings, and Other Tax Relief Act  of 2018, and the Taxpayer First Act of 2018.   Since the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 2.1 million jobs have  been created. More Americans are working. They are taking home more  money as a result of pro-growth policies like tax reform and cleaning  up an overly burdensome regulatory regime.   We can keep this momentum going by enacting reforms like the one  before us today. This package includes legislation to make it easier  for families to save for retirement, and make it easier for employers  to offer retirement plans to their employees.   I am a former employer. I know that employers want this for their  employees.   It also makes important structural changes to the IRS to ensure it is  oriented for taxpayer service, prevents abuses, and creates a more fair  appeals process.   This package would delay or repeal harmful health-related taxes,  including delays for the Cadillac tax and the medical device tax which,  I can tell you as a surgeon, is harmful for the advancement of medicine  on behalf of patients.   Also, this bill offers a full repeal of the excise tax on indoor  tanning services, which affects small businesses all over the country.                                time  1600    It gives Americans impacted by recent disasters much needed  flexibility to access their retirement savings, increases charitable  contributions, and helps businesses keep their employees on payroll as  they surmount these disasters.   Finally, it makes technical corrections to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,  thus ensuring that individuals and businesses can benefit from the  important reforms of the law, as intended.   Mr. Speaker, this package of bills continues our efforts to help  Americans save, help the economy grow, improve IRS operations, and keep  a nimble and smart Tax Code. So I encourage my colleagues to support  this legislation on behalf of all Americans of all generations.    Mr. Speaker, our Federal Government was founded for one  purpose: to fulfill the charges set forth in the Constitution,  establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common  defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of  liberty.   Lawmakers take an oath to uphold the Constitution. We fail in our  sworn duty if we refuse to ensure the sovereignty, security, and  wellbeing of this Nation through secure borders. The situation at the  border is a serious problem that demands our immediate attention. It  has been constantly brushed aside because somewhere along the way, our  conversation about border security got muddled.   The wall, border patrol, surveillance of human trafficking routes,  all of these have been recast exclusively into the context of  immigration policy.   Border security is, indeed, a part of immigration policy, but it is  much more than that. It is part of keeping drugs off our streets and  keeping Americans safe. Our porous borders can allow drugs, cartels,  and even terrorists into our Nation. An unsecure border makes it  impossible for us to enact meaningful immigration reform as we cannot  expect any legal system to work if we do not have control of who is  entering.   Funding for border security is not a political point. This is about  keeping America safe, keeping illicit drugs out of our country, and  protecting American families and our own precious lives.
