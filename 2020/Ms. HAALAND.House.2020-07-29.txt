 Madam Speaker, childcare is a vital part of economic  recovery.   I know what it is like to struggle to make ends meet as a parent. I  raised my daughter, Somah, on my own. And as a single mother working my  way through law school, it was very hard to find childcare. In fact, I  could never afford childcare.   When she was 2, I found a preschool where I could volunteer in  exchange for lower tuition so that she would have a place to learn  while I worked. It was helpful and shows just how much New Mexicans are  willing to support each other. But that should not be the reality for  parents and kids across the country.   During the pandemic, our State has helped childcare providers stay  open by paying licensed providers a premium, but many of them still had  to lay off employees because fewer children were showing up.   As we look to a future when more parents get back to working outside  their home, the childcare industry needs Federal support to safely  adapt to the new normal and welcome families and employees back. That  is why I am supporting the Child Care for Economic Recovery Act.   This bill funds upgrades in childcare centers that are needed to meet  new health and safety measures for the pandemic; it provides refundable  tax credits for parents to return to their jobs; and, most importantly,  it ensures a satisfactory, affordable, and guaranteed future for the  childcare industry.   Madam Speaker, by investing in the childcare industry, we invest in  our economic future. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.
