 Mr. Speaker, few people have the gift to bring  people together, but Kay Arthur is one of these special individuals.  Her passion for people and deeply rooted faith is illuminated through  her television, radio, and online programs in which she uses God's Word  to reach over 75 million households in over 30 countries.   Kay is a four-time ECPA Christian Book Award-winning author and the  cofounder of Precept Ministries International, and she will soon be  recognized once again as the recipient of the Scenic City Women's  Network Lydia Impact Award.   An institution in the Chattanooga community, the vision of the Scenic  City Women's Network is to encourage, equip, and energize Christian  women. As part of this vision, the Lydia Award is a special honor for a  woman who emulates the attributes of Lydia in the Bible: a devout  woman, a seeking woman, a hospitable woman, and one who is fervent in  spirit and serves the Lord.   Mr. Speaker, that woman is Kay Arthur.   I would like to share a story that illustrates her servant heart:   Being a high-profile Bible teacher and author has never kept Kay from  striving to meet the needs of whoever crosses her path. From waiters to  cab drivers, Kay Arthur seeks to truly meet people where they are, but  never leave them without a pathway to hope.   One chilly afternoon, Kay and her son David were driving back to the  office after a lunch appointment. Kay noticed a lady in a wheelchair on  the side of the road. David was instructed to promptly pull over. Kay  sprang out of the car and approached the woman. After a quick  conversation, Kay took off her full-length winter coat, wrapped it  around this lady and shared that Jesus loves her, and the coat is a  sign of His gracious love to her.   Kay never meets a stranger, no matter if in Chattanooga or a country  across the world. She loves people, and she loves her Lord Jesus. She  consistently seeks to demonstrate her love with kind words and actions.  She truly has the servant heart of our Savior, Jesus Christ.   Mr. Speaker, as you have just heard, Kay, like Lydia, has committed  her life to her faith and exemplifies what it is to be a woman of God.   I would like to congratulate Kay Arthur on receiving the prestigious  Lydia Impact Award and thank her for her blessing our Nation with her  Christian heart and service.                            ____________________
