 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5738, the Lactation Spaces for  Veteran Moms Act. One of my priorities is strengthening services for  women veterans. This bill would do that by ensuring that VA medical  facilities have safe, clean, private spaces for them to use for  breastfeeding.   VA is already required to create these spaces for VA employees. It is  only right that we give veteran mothers who use VA facilities the  ability to take care of their families this way as well.   I am grateful to Congresswoman Luria and Congresswoman Herrera  Beutler for their work on this legislation. I urge all of my colleagues  to join me in support of it today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7335, the MST Claims  Coordination Act. This bill requires VBA to provide claimants with  outreach materials on VHA services for military sexual trauma survivors  during the benefits claim process.   Additionally, this legislation will allow the veterans to opt into a  requirement that the VBA notify VHA when the veteran receives a  disability exam or board hearing for a claim related to MST. This will  allow the VHA to be better informed about the events in the claims  process that may cause distress to the MST survivor in order to improve  their care.   Veteran claimants have reported that they are unaware of the services  VHA provides to assist veterans who experienced MST, regardless of  their service-connected disability status.   It is critical that VA improves coordination between VHA and VBA to  better support survivors of MST.   I appreciate Congresswoman Luria, the Chairwoman of the Disability  Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, for introducing this  bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6961, the Dignity for  MST Survivors Act, which was introduced by Congressman Mrvan, the  chairman of the Subcommittee on Technology Modernization.   All veterans should receive an accurate decision the first time they  file a claim, especially if the claim is related to MST. If the VA must  deny that claim, this should be communicated in a compassionate manner.   Moreover, the VA disability examiners should be sensitive to the  needs of our veterans who are undergoing an exam for a condition  related to MST.   This bill would make several improvements to the MST claims process,  including enhancing training on MST for adjudicators at the Board of  Veterans' Appeals; improving decision notices for claims related to  MST; and, requiring the VA to establish standards to ensure that  disability examiners perform exams related to MST using trauma-informed  practices.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6064, and I thank  Congressman Nehls, Congresswoman Luria, and the leaders of the  Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, for  introducing this bill.   This bill would require the VA to partner with the National Academies  to conduct an independent review of the VA's delivery of benefits for  claims related to MST.   The National Academies would also provide recommendations that the VA  could implement to improve the disability claims process for MST  survivors.                                time  1300    For decades, the National Academies has led research into the VA  disability benefits process, including reports on the health effects of  toxic exposures and VA's handling of traumatic brain injury claims.   This study is needed to help Congress and VA better understand what  changes need to be made in this process to ensure that veterans receive  quality, timely, and compassionate consideration of their disability  claims.   For too long, we have heard that the MST claims process can be  insensitive. This is unacceptable, and VA must do better.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2724, the VA Peer  Support Enhancement for MST Survivors Act, which is sponsored by the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Delgado).   Veterans who file disability claims based on MST report that the  process can be difficult and emotional. Peer support specialists can  help these veterans through this stressful time. Peer support  specialists provide critical help to veterans.   Unfortunately, many veterans who file a claim for conditions based on  MST may not be aware of, or eligible for, VHA peer support services.  This bill would better ensure that these claimants are eligible for  peer support services or are connected with an MST coordinator at VHA.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 4089, the Veterans Rapid  Retraining Assistance Program Restoration and Recovery Act.   One of the few positive provisions that was enacted as part of the  American Rescue Plan was the creation of the Veteran Rapid Retraining  Assistance Program, or VRRAP. This program authorizes 1 year of GI  Bill-style education benefits for training for an in-demand occupation  for unemployed veterans.   VRRAP was originally authored during the peak of COVID veteran  unemployment by our former colleague Dr. Phil Roe and Congressman  Levin. I was pleased to introduce the bill this year and was glad that  it was made part of the American Rescue Plan.   Under this program, eligible veterans only have one chance to  participate in VRRAP. This became a problem for hundreds of students at  Future Tech Career Institute in Chicago when the training provider lost  their ability to administer GI Bill benefits earlier this year.   If those students had been using a traditional GI Bill program, they  would be eligible to have their benefits restored to continue their  studies at another school. However, with VRRAP, that was not possible.   This bill will fix that issue, authorizing VRRAP users to have  another chance to use the program if their school closes or loses GI  Bill approval in the middle of the semester.   While I am very supportive of the policy in this bill, I do have  concerns about the cost. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated  the cost of this bill to be at $6 million in mandatory costs over 10  years.   For whatever reason, the Senate chose not to offset these costs  before passing this bill. This decision is, unfortunately, not  surprising, as we have seen repeatedly that the Democrat majority in  both the House and the Senate loves to ignore costs and increase  spending.   Their overstimulation of the economy has led to soaring inflation and  staggering price increases that Americans see every day. We must stop  mortgaging our children's and grandchildren's futures. Our current  level of spending is simply not sustainable.   That being said, I am not going to stand in the way of providing  restored benefits to unemployed veterans who need our help in this  struggling economy. That is why I am going to reluctantly support the  passage of this bill today. However, I caution my friends that this  practice of un-offset spending must end.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6052, which requires VA  employees to receive training on the work that the VA inspector general  does. This training will help VA employees understand how to recognize  and report instances of waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as their  responsibility to comply with the investigations.   VA's budget request for fiscal year 2023 is over $300 billion.  Oversight of this Department's massive budget is a major priority of  mine. This commonsense bill would lead to better oversight by informing  all VA employees of their responsibility to identify and report fraud,  waste, and abuse.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2533, the MAMMO for Veterans  Act. This bill requires VA to develop a plan to improve breast imaging  services. It also establishes a breast imaging telehealth pilot program  to better serve women veterans in areas where VA does not have  significant capacity, including rural areas.   It also requires VA to upgrade breast imaging services at the VA  facilities by using three-dimensional imaging and provide updated  guidelines and genetic counseling for veterans diagnosed with breast  cancer. Early detection is the key to fighting all forms of cancer, to  include breast cancer.   VA should make every effort to ensure veterans with breast cancer  receive cutting-edge care, both in screening and treatment.   I appreciate Senator Tester and my friend and fellow veteran,  Congresswoman Miller-Meeks, for their work on this important bill. It  has my full support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa  (Mrs. Miller-Meeks), my good friend.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2102, the Dr. Kate Hendricks  Thomas Supporting Expanded Review for Veterans in Combat Environment,  or SERVICE Act.   Dr. Thomas was a marine--oorah--veteran and a public health  professional, who was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer following  her deployment to Iraq.   She was just 38 years old when she was diagnosed. She was just 42  years old when she died of breast cancer on April 5 of this year.   My thoughts and prayers are with her family and loved ones.   Dr. Thomas' passing is a tragic reminder of how high the stakes are  when it comes to better serving veterans suffering from toxic exposure.   Both VA and DOD have conducted studies that indicate that women who  have served in the military have an elevated risk for breast cancer.   The bill that bears Dr. Thomas' name would help more toxic-exposed  veterans like her have access to breast imaging services from the VA,  regardless of their enrollment status.   The bill is sponsored by Senator Boozman of Arkansas, and I thank him  for his work on this legislation. I also thank Congresswoman Miller- Meeks, the House sponsor, who has been a strong champion for it as  well. Dr. Miller-Meeks is a veteran herself, and women veterans have no  better advocate than she.   I am proud to support the bill today, and I hope that all of my  colleagues will join me.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa  (Mrs. Miller-Meeks).    Mr. Speaker, as we have noticed today, this bill and other  bills deal specifically with the promise we have made, I have made, and  I know that Chairman Takano as well has made, to try to make things  better for our women veterans. We also had the bills that dealt with  the sexual trauma. These are issues that are vitally important. I  appreciate what we have worked on today. We want to make sure that we  provide for those needs.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this piece of  legislation along with all the others that we have moved today, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
