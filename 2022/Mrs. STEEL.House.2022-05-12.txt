 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of Orange County  families to share their frustration and outrage that they are feeling  because of the skyrocketing gas prices in this country.   While this administration refuses to embrace full energy independence  and instead continues relying on foreign dictators for oil, southern  Californians are paying more for gas than anywhere else in the country.  On top of that, despite what could be a $68 billion surplus, Governor  Newsom and Sacramento Democrats have decided to raise gas taxes on July  1. My constituents simply can't afford another day under the policies  that are forcing them to pay more while getting less.   Enough is enough.   Whether it is here in Washington, D.C., or in Sacramento, President  Biden and Governor Newsom need to commit to unleashing energy  independence today. The people of this great country need relief today.                            ____________________
