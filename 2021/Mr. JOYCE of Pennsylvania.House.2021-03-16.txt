 Madam Speaker, despite what the Biden  administration would like the American people to believe, our Nation is  facing a catastrophe on the southern border.   Last month alone, U.S. Border Protection officers encountered more  than 100,000 migrants attempting to cross the border illegally. This is  a 173 percent increase from last February.   Right now, the Office of Refugee Resettlement shelters that house  unaccompanied migrant children are reaching capacity. Our border agents  are being diverted from their posts to care for record numbers of  teenagers and children who are illegally crossing our border.   This escalating crisis is rooted right here in Washington, D.C., more  than 1,700 miles away from that border. As we witness unprecedented  groups of migrants reaching the United States, there is no question  that the President's weak border security stance has heightened this  so-called challenge.   By reversing the Trump administration's actions to bolster security  on the southern border and halting construction of the border wall, the  current administration is sending a clear message to the world that  America's border, unfortunately, is wide open.   Innocent people, and cartels and human traffickers who prey upon  them, pay attention to what we say here in Washington. Words have  consequences. Rhetoric has ramifications.   What is happening on the southern border is both a humanitarian and  security crisis. It is simply inhumane for politicians to incentivize  the dangerous trek across Central America to the southern border.   Those who attempt the journey face treacherous conditions, gang  violence, and unthinkable danger. As my friend, Republican leader Kevin  McCarthy, said at the border just yesterday, ``This is human  heartbreak.''   As the situation worsens, the limited resources on the border are  being pulled away from protecting the American people. The Biden  administration is prioritizing illegal immigrants over the American  people. As U.S. Customs and Border Protection leadership shifts to  caring for migrants, there are fewer officers focusing on apprehending  threats.   This is not only a human trafficking crisis; it is also a drug  trafficking crisis. The illicit drugs, including deadly  methamphetamine, cocaine, and fentanyl, that come across the porous  southern border are killing Pennsylvanians in the streets of Altoona,  Johnstown, Bedford, Chambersburg, Gettysburg, and Somerset, and  throughout my district.   Just this weekend, Border Patrol agents apprehended two individuals  attempting to smuggle nearly 8 pounds of methamphetamine across the  border. By preventing these drugs from reaching American communities,  we likely saved lives. What would have happened if these suspects  hadn't been caught?   Clearly, we need more, and not less, security on our southern border.   As our Nation continues to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress  cannot afford to stand back and allow the border crisis to get even  worse. We need safer, stronger, and more secure communities in  Pennsylvania and across the country.   Here is the truth: The border crisis has consequences beyond the  border. Inaction is not the correct action. Border security is national  security.                            ____________________
