 Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from  Colorado. He does chair a subcommittee that I am a part of. We had a  great hearing last week, talking about China and the South China Sea  issues, as he mentioned. We did talk about North Korea and the need for  this summit between President Xi and President Trump to  [[Page S2172]]  include a discussion of how China could be more constructive, including  the possibility of additional sanctions on North Korea to try to get  some sort of pressure on the North Koreans to do the right thing and  back off their nuclear program.   We also talked about trade. To level the playing field, we need  trade, particularly allowing U.S. companies to have the ability to do  what Chinese companies can do here in this country. And my colleague  talked a little about that this evening.   I will say--because he mentioned the issue of opioids--there is  another topic that I hope President Trump will raise with President Xi,  and that is this issue of synthetic heroin being produced in China,  which actually comes into our communities. In Denver, CO, or in  Columbus, OH, we have through the mail system these poisons coming in,  synthetic heroin coming through the mail from China.   We are told by law enforcement officials that most of these  laboratories are in China. These are evil scientists in China who are  making this incredibly potent, dangerous drug. It is 30 to 50 times  more powerful than heroin. Three flakes of it can kill you. They are  putting it into packages and sending it into our communities through  the mail.   It is a topic that I hope comes up--in addition to the very important  ones that my colleague has raised and we talked about in the hearing  last week--which is: How do you get China to actually crack down on  these laboratories? And how do you get them to schedule these drugs so  that they are illegal in China, to ensure the inputs into the  laboratories and the final drug itself?   By the way, the Chinese should have a strong interest in this  because, I will guarantee you, there are people in China who are also  becoming addicted to opioids because of this inexpensive, incredibly  dangerous synthetic heroin that is being promoted by these Chinese  scientists.   My hope is that this will be a successful summit and among the very  important issues raised is this opioid issue, which is so important to  our communities.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I also wanted to talk briefly, if I  could, about the legislation we just passed, S. 89. It has to do with  the Delta Queen. The Delta Queen is a wooden ship that is very  important to my community of Cincinnati. It is part of our Queen City  heritage.   The boat was actually in Cincinnati during my childhood. From 1946  until 1985, it called Cincinnati home. It is a beautiful paddle  wheeler, and people love to get on it and go down the Mississippi  River.   It is no longer docked in Cincinnati, which is why the folks in  Missouri were interested in this legislation tonight too. We just had a  big vote, over 80 votes in favor of simply saying, for the first time  since 2008: Let's allow people to spend the night on this boat and go  overnight on this boat, despite the fact that there is legislation  called the 1966 Safety at Sea law, which prohibits wooden boats of a  certain size from carrying overnight passengers. Let's make an  exception here because the Delta Queen is willing to undergo the kind  of renovations that are necessary to make it safe. It also requires new  safety requirements for the Delta Queen going forward.   So I really appreciate the fact this vote was taken tonight. It is  about a treasured part of our history. It is also about the economy  because it will produce tourism and economic advancements all along the  river everywhere the river stops, including in my hometown of  Cincinnati. We are going to welcome the Delta Queen back if this  legislation can be enacted into law.   It is now going over to the House. It is in committee there. We hope  that the House will do as the Senate did tonight and pass this  legislation.   This is my button. It says ``Save the Delta Queen,'' which I am not  going to wear on the floor of the Senate because of the rules. It  doesn't mean I don't care.   I thank my colleagues tonight for helping us to be able to get this  legislation through.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to talk briefly about a nomination  that is coming before us this week. This is for Elaine Duke to be the  Deputy Homeland Security Secretary.   This is an incredibly important job. Some of you remember the  Homeland Security Department was made up of about 23 different  departments and agencies coming together. It is a huge management  challenge. The key job of the Deputy Secretary is to try to manage all  of that.   We are very fortunate that Elaine Duke is willing to step forward and  take on this responsibility. My hope is that we will have a bipartisan  vote here on the floor of the Senate for her confirmation and that we  do it quickly this week because they need her there.   She came before our Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs last month. We had a very productive hearing. I had the honor  of introducing her to the committee because she has Ohio roots. We are  very proud of those Ohio roots.   She has had a long, distinguished career all across the country in  the Federal Government, but she still calls Ohio home, and much of her  family continues to reside in Ohio. Her dad, Frank Costanzo, is a  first-generation American who still lives in Cleveland, OH. I have also  known her uncle, Dominick Costanzo, for over 25 years. He is a friend  and a neighbor. Boy, he is very proud of his niece, as is her whole  family.   This family has instilled in her a midwestern work ethic that you see  in the great work she has done for the Federal Government over the past  28 years. She has worked as a senior member of various administrations.  We are really fortunate that she is willing to now continue to serve.   She started her career as a GS-7 contract specialist for the U.S. Air  Force. Over the next 28 years, she assumed bigger and bigger  responsibilities in the Air Force, the Navy, the Federal Railroad  Administration, the Smithsonian, and finally, the Department of  Homeland Security.   In 2008, she was confirmed unanimously by this Senate to serve as the  Under Secretary for Management at DHS. In this latest role, she, of  course, was a key member of the DHS leadership team for both Secretary  Chertoff and Secretary Napolitano, and they strongly support her.   She has earned a reputation for being an expert on issues of  contracting, on acquisitions, on procurement, on property management,  on organizational change, and on human resources. All of these, as I  said earlier, are key issues right now at the Department of Homeland  Security, so she will help it to be managed better, which will protect  all of us.   Serving in these administrations--both Republican and Democrat--she  did earn the respect of folks from both sides of the aisle. I find it  interesting that all five previously confirmed DHS Deputy Secretaries  have unanimously and strongly recommended her confirmation--all five of  the previously confirmed ones. They said in their letter:         Elaine is extraordinarily well-qualified to serve in the       position for which she has now been nominated. . . . Elaine       knows DHS. She has been a senior leader at DHS under two       presidents. She sets an unwavering standard of excellence for       all who consider themselves committed to public service.    I look forward to having this vote. I hope we will have resounding  support on a bipartisan basis for the nomination.   Secretary Kelly is doing a good job. General Kelly has an incredibly  distinguished career. We are fortunate that he has stepped up as  Secretary also. He needs her. He needs his deputy in place to help him  run the Department, and the men and women serving in DHS today need her  on the job.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
