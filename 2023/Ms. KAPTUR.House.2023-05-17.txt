 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to an  executive branch decision that will have a significant negative impact  on the U.S. domestic solar industry, including in northwest Ohio, the  home of the largest domestic solar production platform on this  continent.   Last week, the U.S. Treasury issued initial guidance allowing solar  project developers to qualify for a 10 percent domestic content bonus,  even if the solar panels they use are made with foreign silicon wafers,  97 percent of which are produced in--guess where--China.   The new interpretation of the domestic content bonus established as  part of the Inflation Reduction Act squanders a rare and critical  opportunity to spur the renaissance of an end-to-end domestic solar  manufacturing supply chain. It also ultimately rewards those who cut  corners, offshore U.S. jobs, and buy cheaper subcomponents produced in  China.   This administration must not allow China to undercut domestic  manufacturers and American workers, and we all know how that is done  with China's predatory practices.   Take steel. What China does is produce four times what the globe  consumes annually in steel. Then they strategically dump it, including  here, and drive down prices and drive out domestic manufacturing. We  know the gig. We can't accept it.   Giving additional tax benefits to predatory practices and those who  strategically cut corners to undermine fair trade rewards their bad  behavior.   When a product is given the benefit of being called American made,  that should include all steps and stages in the production process and  its supply chain, including those silica-based chips.   ``Made in the USA'' means made in the USA. The Biden administration  should pay attention.                            ____________________
