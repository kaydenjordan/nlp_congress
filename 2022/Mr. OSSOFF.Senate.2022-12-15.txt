 Madam President, today it is with great pleasure that I  honor a superb Army noncommissioned officer and legislative liaison.  After 2 years of exemplary service with the Army Office of the Chief,  Legislative Liaison, SGM Nicholas J. Stokely was selected to serve as  the next battalion command sergeant major for the 96th Civil Affairs  Battalion, Special Operations (Airborne), at Fort Bragg, NC. He is no  stranger to positions of trust and authority as he currently serves as  the legislative assistant to the 16th Sergeant Major of the Army. He  will assume responsibility for this new position in June.   On this occasion, I believe it is appropriate to recognize Sergeant  Major Stokely's distinguished 25-year career spent serving the  interests of the American people, whether here in the halls of Congress  or out in the field with his boots on the ground. He is a native of  Fountain Inn, SC. It is there that he first began his military service  as an infantryman in the South Carolina National Guard in 1997.  Sergeant Major Stokely enlisted in the Active-Duty Army in February  2002 and served in numerous leadership positions while stationed at  Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State.   In 2006, he donned the iconic hat of the U.S. Army drill sergeant,  helping train young men and women in preparation for the rigors of  serving in the Army. Sergeant Major Stokely has excelled in every job  the Army has asked him to take on, and true to form, he was selected as  the 2007 Infantry Training Brigade Drill Sergeant of the Year at Fort  Benning, GA. This is indicative of how he approaches his job.   In 2009, Sergeant Major Stokely began a new chapter in his career by  completing the Civil Affairs Specialist Course at Fort Bragg and  joining the ranks of Special Forces operators. He subsequently served  in every leadership position possible while assigned to the 95th Civil  Affairs Brigade. He then went on to serve as an instructor and course  manager at the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and  School.   It is clear the Army has consistently relied upon Sergeant Major  Stokely for his exceptional leadership. He has deployed on numerous  occasions in support of America's national defense. Sergeant Major  Stokely has deployed in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring  Freedom, the European Reassurance Initiative, and European Deterrence  Initiative with multiple tough assignments within Special Operations  units across the Asian and European continents.   In 2019, Sergeant Major Stokely arrived on Capitol Hill, serving as  the defense fellow for Representative Jason Crow of Colorado's Sixth  District. From there, he did exceptional work liaising on the Army's  Senate Liaison Division staff before his selection as a legislative  assistant. In each of these positions, his primary responsibility was  to help continue and strengthen Army relationships across Congress.  [[Page S7247]]  Over the past 2 years, Sergeant Major Stokely has traveled all over the  world leading congressional and staff delegations doing just that.   Now, he will continue his distinguished Army career, returning to  lead men and women. I am thankful for his service and sacrifice. On  behalf of Congress, I wish him, his wonderful wife Kritina, and three  beautiful children Cody, Cailynn, and Kinslee all the best.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S7247, December 15, 2022, in the first column, the  following appears: Now, he will continue his distinguished Army  career, returning to lead men and women.
