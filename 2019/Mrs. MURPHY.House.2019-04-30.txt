 Mr. Speaker, there is a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela  and it is man-made.   My view is simple. The people of Venezuela will not prosper as long  as the Maduro regime remains in power. It has proven itself to be  cruel, incompetent, and antidemocratic.   Ideally, the regime will go peacefully, but it must go.   The United States cannot be passive. We must stand behind the proud  Venezuelan patriots who have taken to the streets and are struggling to  reclaim their country from the regime that is destroying it. We must be  ready to support these brave men and women with all elements of  American power, always working alongside our partners in Latin America.   The Venezuelan people need to know that we have their backs. If the  Maduro regime targets its own citizens with violence, it should be  prepared to suffer the consequences.   To the Maduro regime, I say ``enough,'' ``basta.'' To the people of  Venezuela, I say ``be strong,'' ``fuerza''; ``we are with you,''  ``estamos con ustedes.''                            ____________________
