 Mr. Speaker, the House Appropriations Committee has the  distinction of being the only congressional committee enumerated in  Article I of the Constitution.  [[Page H5176]]    It is our job to allocate funding across the Federal Government to  best serve the American people. To put it more simply, it is our job to  solve problems.   That is why I wanted to take an opportunity to call attention to some  of the problems that the committee has worked to solve over the past  few weeks.   The gun violence epidemic has devastated communities across our  country, including my own. And that is why I am proud that the Labor,  Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies  Appropriations bill for the upcoming fiscal year has set aside funding  for the first time for $25 million for the CDC to study and develop  solutions for this epidemic.   The bill also makes meaningful investments in combating the opioid  crisis that has torn far too many families apart, increasing funding  for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.   It also ramps up funding to protect title X family planning, helping  low-income families access the healthcare that they need.   These are only a few of the ways that the House Appropriations  Committee has worked to provide real, tangible results to lead to  better health outcomes for the American people.   I am proud of the work the committee has done, and I look forward to  our continued work.                            ____________________
