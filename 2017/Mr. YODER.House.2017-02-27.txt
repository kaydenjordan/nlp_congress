 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight, heartbroken, with my friends  and colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, to honor the life and  memory of Srinivas Kuchibhotla, who was shot and killed last week in my  district, as well as in support for Alok Madasani, who was injured, and  Ian Grillot, whose heroism prevented this senseless tragedy from being  much worse.   I ask that my colleagues in the Chamber please join me for a moment  of silence.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Guests in the gallery and Members will  please rise for a moment of silence.    Mr. Speaker, the man who perpetrated the attack in my  district last week was filled with hate. He does not represent anything  we believe in as Kansans and as Americans. Last night, our community  sent the strong message that love will overcome hate.   Thousands of concerned citizens in my district came together to  support one another and our growing and vibrant Indian community in  this time of great tragedy. We showed the world that our diverse  political and religious views are what make our community and our  country great.   Mr. Speaker, in addition to this moment of silence, let us renew our  commitment to treating each other with respect and embracing civility  in our public discourse.                            ____________________
