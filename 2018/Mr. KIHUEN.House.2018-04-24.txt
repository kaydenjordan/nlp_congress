 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of  Patricia ``Pati'' Mestas.   Pati was a good mother to her three children, eight grandchildren,  and one great-grandchild.   Patricia was a retired gas station and convenience store worker who  loved country music and traveling. Patricia would go to almost every  country show within driving distance of her house. One of her favorite  artists was Jason Aldean, and she was excited to see him perform at the  Route 91 festival on October 1 in Las Vegas.   Patricia loved to laugh and smile. She had a fun-loving spirit and  was young at heart. Patricia is remembered for being outgoing, likable,  and being sensitive to other people's concerns and problems.   I would like to extend my condolences to Patricia Mestas' family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
