 Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about  several amendments I am working on in relation to the Commerce,  Justice, Science, and Related Agencies; the Agriculture; the Interior  and Environment, and Related Agencies; and the Transportation, Housing  and Urban Development, and Related Agencies appropriations bills that  this body will be working on shortly.   The first amendment I am offering to the legislation addresses a very  serious issue; that being the rising scourge of methamphetamine around  the country.   Methamphetamine--meth--use is something we talked a lot about a  decade ago. Conversations turned to opioid abuse in this country--and  rightfully so--and focused on opioids, but unfortunately meth use is  now increasing dramatically in States like Colorado as we continue to  address the opioid epidemic.   When I traveled across Colorado over the summer and last week and  through the August work period, I heard from rural sheriffs across the  State who were especially concerned about the severe impact that meth  was having on our small communities. Headlines this summer and as  recently as this week talked about the increase in meth use across  Colorado and the country.   From 2011 to 2018, treatment admissions for meth across Colorado  increased by nearly 40 percent. In 2018, 318 people died in Colorado  from meth overdoses. That is a 750-percent increase over 10 years. From  1999 to 2018, there has been a 1,450-percent increase in meth deaths in  Denver alone. In 2018, which was just last year, the Denver Police made  nearly 1,500 meth-related arrests. Indeed, there were more meth arrests  in Denver than there were arrests for heroin and cocaine combined.   Meth causes property damage. It damages our families. It can cause,  certainly, permanent damage to the individual who is using meth, and it  causes tremendous harm to families. In Utah, just in August, nearly  $2.2 million worth of methamphetamine was confiscated--seized--in the  State of Utah that was heading to Colorado. That $2.2 million was  enough meth to provide 1.1 million individual doses in Colorado. It was  on its way, and it would have done great harm.   I have introduced an amendment that would add $1 million to the COPS  Anti-Methamphetamine Program. This $1 million increase would allow one  more fully funded grant to go to an area, to a State, to a drug program  to help reduce and to break up this cycle of meth.   We have heard from the people in Colorado. We have heard from the  sheriffs. We have heard from our communities to do more. I believe this  amendment does more to help to address the epidemic of meth and the  lives it is shattering in Colorado, and I hope my colleagues will be  able to support this issue.   In particular, I thank Senator Daines, Senator Tester, Senator  Gillibrand, Senator Baldwin, and Senator Jones, who have all joined me  in adding $1 million, fully paid for and offset within the bill, in  order to help combat this epidemic of meth in our country and certainly  in our States like Colorado.   Another amendment I have been working on is the bulletproof vest  amendment. We have seen far too many attacks on our law enforcement  over the past several years. This legislation would provide a $1.1  billion fund for our Nation's law enforcement officers with type 3  bulletproof vests. These vests are capable of stopping more powerful  rifle ballistics and, therefore, would allow more officers to come home  at the end of the day from their service. That is what we need to be  focusing on--how to protect the men and women in blue in our  communities.   I am proud to have joined legislation earlier this year that has been  signed into law that permanently reauthorizes the Bulletproof Vest  Partnership Grant Program, and I hope we continue to build and offer  our support to those who defend that thin blue line.   The crown jewel of our conservation programs, the Land and Water  Conservation Fund, has benefited Colorado and this country so  significantly over the past several decades. It is something that has  affected every State in the country in our being able to preserve and  protect some of our most pristine environments across this great land.  Last spring, we were able to work together in a bipartisan effort to  permanently authorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund.   This legislation, which is the amendment I will be offering to the  bill, would fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund. So, while  we have done a great thing in permanently authorizing the Land and  Water Conservation Fund, we need to fully fund the Land and Water  Conservation  [[Page S6228]]  Fund. This amendment would do just that and fully fund the Land and  Water Conservation Fund.   Why is this important?   The outdoor economy, that of protecting our public lands, is so  critical to the State of Colorado. The outdoor economy alone in  Colorado generates $28 billion in consumer spending and $2 billion in  State and local tax revenue. It employs close to 230,000 people just in  Colorado alone, which makes Colorado the year-round destination for  visitors. If you are interested in skiing, there are already 40 inches  of snow in Summit County, and several ski resorts have opened up  already. It is snowing right now in Colorado, so this amendment is all  the more important as people look to our State for the continued  enjoyment of the great outdoors.   I have a bipartisan amendment with seven of my colleagues--Senators  Bennet, Daines, Tester, Burr, Heinrich, Collins, and Shaheen--that will  fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund for fiscal year 2020,  and I hope this Chamber will support the legislation.   I am also working on an amendment that will address the ski area fees  that our ski resorts pay to the Federal Government in order to operate  on public lands and have their ski runs on public lands. Many times,  the ski resorts, the ski areas, are the largest employers in our  mountain communities and contribute significantly to the economy and to  the health and stability of our local communities.   There are 122 of our ski areas that operate on National Forest System  lands. They generate, roughly, $37 million in rental fees for the  Treasury. Yet staffing levels for those very recreation programs are  40-percent lower than they were in the year 2000. Just as more and more  people are enjoying our public lands, we see fewer and fewer people who  are employed by the Federal Government to deal with those public lands,  to process the permitting needs, and to address the needs of our public  lands.   Fire borrowing has been an issue that has gobbled up some of the  funding that has helped manage our forests. We have put a bipartisan  fix in place that will no longer allow that money to be gobbled up, but  we need to find a solution as to the ski area fee retention as well so  we can allow that money to stay within the forest in which it is  generated.   Now that we have the fire borrowing fix, we can put the ski area fee  bill in place and have even more dollars returned to the forest from  which those fees are generated so we can address the staffing issues  and other complex issues we face in our national forests. This bill  alone would allow a portion of that $37 million to be returned to the  forests from which they were generated. That means more timely permit  application processing at the Forest Service and better customer  service from those in the ski areas that are trying to accommodate even  more and more people who visit our great ski areas.   I am also working on an amendment to the legislation that deals with  RTD, which is our public transit system in Denver, and the Front Range.   Years ago, the Department of Transportation was working on an effort  that refunded some programs in Colorado. The RTD, more than 20 years  early, had basically paid off the loan on one of these projects. The  RTD was told it would be reimbursed by the Department of Transportation  if it paid this off. Unfortunately, even though it has paid it off  early, it has not been reimbursed.   If you look at the effort and the project it accomplished with this  loan, the Denver Union Station project is one of the highlights of  urban renewal in the country. The RTD got the loan successfully paid  off early--a great success. Now it needs that money back in order to  continue investing in Colorado. I am working with Senator Bennet to  make sure this money gets back to Colorado, which is one of the  amendments we have filed.    The National Institute of Standards and Technology is  one of the Nation's premier research agencies in the Federal  Government. Colorado is lucky to house the second-largest contingent of  NIST staff in Boulder, where they work on issues like  telecommunications, biosciences, forensics, and quantum information  science and technology.   NIST's Boulder campus, and their affiliated NIST/JILA partnership,  has won three Nobel Prizes and three National Medals of Science. These  preeminent experts were charged with continuing to build on the  successes in the National Quantum Initiative Act, which passed into law  just this last Congress.   But in order to remain competitive globally, competing against  countries like China, the United States has to continue its robust  investments in science and research and development, and that is going  to require investing in our science facilities as well.   When I was able to travel to the NIST facilities in Boulder, I  witnessed a trash can and giant trash bag used to collect rainwater  from a leaky roof. Nobel scientists--prize-winning scientists working  there. It is harmful to think that it is okay for this great country to  have Nobel Prize-winning scientists working in a facility that can't  even keep them dry because the roof leaks.   While I am grateful to the Appropriation Committee's attention to  increasing the construction and facilities budget for NIST in recent  years, we have a lot more work to do. That is why, in light of the  National Quantum Initiative, I introduced an amendment to the  Appropriations bill to provide an additional $161 million for  construction and renovation costs for NIST projects.   In partnering with universities, like the University of Colorado at  Boulder, NIST can continue to expand their work on issues like quantum  in renovated and new state-of-the-art research facilities. That  benefits the United States and will retain and grow our competitive  advantage around the globe.   Another issue that I continue to hear about in Colorado, that we were  able to address through the appropriations package before us, is  affordable housing. It is an urban issue; it is something that you face  in Boulder or Denver or Colorado Springs. But it is an issue that I  hear in some of the smallest communities, as well as the biggest  communities.   So Senator Young and I have been working on an amendment that deals  with affordable housing. We know we have a relationship between the  lack of affordable housing and issues relating to health, education,  nutrition, and job outcomes. And those issues, combined with  homelessness and lack of affordable housing, combine with other issues  to create strains on government and other social services.   The amendment we have offered will help us better understand those  challenges and the root causes of and lack of affordable housing, and  help us understand the effects of the affordable housing crisis on  health and education and employment as well.   It will help us to understand what work we need to do to solve the  problem or whether there are smaller programs that are already working  to expand, to help, do even more good.   These are a number of bills related to the great State of Colorado,  and in this country and I think will do a lot of good, and as we  process these appropriations bills in a bipartisan fashion, we will be  able to improve and help in addressing some major issues.   With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.                            Health Insurance Plans
