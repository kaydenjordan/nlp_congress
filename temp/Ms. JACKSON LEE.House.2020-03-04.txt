 Madam Speaker, just returning from my district, I am  well aware of the sense of concern of our constituents regarding the  coronavirus, having been the first Member to present this to her  community after unclassified briefings left me with many more answers.   I believe it is imperative that we not panic, but prepare.   In San Antonio, this headline reads: ``San Antonio declares emergency  after CDC released a woman infected with the coronavirus: `Totally  unacceptable.' ''   ``Coronavirus: You may need to take a 2-week break from your life,''  CDC says.   I am intending to introduce legislation that deals with hourly wage  makers in order to protect them if such happens.   But I think it is important, as well, to determine what equipment we  have in the United States, to explain to the American people that there  are now two strains--one more deadly than the other--and to be as  forthright as you possibly can.   Information provides opportunity to prepare, and it embraces all of  the community.    Finally, it is important that local health departments have test kits  and that we explain to the Nation that a vaccine is not easily done. It  has to be researched, tested, and vetted, and there will be a period of  time.   So our actions should be preparation and prevention, not panic; but  the reality is that we are dealing with something enormously serious,  and I intend to continue to do that on behalf of my constituents.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), a member of the Rules Committee, for her  leadership. I thank the minority's representative, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to enthusiastically support H.R. 1140. I am very  proud to be an enthusiastic cosponsor of this legislation and to  explain to my colleagues and the American people how we started the  Committee on Homeland Security, as a founding  [[Page H1482]]  member, if you will, being here during the heinous terrorist acts of 9/ 11 and knowing that the Nation needed to put together quickly a  Homeland Security Department, second in size to the Department of  Defense, I believe.   We organized the Transportation Security Administration fast and in a  way that the Administrator would, really, have all powers--all powers.  In doing so, we failed to give them Federal civil service protection.  So, this legislation is legislation that is crucial because the TSA  workforce is among the lowest paid in the Federal Government and lacks  basic workplace protection afforded to most other government workers.  As a result, TSA struggles with low morale and high attrition.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1140, the Rights for Transportation Security  Officers Act of 2020, is nothing that has been previously described-- nothing like that. It is an opportunity to maintain a professional  force of individuals who every day protect Americans.   It is unfortunate that, as we go through our normal life and we see  TSO officers, and we see them in their blue shirts and their dark  pants, we take them for granted, quite frankly.   As a former chair of the Transportation Security Subcommittee of the  Homeland Security Committee, I was intimately engaged in knowing just  what the work was that they did.   Do we understand the numbers of weapons that are found every day? I  am saying it generically because some of this is classified.   The number of incidences that are thwarted, if you will, by TSO  officers--do we realize that one of our great officers lost his life in  Los Angeles, and his family suffers?   This bill would provide reasonable protection. It would give  gradations of salaries. It will allow us to keep a professional staff.    We attempted to put a Band-Aid on this by providing for professional  development training in Georgia, where other Federal law enforcement  academies were. That was not enough.   In fact, they had to change it for these individuals who work for a  period of time before they went to the academy because they were losing  people after they went to the academy because they were not earning the  compensation that they should. There was no promotion.   Just the other day, a very fine young woman, excellent, who was  respected and had come up to headquarters, she left us for another  Federal agency because there was no advancement or opportunity.    Mr. Speaker, these are fine Americans. Many of them  are former military, and they support their families. To give them the  opportunity to, first of all, have a right to grievance, to ensure that  they have nonreduction on pay and compensation, that they have  preservation of their civil rights--there is no right to strike. But it  is a right to have the ability to engage their employer and to be able  to be respected.   Mr. Speaker, I am enthusiastic about this. Names like Bill and  Patrick and Alfred, other men and women of the Transportation Security  Administration, the TSOs' names, I am sure, that we could call in our  respective airports, the people we know every day, our neighbors. They  do a great and fine job.   We must pass this bill, and I hope we pass it in a bipartisan way.  Think about not paying those who are saving your lives every single day  in the Nation's airports. Think about how you are treating them. Think  about the low pay. Think about the compensation that does not allow  them to have high morale.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the show of support for passing this  bill, and I ask my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi  for yielding.   I want to thank the gentleman from Mississippi for his wisdom in  putting forward a bill that is long overdue, and that is H.R. 1140,  which is the Rights for Transportation Security Officers Act of 2020.   Let me congratulate the storied organization AFGE. They have a  stellar reputation for fairly representing government workers in a way  that provides them a better quality of life. I am not sure why they  have become the issue on this floor, and our chairman has just  indicated that there is no such language that limits any actions by our  TSO officers.   Let me be very clear: Starting with the TSO and Homeland Security  from the very beginning, this organizing was done for purposes of  emergency. So now you have denied, for over 20 years, the rights of  these individuals to live a decent life.   I take issue with this one example of an individual who, obviously,  was not managed, because we all know that a man does not examine a  female passenger, period, or traveler. We know that doesn't happen.   So a bad apple does not reflect on the fact that these workers need  better rights, grievances, higher pay, professional development, and to  be treated in the civil system such that we will develop a professional  workforce that stays, that has a high morale and not a low morale.                                time  1415    Are we doing this to the FBI, the Defense Department, and ATF?   Are we telling them that at any moment they can be fired without due  process?   This doesn't make sense. These people have put their life on the  line. They have stopped so much that you do not even know protecting  the traveling public.   Mr. Chairman, if you take a moment to talk with them, you will find  out the massive number of weapons and other types of items that they  have to be astute enough and keen enough to know what to do with.   I support the TSA. I support TSOs because I see them every day as the  front line for this Nation in providing a safe and secure aviation  system.   Yes, their job is difficult and deadly. We lost a gentleman in Los  Angeles, and we all surrounded his family, he died in the line of duty.   I believe this is an important legislative initiative. Let us take  this and finally give to these workers the decency that they deserve.  Let us not make excuses. Let us make it right, and let us stand with  them as American workers and defenders of the security and freedom of  this Nation. Support H.R. 1140.
