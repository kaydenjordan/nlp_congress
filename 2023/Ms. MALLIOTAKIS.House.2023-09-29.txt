 Mr. Speaker, I hope the American people are  listening right now. The Democrats would rather shut down the  government than end an unsustainable and unsafe border crisis that has  flooded our streets with fentanyl, an unsustainable flow of illegal  immigrants destroying New York City, as Mayor Adams says, and only  enriching the drug cartels.   This bill is common sense, and everyone should support it. It does  three things that the American people want. It avoids a shutdown; it  cuts excessive, wasteful spending that has led us to a $33 trillion  debt; and it secures our border. It stops an unsustainable and unsafe  crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to put taxpaying, hardworking  American citizens and their safety first.   I heard my colleague from New York City say that it was cruel that we  want to secure our borders. Do you know what is cruel? In New York City  yesterday, at one of the migrant shelters, a 7-year-old girl was  sexually abused. Do you know what is cruel? Somebody was stabbed at the  Roosevelt shelter in Manhattan. The fact is, there are dozens of crimes  being committed, and our mayor and you guys are doing nothing about it.
