 Madam Speaker, I too, rise today to honor our dear friend,  Congressman Jim Hagedorn. It is amazing that in this day and age with  all of our differences, proud Minnesotans, regardless of our political  perspective, can stand together in memory of one of our great  colleagues, and we thank everybody in this Chamber for doing the same.   It is fitting that we hold this tribute on the House floor. I never  saw Jim more proud than when he was here in this Chamber representing  the State of Minnesota and the communities that he loved so much.   Jim showed us the best of Minnesota. Born in Blue Earth, as Betty  told you, Jim was born in 1962, and he grew up on his family's farm  near Truman, Minnesota. The son of former Minnesota  [[Page H1172]]  Congressman Tom Hagedorn, Jim was raised with a lifelong commitment to  serve.   After graduating from George Mason University, Jim followed in his  father's footsteps and pursued a life of public service. Jim began his  career as a staffer to Minnesota Representative Arlan Stangeland and  then he went on to work for the U.S. Treasury and Bureau of Engraving  and Printing before finally being elected to the House of  Representatives in 2018.   During his time in the House, Jim served the First District of  Minnesota every day with an unwavering passion and a positive attitude  that brightened the Halls of Congress and brought the best of Blue  Earth to Washington.   We will all miss Jim dearly, and we pray for his family during this  difficult time.
