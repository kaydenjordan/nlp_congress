 Madam Speaker, I rise today with great  remorse. Two weeks ago, U.S. Sergeant Nicole Gee, a marine from  Roseville, California, was tragically killed in action during the  August 26 bombing at the Kabul International Airport in Afghanistan.   As a physician of 30 years, I have written hundreds of letters to  families whose loved ones have passed away. The letters that I wrote to  Sergeant Gee's family were amongst the hardest I have ever written. She  gave her life in service and sacrifice to our Nation alongside 12 other  marines and beloved U.S. servicemembers, all of whom we remember fondly  with admiration, appreciation, and a deep and humble respect.   Just a few days prior, Sergeant Gee commented upon her life as a  marine, and she said: ``I love my job.''   Prior to her mission in Afghanistan, Sergeant Gee had been a  maintenance technician assigned to Combat Logistics Battalion 24 of the  24th Marine Expeditionary Unit. Her unit was based out of the Marine  Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, in my district.   I know I can speak for everyone in eastern North Carolina and the  Camp Lejeune community in offering our most sincere condolences to  Sergeant Gee's husband, fellow marine Jarod Gee, as well as her family  and loved ones during this extremely difficult time.   Sergeant Gee's bravery, empathy, patriotism, and unwavering  commitment to others will never be forgotten. Her willingness to put  herself in harm's way to protect her country and the cause of freedom  is the most selfless act one can commit, and words are not enough to  convey our district's sadness and our gratitude.   As a female marine, Sergeant Gee represented one of the fewer, one of  the prouder. Women make up less than 10 percent of the Marine Corps,  but these women carry the same flag, fight the same fight, and bleed  the same red blood as their brothers on the battlefield.   Sergeant Nicole Gee's selflessness reminds us of the many sacrifices  our women in uniform make for our country every day. We will never  forget her  [[Page H4561]]  sacrifice or the sacrifices of her brothers and sisters in arms.   Importantly, she will always be remembered for her compassion and  grace. Most Americans have seen this iconic photo of Sergeant Gee  cradling and comforting an Afghan child at the Kabul Airport. This  image is just a snapshot of her outstanding commitment to others as her  loved ones and fellow marines remember Nicole as an outstanding person  who always had a positive attitude and never failed to put a smile on  everyone's face.                                time  0915    Her dear friend, Marine Sergeant Mallory Harrison, recently took to  social media to say: ``I find peace knowing that she left this world  doing what she loved. She was a marine's marine. She cared about  people. She loved fiercely, and she was a light in this very dark  world.''   One infantry marine who served in Afghanistan with her, Rowdy Woods,  wrote: ``Nicole loved what she was doing out here and she knew the  risks. She did it anyway because she is and forever will be one badass  marine.''   For 2 weeks, residents and visitors in Onslow County have been paying  their respects to Sergeant Gee and her 12 fallen comrades outside of  Camp Lejeune.   Thank you to all the military families and other community members  for adorning the gates of Camp Lejeune with flowers, meaningful signs,  and combat boots.   The outpouring of love and support that I have seen in the Third  District is a true testament to the epic legacy that Sergeant Gee and  all of our other lost U.S. servicemen now leave behind.   It is an honor to represent the marines in my district. They  represent the very best amongst our steadfast patriots, risking  everything to preserve life and liberty for our great Nation. Their  commitment is unmatched.   I, again, extend my sincere condolences to Sergeant Gee's family, her  friends, her fellow marines, and others who were touched by her  wonderful life and valiant service. There is a true void in her  absence. Sergeant Gee will be missed, but her sacrifice will never be  forgotten.                            ____________________
