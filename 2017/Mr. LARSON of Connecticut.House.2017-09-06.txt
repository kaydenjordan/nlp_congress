 Mr. Chair, in less than a minute, I want  to thank the chairman and I also want to thank the ranking member for  their support in what is a critical issue to the citizens of the State  of Connecticut. I want to thank Representative Courtney for  spearheading this effort in the State of Connecticut, along with a  young State senator named Timothy D. Larson.
