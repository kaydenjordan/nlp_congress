 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6845, the Commercial Remote  Sensing Amendment Act. I introduced this bipartisan legislation along  with my colleague, Representative Perlmutter, to update reporting  requirements for NOAA's Office of Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory  Affairs so that Congress can monitor how regulations are impacting the  growth and improvement of the commercial remote sensing industry.   Remote sensing uses data collected from satellites to produce images  of the Earth. It has become a critical resource in fields like  agriculture, finance, trade, and energy.   For instance, imagery and data from commercial remote sensing allows  us to improve crop production by helping farmers more efficiently apply  water and fertilizer. It informs future commodity prices by actively  monitoring weather and crop health.   Commercial remote sensing also improves our ability to prepare for  and to respond to natural disasters by informing flood plain mapping,  tornado tracking, and drought monitoring, topics that are very  important to the people of Oklahoma.   It can also be helpful in humanitarian relief efforts and monitoring  treaty compliance, among other applications.   As you can see, commercial remote sensing provides us with critical  information for many important applications. This technology is  constantly evolving, and the industry is seeing tremendous growth.   To effectively support and manage remote sensing activities, it is  critical that Congress receives timely and comprehensive reports so we  can evaluate the state of the industry and how regulations are  affecting its growth.   The Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015 established a  reporting requirement from the Department of Commerce on the status of  commercial remote sensing licensing and regulation. That requirement  expired in 2020.   H.R. 6845 will reinstate the reporting requirement and keep Congress  informed of agency actions, their impact on licensees, and the state of  the commercial remote sensing industry. These reports to Congress will  give us the information we need to ensure that the U.S. remains a  global leader in this important field.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 6845 is a no-nonsense, bipartisan bill that will  help ensure that the U.S. remains the global leader in the commercial  remote sensing industry.   I thank my friend, Representative Perlmutter, for working with me on  this legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as may consume.   As I said before, commercial remote sensing provides us with critical  information to a number of fields like agriculture, finance, trade,  energy, and more. This, in turn, allows us to be better stewards of our  resources.   H.R. 6845, the Commercial Remote Sensing Amendment Act, will help us  [[Page H7090]]  ensure that Congress receives the updates necessary to monitor industry  regulations. By updating these reporting requirements, we can ensure  that the U.S. remains the global leader in this important field.   Again, I thank Representative Perlmutter for cosponsoring this bill  with me, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7569, the Energy  Cybersecurity University Leadership Act.   Broadly, this bill is meant to expand the cybersecurity workforce for  our energy sector. But before I explain how it will do that, I will  impress upon my colleagues why this is necessary.   Our energy sector is facing more threats now than ever before.  Russia's attack on Ukraine has heightened threats to our  infrastructure, and our liquefied natural gas industry has been the  target of numerous cyberattacks recently.   The FBI has also been issuing warnings about credible threats to our  energy infrastructure. In addition to staying vigilant now, we need to  prepare ourselves for a future in which threats like these continue to  grow. The way we do this is by building our energy sector cybersecurity  workforce. This bill does just that with a three-pronged approach.   First, it encourages further study in this field by creating a  program at the Department of Energy that provides financial assistance  to graduate students and post-docs who are working on cybersecurity and  energy infrastructure.   Second, it provides energy cybersecurity training through  traineeships at our national labs and utilities, giving students  practical skills and experience to bring to the workforce.  [[Page H7091]]    Third, it ensures that we have access to the broadest possible range  of potential cybersecurity experts by conducting outreach to  historically Black colleges and universities, Tribal colleges and  universities, and minority-serving institutions.   Taken together, these three provisions in this bill will expand and  improve our energy cybersecurity workforce and help us protect our  critical infrastructure from growing threats.   I thank my colleague, Representative Ross, for introducing this  important legislation, and Representative Carey for joining her as the  Republican lead on this bipartisan effort. It deserves our full  support.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, our energy industry infrastructure quite literally  keeps our country running. Cyberattacks that damage our grids, shut  down our pipelines, interrupt our energy transmissions can have real  and dangerous consequences for families and businesses across the  country.   We know our energy sector is an attractive target for our foreign  adversaries, so we need to do everything within our power to keep it  secure and reliable.                                time  1445    H.R. 7569 will help develop the most important weapon we have in our  arsenal against cyberattacks: a highly skilled and engaged workforce.   I appreciate the work that Representatives Ross and Carey have done  to get this bill to the House floor.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it today so we can  move quickly to begin developing cybersecurity resources.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6933, the Cost-Share  Accountability Act of 2022.   As the ranking member of the House Science Committee, I am proud of  the work my colleagues and I have done to support innovative research,  development, demonstration, and commercial application activities for  the Department of Energy.   To give just a few examples, last summer, the full House passed H.R.  3593, our comprehensive reauthorization of the Office of Science.  Additionally, the committee passed bipartisan legislation authorizing  cutting-edge R&D activities across a variety of  [[Page H7092]]  fields such as biomanufacturing, abandoned well remediation,  microelectronics, and low-emissions manufacturing.   However, directing the Department to conduct these activities is only  a part of our job. Congress must be an active partner for the  Department of Energy in ensuring we get the best return on our Federal  research and development investments. This legislation institutes a  basic, commonsense reporting requirement that facilitates congressional  oversight of the Department of Energy's financial awards.   As a bit of background, for each research, development,  demonstration, or commercial application award the Department of Energy  issues, it must require that a non-Federal source pay a certain  percentage of the cost of the project. However, the Department has the  authority to reduce or eliminate this requirement under certain  circumstances and fund a larger percentage of the project's cost.   This authority to modify these cost-share requirements is useful for  supporting the development of novel technologies and encouraging new  potential partner organizations to compete for awards. However, the  Department must wield this authority carefully and be a responsible  steward of the taxpayers' dollars.   The Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2022 requires the Department to  submit quarterly reports to Congress on the use of its authority to  modify or eliminate the statutory cost-share requirement for research,  development, demonstration, and commercial application activities that  it funds. This legislation requires the Department to make these  reports public, increasing public awareness and transparency regarding  the Department's funding decisions.   The reports will be an important tool for Congress in monitoring the  Department's energy technology programs and holding it accountable for  its fiscal decisions. Additionally, these reports can inform future  legislation on research and development programs and any potential  adjustments to the cost-share requirements.   This basic reporting requirement in no way impedes the Department's  ability to continue to use its authority to waive the cost-share  requirement. Again, it simply provides Congress and the public with  more data on how and when the Department exercises its authority.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this simple  reporting requirement, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Obernolte).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The Cost-Share Accountability Act of 2022 institutes a simple  reporting requirement to assist Congress in monitoring the Department  of Energy's financial awards under its research, development,  demonstration, and commercial applications programs.   The reports required by this bill will provide valuable information  to Congress on how the Department administers the statutory cost-share  requirement. They will also assist Congress in fulfilling its  responsibilities to oversee our Federal agencies' use of taxpayers'  resources.   This legislation is a simple improvement to support accounting at the  Department of Energy for its spending decisions and helps maximize the  value of our R&D dollars.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7289, the Federal PFAS  Research Evaluation Act.   PFAS is an acronym for a large range of manufactured chemicals that  are exceptionally strong and durable and have the ability to withstand  high temperatures. These characteristics make them incredibly valuable  in countless products, from cell phones to wind turbine components to  military aircraft to everything in between.   The high strength and durability of PFAS also mean they don't break  down easily in the environment. But their essential use in industry and  consumer  [[Page H7094]]  products is exactly why it is important we remember not to villainize  the entire category of chemicals.   The hazard and risk profiles of various PFAS are immensely different.  Using certain PFAS in a controlled, responsible manner is safe and  effective. Understanding the distinct properties of each of these  chemicals will allow us to continue the important uses and benefits of  PFAS technologies.   That is why I rise in support of H.R. 7289. This bill seeks to  increase our understanding of PFAS by directing the Environmental  Protection Agency to work with the National Academies to conduct two  studies.   The first study is to better understand human exposure, behavior, and  toxicity of PFAS. It will allow us to better address research and  knowledge gaps that were identified by the National Academies in 2020.   The second study is focused on understanding the extent and  implications of PFAS contamination, as well as research needed to  manage and treat contamination and develop safe alternatives.                                time  1500    Together, these studies will help us better address PFAS using the  best available science.   At the end of the day, removing harmful PFAS from production and  cleaning up legacy contaminations to protect human health is a  bipartisan issue. But we need to understand the full extent of what we  are seeking to remove, how to best do it, and the potential  implications, if executed.   I thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Meijer), my colleague on the  Science, Space and Technology Committee, for leading this bill, and  being an informed, smart advocate on this issue.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Meijer).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to close.   In December of last year, the Science, Space and Technology Committee  held a hearing on research and development relating to PFAS. I was  impressed to hear just how far along the companies are when it comes to  technologies that can safely and effectively destroy PFAS in the  environment.   I mention that because it is part of why I am optimistic about our  ability to improve our environmental stewardship. When it comes to  protecting human health and the environment, we are making tremendous  progress through technology. There are very few problems, if any, that  innovation cannot address. We can spur that innovation by arming  ourselves with the best possible information, data, and scientific  knowledge.   H.R. 7289 does exactly that for PFAS. It doesn't label all PFAS as  deadly, and it doesn't ban using it. It simply identifies areas of  research that will help us address PFAS using the best available  science.   I thank Representative Lizzie Fletcher for introducing this  legislation and working in a bipartisan manner to advance it, and I  also thank Science, Space and Technology Committee members,  Representatives Meijer and Posey, for cosponsoring this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3952, the NOAA  Chief Scientist Act, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA to most  of us, has a broad mission that includes monitoring and conserving our  coasts, strengthening fisheries, forecasting severe weather, and  improving emergency management. That is just a small sample of what  they do.   Their work either involves directly conducting research or using  research to inform how they can provide the best services to American  industries and communities. That is why the position of chief scientist  at NOAA is so important. The chief scientist is tasked with advising  the NOAA administrator, providing direction for NOAA's science and  technology policies, and leading scientific integrity efforts.   This bill doesn't create a new role for the chief scientist at NOAA.  That position has been utilized by the agency for a long time now.  Instead, in recognition of how important it is for the agency to have a  chief scientist, this bill simply makes that role's existing  responsibilities into law.   It also ensures that the position will never be vacant for long by  creating a process for naming an acting chief scientist when the role  is empty. And having an office support staff for the chief scientist  will make sure critical activities don't slip through the cracks.   We rely on NOAA to perform critical R&D and to implement sound  scientific policies. Doing so requires capable scientific research, and  this bill ensures that NOAA will always have that. It is especially  timely, given that earlier this month Sarah Kapnick was named to the  role of chief scientist at NOAA. I wish her luck there. I hope she will  continue NOAA's long history of scientific excellence.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to close.   Madam Speaker, the NOAA Chief Scientist Act is smart legislation that  codifies an important existing role at NOAA.   A scientific agency needs scientific leadership, and H.R. 3952  ensures that NOAA will always have that in place.   I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill), the chair of  our Environment Subcommittee, for introducing this bill. I also thank  the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Feenstra), the ranking member of the  Research and Technology Subcommittee, for leading the Republican side.   Madam Speaker, this is a smart, simple bill, and I urge my colleagues  to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7361, the National Weather  Service Communications Improvement Act. Right now, the National Weather  Service is years behind when it comes to the internal communications  system known as NWSChat.   This instant messaging system is how forecasters and local emergency  managers communicate with each other before, during, and after a severe  weather event unfolds. This instantaneous communication is critical to  their ability to warn and prepare communities for dangerous storms  quickly and accurately.   It was developed decades ago out of necessity by employees within the  National Weather Service, not by a company that specializes in  application development. Therefore, NWSChat has had its fair share of  hiccups, especially when a large number of users try to access it at  once.                                time  1515    Surprisingly, the heaviest user traffic is usually during a large,  destructive weather event when officials are trying to anticipate what  is coming toward their communities.   H.R. 7361 will help solve this problem by authorizing the National  Weather Service to upgrade their instant messaging service to a  commercial, off-the-shelf solution. These services can handle a large  number of users and easily adapt to technology upgrades, giving our  forecasters a flexible and modern messaging service.   Living in Tornado Alley, I am very familiar with how quickly storms  can form and change direction, so I can tell you that if a small  upgrade like this makes storm warnings even a few seconds faster, that  time can absolutely be the difference between life and death.   Madam Speaker, I thank my Committee on Science, Space, and Technology  colleague, Mr. Feenstra, for introducing this bill. I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Iowa (Mr. Feenstra).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   Madam Speaker, as my colleagues have made clear in their support of  this bill today, every second matters when it comes to reacting to  extreme weather events.   NWS Chat is yet another tool in our toolbox to make sure that  communities have the earliest possible warning of what is heading their  way. We need a fast and reliable messaging service that doesn't glitch  when we need it most.   That is why H.R. 7361 is a simple but necessary bill. By upgrading  the National Weather Service's communications, we can give our most  vulnerable communities the information they need to protect lives and  property.   I again thank my colleague, Mr. Feenstra, for bringing together the  entire Iowa House delegation to support this bill after witnessing the  destructive power of a tornado outbreak in their State.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 3588, the Mathematical and Statistical  Modeling Education Act.   This bill would direct the National Science Foundation to provide  competitive grants to support the research and development of curricula  and teaching methods to improve mathematical and statistical modeling  education. Ensuring that our teachers are well equipped to encourage  student interest and involvement in STEM fields is a key component of  stimulating America's STEM workforce and bolstering our  competitiveness.   Mathematics underpins the critical thinking skills we use every day,  from managing a budget to following a recipe, even to estimating how  long votes will take today.   As more and more jobs become tech-reliant, our students will need  mathematical and computational skills to keep up with the changing  workplace and fill the growing demand for a domestic STEM-literate  workforce.   H.R. 3588 is supported by the American Statistical Association, the  National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the American Society of  Mechanical Engineers, and the Business Software Alliance, among other  stakeholders.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Dr. Baird, for working in a  bipartisan way to advance this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   Madam Speaker, as teachers prepare for the next generation of the  American workforce, it is vital that we invest in the best STEM  education curricula and teaching methods. That is why I strongly  support this bipartisan legislation, which will bolster investments in  mathematics and statistical modeling curricula.   Madam Speaker, I again thank Dr. Baird for his hard work to advance  this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 7180, and I thank my colleague, Mr.  Gonzalez, for introducing and championing this important legislation.   The Brycen Gray and Ben Price COVID-19 Cognitive Research Act directs  the National Science Foundation to support research on the long-term  neurological effects of COVID, particularly in adolescents. It also  instructs NSF to commission a National Academies study on the  disruption of cognitive processes associated with COVID.   This bill is named for two men who died by suicide after suffering  neurological problems caused by COVID-19.   Tragically, there have been numerous instances of psychosis developed  after COVID illnesses. The neurological effects of this disease is not  well understood, and H.R. 7180 will help to change that.   Research on this issue has been progressing as we continue to learn  more about the long-term effects of the disease. This bill will help  accelerate these efforts to better inform the public and medical  community; and hopefully, it will prevent more tragic deaths from  occurring.   I again thank Representative Gonzalez for his hard work on behalf of  his constituents.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This legislation reflects how Congress can work in a bipartisan way  to address difficult issues that our constituents are facing. The  deaths of Brycen Gray and Ben Price due to COVID psychosis were  unexpected and tragic.   While their memories will live on through their families and friends,  we can give them a further memorial through the passage of this  legislation and, hopefully, prevent more tragedies like this in the  future.   H.R. 7180 represents a grassroots effort to address the issue in a  thoughtful and meaningful way.   Again, I thank my friend Mr. Gonzalez for championing this  legislation. Many times, people who observe this body may think it is  all about political tit-for-tat or it is about making noise or  directing time and energy in a fashion that is less than productive.  What Congressman Gonzalez has demonstrated here today in the case of  both Brycen and Ben is that we are  [[Page H7103]]  people, too, as Members. This tragedy touched Mr. Gonzalez and  compelled him to respond legislatively to make sure that other families  can be spared what the Grays and Prices have gone through. It is a  testament to my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez) and a statement that  we are basically good and decent people in this place. We just need to  focus on the priorities that are important to our fellow Americans as  Congressman Gonzalez is doing today.   Madam Speaker, I urge the passage of this legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
