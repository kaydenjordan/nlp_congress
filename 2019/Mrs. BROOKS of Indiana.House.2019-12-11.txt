 Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous  question, we can move to pass H.R. 2207.   Why is it so important that we repeal this disastrous medical device  tax? Since 2013, when I came to Congress, my colleagues and I across  the aisle  [[Page H10040]]  have worked in a bipartisan way to delay and, ultimately, defeat this  disastrous tax.   And why is that so important? It is not just about the economics of a  tax; it is about patients. This is about innovation for patients, and  higher taxes mean fewer innovations will be developed for patients.  Fewer lives will be saved because, when we tax this critical industry,  it will make it harder for them to come up with and fund the next  lifesaving technology.   Tell that to the over a million people a year, worldwide, who receive  implants like pacemakers. These folks rely on these lifesaving devices.  So many of the innovations will not come to market.   Medical devices allow patients to undergo fewer intensive procedures,  with shorter hospitalizations and rehabilitation time, which ultimately  lowers the overall cost of patient care.   Beyond patient care, this is an amazing industry; and if we tax these  businesses, jobs will be lost. We already know that, when the tax was  in place, 29,000 jobs were lost in this industry. These are high-paying  jobs in States across the country.   Indiana is one of the top States in the country to have these types  of medical device jobs. These pay 30 percent higher. The degree of  expertise and the skill of these workers, particularly in the area of  research and development and manufacturing, is unbelievable. And these  people work day in and day out to provide better medical devices to  consumers, not just here in this country, but around the globe.   So reinstating this medical device tax, which will take place on  January 1 of 2020, will hurt the success not just of these businesses,  but it will roll back innovations and stifle R&D of these lifesaving  and life-altering medical advances.   We have a chance, with 256 cosponsors, to stand together and repeal  this tax. I urge this body to pass the repeal of the medical device  tax.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my  colleague, the only pharmacist in the House, Buddy Carter from the  great State of Georgia, who has brought us together to talk about the  importance of lowering costs and making sure we can continue to focus  on more cures.   I also rise today in opposition to H.R. 3. We know that Americans pay  far too much for the drugs at the pharmacy counter, something that my  colleague knows better than anybody, and it is our duty to come  together to find solutions that are solutions to lower costs of drugs  while protecting innovation and future drug development in our country.   But, unfortunately, H.R. 3, which we are scheduled to vote on  tomorrow, jeopardizes that American innovation and patient access to  care. The nonpartisan CBO estimates that, under H.R. 3, approximately  15 fewer drugs will be introduced over the next decade, and about 30  fewer drugs over the following decade, and then a 10 percent reduction  annually, afterwards, into perpetuity. This means that over 40  potential cures will not be discovered over the next 20 to 30 years.   So let's talk about what that means.   It might mean there might not be a cure for breast cancer, maybe no  cure for diabetes and no cure for Alzheimer's, diseases that we know  impact Americans all across our country.   We lead the world in innovation, in breakthrough medicines, cutting- edge technologies, and therapies to save and improve lives. Our peer  nations have 40 to 60 percent fewer cures--as you just heard from  previous speakers--compared to what is available in our market.   In Canada, a country with a nationalized health system, Tori Lacey, a  21-year-old with SMA type 2, spinal muscular atrophy, is unable to  access a treatment called Spinraza because it is not covered for those  with type 2 SMA in Ontario.   Stringent eligibility criteria for novel medicines prevent Tori, a  college student, from focusing on her schoolwork and future. So Tori  must suffer through this genetic neuromuscular disorder that affects  the nerve cells that control voluntary muscles instead of being granted  access to this critical drug. In America, Tori would be able to access  this cure.   If we lose these 15 drugs over the next decade, again, which drug and  which disease is going to lose out? Is it breast cancer, a disease that  claims one in eight women each year?   Madam Speaker, do I go home and tell my dear, longtime friend Judy,  who, at one time, was told she had 18 months to live--that was 8 years  ago--do I tell her: Sorry, we may not be able to work on it, and the  drug companies that do this R&D may not be able to because we can't get  our act together to protect innovation?   Judy has been fighting, for the second time, breast cancer for 8  years. She has been holding on to hope that next month there may be a  cure and that next year there may be a cure. But under H.R. 3, those  chances drop precipitously.   If we lose 15 drugs over the next decade, will it be diabetes, a  disease affecting over 30 million Americans, a disease gripping 700,000  of my fellow Hoosiers?   This past summer, I visited with a young JDRF advocate, Ella, from  Indianapolis. Ella was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 4. She is  an incredible young girl who is advocating on behalf of kids like her  with diabetes. She came to Washington and shared her story with me.   She is a gymnast, but with her disease, she has to be incredibly  careful and monitor her blood sugar constantly. She told me sometimes  she has  [[Page H10120]]  to sit out at practice due to her blood sugar and that it is very  annoying to this 11-year-old gymnast. She should be focused on her  gymnastics and on school, but instead of being a kid, she has to worry  about her blood sugar and about her insuline pump.   I hear from constituents like Ella and her family that the technology  developments in the diabetes space is working to make lives almost  normal. Diabetes was a death sentence just over 100 years ago. Now,  diabetics can almost live normal lives.   But what if we could find a cure?   Hopefully one day, advancements in medicine technology will allow  Ella to be that kid, a kid without any worry.   If we lose these 15 drugs over the next decade, is it the GNAO1  encephalopathy? It is a rare neurological disorder that causes  developmental delays, early infantile seizures, and abnormal movements.   My dear friend and a former House staffer here on the Hill, Emily,  had to leave my team when she found out that her first child, sweet  Madeline, was diagnosed with this rare disease. Madeline is now 5 years  old.   Madeline, at this point in her life, will never be able to feed  herself. She will never be able to run around with classmates. She will  never experience a normal childhood without a cure, let alone more  answers to this very rare disease.   We could go on and on and on if we lose 15 drugs over the next  decade.   H.R. 3 is so wrong for America. But we have an alternative.   We came together with H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, of  which I am proud to be an original cosponsor. This is a piece of  legislation that is a bipartisan package, what Buddy Carter was talking  about. It is focused on lowering drug prices while protecting America's  ability to lead the world in innovative solutions.   Our Energy and Commerce Committee enjoys an, actually, very warm and  bipartisan working relationship on so many bills. We worked across the  aisle; we held many hearings; we had many markups; and we worked on  thorny issues together. Our committee actually put forward several  serious bipartisan measures that could become law. They are part of  H.R. 19.   I am not going to go through all of those pieces that are in H.R. 19,  but one of the things that is so important about H.R. 19 is it provides  affordability and predicability for patients and seniors.   Americans don't want a guessing game at the pharmacy counter. H.R. 19  caps out-of-pocket costs for seniors; it increases competition, which  is key to getting more generic medicines to the market; it increases  low-cost options for patients by bringing these generics to the  marketplace faster; it ends pay-for-delay; it implements CREATES; and  it eases new product entry to the market.   I could go on and on.                                time  2145    These were things that we worked on with our colleagues across the  aisle, and that is what is in H.R. 19.   So while H.R. 3 crushes investments in the R&D of new cures, it  stifles innovation and uses incredibly harsh penalties to squeeze drug  manufacturers who create these cures. It squeezes them almost out of  existence in many ways.   Ultimately, it is the patients who suffer, and it is H.R. 19 that  will encourage innovation of those cures and protect access to new  medicines. It will support competition, which will drive down prices  and lower the cost of medicines, and it does put patients first.   So I urge my colleagues to support that innovation by opposing H.R. 3  and supporting the bipartisan H.R. 19, Lower Costs, More Cures Act-- real solutions for Americans.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for hosting this important hour.
