 Mr. President, before I start my remarks, in case they  go beyond the time for a vote, I ask unanimous consent to finish my  remarks.    We are here today to begin debate on a piece of  legislation called the FIRST STEP Act of 2018. This happens to be the  most significant criminal justice reform bill in a generation.   Our country is based upon the rule of law. If someone commits a  crime, they should be punished, and that punishment should be severe  enough to deter others from committing crimes.   But for our criminal justice system to serve our society well, it has  to do more than punish and deter. Recidivism rates are far too high and  drive crime rates up. In the Federal system, 49 percent of prisoners  are rearrested within 8 years, and 32 percent are convicted of new  crimes. We must better prepare prisoners to leave behind their criminal  past and to become productive citizens when they leave the prison  system.   We also need to make sure that criminal sentences are tough enough to  punish and deter, but not be unjustly harsh. Sentences should not  destroy the opportunity of redemption for inmates willing to get right  with the law.   The FIRST STEP Act is tough on crime, but it is also fair. To tackle  the recidivism rates in our country, the bill establishes evidence- based programming that has reduced recidivism at the State level. We  have evidence from the States of Texas, Georgia, Mississippi, and many  others to justify that fact.   The bill provides incentives for inmates willing to put in the work  to complete these programs. Under this bill, a prisoner may earn 10  days of time credit for every 30 days of successful participation,  which they can apply toward prerelease custody. However, access to  these incentives is available only to those who pose little risk of  committing new crimes.   The FIRST STEP Act requires the Bureau of Prisons to implement a risk  assessment system to determine an inmate's risk of returning to crime  after prison.   Access to the earned-time credits is limited to those who pose a  minimum or low risk. The bill also makes clear that violent and high- risk criminals convicted of certain serious offenses are ineligible for  the prerelease custody program.   The list of disqualifying offenses includes crimes relating to  terrorism, murder, sexual exploitation of children, and gun crimes,  among others that are listed in the bill. All fentanyl traffickers are  disqualified from earning time credits.   The bill also makes sentencing fairer by returning some discretion to  judges during sentencing. Some have called for eliminating mandatory  minimums or cutting them back severely.   I happen to be a supporter of mandatory minimum sentences because it  helps law enforcement take down criminal enterprises, but at the same  time, I recognize there is some unfairness in how these mandatory  minimum sentences are sometimes applied. The FIRST STEP Act leaves in  place these maximum sentences but also addresses overly harsh and  expensive mandatory minimums for certain nonviolent offenders. Locking  up low-level offenders for needlessly long prison sentences diverts  resources that are needed elsewhere to fight crime.   To address this, the FIRST STEP Act makes a number of changes to  sentencing guidelines. First, the legislation clarifies that enhanced  penalties for using a firearm during a crime of violence or drug crime  should be reserved for repeat offenders of such crimes. That is what  Congress had intended when it created the enhanced penalty in the first  place.   Second, the bill would reduce the three-strike penalty for life  imprisonment to 25 years. The 20-year minimum is reduced to 15 years.  The bill also broadens the mandatory penalties, applying them to more  of the worst criminals.   Third, the bill provides for more judicial discretion by expanding  the existing Federal safety valve to include more low-level, nonviolent  offenders. Consistent with the existing law, the judge cannot apply the  safety valve unless the defendant has fully cooperated with law  enforcement.   Lastly, the bill also allows for the retroactive application of the  Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which reduced the 100-to-1 disparity in  sentencing between crack and powder cocaine.   I want to acknowledge President Trump's leadership on criminal  justice reform. Without the President's engagement, we wouldn't be here  today.  [[Page S7650]]  The President deserves credit for brokering a deal that improves  fairness and supports law enforcement.   A tremendous amount of credit is also due to my colleagues in the  Senate who helped to forge a bipartisan compromise on complex issues. I  emphasize ``bipartisan compromise'' because the people in the  grassroots of America, even in my State of Iowa, think there isn't much  bipartisanship going on here.   I would especially like to thank my colleague, Senator Durbin. He has  been a partner through this entire process.   A bipartisan cosponsor includes Senator Lee, who has done a  tremendous amount of work on this. In fact, he started with Senator  Durbin before I even got involved. We also have cosponsorships by  Senators Booker, Graham, Whitehouse, Scott, Feinstein, Cornyn, and  Leahy. They all deserve praise for reaching this deal.   The product of years of negotiating and listening to each other is a  bill that will reduce crime, strengthen faith in our judicial system,  support law enforcement, and give thousands of people a better shot at  living good lives.   As we go to this very important first vote on this bill, which is to  invoke cloture, I urge all of my colleagues to join with President  Trump and our bipartisan coalition of supporters to support the FIRST  STEP Act.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to an  Iowan whose stewardship at a leading television news station in Des  Moines, IA, has strengthened the principles of good government,  transparency and the public's right to know.   As a member of the broadcast press corps for four decades, Dave  Busiek understands that freedom of the press is fundamental to liberty  in this country. I often say that journalists serve an important role  in our system of checks and balances, which preserves liberty. They are  integral to keeping an engaged and infoimed citizenry. They report  corruption, weed out wrongdoing, and hold government accountable to the  American people.   Throughout my public service and political life, I hold myself  accountable to Iowans by making myself accessible to members of the  media. I hold regular news conferences and answer their questions in  the hallways of the U.S. Capitol and after my county meetings at home  in Iowa.   It is a commitment I have kept since my first campaign for the U.S.  Senate back in 1980. And that happens to be the year my political path  crossed with Dave Busiek. In fact, for as long as I have served Iowans  in the U.S. Senate, Dave Busiek has served the people of Iowa in  broadcast journalism: as a reporter, anchor, and news director at  [[Page S7656]]  KCCI-TV in Des Moines, where he started in 1979 after working for 3  years at WHO Radio.   Dave has led coverage of breaking news events, natural disasters,  government and politics, and human interest stories that keep Iowans  informed. When there has been a story to tell and information that  matters to Iowans, Dave has led the coverage over the span of four  decades. Twenty-nine years ago, he covered the United Flight 232 plane  crash in Sioux City. He made sure Iowans knew what they needed to know  during the historic floods of 1993 and during the tornadoes in  Marshalltown, Pella, and surrounding communities this past summer. With  fairness, accuracy and objectivity, Dave has led a team of journalists  to report the news that affects the lives of Iowans, including decades  of coverage of one my favorite places in Iowa: The Iowa State Fair.   Of course, Iowa is considered ground zero for the presidential  campaign trail and all things politics. Dave's political coverage  extends to six Iowa Governors and dates back to George H.W. Bush  beating Ronald Reagan in the 1980 caucuses. As I mentioned earlier, he  covered my first Senate campaign in 1980 and 35 years later, partnered  with CBS News and the Des Moines Register to cosponsor the Democratic  Debate for President at Drake University.   His 29-year tenure as news director at KCCI helped the station win  countless awards for journalistic excellence. In 2002, he was elected  chair of the Radio-Television News-Directors Association and was named  News Director of the Year in 2014 by Broadcasting and Cable Magazine.  He was inducted this summer into the Iowa Broadcasters Association Hall  of Fame. He understands that good content is integral to survival from  an economic standpoint and obviously, good content matters to good  government and quality journalism. He pursued KCCI's expansion into  social media where the news station provides weather and breaking news  coverage across all digital platforms to its consumers. Whether on-air  or online, Dave has worked to stay on top of the news, day after day,  for four decades.   Dave Busiek is not a native Iowan, but we sure are glad he has called  Iowa home since graduating from the Missouri School of Journalism.  Remarkably, he is only the third news director at KCCI since it first  aired in 1955. From viewers to voters, I know that Iowans carry a high  bar of expectations. Dave earned his rise through the ranks and  certainly has raised the bar even higher for his peers in the  profession.   I would like to thank Dave Busiek for his service, professionalism  and integrity in broadcast journalis also like to thank him for his  testimony at a congressional hearing I led back in 2000. He testified  in support of my bipartisan legislation to allow cameras in Federal  courtrooms. The Supreme Court has affirmed that the public has a right  to know what happens in our courts. Dave and I agree that the media can  serve as an important surrogate to allow the court of public opinion to  bear witness to the court of law through the unfiltered lens of a  camera. Specifically, audio/visual streaming and broadcasting of the  Federal courts would enhance better appreciation and understanding of  the Federal judiciary, a coequal branch of the Federal Governnent. That  was 18 years ago. And I am not giving up on getting this bill signed  into law. They say slow and steady wins the race. The people of Iowa  graciously put me on this fence post and I am committed to fighting the  fight as long as I am serving in the U.S. Senate.   I congratulate Dave Busiek on a remarkable career. His legacy will  continue to shine long after he signs off as news director through the  lens of countless journalists he has trained and mentored along the  way.                            ____________________
