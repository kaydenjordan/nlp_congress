 Mr. Speaker, the Hollings Manufacturing  Extension Partnership program at the National Institute of Standards  and Technology is celebrating 30 years of success. I am grateful to  recognize the achievement of MEP in South Carolina.   Senator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina introduced the legislation  that led to the creation of the program. It later was renamed in his  honor.   The MEP has served over 26,000 companies. It has earned support in  Congress for assisting small- to mid-sized manufacturers.   I am grateful that the South Carolina MEP has generated almost $380  million in new investment and created 1,361 jobs. It generated almost  $2.7 billion in statewide economic impact.   In the Second Congressional District, it helped to create and retain  989 jobs last year and brought in over $30 million in new investment.   I commend these employers for creating jobs in South Carolina and  nationwide.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
