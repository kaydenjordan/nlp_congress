 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, someday I will write a book--maybe--and  one of the topics that I have thought of, because I spent most of my  adult life in the world of legislating, is what motivates or inspires  the idea to introduce a bill that might one day become a law.   I think many people would be surprised at what the motivation could  be. For example, on health issues, I have found Members who were  inspired because of the knowledge of someone in their family or a  friend who went through a challenge with a medical  [[Page S416]]  condition and asked them if they would help in the field of research.  Of course, many bills come to us from constituents who contact us and  have problems and challenges, and we realize the only real recourse is  a change in the law. That is the case with the bill I am introducing  today.   It was 20 years ago that we got a phone call in my office in Chicago,  and a woman who was the director of a music program in the city of  Chicago asked for some help. The program is known as the MERIT Music  Program, and a very kind lady left some money to the program with the  instruction that it should be used to teach students--low-income family  students--in public schools how to play a musical instrument and to  actually buy the instrument for them.    It has been spectacularly successful. And, of course, we learned that  many students, if they take up music, turn out to be not only musicians  but very good students.   The MERIT Music Program has quite a history. Well, they called and  told us 20 years ago that they had an amazing young woman who was part  of the MERIT Music Program, who had started playing the piano at the  age of 12 and was nothing short of a phenomenon. She had applied for  music schools that she might attend, and the major music schools--like  Juilliard and Manhattan Conservatory of Music--had expressed an  interest.   They had run into a problem, though, because when she filled out the  application form and they asked for her citizenship status. She said,  unfortunately, that she didn't know what it was, and her mother said:  Why don't we call Senator Durbin's office?   And that is how we got into the picture.   Her name was Tereza Lee. Tereza Lee was Korean American. She was  brought to the United States on a visitor's visa at a very early age,  at the age of 2, to Chicago. And when the visa expired, no effort was  made to renew it or to file any papers with the Federal Government.   She was a classic case of the undocumented alien. Her parents, some  of whom were here legally, and her siblings, some of whom were  citizens, did not spare her the problem that she faced in determining  her own status, and that is why they called us.   We learned that, even though she was 17 or 18 at the time and had  been in the United States all of her life that she could remember, she  did not have legal status. And the law said that Tereza Lee, at the age  of 17, had to leave the United States for 10 years and apply to come  back in legally.   I couldn't believe it when I heard it. My staff told me that they  didn't know what to tell her to do, and I soon realized the only thing  to do was to change the law and to give to young people brought here as  infants and toddlers and babies and young kids a chance to become legal  in America. That is why 20 years ago I introduced a bill called the  DREAM Act. The DREAM Act was for Tereza Lee.   I am going to interject here part of the story because I always  forget to tell the happy ending. Tereza Lee ended up applying to music  school in New York. She was accepted, and she went to school because of  the kindness of several families in Chicago who were so impressed with  her talent. She finished the 4 years of education at that music school  and was so good that she played in Carnegie Hall and then married an  American-born jazz musician in New York.   She is now the proud mother of three children. She is a music teacher  herself and an American citizen, by virtue of her marriage to the other  musician.   Tereza was the first Dreamer, but there were many just like her who  didn't have as much luck. They are still in a suspended animation  status when it comes to immigration and citizenship. So for 20 years on  the floor of the U.S. Senate, I have introduced this bill and told the  stories of the Dreamers.   I think I have gotten through to a number of people because the word  ``Dreamer'' now really signifies more this citizenship status than  anything else. I joke that when I first started this mission, if you  were to ask people who were the Dreamers, older folks would have said:  Why, that is a British rock group, with a fellow named Freddie who is  the lead singer. But today when you mention the word ``Dreamers,''  people automatically think of these young people and their situation in  the United States, which, to this day, because of our failure to pass  the Dream Act, is still unresolved.   They came to the United States as kids. They are American in every  way. They went to our schools, and they stood up every morning and put  their hand over their heart to pledge allegiance to that flag--the only  flag they have ever known. They thought they were just like the kids  next to them, and then one day, the parents sat down and told them the  reality.   They go to school with our kids. We see them in church. We know that  they stand by the beds of our neighbors and relatives who are fighting  COVID-19. We know that they are injecting lifesaving vaccines in the  arms of our parents and loved ones. And they are giving back to America  as teachers, nurses, engineers, and soldiers, but they are not citizens  of the United States.   Today, I will once again reintroduce the Dream Act with Senator  Lindsey Graham, Republican from South Carolina, as my cosponsor. I want  to thank him for doing this and making it a bipartisan effort. We have  a long history of working together--though we disagree on many things,  but on this issue, we believe that Congress has an obligation to fix  our broken immigration system.   It was, as I mentioned, many years ago that I introduced the bill,  but it was 11 years ago that Republican Senator Dick Lugar, of Indiana,  on a bipartisan basis agreed to call on President Obama and ask him to  do what he could do to protect these young people from deportation.  President Obama created the DACA Program. The DACA Program meant that  these young people came forward, identified themselves, paid a  substantial fee, went through a criminal background check and a  national security check, and, if approved, were given a 2-year  renewable protection from deportation and a 2-year renewable right to  work.   More than 800,000 of these Dreamers came forward and received the  protection of DACA. It unleashed their full potential. I can tell you  over and over and over again, they will say to me: DACA changed my  life; I finally thought I had a chance to be part of America   And so they became soldiers and teachers and business owners and  everything imaginable.   In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 200,000 DACA  recipients are essential infrastructure workers. That is not my term.  That is the definition of the Department of Homeland Security under  President Donald Trump.   Among these essential workers are 41,700 DACA recipients in the  healthcare industry: doctors, intensive care nurses, paramedics,  respiratory therapists--all of them in a suspended immigration status  because the Dream Act is still a bill and not a law.   On September 5, 2017, former President Trump repealed DACA. Hundreds  of thousands of these Dreamers faced losing their work permits and  being deported.   Last summer, the Supreme Court rejected President Trump's effort to  end deportation protection for Dreamers. In an opinion--an amazing  opinion--by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court held that President  Trump's attempt to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,  known as DACA, was ``arbitrary and capricious.''   In one of his first official acts--I can't thank him enough-- President Biden signed an Executive order on January 20 to restore  DACA. I want to thank him from the bottom of my heart for making DACA  one of his highest priorities.   Without DACA, hundreds of thousands of talented young people who have  grown up in our country cannot continue their work and are at risk of  deportation to countries they barely remember, if they remember at all.  But the resumption of DACA is just the first step toward justice for  Dreamers. Only legislation by Congress can provide a path to  citizenship for Dreamers.   We know now that there are still efforts under way to eliminate DACA  protection in the courts of America. A recent case in Texas is a  reminder that a law has to pass.   I am honored that I have a chance to serve as chairman of the Senate  Judiciary Committee in this new Congress.  [[Page S417]]  As the child of an immigrant, I never dreamed that I would have this  opportunity to lead the committee in the Senate that writes our  Nation's immigration laws.   To all of the Dreamers out there, let me tell this: Passing the Dream  Act is still my highest legislative priority.   There was a fellow named Jack Valenti who worked for LBJ years ago,  and he used to say: ``Every good speech has six words in it.'' And so  he told me those words, and they are these: ``Let me tell you a  story.'' I have come to the floor of the U.S. Senate to tell the story  of the Dreamers 128 times.   Today, I want to tell you about Ana Cueva. She was born in Mexico and  came to the United States when she was 5 years old. She grew up in  Utah. What a student--she was president of the National Honor Society  at her high school, graduated in the top 10 percent of her class, and  volunteered at local hospitals in her junior and senior years.   Ana's dream? She wanted to become a nurse. Ana wrote me a letter, and  here is what she said about her dream:         My mom became very sick. She required emergency surgery for       a brain tumor. It was one year after arriving to the U.S., so       her English was [very] limited. After her recovery, she has       always said the nurses who cared for her were kind and       patient. Even though they couldn't communicate very well,       they touched her very deeply.    Ana said:         I wanted to do for others what these nurses did for my mom.    Driven by that commitment, Ana earned an associate's degree and a  bachelor of science in nursing at Utah Valley University. Thanks to  DACA, she became an ICU registered nurse. Most of her nursing career  has been in her home State of Utah, but during the COVID-19 pandemic,  she has become a travel nurse and has worked in California,  Massachusetts, Idaho, and Texas.   Here is what Ana said about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic:         My soul aches. I have seen more people die in the past year       than my five years [before] as a nurse. I have held more       hands as people passed away alone and cried with families       through FaceTime and on the phone. I became numb for a short       while [there]. But as I find myself again, I remembered why I       do what I do.    I want to thank Ana for her service on the frontlines of the  coronavirus pandemic. She is a health hero. She is an immigrant health  hero. She is the face of DACA.   She has put her life at risk and her family at risk to protect  others. She should not also have to worry about whether she is going to  be deported and her family ripped apart.   So some people think we would be a stronger country if Ana Cueva  would leave: Go back to Mexico; you are not one of us. We have numbers  of immigrants we can accept each year, and you are not in that number.  You are illegal, you are undocumented.   What a loss that would be. If we lose Ana and people like her in the  middle of a pandemic, what would we be thinking? The fight is on for  Ana and for hundreds of thousands just like her who simply want a  chance to earn their way to legal status and citizenship in the United  States of America.   It would be a tragedy for us to turn away these brave, talented, and  determined professionals in the midst of this pandemic. So we have to  get to work in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor of the Senate.  This is the year. This is the time when we can come together and make a  difference in the future of America.   To Ana, we need you. We want you. We want to make you part of the  future of this country because you are such an important part of  America today. This Dream Act means a lot to me. We need to make it the  law.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, let me clarify something at the outset.  Undocumented immigrants do not qualify for stimulus relief under  current law or any proposal by the Biden administration. This amendment  is unnecessary.   There are estimated to be 11 million undocumented immigrants in the  United States, 7\1/2\ million ITINs. These are men and women working in  the United States, paying Federal taxes, living in this country.   We can save the debate for another day as to their entitlement for  any financial relief, but let me hope that we do agree on one basic  thing: Children who are legal citizens in the United States of America  are entitled to help, regardless of the immigration status of their  parents.  [[Page S436]]    Unfortunately, Senator Young's amendment, as written, would preclude  these children of immigrant parents from this financial assistance.  Whether you are for or against their parents receiving a payment, be  fair to these American children, these legal citizens in the United  States, and vote no on the Young amendment.    Do I have any time remaining?    Mr. President, community policing is not a one-size-fits- all approach. The Congress and the administration should respect the  judgment of local leaders when it comes to identifying public safety  needs.   Hundreds of cities and counties have decided they don't want to be  immigration police. Why? Because their resources are stretched thin,  and doing so will deter people from reporting crime and cooperating  with police investigation.   Instead of laying off this responsibility to local government, I have  got a radical idea: Why doesn't Congress do its own work and fix this  broken immigration system once and for all, instead of blaming local  police departments?                          Vote on Amendment No. 553     Mr. President, it is already current law that all Federal  protections for people apply to every infant born alive, including  those born alive during the course of an abortion. Simply put, you  cannot kill an infant, regardless of how they came into this world.   This is the law of the land thanks to the Born-Alive Infants  Protection Act, which passed the House and Senate by a voice vote and  was signed into law by President George Bush in 2002.   Does it work? In 2013, Dr. Kermit Gosnell, a physician in  Pennsylvania, was found guilty on three counts of murdering babies born  alive in his clinic after botched late-term abortions. He is currently  serving three life terms in prison.   I would say to the Senator from Nebraska, of course we agree. People  like Dr. Gosnell should pay a heavy price. But to put this into a  budget resolution just doesn't fit, and I am afraid one page doesn't do  justice to even the explanation that was given.   I raise a point of order that the pending amendment is not germane to  the underlying resolution and therefore violates section 305(b)(2) of  the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.    Mr. President.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I  understand  [[Page S441]]  the Senator from Utah's sentiments, and I share them.   There is a physical need to call the roll, which takes an amount of  time, which sometimes can be more than 10 minutes. If we reach a tie  situation and have to call in the Vice President, it takes even longer.   The most effective thing I have seen in the Senate to deal with this  issue is for Members to sit in their chairs and to vote as their names  are called. We can bring the rollcalls to an end much more quickly. Now  they are running around 30 minutes.   I am going to object to your suggestion, but I would suggest that  when we reach the point where Members are sitting in their chairs,  amendments are called, and we vote on them quickly, we can come to a  conclusion in a much faster way.    I think you are going to find that 10 minutes is not  practical. I wish--I am for electronic voting, just to go way out on a  limb, but I want to tell you--    I object.    Madam President, in this ragtag, middle-of-the-night  procedure, the Senator from Utah asks a basic question: What if my  freedom conflicts with your freedom? Specifically, what if my freedom  of religious belief says that I don't have to sell my home to an  African American? What if my religious belief says that I don't have to  pay women the same thing as men who work for me? What if my religious  belief says that I can discriminate against a person because of their  sexual orientation?   I read the Senator's amendment as saying the answer is obvious:  religion prevails.   I don't think it is that simple. It is not that simple in this  building or across the street in the Supreme Court.   If we are dealing with the fundamental question of discrimination  based on religious belief, we all want to make certain that we  acknowledge and respect religious belief, but we also feel pretty  strongly about the rights of individuals when it comes to their gender,  their identity, their sexual orientation, their color, the fact that  they may be disabled.   Arguing that religious belief would allow me to discriminate with  impunity is a pretty large question to assert at this time of night.   I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this Lee amendment.    Mr. President, the Constitution does not stipulate the  number of Supreme Court Justices. That is up to Congress. Congress has  a long history of altering the makeup of the Court. The number of  Justices changed six times before we arrived at the number nine. This  amendment chooses to ignore the history.   For the record, there is exactly one living Senator who has  effectively changed the size of the Supreme Court. He is Senator  McConnell, who shrank the Court to eight seats for nearly a year, in  the last year of the Obama Presidency, by refusing to fill the Scalia  vacancy. Now President Biden has established a bipartisan commission to  study Supreme Court reform. Let them do their work.                                Point of Order    Mr. President, come to think of it, should we be changing the Senate  rules in the budget resolution? I think not.   In fact, Mr. President, as a result, I raise a point of order that  the pending amendment is not germane to the underlying resolution.  Therefore, it violates section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget  Act of 1974.    Mr. President, the solution sounds so simple, and it is  simply wrong. May I give you an example?   Barring additional green cards for hundreds of thousands of immigrant  workers stuck in the backlog won't help American workers since these  immigrants are already working here. In fact, it would hurt American  workers by creating an incentive to hire more guest workers who can be  paid lower wages.   This is not the approach we need for coronavirus immigration reform.                                Point of Order    Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment is  not germane to the underlying resolution. Therefore, it violates  section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.    In the course of the last year, more than 425,000  Americans died. We all know the story, and we know it personally.   Elected officials at every level have been called on to respond to  this pandemic. Mayors and Governors have had to make critical public  health choices they didn't believe they would ever face in their  professional lives. They had to decide whether certain businesses would  be opened or closed, when to open and close schools, whether or not  they would have churches that would be open. It was a myriad of  opportunities to make the right decision or the wrong decision.   Some of them learned the hard way. Some were courageous; some were  not. Some listened to the scientific community and some ignored it. But  I believe most of them tried to do their best.   Sadly, when it was all said and done, many made wrong decisions in  terms of when to open and how many people to allow in certain places.  It was just a fact of life--a novel coronavirus--and they were trying  to respond to infection and death.   Sadly, what the Senator from Oklahoma is charging is if there was a  discrimination against a church in the process--    The people in the community would be penalized to receive  less Federal funds because of the decision the Governor had made.    The Senator from Florida is asking us to lock in the  relationship with Remain in Mexico and the Migrant Protection  Protocols. The new President, Joe Biden, is in the process of reviewing  that at the very moment. The question is whether we are going to adopt  the Rubio amendment and tie his hands to accept the outcome.   Allow this President, elected by a large majority of the American  people, a chance to lead and to respond to a real challenge. Vote no on  the Rubio amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 651     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 263         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
