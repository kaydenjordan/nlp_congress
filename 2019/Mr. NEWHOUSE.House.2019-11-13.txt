 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Debbie Bone- Harris as she begins her retirement from the Franklin Public Utility  District.   Deb began working for Franklin PUD in 2003 and has held many roles  throughout the organization. She has been a stalwart advocate for  hydropower in the Northwest. She has spent countless hours educating  our community about the value of the Columbia and the Snake River dams,  and she has worked with both State and Federal legislators to advocate  for their protection.   Deb is a leader, not only with the Franklin PUD, but in the greater  community as well. She has served on numerous boards and held  leadership roles with community organizations, including Pasco Chamber  of Commerce, Visit Tri-Cities, Tri-Cities Legislative Council,  Washington Public Utility District, Northwest Public Power Association,  and Pacific Northwest Waterways Association.   As Deb begins her well-earned retirement, our community wishes her  the best as she enjoys spending more time with her grandchildren, going  on hotrod adventures with her husband, and attending those rowdy sewing  conventions.   I thank Deb for her advocacy and congratulate her.                            ____________________
