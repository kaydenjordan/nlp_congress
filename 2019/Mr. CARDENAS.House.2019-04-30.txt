 Madam Speaker, I have the honor of helping an American  citizen familiarize herself with our United States Capitol--with her  United States Capitol. Sophia is here with her eighth grade class from  St. Philip The Apostle Catholic School in Pasadena, California.   I felt it important for her to understand that we do listen, so I  asked her before I gave this speech: What comes to mind? What issue  would you like me to mention?   She thought, and she thought, and she said: Teenage suicide rates are  way too high.   You had better believe it, America. They are. And there are many  things we can do, both locally and here in Washington, to make sure  that we curtail that and make sure that young people don't find  themselves in the position to do such a thing to themselves, their  family, and their community.   I pledged to Sophia that many of us here in Washington are committed  to doing what we can to make sure that suicide rates in general, but  specifically suicide rates amongst young people, are curtailed and they  hopefully stop and come down to zero soon.   I thank Sophia for visiting us, and I thank her teachers and all of  those who brought her here today.                            ____________________
