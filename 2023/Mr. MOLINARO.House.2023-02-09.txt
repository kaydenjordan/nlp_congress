 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong opposition  to New York State Governor Kathy Hochul's 2023 budget proposal.   Each year, Congress directs billions of Medicaid dollars to the State  and local government to administer programs to help our most vulnerable  neighbors.   Governor Hochul's budget puts these programs at risk and the people  served in danger. Her budget steals $1 billion in Federal Medicaid  dollars from the most vulnerable to subsidize a bloated and broken  State bureaucracy.   It puts programs that are meant to serve hungry children,  impoverished seniors, and working mothers on the chopping block.   That is what is at risk: Things like food assistance and senior  nursing care and addiction treatment services.   Governor Hochul is stealing from programs that help children,  seniors, and those living in poverty and putting Albany bureaucracy in  control of another billion dollars in taxpayer money.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this budget and seek that we protect the most  vulnerable of our neighbors all across New York.                            ____________________
