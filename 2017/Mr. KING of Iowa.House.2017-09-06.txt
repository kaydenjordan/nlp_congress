 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk made  in order by the rule.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This is the amendment that doesn't allow Federal funding to support  any project that enforces Davis-Bacon rules.   Davis-Bacon rules have--actually, it is the last remaining Jim Crow  law left on the books in America. It was established by a couple of  Republicans in New York back in about 1932 or 1933, when they realized  that of the few construction projects that were going on during the  Great Depression, there was an Alabama contractor that underbid the  local unions in New York to build a Federal building up in New York.   That contractor who came out of Alabama brought his labor out of  Alabama, African Americans out of Alabama. So they got together and  decided, let's pass a law to have a little trade protectionism between  Alabama and New York. We are going to control who is in the union, and  we will control the wages, and we will control the benefits.   I have been in the construction business, as of last Monday, for 42  years. We have paid Davis-Bacon wage scales most of those years, if not  all of those years, and King Construction understands what this does.   First, it inflates wages, and the inflation of wages is dictated by a  little board and committee that is supposed to be evaluating what is  described as prevailing wage. But it is not prevailing wage, it is  union scale, and it is a BOGSAT is what it is. BOGSAT, meaning a bunch  of guys sitting around a table deciding that they are having trouble  competing with the rest of the private sector, so they want to raise  the wages of their construction workers so that they can get the pick  of the cream of the crop of the construction workers to go to work for  them rather than their competitor or another industry.   That is how this has gone on for all of these years in the private  sector, the  [[Page H7040]]  Federal Government deciding what wages and what benefits should be  paid. And now we are seeing benefits that are being paid in the fringe  benefit category to people who have a health insurance program that is  funded by the taxpayers, premiums funded by the taxpayers under  ObamaCare.   So now, Davis-Bacon is even worse. It pays wages and it pays benefits  that are designed to pay for their health insurance benefits, and they  are doubling down on that and on the ObamaCare subsidy of their  premiums. And so these wages no longer reflect prevailing wage. They  haven't for a long time. They have long, and maybe always, been union  scale. The union sits at the table with a few contractors in the  BOGSAT, and they make the deal.   And I have a private contractor, a merit shop contractor, who has  worked with this for 42 years. I have seen the inefficiencies it has  created within our company, and competing companies as well.   And, yes, we like it when we can pay our labor the highest rates  known to man. It makes our employees happy. And if I can look at our  competition and we can sit down and say, you know what, we would like  to give each of our employees a $5 an hour raise or a $10 an hour  raise, and let's make sure that any other industry can't compete with  the wages we are paying, because, after all, it doesn't really come out  of our pocket as contractors. It comes out of the pockets of the  taxpayers, borrowed from the Chinese.   That is what is going on, and the wages increase is a 20 percent  increase on balance. So, for example, if you want to build five  bridges, repeal Davis-Bacon. If you want to build four bridges, stick  with the imposed Federal union scale, the legacy of Jim Crow. If you  want to build--let's just say a USDA building, the same formula  applies. You can build five buildings; you can build four. You can  build four stories, or you can build five, but we need to have  competition in this U.S. economy.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), the chairman of the subcommittee.    Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, and expending the  balance of it, I would point out that some of these wages that we are  looking at here, here are laborers in Indiana, a total of $34.63 an  hour. Here is an asbestos worker, $46.05 an hour.   There are more here in the records, and I don't think that these are  the kind of numbers that the gentleman is talking about. And I  constantly hear the script read to us from the other side but never a  response.   Mr. Chair, I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that requires that new hires under  this appropriations bill are verified under E-Verify before they can go  to work. It ensures that those funds that are made available in this  appropriations bill will not be used for new hires unless they use the  E-verify program as a responsibility that the Federal Government  requires as a matter of law.   Current law requires the Federal Government to use E-Verify to  enhance enforcement of Federal immigration law in all hiring. However,  it has been brought to my attention that it isn't consistent across the  different departments. We need to ensure that it is. It is in response  to those concerns that I offer this amendment to require E-Verify.   I will just describe E-Verify.   Conditional to the hire, employers who have a prospective employee  may go onboard the Federal internet site, which is the E-Verify site,  and type in the valid information or perhaps the presented information  of the prospective employee that has been offered a job. Should they  clear E-Verify, you punch in what I just euphemistically call name,  rank, and serial number. It is a short piece of data that includes  birth date, name, and often birthplace. Then that goes into the  internet site. It comes back to you and lets you  [[Page H7043]]  know that you can legally hire the individual that is identified in  this data. That is E-Verify.   Hopefully, in this Congress, the Federal Government will pass and  make E-Verify mandatory for private sector employers. Hopefully, we  will do that in this Congress. But the Federal Government needs to, Mr.  Chairman, address this, and it needs to do so with our own employees.  That is what the King amendment does. It ensures that E-Verify is used  by our own employees.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. BISHOP Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama  (Mr. Aderholt), chairman of the subcommittee.    I would add for clarification, Mr. Chairman, that  the provision the gentleman referred to is section 408 of the Foreign  Service Act of 1980, which exempts those employees in foreign countries  that surely would not want them uncovered under E-Verify.   In response to the gentleman's objection, I have tried to fool E- Verify by punching data into it. The longest delay I could create was 6  seconds. So as far as undue burden is concerned, a 6-second wait in the  most extreme circumstances I don't think is extreme at all.   This is the right thing for the Federal Government to at least  exercise the laws that we pass and we want to impose upon the rest of  the country and upon ourselves.   So it is a clarification amendment, Mr. Chairman. I urge its  adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk made  in order by the rule.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This is an amendment, a Davis-Bacon amendment, and it will be brought  on each of the four segments of this appropriations bill that we are  considering here in the House this evening and perhaps tomorrow  morning, Mr. Chairman.   Just to make it clear, the text of the amendment is very simple. It  says, ``None of the funds made available by this act may be used to  implement, administer, or enforce the prevailing wage requirements in  subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, United States Code,'' and this  is commonly referred to as the Davis-Bacon Act.   What the Davis-Bacon Act is, it is a statute that exists from about  1933, and its genesis is back during the Great Depression when there  was, let's say, labor protectionism brought about by the unions in New  York City. When a contractor from Alabama bid a Federal building  contract--and there were not many of them in those days--that Alabama  contractor was successful and he imported African-American labor out of  Alabama to do the work in the trade zone of the construction unions in  New York City. And so two Republicans, a Republican Senator and a  Republican Member of the House, got together and wrote the Davis-Bacon  Act, which is defined as prevailing wage.   In my 42 years in the construction business, which we just concluded  as of Labor Day, this past Labor Day, we have dealt with the Davis- Bacon Act quite a lot. Our math goes somewhere between an 8 and 35  percent increase in the cost of the projects. We use an average of 20  percent. I believe you will see some of those sophisticated studies go  to a 22 percent increase in prices.   So we are dealing with taxpayers' moneys here in a fiscal time when  we need to get to a balance. There never was a time we should be  wasting taxpayers' money. A prevailing wage, a real prevailing wage is  a merit shop wage, not a union scale imposed by a BOGSAT, which is a  bunch of guys sitting around a table deciding whether they want to give  raises to the different classifications within the labor force.   I have long opposed the Davis-Bacon wage scale. It messes up the  efficiency within our companies and makes us less efficient. This just  doesn't raise the cost and impose the union scale on the taxpayers, but  it erodes the efficiency that you can provide in a private sector  approach. And so after all of these years, I am pledged to see the day  when this is finally repealed.   I urge the adoption of this amendment which strikes the use of Davis- Bacon enforcement in the underlying appropriations, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I  have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out that I hear the script read  every year that I bring the effort to repeal or undo Davis-Bacon, but I  don't really hear a lot of response to the fact that Davis-Bacon is a  Jim Crow law designed to keep minorities, particularly African  Americans, out of the construction trades, particularly in the unions.  The assertion that it is a prevailing wage doesn't hold up when you  live in this universe where I have for 42-plus years--and that is just  as an owner, and working out, I saw that also for other companies.   So when I see these rates and I talk to a contractor that is building  bridges in rural Missouri down there in the whoops and hollers, as we  say, and they are paying for an unskilled laborer who, for a number of  those hours, does lean on the shovel while he waits for other things to  get done, $23 an hour for wages, $22 an hour for fringe benefits, $45  an hour out of pocket for the contractor really just transferred to the  taxpayer. That is an example.   There is much of it that is here that goes in 46, 57, here is $51.60  an hour, Mr. Chairman. So, no, this is not prevailing wage.   There is no study that I have found in all the time I have dealt with  this that would demonstrate that prevailing wage is a merit shop earned  wage. Instead, it is set, as I said, by a bunch of guys sitting around  a table. It reflects almost always union scale.   Many of the merit shop contractors will not report their Davis-Bacon  prevailing wages because they know that just brings union organization  up against them. They want to avoid that, so they are not reporting  what they are actually paying in wages.   In many of the States that have adopted a mini Davis-Bacon for their  State or the States that are highly unionized, they press this thing to  the point where the difference between the merit shop wages and union  scale is very close together.  [[Page H7056]]    We have also double-breasted operations where you might have a  company that is Company A and Company B wrapped up, and one-half of the  company is union and the other half of the company isn't. That is to  comply with Federal regulations.   There is a gentleman who used to serve this Congress in  Massachusetts, who was famous for saying that the Federal Government  has no business intervening in between a relationship between two or  more consenting adults. I agree with that. An employee and an employer  should be able to decide what they want to make as their business  agreement. If I decide I want to pay someone $100 an hour or $1,000 or  $1 an hour, that should be up to me.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk made  in order by the rule.    Mr. Chairman, this is an E-Verify amendment. It was  offered in the previous segment of this appropriation bill as well.   What it does, it just simply reinstates and clarifies Federal law,  the requirement to use E-Verify in the forms of all Federal  contracting. Under this T-HUD bill, that is what would apply.   We have run into cases where there has been, let's say, concerns that  the Federal agencies are not uniformly and consistently abiding by  Federal law. This says that the funds will not be used for new hires,  unless they are verified through the E-Verify program.   The E-Verify program--we worked this now for quite a few years,  brought to us by Ken Calvert of California--even though in its early  days it hit a couple of bumps in the road, it has gotten better and  better. We use it, I have used it, it is efficient, and it is not time- consuming at all.   This reiterates Federal law. In fact, the Federal Acquisition  Regulation Act of 2009 reinforces and requires that compliance be there  for new hires, and  [[Page H7064]]  to use E-Verify on all new hires affected by this appropriations bill.   Mr. Chairman, I urge this adoption, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, in response to the gentleman's  comments, I am not at all convinced that it is needless. The reports  that I am getting are that E-Verify has not been adequately enforced,  especially at the contractor and subcontractor level.   This is Congress reminding those who consume Federal dollars and  Federal contracting under this T-HUD appropriations bill that they  shall comply with the law that was referenced by the gentleman. I don't  know why it would be divisive, if it is Federal law, and needless,  supposedly.   Let's go ahead and pass this and remind those that follow Federal law  and this debate won't happen next year.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment, the E-Verify  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk made  in order by the rule.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to modify my  amendment with the modification at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, this eliminates the funding that would go to Davis- Bacon and enforcing Davis-Bacon, the Federal wage scale that advertises  prevailing wage but turns out to be union scale.   We debated this twice earlier this evening. The modification for the  edification of the people who might not have picked up on that rolls  this Davis-Bacon amendment together with the appropriations component  that we will debate tomorrow so there is clarification here on the  floor.   I have long been for the repeal of Davis-Bacon. I have made a  statement that the Federal Government doesn't have any business  dictating to an employer and an employee what they should be able to  agree to on wages.   We have been in the construction business for 42 years. We started on  our 43rd year this week. We have paid Davis-Bacon wages in most of  those years, if not all of those years, and it upsets the efficiency of  being able to manage the job, and it interferes with that relationship.   If it is going to be prevailing wages, then let the market decide  that. But the studies that we have out there, there is no study that I  know of that would show where there is an imposed Davis-Bacon wage  scale that it costs less money. It always costs the taxpayers more  money to do a particular project.   Our records of these years run between an 8 percent greater than it  [[Page H7083]]  would be if we had merit shop or as high as 35 percent greater than the  cost of the projects. We average it out to 20 percent. There are  studies out there that say a 22 percent increase.   So I describe it this way: if the Federal Government is going to  mandate union scale on construction projects, whether it be for  building a wall on the southern border or an interstate or a bridge, a  highway, a building, whatever it might be, you can decide whether you  want to borrow money from China to build 4 miles of road or 5, if you  want to build four bridges or five, or if you want to build four  buildings or five. That is what it comes down to in the end. We can  build five of everything instead of four if we just repeal Davis-Bacon.   So this scores well for us. The fiscally responsible people will come  down on the side of eliminating Davis-Bacon. This country would not  adopt such a policy if it happened today.   By the way, this is the last remaining Jim Crow law that I can find  in America. As so many things are being taken down left over from that  era, it is time we took down Davis-Bacon, too. So I would urge adoption  of my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Chairman, in response, I have heard a piece of  history revisionism. Now is the first time I recall, in all these  debates that we have had, that the purpose of Davis-Bacon, which does  produce a result of union scales imposed by, as I said earlier this  evening--it is not prevailing wage.                                time  0100    Employers that are nonunion don't report wages to the Federal  Government because the union comes to organize their employees. So the  thing that is called prevailing wage is a distortion of the reality. We  know this.   I have been in this business 42 years. I talked to a contractor just  a week ago who was a bridge contractor. He has been operating in rural  Missouri. In just this past year's numbers, unskilled laborers cost him  $45 an hour. There is no way that you go down to Missouri and hire  somebody that is unskilled and you have to pay them $45 an hour. For  somebody that is going to look through the chart, I should tell you it  is about $23 an hour for labor and $22 for fringe benefits. The fringe  benefits are to pay for your health insurance and your retirement  program. But some of these employees are on our ObamaCare, with their  premiums paid by other money that we borrow from China.   It is foolish for a fiscally responsible nation, trying to get to  balance, to have a David-Bacon law in place. And I will pound on this  drum until we come to our senses on this.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I  have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I would just conclude that this is  the first time I have heard that Davis-Bacon was formed to protect  minority migrant workers that came out of Alabama to work in New York.  That seems to me to be Members of Congress representing the folks that  are not their constituents. That would be one of the rare times also.   So that is history revisionism. This is a Jim Crow law. It needs to  go. It needs to be ripped out of the code at every opportunity.   Mr. Chairman, I would urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk made  in order under the rule.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to modify my  amendment by the modification at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her  consent to this unanimous consent request which will help expedite our  debate here on this long appropriations discussion that we are having.   This is the amendment that requires that E-Verify be used in all new  hires that are funded under this appropriation. And it is a well  established debate, I think, not only throughout the years of E-Verify,  but also throughout this evening.   It is all new hires, in conjunction with an offer of employment,  simply run their data through E-Verify. If it comes back from E-Verify  verifying that that information that is provided by the applicant  identifies an individual who can work legally in the United States,  that is the verification that the efficiency has gone way up into the  upper 90, 99 point something percentile.   Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Chairman, I would just reiterate that we are  getting reports that there are gaps in this enforcement and, spending  my life in a contracting business, I would remind the Members that we  have general contractors, we have first tier contractors,  [[Page H7087]]  we have second tier subcontractors, even third tier subcontractors, and  so we want to ensure that the enforcement is there of E-Verify. And I  want to thank everyone for their cooperation, and I urge the adoption  of my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
