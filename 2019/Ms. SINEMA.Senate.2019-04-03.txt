 I agree with my colleagues' statements and am proud to  continue the legacy of water policy leadership in Arizona. Water plays  a pivotal role for the environment, economic development, and cultural  heritage of Arizona, and I am proud to have worked closely with the  State of Arizona and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to keep  this process moving forward. Arizona takes a huge step towards securing  its water future under the Drought Contingency Plan. The plan provides  all Arizona communities, from Native American tribes to rural and  agricultural regions to metropolitan cities, with greater certainty for  reliable and secure water supplies. It shows what can be accomplished  when stakeholders work together. I thank my colleagues for the  discussion here today and urge passage of this legislation to ensure  all Colorado River Basin States are able to implement the DCP as soon  as possible.
