Without objection, it is so  ordered.                        Affordable Housing Tax Credit     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.                        Affordable Housing Tax Credit     Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to  talk about the affordable housing crisis in the United States of  America and to talk about the reintroduction of legislation from last  Congress that is going to be reintroduced by me, Senator Hatch, Senator  Wyden, Senator Heller, Senator Schumer, Senator Murkowski, and the  Acting President pro tempore--Senator Young--and several other of our  colleagues.   The reason we are introducing this important legislation is to say  that we need to increase the tax credit for affordable housing in the  United States. We are saying this because we know from reports and  statistics that we have a housing crisis in the United States of  America, and unless we increase the affordable housing tax credit, we  are not going to see much more new supply. That is because 90 percent  of the affordable housing that is built in the United States of America  is built with a tax credit.   Today, we are also releasing a report that is showing that the demand  for affordable housing is exploding and construction is definitely not  keeping pace. We are showing that seniors and veterans are at a greater  risk for homelessness and that about a 60-percent increase in the need  for affordable housing is being driven by Americans who are paying more  than 50 percent of their income in rent, making it an unaffordable  situation.   We are introducing this important legislation that, we hope, will  build 400,000 additional affordable housing units across the United  States and that will also help create additional jobs.   This is an issue that we are sending to the Finance Committee before,  and I would hope my colleagues on the Finance Committee would take  swift action. I say that because the report found three key factors.  One is an increase of 9 million renters since 2005. That is a huge  increase since 2005. How did we get there?   Over 7 million Americans lost their homes due to foreclosure in the  economic crisis. As a result, home ownership rates have been at their  lowest levels since the mid-1960s. Over the last 10 years, we have seen  the largest gain in the number of renters in any 10-year period of time  on record. That is right. We increased the number of renters in this  last 10-year period of time more than at any other time on the books.   It kind of makes sense if you think about it. If the economic crisis  caused you to downsize, and you were in a home and you could no longer  afford it,  [[Page S1593]]  you would put pressure on the rental market. For those already in the  rental market, it pushed many of them out of market-based rates and  into solutions that were less affordable. As we all know, in major  cities and urban areas across our country, it caused an actual  homelessness crisis, as well, as many people could no longer even  afford basic rent.   The affordable housing crisis is exploding all over the country, and  we face pressures from all sides. Demand for rental housing has  increased by 21 percent, but we are building units at the lowest rate  since 1970. It does not take more than basic economics to see that,  with demand so high and supply so low, we need to do something if we  are going to make a dent in this problem. If we do not increase the  Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, then, by the year 2025, we are going to  have 15 million Americans who are spending more than half of their  income on rent, and this is truly unacceptable.   Our report shows that in the last decade the total number of  Americans who have faced this extreme housing problem--that is, paying  more than half of their incomes in rent--ballooned by 60-percent, and  that has put a lot of pressure on many of our States. For my home  State, the affordability crisis is actually getting worse than the  national average. Since 2000, median rents have risen by 7.6 percent,  which is 2.5 percent higher than in the rest of the country. As I said,  it is all of those people coming from the foreclosure market into the  rental market. On average, there is about a 3.5-percent increase in  rents across the United States. In addition, there are 16 percent fewer  affordable rental homes available in Washington State compared to the  U.S. average. Overall, 400,000 Washingtonians are paying more than half  of their monthly incomes in rent.   We saw these numbers, and we saw specifically how seniors and  veterans and homelessness are also driving the increase in demand.  Senior unaffordability, which is the term given to people who are  paying more than half of their incomes in rent, rose by 30 percent.  With the veteran unaffordability, which is the number of the veterans  who are returning and being part of the housing market, we will see an  increase of over 500,000 veterans who need affordable housing.   I think the Acting President pro tempore knows well that in his home  State there are people who are trying to provide solutions in small  towns and urban areas for our veterans so that they can have affordable  places to live. The report also shows that doing nothing is going to  continue to exacerbate the problem. We will see another 25-percent  increase in unaffordability. That is just unacceptable.   To help solve the problem of affordable housing, my colleague, the  chairman of the Finance Committee, and I are reintroducing the  bipartisan Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act to strengthen and  expand the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit.   Under this provision, the expanded tax credit would help create and  preserve 1.3 million affordable homes over a 10-year period of time,  which would be an increase of 400,000 new units nationwide. According  to the National Association of Home Builders, annual LIHTC  development--this is the overall appropriation--supports approximately  95,700 jobs and $9.1 billion in wages. Investing in the low-income  housing tax credit, which gives our citizens more affordable housing,  is good for them, but it is also good for our economy. Enacting the  proposal would create an additional 450,000 jobs over the next 10 years  and would support the construction of these important units.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a letter from the National Association of Home Builders that talks  about the economic benefit of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and  this particular proposal, with their estimates of increased Federal  revenue of $11.4 billion, State and local revenue of $5.6 billion, and  a total of 452,000 jobs being created in that 10-year period of time.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                             National Association of                                                   Home Builders,                                  Washington, DC, November 11, 2016.      Hon. Maria Cantwell,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Cantwell: As requested by your staff, the       Economics Group of the National Association of Home Builders       (NAHB) has provided the economic impacts of multifamily       construction as part of a review of S. 3237, the Affordable       Housing Credit Improvement Act of 2016.        Our estimate relies on both internal NAHB data as well as       data provided to us by external sources. Estimates of per-      unit revenue and employment impacts have been calculated       using NAHB's home building and remodeling economic impact       model.

In total, NAHB estimates that the new 400,000 units would       result in 452,000 jobs as well as a gross increase in federal       revenues of $11.4 billion, and state and local revenues of       $5.6 billion, over ten years.

Sincerely,                                            Robert Dietz, Ph.D.,                                           Chief Economist, National                                      Association of Home Builders.     Mr. President, I enter that into the Record because it  is so important for our colleagues not to get stymied over the next  several months, as we discuss proposals for economic development and  for infrastructure across the United States, and not take action on  this issue because we do not know how we can afford it. What we cannot  afford is the rising number of Americans who no longer can afford rent  or home ownership. What we need to do is to make sure that there is a  roof over their heads and that they can be productive parts of our  economy.   Since its creation over the last 30 years, this tax credit has  financed nearly 2.9 million homes across the United States, leveraging  more than $100 billion in private sector investment. That is what I  like most--a little bit of the tax credit going a long way to leverage  the private sector into making investments in affordable housing.  Between 1986 and 2013, more than 13 million people have lived in homes  that have been financed by this tax credit.   I hope my colleagues will take a look at this legislation that we are  introducing today and help us support it. The crisis is real across  America. Our report shows the crisis is only going to be exacerbated  because of demographics and demand. The best way out of this problem is  for us to make an investment that only we can make, as 90 percent of  the affordable homes are built with the tax credit. Without increasing  the tax credit by 50 percent, we are just writing our own statistics  for a very, very dire situation across the United States of America.   I see communities in my State that look like and reflect pictures  that I have seen from the Great Depression. I know the recession hit us  hard, but we have to climb out of this homelessness problem by making  an investment in the affordable housing tax credit. It is a bipartisan  success. I hope we can make its expansion a bipartisan solution that we  all can get behind.   I thank the Acting President pro tempore.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
