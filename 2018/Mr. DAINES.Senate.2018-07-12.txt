 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Betsey Hedrick of Dawson County for her contribution to the  community through Betsey's Badlands Catering.   Betsey was born and raised in Bozeman. After graduating from high  school, she attended culinary school in Portland, which led her to work  at a local country club and eventually run a steakhouse back in  Bozeman. She and her husband, Phil, moved to Glendive 14 years ago, had  their son Sam, and shortly after, she opened Betsey's Badlands  Catering.   Fixing food has always been Betsey's passion. Her favorite part about  cooking is not what she is cooking or who she is cooking for; it is the  impact that food has on people. No matter people's backgrounds or  history, food brings them together. She loves being a part of something  that brings joy to people's lives, and that is why she continues to do  it daily.   I congratulate Betsey on her significant contributions to Glendive  and the greater Dawson County. I look forward to seeing her business  grow and trying some of her famous seasonal dishes soon.                            ____________________
