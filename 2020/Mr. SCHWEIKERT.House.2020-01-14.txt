 Madam Speaker, to our stenographer, if I start  talking too fast, just give me that horrible look because my staff was  telling me last week that I was sounding like a machine gun.   Madam Speaker, this is something I try to do at least half an hour  every week. It is basically to have a little bit of honesty about math  and a little optimism about what policy can do to make things work.   Once again, I have a couple of my old slides here. I am sorry that I  haven't been able to update them because there are some new numbers,  but it is a really simple concept. Let's walk through it.   How many times do you hear Members from both the right and the left  get on television and talk about things? Why does no one talk about the  debt and deficits? I can tell you why we don't talk about the debt and  deficits, because to tell the truth of what is driving the debt and  deficits is really uncomfortable.   We are going to try to do a little bit of that math honesty because  it is demographics. It turns out, demographics are not Republican or  Democratic. It is just math.   We continue to exist in this pretend world, saying: Well, if we would  tax rich people more, if we get rid of waste and fraud--none of those.   I have brought these charts here before. There are fractions of  fractions of variance.   Why is it so hard for us to tell the truth? Why is it so hard for us  to own calculators? We basically are a math-free zone.   This slide is a few months old, and I am sorry about that because  there is optimism on the tax cuts in the revenues. As you all know,  last fiscal year, we broke over 4 percent revenue growth in a time with  lower rates, which none of us modeled. The economy is doing really well  there.                                time  1415    Demands on social services have fallen fairly dramatically because of  the incredibly robust labor environment. Discretionary spending, turns  out the caps that that line is about, the benefits we were getting from  the caps, when we did the budgetary deal functionally in September and  October, we blew up the caps. So this line is bigger; this line is  smaller.   But the punch line here is really, really simple: 90 percent of  rising debt deficits between 2019, so last fiscal year, and 2029--90  percent Social Security and Medicare.   Now, those are earned entitlements. We have a societal obligation to  keep our promises. But it is mostly Medicare. So we can't have an  honest conversation here about debt unless you are willing to actually  have an honest conversation about medical costs, healthcare costs.   We are going to pull some slides here that I am just incredibly  optimistic that we could actually have a revolution in healthcare  costs, but the only way that happens is this place has to grow up  intellectually and join this century of technology and opportunities  because, once again, let's go back a decade.   The ACA, ObamaCare, what was it really? It was a financing mechanism.  [[Page H226]]  It was who got subsidized and who had to pay.   What did we, as Republicans, do? I still think ours was much better.  It wasn't who got subsidized and who had to pay; it was who had to pay  and who got subsidized.   We basically debate about healthcare financing. We do not have honest  conversations about how to crash the price, because it is a really  uncomfortable conversation because the things that would crash the  price often actually make us have to have very uncomfortable  conversations with our constituencies.   The different groups that are wandering the hallways right across the  street right now lobbying us for this or that, they believe in their  causes. They are wonderful people. But there is a disruption of  technology.   So let's sort of walk through the math once again so we understand  that we could have this amazing future if we could just focus on the  facts.   This is a slide I have been showing almost for a year. If you and I  remove Social Security and Medicare out of the 30-year projection, we  have $23 trillion in the bank. If we pull Social Security and  Medicare--and this chart is not inflation adjusted, so you could remove  about a third of it if you want to do constant dollars and you will see  the difference of what is actual spending and then the financing costs,  the interest on those. But if you pull Social Security and Medicare  back into that number, we are $103 trillion in debt.   So think about that difference: 23 cash positive, $103 trillion in  debt.   For those of you who care about your Medicare, you care about Social  Security, you actually want these to exist, we must be honest about the  math, because if we don't get our act together, we are going to get  squeezed and there are no more dollars.   It is math. It is not Republican math; it is not Democratic math; it  is demographics.   We have 73 million of us who are baby boomers. We are about halfway  through retirement. That is what is driving the future debt.   So the next time you hear someone walk behind a microphone and say,  ``I am very concerned about the excess spending; I am very concerned  about debt and deficits,'' if their next sentence isn't, ``And I am  going to work on a revolution to change the costs of healthcare and the  things we provide,'' they are not being honest about how we save this  society or how we save this country.   So, one more time, just to get our heads around the scale of the  problem, and then we are going to actually talk about solutions.   This is a 2024 chart, so it is only what? Now, that is 3 fiscal years  from now.   Nondefense, this is discretionary. This is what we get to vote on.  This is defense. Everything you see in a blue shade there is on  autopilot.   Do you notice something? The vast majority of spending is on  autopilot. We don't vote on it. We don't do policy on it, and it is  consuming everything.   So get our heads around something. Just the growth, just the growth  of Social Security, Medicare, and the healthcare entitlements, over the  next 5 years, just the growth portion equals one of these wedges. It  functionally equals the entire Defense Department spending.   So, if you are someone who walks in the door and says, ``Well, we  spend too much money on defense; get rid of it,'' do you realize you  just took care of only 5 years of the growth? What do you want to do  with everything else? Over 10 years, it equals all the discretionary  spending.   Once again, it is demographics.   Why is this place so uncomfortable to talk about that? Because it  violates the pitches we go home and tell our voters. But it is math and  it is honest, and if we keep avoiding the subject, the future becomes  incredibly ugly. If we take it on, there is a path where things work.   So every week I come behind this microphone and I say, here is where  the problem is, but here are solutions. And the very last slide is the  one we do all the time, where we believe we have a formula where you  grow the economy very aggressively. You do things from tax policy to  immigration policy to trade policy that maximize economic velocity, and  you are seeing some of that right now.   If I had come to this room a couple of years ago and said we are  going to live in a time where we have more jobs than available workers,  where the bottom 10 percent, the working poor in our society, have had  the fastest growing wages in modern times, basically double what the  mean is--it is working.   We should be, actually, as Republicans and Democrats, trying to  figure out what is working, particularly for those quartiles--and I  hate that term--those quartiles in our population that we were writing  off a couple of years ago: You don't have a high school degree, you  don't have skills, we are writing you off. You are part of the  permanent underclass.    That was brutal. It was arrogant. It was vicious. It was wrong.   We know, right now, over the last couple of years, the movement of  wages for those very people we were writing off 3 years ago, it is  working.   How do we keep that going?   If you love and care about people, we need to keep this going,  because, in my lifetime, there has never been a period of this type of  economic growth and stability. Let's keep it going.   But let's not pretend that our future isn't buried in debt. Once  again, if we take a look at it, it is substantially the growth of  Medicare.   I intend that this Congress is going to keep its promises, but,  mathematically, we are not going to keep our promises unless we  actually deal with the reality.   So when we have come in here, we have tried to show that there is a  path, but beyond the economic growth issues.   We have labor force participation. You can't grow the economy unless  our brothers and sisters are working, and those are folks who are both  older, but we still have a problem with millennial men.   We had a miracle begin a year ago, December, where millennial females  started entering the labor force in droves. The math right now says  there are more females in the labor market than there are males.   Those are good things, because when we did tax reform, the joint tax  folks, you know, the 50 of them who are all freaky smart, said your two  problems of continuing the economic expansion will be capital stock-- and I know I am getting a little geeky, and I am sorry--but capital  stock, available capital for lending, for borrowing, for the growth,  and people, available labor.   It turns out they were completely wrong on the capital stock. We have  had hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars more in what we call  repatriation come back into the country than we had originally modeled.  People are saving much more of their tax savings from tax reform than  we ever modeled.   So the United States now is flush with cash. This is working over  here. We have great capital stock, and you see it in our interest  rates.   Our biggest fragility right now for continued economic expansion is  actually labor participation. Now, there are miracles there.   Sure, because we are all really geeky, we all ran and looked at the  U-6 unemployment numbers last Friday--not the top line, not where we  stayed at 3.5, but the actual, what we used to talk about for years,  ``What is the real unemployment?'' and you saw now we are in the sixes.  We broke below 7 percent of real unemployment.   These are the folks who had become and we wrote off as discouraged  workers, not participating; their skill sets are outdated. All of a  sudden, they are entering the labor force.   We need public policy that continues to encourage that. How do you do  that? How do you take someone who says, ``I am older, but I am still a  skilled worker; yeah, I might need an employer that is willing to make  some accommodations for me,'' how do we create policies that  incentivize that?   For our millennial males, how do we create policies that incentivize  them? Because if we don't have that labor participation, we can't grow  the economy.   The other things that also get uncomfortable, and we are going to  talk about those today, is: How do you have a disruption, a disruption  in the cost of healthcare?   I want to argue and I am going to make you an argument that we are  living on the cusp of miracles.  [[Page H227]]    On one hand, we have technology. Many of you are carrying it in your  pocket. That cell phone, that supercomputer, and the new sensors and  other things, the ability to stay healthy, the ability to know when you  have a problem.   Then, on the other side, the miracle cures, the single-shot cure for  hemophilia that will be here this year, the experiment that is going on  that cures sickle cell anemia. We are in the time of miracles.   Why this side is so important on my little upside-down bell curve is  5 percent of our population is the majority of our healthcare spending.  It is our brothers and sisters who have chronic conditions.   What happens if we could get our act together and, through a series  of financing and policy and licensing, these new biologic drugs, these  new small-molecule drugs, these new things we are learning, get them to  market and we are curing people who are part of that 5 percent of  chronic conditions? Even if we can cure parts of their struggles, it is  wonderful for society, and it is also really good for the cost of  healthcare.   So we are going to touch base on just some things that I find fun,  because it is part of the--and I know I overuse this term--thought  experiment of what is coming.   So we now have almost complete miracles of technology. This is  something that was just shown last week at the Consumer Electronics  Show. This is a defibrillator you can carry in your purse. You can  almost carry it in your pocket. It is just handheld.   This type of technology, as you now know, with the new types of  pacemakers, the new abilities to help someone manage everything from  hypertension to arrhythmia to now actually being able to restart a  heart, this is at the Consumer Electronics Show.   We need to think about these types of disruptions.   Here is one. It turns out, if you were to take a look at how many  Americans will lose their life to heart disease, to a heart attack, we  now have the ability to monitor, with just almost a single pod like  this in your home, just a single patch you put on, talking to your  phone. These concepts crash the price of that disease if we could get  them adopted.   It means we, as policymakers, have to figure out everything from the  elegance of the licensing mechanisms--which the FDA does get some  credit. They have been trying to create some kind of a third rail.    If you wear one of the Apple watches, you realize parts of that are  coming on a new third rail of: Is it technology? Is it a health device?   These things are coming, and we are building models now that show  they can help crash the price of keeping people healthy.   One of the slides I did not bring today but we have talked to the  professor, the thing that looks like a big kazoo. I am sorry. This is  the best way we have to describe it.   You blow into it, and it instantly knows if you have the flu,  instantly can bounce off your medical records if you are carrying them  on your phone and instantly can order your antivirals.   So this could be in your medicine cabinet at home. You blow into it.  They think the future version will be able to pick up bacterial  infections, and the one a couple of years in the future will pick up as  many as 20 different cancer proteins.   And it is a kazoo. You blow into it. We call it a flu kazoo in our  office. People laugh at me for that, but they remember it.   Do you know that technology is illegal?   Think about that. The thing you would blow into that instantly knows  you have the flu, that instantly can ping your medical records, knows  that you are not allergic or are allergic to this particular antiviral,  orders that antiviral and that Lyft or Uber or somehow gets it to your  door an hour later, that process right now is illegal under many of our  State laws under the way we reimburse under the Social Security Act  because an algorithm is writing the prescription.   Should Congress, a few years ago, have slowed down the internet to  protect Blockbuster video from Netflix?   You have got to understand, we have these disruptions in our society;  we live with them all the time; but we sometimes need to step back and  say: Okay. I like going home and hitting a button on my television and  seeing all those movies instead of going and getting the little silver  disc.                                time  1430    Apparently, Blockbuster Video didn't have armies of lobbyists walking  up and down the hallways here in Washington, D.C. trying to protect  their portion of the business model.   The technology is here that could crash the price of healthcare. Is  that Republican or Democrat? I am going to argue it is just necessary.  We do not have a choice. Do you remember the earlier boards? They were  about if we don't have a revolution in healthcare costs.   So part of that same thought experiment, over that next 30 years you  saw the majority of the debt and deficits are driven by Medicare.  Thirty percent of that spending is just diabetes. What happens if--and  I accept diabetes I and II are incredibly complex, there are autoimmune  issues, there are lifestyle issues, it is complex, but just as part of  the thought experiment--the single biggest impact you could have on  future deficit spending is a cure for diabetes. Does that help sort of  put it into perspective?   Let's actually walk through a couple of these. It turns out, remember  how I said I think it is sort of an upside-down cure? On this side is  the use of technology to keep us healthy to be able to manage our  health issues, if you need a pharmaceutical get it quickly, get it  through use of technology; over here is the curative.   It turns out we are now coming across some studies that are talking  about some of the new gene therapies that are crazy expensive, except  the model is because of the cures they are producing, it will save  billions of dollars in the future because you are cured. The miracles  are coming.   Have you seen what we are able to do now in what we call CAR T? That  is where we find out the type of cancer you have, we see what types of  proteins it is producing, what T cells would properly attack it, and we  set your body's immune system to attack. Some of the companies that are  producing this technology actually give you a guarantee that if it  doesn't work, you don't pay.   We just had a breakthrough a couple weeks ago, it turns out that we  may be able to not only grow these in a petri dish, but we may be able  to grow parts of those first immune responses to these types of  diseases in an agnostic fashion before it is customized to you, so the  price is about to crash. What is the value of curing your cancer  instead of trying to find a way where you live with it for decades?   This place needs to think through the benefits of: How do we finance  the cures? And this is where it gets a little political. I am sorry I  am going to hurt some people's feelings, but there is a bill that has  moved through this House called H.R. 3. It was a drug pricing bill. If  you will be honest and sit and read it in detail, it is basically the  keep Big Pharma protected bill because what it does is it wipes out all  the small biologic, small molecule companies that are the disrupters.   These are the ones, you know, the product clearance is really simple.  The drug that cures hemophilia is here. It is going to be like a  million-and-a-half bucks a shot, but in many parts of the country  hemophilia A may be a half a million dollars a year for the clotting  factor and everything that goes with that. A million-and-a-half dollars  a shot is a great investment. You are back in the money after 3 or 4  years. Our discussion should be financing that and getting those rolled  out into society really fast.   But if H.R. 3 had existed when they were starting to research that  drug, that drug would not be here. In a perverse way, the incentives  are, without that drug, the ways of pharma and the infrastructure  around that disease, they don't have a disruption. They are not put out  of business by a cure.   H.R. 3, I know some of my brothers and sisters on the Democratic  side, we have worked on it, we have talked about it, they mean well.  There are actually some good things in the bill. But the basic  reference pricing mechanisms that come with it, importing the European  model, which in Great Britain a  [[Page H228]]  year of healthy life is worth, I think $38,000. So if the drug costs  more than $38,000, even though it gives you a year of healthy life,  they don't buy it. And that is what this bill does, it imports that  pricing mechanism into our market.   It is absurd because we should be looking at both pricing mechanisms  that crash the price where we can, but cure. How do we cure our  brothers and sisters who are part of that 5 percent who have chronic  conditions that are the drivers?   We just passed a bill through this body that basically protects Big  Pharma's current monopolies and wipes out the disrupters that were  going to take their market share. They did it with glee because I think  the hatred of Big Pharma blinded from understanding who actually won  and who gets to just change their business model a little bit and stay  protected and who you just wiped out, because that would wipe out those  miracles that are coming.   I know that is partisan, and I don't mean to hurt anyone's feelings,  but it is the math of the legislation. So these are important.   Another thought, if you want to have a real disruption that you could  do before the end of this year, half the pharmaceuticals that will be  picked up today at pharmacies will not be used or will not be used  properly. Our model says it is a half a trillion dollars a year from  not using your pharmaceuticals properly. The person that doesn't take  their hypertension pills and ends up having an aneurism, the person  over here that takes too many, or the person over here gets confused.  Half a trillion dollars a year for noncompliance with pharmaceutical  regimes, and half the pharmaceuticals that will be picked up today will  not be used or will not be used properly.   The thought experiment is really simple. Go look in your own medicine  cabinet. Take a look, and what is sitting in there? What is the value  of what is sitting in there? Let's be honest. Almost all of us, if we  go, yes, I probably do have hundreds of dollars of value sitting there.  Let's just go after one small portion, the efficacy, the person who, if  they really take their hypertension pill every morning, and there is a  miracle, we think there might be a one- or two-shot-a-year system about  to come that may actually intervene instead of having to take the daily  pill--but I don't mean to take us down that side.    How about a pill bottle that pings you and says, Hey, Bob, you didn't  take your hypertension pill this morning. Don't forget, this is really  important. It turns out, just that $20 piece of technology would save  billions of dollars of healthcare costs and stop many tragedies in our  families.   I have actually brought the board here that is actually for seniors  that looks a little bit like a dome that drops the pills into a little  cup and then notifies you, because some people have regimes where they  need to take this one in the morning, this one during lunch, these  three before going to bed to stay stable. And how many of us have ever  had that moment saying, Now did I take it? Did I remember? This  technology exists. We need to think about making those as part of our  formulary, so we are reimbursed. Because it turns out in those cases it  is not the price of the pharmaceutical, it is our efficacy of how we  take them. Half a trillion dollars a year, because we don't stay on our  regimes of our pharmaceutical prescriptions properly.   If you wanted to have a disruption in healthcare costs tomorrow, make  high-value pharmaceuticals, put them in a double blister pack, put them  in a cartridge so they stay sterile, and make them returnable. Use  technology like this so we take our pharmaceuticals as we are supposed  to. Make it so it could also talk to family members or even the  physicians' assistants to call in and say, Betty, we are getting a  notice that you haven't been opening your pill bottle. The technology  is here. Why do we fight it?   Here is also a level of disruption that was being shown at the  consumer electronics show, but I need to put this a little more in  context.   In the Phoenix area we have an experiment going on. I am blessed, I  represent, I truly believe, the greatest congressional district you  could ever imagine. I have north Phoenix and Scottsdale, and I have a  lot of freaky-smart people in our community and moving into our  community. And there is this one business, a couple autonomous  automobile engineers got together and said, Hey, we have made a lot of  money, we want to take on the biggest issue in our society, which is  the cost of healthcare. Let's try an experiment. Let's see if we can  create autonomous healthcare clinics.   Think of this, you walk into a Safeway grocery store--it is a little  unfortunate, they are in former Theranos spots, but you all get that  joke--but you walk in the door, you pick up the iPad, you sign in. You  take a picture of your driver's license, a picture of your insurance  card. You walk into a booth alone. The instructions pop up on the  screen. You put your arm in this, you hold this up, you follow an  avatar, you shine this in your mouth, your nose, your ears, you do  this, you look into this, and it turns out the algorithm is stunningly  accurate. And I believe they have had a couple of their algorithms now  certified by the FDA. And there are a dozen clinics now or they have a  dozen clinics in a dozen grocery stores.   Are we willing to make that technology legal? Because at the end they  have to bring a doctor on the screen to meet the laws. Well, what would  happen if that autonomous--what they call in some of the literature,  they now refer to them as sensor clinics or sensor healthcare, but we  need to think about this. This is here. It is coming very fast.   It turns out at the electronics show last week they were showing one  that is a micro size that you could have in your medicine cabinet that  does many of those very same types of tests and the algorithm  apparently is freaky accurate and can do all sorts of diagnostics. Are  we ready for this?   Last year I came and showed a box--that actually is sort of what  Theranos had promised, but it actually now exists--it is from an  Israeli company, it is certified in the EU, that does all sorts of  blood tests. The technology now exists. It is not being offered here  because it is too hard to hit our market at this point.   Go back to the beginning slides. The debt and deficit are  functionally being driven by our demographics. The cost of those  demographics is our healthcare. Are we going to continue to have the  absurd debate around here of financing options, which may have effects?  There are parts of it that are good, but they don't have a disruption.  Are we going to find a way to promote, legalize the next-generation  technology that can crash the price of healthcare and make us healthier  and cure many of the diseases that crush our brothers and sisters?   So back again--the slide we either start with or end with--we believe  to take on the debt-ridden future and keep us from breaking through  that 95 percent debt-to-GDP it is not a single solution. Today we just  did healthcare technology disruption. But it is everything. It turns  out it is economic policies that grow because if we don't grow the  math, you can't get anywhere.   Population stability, how do we incentivize family formations? How do  you build an immigration system that is much more talent-based,  because--let's be brutally honest--since 1971, the United States has  been below replacement rate in our birth rates. The last few years we  have actually had fairly stable economic times, the last 2 years, great  economic times, and our birth rates are still falling.   There is a paper I have in my office that says, in about 8, 9, 10  years, two workers, one retiree. The math doesn't work. So what do you  do to encourage family formation? For some Republicans we are going to  have to really step up and think about that.   But also for immigration, you need to move to a talent-based system.  The elegance of that is you don't care about someone's religion, their  race, who they cuddle with, or where they come from. But what you do  care about is what they bring to our society to maximize economic  expansion. In many ways it is a much more honest and elegant system  than this carve-out system that we have today.    Changing the way or creating benefits incentives within the benefits  of Social Security and Medicare to stay in the labor force or to come  back into the labor force or become a part-time entrepreneur, we need  to fix the way we tax certain benefits, the way we  [[Page H229]]  crush people if they are still saving when they are older. We need to  deal with the reality of how much longer baby boomers are going to be  living. And we have got to get our labor force participation numbers  up. It turns out all these things tie together. You can't do one  without doing the others to get the economic benefits of it.   And that is what terrifies me about our place here: Are we capable of  doing complex policy, when over here I am doing immigration issues, and  over here I am doing tax reform issues, and over here I am doing trade  issues, and over here I am doing healthcare technology issues; and  understanding they are all sympathetic to each other, they all tie  together to create the economic philosophy and the changes in our cost  structure together? When what we have here is a place where we fight  over the naming of a post office.   I understand we are living in a time of political rage, and that is  how so many people raise money, how they hold office.                                time  1445    I have a 4-year-old daughter. I am 57 with a 4-year-old daughter. My  wife, the same.   You know I am pathologically optimistic, but I am optimistic because  I get to get behind this microphone and advocate for what I believe is  an actual path that saves us from a debt-ridden future.   I have been doing this now for a year, saying here is the problem,  but also offering the steps of a solution.   I will go back to my office now, and the phones won't ring. There  won't be any text messages or emails from even fellow Members, let  alone the world, saying: Hey, David, can you tell me about this  technology? Can you tell me about this? How do we help?   If we don't have that revolution, I am terrified.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy) for the  purposes of a colloquy.    Madam Speaker, I wish he would tell that story more.    Madam Speaker, look, in some ways, telling the truth  is like soaking yourself in kerosene and running around with a lighter.   Congress has functionally become a protection racket. The armies in  our hallways, both with Democrats and Republicans, say, ``We like this  technology, but,'' and the ``but'' always happens to be, ``you are  going to blow up my business model.''   How do we as policymakers stop having the arrogance of thinking we  know what the future is and, instead, design the rules, reimbursements,  licensing, and mechanisms that all go with that so the best technology  is constantly winning and today's winner, it turns out, gets crushed  tomorrow because a better one comes along?   Today the way we do it is we build walls of protection that say,  ``This is good. Yeah, there is something incredibly good over here,  but.''   That is why I use that Blockbuster video example. We all sort of  accepted that, hey, we used to go get the little silver disk and shove  it in the machine. The creepy guy would give us movie recommendations.  He was creepy, but his movie recommendations were really good.   Today, we go home and hit a button. We just lived through that, and  the world didn't come to an end.   When it comes to healthcare technology particularly--and I do a  similar presentation on environmental technology. There is stunning  stuff that could revolutionize those issues. If you are concerned with  global warming or greenhouse gases, the technology is here, yet we  don't talk about it because we know what we know. The problem is, much  of what I and others know is a decade out of date.    Madam Speaker, we have to be a little careful because  I find there are certain insurance companies that are ready to offer a  technology, sensor-based healthcare, but it is illegal.   There are hospitals I have worked with that desperately want to do an  outreach in the community, where they are using data and algorithms to  keep people healthy and to know when there is an issue coming.   It is not only us as Members of Congress and what we know and don't  know, and the arrogance of how we often do pieces of legislation where  we don't future-proof it to use it, and also the incentives that are  built in to surviving election, raising money, everything there, I will  also argue our bureaucracies have become calcified.   The bureaucracies now have become incredible barriers when they say:  ``Well, we don't see that in the rules; therefore, you can't do it.  Yes, it would help society. Yes, it would make us healthier. Yes, it  would.''    Exactly, Madam Speaker. States are going to be a real  issue, and then different lobbying organizations and different  constituencies.    Guess what? We don't have a choice. The single biggest threat to our  Nation is the massive wave of debt that is here.   One of our charts, in just a decade or two, we are running $2\1/2\  trillion, almost approaching $3 trillion, deficits. It is almost all  solely driven by our demographics. We have gotten older.    Madam Speaker, I enjoyed it.   Madam Speaker, there is a path. Will we step up and understand that  the path turns out to be complicated? We are going to make some of our  constituencies just elated with the opportunity to change. We are also  going to terrify some of our constituencies.   There is a way to get there, and believe it or not, it is technology.  It is not Republican technology. It is not Democratic technology. It  turns out it is math, and the math will always win.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
