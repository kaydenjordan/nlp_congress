 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  legacy of our dear friend, Reverend Kevin Cox, as a longtime servant in  the ministry.   Reverend Cox started out his journey as a CPA, but the Lord brought  him quickly into the blessings of pastoral ministry. From his very  first pastorate at First Pentecostal Church in a small town in Florida  in 1980, to now retiring after 16 years as Louisiana's district  superintendent for the United Pentecostal Church International,  Reverend Cox has diligently answered the call of God.   He and his late wife, Delisa, and their two sons, who now have  beautiful families of their own, were never afraid to move where the  Lord led.   Psalm 37:23 states that ``the steps of a good man are ordered by the  Lord: and He delighteth in his way.''   Mr. Speaker, well done to Brother Cox. The Lord surely delights in  his way. We are thankful for his years of service to the kingdom, and  the blessings he has been to countless many people, including  Louisiana's Fourth Congressional District. God bless him in his  endeavors throughout retirement.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  call up H.R. 682, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from  behind screens and back in the classroom.
