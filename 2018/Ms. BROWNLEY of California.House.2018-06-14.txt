 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I am  deeply concerned that the Department of Veterans Affairs is missing  nearly a dozen key, very important leaders, which is a grave disservice  to our Nation's veterans.   It has been 4 weeks since the President announced his latest VA  Secretary nominee, but he has yet to formally submit the nomination to  the Senate. The VA has been without a permanent Under Secretary for  Health since February of 2017, and there are at least nine Deputy Under  Secretaries and Assistant Deputy Secretary positions without a  permanent appointee.   Without strong, steady leadership, how will the VA provide the best  healthcare and timely benefits our Nation's veterans deserve?   The President must take responsibility for these failures of  leadership and immediately prioritize identifying, properly vetting,  and appointing the qualified leaders the VA needs because this ``vacant  VA'' is an insult to our heroes.                            ____________________
