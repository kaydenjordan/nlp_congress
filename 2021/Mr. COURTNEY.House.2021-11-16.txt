 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, November 15, at about 3 o'clock  in the afternoon, President Biden signed into law the bipartisan  infrastructure bill, which, for a lot of us who have been serving  around here, was an incredibly gratifying and important moment in terms  of really finally getting this country ahead of the curve in terms of  critical investments for infrastructure.   Last Wednesday night, I held a telephone townhall on the  infrastructure bill because the House had passed the measure on  November 5. We had 7,000 people on the call who were either on the  phone or streaming in. Lots of questions, lots of excitement.  Connecticut is obviously a State that has been settled really since the  origins of our Nation and has some of the oldest infrastructure in the  country.   Mr. Speaker, I would note, however, that some of the questions that  came in said, Well, only 10 percent of the bill is for hard  infrastructure, for surface transportation. What's up with that?   And I was joined by Don Shubert, who is the executive director of the  Connecticut Construction Industries Association, who was quick to jump  into the call and point out the fact that if you step back and look at  this bill, it is a continuation of the last infrastructure bill which  passed in 2015, the FAST Act, which passed on a bipartisan basis and  was signed into law by President Obama, and was extended twice by  President Trump.   Again, that baseline was kind of keeping the lights on for  infrastructure. It was not, however, getting us ahead of the curve in  terms of the changes that are happening in other countries around the  world. And with the new money that was included in the bipartisan  infrastructure bill, we are seeing a huge increase, both in roads and  bridges, but also in rail, also in the electric grid, also in  broadband, which is now critical for any economic development for small  communities to be able to tell companies and businesses that they have  high speed internet.   So what does that mean in terms of the State of Connecticut? It means  that the roads and the bridges--which again is a big focus--got a 32  percent increase in terms of the State's allotment, which will flow  through the State's Department of Transportation.   Some of the old bridges in our State--again, the largest vehicle  bridge is the Gold Star Bridge, which is part of the I-95 corridor, has  been getting a pounding since it was built in 1943. The northbound lane  right now, quite frankly, is so compromised that large trucks are  basically not given permits to travel across that bridge. Again, it is  part of the Interstate Highway System. It is a $250 million job.   This bill will make sure that that funding is there. It is a project  labor agreement, so it is going to be union labor and apprenticeship  programs incorporated into the work that is there.   Again, there are countless other small bridges, medium-size bridges  in the district. There is a swing bridge over the Connecticut River in  East Haddam, Connecticut, that was built 108 years ago that breaks  down, interferes with boat traffic going up and down the Connecticut  River, that now has got full funding and is slated for repairs.   Also, in terms of the rail piece, which is separate from roads and  bridges, $66 billion, a big investment in the Northeast Corridor.  Across the Connecticut River, there is the Old Saybrook Bridge, which  is 114 years old. Anyone who sails underneath it and sees, again, how  fragile the supports are for that bridge, it is screaming out for  repairs. That project now will be fully funded as a result of this  legislation.   The Coast Guard Academy, which is in New London, Connecticut, is  going to get $53 million to repair the barracks and the dormitories.  Again, anyone looking at the age of those buildings, which some of our  future leaders for the Coast Guard are going to school there, is  getting a long overdue upgrade. As well as a city pier in New London  where the USS Eagle--which is the proud sort of flagship of the U.S.  Coast Guard--will now be able to tie up to modern infrastructure that  is there.  [[Page H6270]]    There is a host of other smaller projects in Tolland and Windham  Counties that are included in this package. Again, I would emphasize  that the total funding amount is not what some of the stuff that is out  there in the media in terms of small fractions for hard infrastructure.  The fact is when you incorporate the FAST Act baseline that was passed  in 2015, along with the bipartisan infrastructure funding on top of it,  the roads and bridges is close to 40 percent of the package. It also  includes increasing and boosting the electric grid; which as we convert  to electric vehicle passenger traffic, as we convert to offshore wind,  which is going to be transmitting voltage to the coastline, we need to  have a stronger grid.    All of that is good jobs that is going to be, again, built-in, baked- in over the next five years. It is not going to create inflationary  pressures because of the fact that, again, it is spread out over a  period of time.   It was a great day for our country. We came together on a bipartisan  basis to get this done and now we are ready for a real 21st century  growth that will be beneficial to all communities large and small.                            ____________________
