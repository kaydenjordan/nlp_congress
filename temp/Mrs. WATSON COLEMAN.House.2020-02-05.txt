 Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me say that my  heart hurts for my colleague and my sister, Lucy McBath, as she  confronts on a daily basis the pain of our failure to act on sensible  gun safety legislation.   I rise today, as many of my colleagues will, almost one year since  the House took the steps to curb violence by passing H.R. 8, a bill  that has yet to receive any consideration in the Senate.   We are in the middle of Gun Violence Survivors Week. Yet, despite  survivors' calls for action; despite the calls of parents and friends  who have lost loved ones to guns; despite the calls from our young  people who just want to be safe in school; and despite our calls of the  communities who want to be safe in their homes, we have yet to get H.R.  8, or any other gun violence bill considered in the Senate.   The paralysis around preventing gun violence is disgusting, and it is  deadly. This story line that preventing people from buying assault  weapons or stockpiling ammunition is somehow infringing upon their  rights is deeply hurtful, and it is wrong thinking.   Including suicides by guns, there were 177 deaths on New Year's Day  alone. There were three mass shootings, and the lives lost included  three children between the ages of 12 and 17. That's just one day, the  first day of this year. Yet, Republicans in the Senate continue to  refuse to move any bill that might keep more families from getting that  phone call.   There are so many options available to us. There is the baseline,  bipartisan bill, like, H.R. 8, that we have already passed in the  House. There are bills that would go even further, like my own Handgun  Licensing and Registration Act of 2019, and the Stop Online Ammunition  Sales Act of 2019.   One would require registration for handgun purchases, just like the  government requires registration and basic standards for voting,  operating a vehicle, even opening a business. It would ensure  accountability and allow enforcement to identify threats.   The other places a very basic principle into law; that you shouldn't  be able to stockpile bullets without ID or without law enforcement  being aware.   Mr. Speaker, there are bills that would keep guns out of the hands of  violent criminals, and bills that would push us to study gun violence  as the health crisis it is. So far, none of these seem to be good  enough for most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, or the  other side of the Capitol.   We are approaching a point from which we cannot return, where failure  to act will normalize gun violence in our schools, in our  neighborhoods, and in our society.   The survivors that we honor today, the families of those we have  lost, and the countless Americans who wonder if they might be next  deserve so much more from us.  [[Page H770]]    I stand here today representing all of the loss of the survivors and  what they have experienced. But I stand here, representing the hope  that my granddaughter, Kamryn Anne Marie Watson, is safe in her school,  just like all of the other children should be. Nothing less is  acceptable.                            ____________________
