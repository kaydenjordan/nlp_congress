As early as preschool, discriminatory policies and practices push  them out of the classroom. This push-out crisis and its  disproportionate impact on our girls continued even as the pandemic hit  and schools went remote.   Last year, we learned the story of Grace, a 15-year-old Black student  who was sent to juvenile detention for not completing her online  coursework. At a time where our children needed to be kept safe in a  volatile crisis, Grace was dehumanized and taken away from her family  and her health put at risk.   Advocates across the Nation, including my colleagues and I, rallied  to call for Grace's release. We were so grateful she safely made her  way home to her mother, but her experience is far too common.   My amendment underscores the need for the GAO to study the prevalence  of these practices during remote learning periods and provide  recommendations on how we can work to urgently address this crisis.   Our young people deserve nurturing, learning environments that  support their healing and well-being.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
