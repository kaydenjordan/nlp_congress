 Madam Speaker, America is leading the way  in coronavirus vaccine research.   Under the direction of President Trump, the Department of Health and  Human Services and the Department of Defense formed a historic  partnership to accelerate the development of a safe coronavirus  vaccine.   Around the country, Operation Warp Speed is charting a new path and  breaking barriers to achieve safe and effective results for the  American people.   Thanks to Americans' unparalleled ingenuity and drive, we are better  positioned to develop therapeutics and a vaccine. The world is  watching.   The Chinese Communist Party already has been caught attempting to  steal American coronavirus vaccine research. It is key that we protect  our groundbreaking research and keep our country on the road to  recovery.                            ____________________
