 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, July 8, I had  the privilege of hosting the White House Opportunity and Revitalization  Council Executive Director, Mr. Scott Turner, in Bellefonte in  Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District.   Mr. Turner shared his insight, his expertise, and, I will say, his  passion for serving economically distressed communities, regarding the  recently designated opportunity zone in Bellefonte, with myself and  members of the community. It was a productive and engaging discussion  hosted by the American Philatelic Society at its headquarters.   Joined by officials from the U.S. Small Business Administration, U.S.  Department of Agriculture, U.S. General Services Administration, and  U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Mr. Turner shared a  vision behind the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council,  or opportunity zones, as they are more broadly known.   The Council was established to proactively address the 52 million  Americans who live in economically distressed communities nationwide in  urban areas, suburban areas, and, quite frankly, rural areas.   It was inspiring to hear Mr. Turner's passion when it comes to  stimulating economic growth, expanding workforce development  opportunities, and promoting long-term investment in distressed  communities.   The opportunity zone designation was made possible by the landmark  2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that I was proud to cosponsor and to  support. This past April, the White House Council was formed to help  align communities with a myriad of Federal agencies that can help  supplement public endeavors with private investments.   Because of this, communities, and not the Federal Government, are  being put in the driver's seat. The borough of Bellefonte is one of 300  opportunity zones in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, nearly 30 of  which are located within Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District.   These opportunity zones were nominated by the Governor and are  nominated by the Governors of each State and territory. The final  vetting and finalization for selection are up to the United States  Treasury Department.   Opportunity zones are an investment in Pennsylvania's future, our  communities' futures, our businesses, and the people who call the  Commonwealth home. These zones have great potential when it comes to  revitalizing economically distressed communities all across the United  States. It is my hope that they can become a catalyst for change and a  catalyst for hope in communities across the country.   This facilitates investment by private investors who can take their  capital gains that they may have realized because of business  transactions that they are engaged in. Normally, these aren't the types  of communities where these capital gains are invested. These are areas  of higher unemployment and infrastructure issues, maybe housing issues,  and a lower median income, not prime places for economic investment by  the private sector.   With the incentives of opportunity zones, where these investors can  invest these capital gains within those communities for causes and for  needs defined by the members of the communities, they are able to  realize tax savings.   It encourages them to maintain that investment for 10 years, where  they would pay zero taxes on those capital gains and yield a tremendous  return on investment for families, for individuals, and for  communities.   Additionally, these 23 Federal agencies would provide preferences for  competitive grants in these designated opportunity zones, another way  of investing.   It was equally inspiring to hear local stakeholders discuss their new  developments in Bellefonte, and I am looking forward to helping these  communities seek these Federal opportunities.   As I mentioned that day, this is a program that was created by  Congress and was signed by President Trump, who executed this with  Scott Turner's leadership as Executive Director. It is one that really  lies in the community, in terms of identifying what the needs are and  the investors who come from the community.   I am grateful to the White House Opportunity and Revitalization  Council for its willingness to be on the ground and engage, in the  hopes of sparking growth and development in all the designated  opportunity zones. Specifically, on Monday, it was Bellefonte.   Moreover, I am grateful to the residents of Bellefonte for joining as  engaged citizens who are passionate about the future of their town. By  taking advantage of opportunity zones, communities like Bellefonte can  play a more proactive role in the future and the destiny of their town  that they call home.                            ____________________
