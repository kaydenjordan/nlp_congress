 Madam Speaker, I include in the Record my remarks  supporting the impeachment of President Donald Trump.   Madam Speaker, I rise today as a strong believer in the American  experiment and the democratic norms that distinguish us from the  monarchies that existed at the birth of our nation and from the  authoritarian tyrannies that exist today.   The facts that were uncovered during the House's impeachment inquiry  point to unlawful misconduct by President Trump--misconduct that  demands that we, the Congress, hold him to account.   The president's egregious abuse of power undermined the integrity of  our elections, which are the foundation of our democracy, and  threatened our national security.   Furthermore, his refusal to cooperate with the House's impeachment  inquiry represents an unprecedented level of contempt for the law and  violation of our democratic norms. What the president obstructed wasn't  trivial, nor was it about concealing private conduct--he obstructed a  Congressional investigation of great significance to our national  interest and infringed on Congress' ability to carry out our  constitutional duty.   As a separate and co-equal branch of government we must hold the  president accountable for his abuse of power and his violation of the  public trust.
