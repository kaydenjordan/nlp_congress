 Madam Speaker, first of all, we all are thinking about  those loyal, hardworking Federal employees who are caught in the middle  of the challenges that we face here in Washington. As with other  battles, these employees will be paid for their time away from the  workplace while they are on furlough.   So what is this all about? Do we have a crisis on the southern border  or not? I would caution my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to use  real numbers.   Are 400,000 illegal immigrants last year across the southern border  too few or too many?   Are the 500 homicides by illegal immigrants in Texas over the past  decade too few or too many?   Maybe the new Homeland Security Committee could hold a hearing and  vet out all of these numbers. There is a problem with that: The  committee is not organized yet, so they cannot meet. I would hope that  they would, so we could put the facts on the table.   I look at the clips of large groups of illegals trying to rush the  border. What has kept them from illegally entering? Well, the fence,  the wall, the barrier. A wall system works. Sections of the border  where fencing and walls have been built have seen a decrease in illegal  immigration.   San Diego first built its wall in 1992. Illegal traffic dropped 92  percent over the past 23 years.   El Paso built their fence in 1993. Illegal traffic dropped 72 percent  in 1 year and 95 percent over 22 years.   Tucson's wall was built in 2000. Illegal traffic dropped 90 percent  over 15 years.   The wall in Yuma was built in 2005. Illegal traffic dropped 95  percent over 9 years.   Since walls work, they have historically held bipartisan support. In  the fiscal year 2007, the DHS appropriations bill provided more than $1  billion for fencing along the southwest border. It passed 412-6.  Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Majority Whip Clyburn, and  Homeland Security Chairman Thompson were among the ``yes'' votes.   Former President Barack Obama, in a Senate floor speech from the  Secure Fence Act in 2006, said: ``It will authorize some badly needed  funding for better fences and better security along our borders, and  that should help stem some of the tide of illegal immigration in this  country.''   The Secretary of Homeland Security under Obama, Janet Napolitano,  reiterated: ``You've got to have a system. You've got to have a system  down there that includes boots on the ground, that has to include  technology and fencing and infrastructure as part of the overall  system.''   It is time that we work together to compromise to reopen the  government and secure our southern border. We can do this. I believe in  this form of government, and I believe in this institution. Let's get  to work.   America is an extraordinarily compassionate nation. We welcome  immigrants seeking the opportunity to build a better life here, as well  as refugees fleeing war, oppression, and poverty around the world. But  even as we do this it is only appropriate that it is done legally.                            ____________________
