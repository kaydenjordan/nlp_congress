 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor First Lieutenant Hope  Kirkendall, a distinguished veteran from Lakeland, Florida, who served  in World War II.   Lieutenant Kirkendall heard the call to serve after seeing the  bombing of Pearl Harbor when she was only 18 years old.   She joined the Army as a nurse, where she was one of the first women  deployed to Normandy after D-Day. During her deployment, she routinely  worked 12- to 16-hour days near the front lines of many major battles,  including the Battle of the Bulge.   She treated both wounded American and German soldiers. In 2004, she  received the French Legion of Honor award for her service in saving  France from German occupiers.   Lieutenant Kirkendall provided hope to many on the battlefield, and  her legacy continues to provide hope to us at home.   Lieutenant Kirkendall represents our very best, and I thank her for  all that she has done to defend and serve our great Nation.                            ____________________
