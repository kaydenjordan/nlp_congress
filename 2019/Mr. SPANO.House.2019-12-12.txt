 Madam Speaker, I rise today to wish a happy birthday to  the National Guard and all servicemembers, past and present.   Established in 1636, our Nation's first militia units organized in  the Massachusetts Bay Colony and were referred to as Minutemen during  the Revolutionary War.   Today, the Army and Air National Guard are made up of 184,000 heroes  who bravely stepped up to defend our freedom.   They made history by forming one of the first all-African American  units during the Civil War. They contributed 50,000 personnel following  the 9/11 attacks. As I speak, they help secure our southern borders.   More importantly, the National Guard sets itself apart as each member  is sworn to uphold two constitutions, both Federal and State.   Most of us are familiar with Guard units helping communities deal  with floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, snowstorms, and other emergencies.  But in times of civil unrest, the citizens of a State can rest assured  that the Guard will be ready, if needed.   These incredible Americans deserve to be recognized and celebrated  for their long and continued service to our Nation. So on behalf of a  grateful Nation, I thank them for their sacrifice and commitment.                            ____________________
