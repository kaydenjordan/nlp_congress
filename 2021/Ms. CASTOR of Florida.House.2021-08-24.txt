 Madam Speaker, over the past decades when  officials in Florida tried to restrict access to the ballot box, the  Voting Rights Act provided protections for all Floridians to cast their  vote.   Maybe they limited hours of voting, or didn't provide timely notice  to changes in polling places, or didn't provide clear ballot language,  but the Voting Rights Act was there. But, unfortunately, the U.S.  Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act and after that State  officials moved to enact other discriminatory practices to keep certain  people and people of color from casting ballots.   It is wrong. So it is vitally important that the Congress adopt the  John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to make sure voting is  fair, especially in places where voting discrimination has been  historically prevalent.   As John Lewis said: When you see something that is not right and not  fair, you have to speak up. You have to say something. You have to do  something. And that is what we are going to do today. I say to  Representative Sewell, We are going to cast a reinvigorated Voting  Rights Act. And I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
