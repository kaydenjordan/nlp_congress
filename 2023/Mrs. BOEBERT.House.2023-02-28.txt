 Madam Chair, I rise in favor of H.R. 347, the REIN IN  Act.   I do think that it is very rich that my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle are talking about regular order all of a sudden. My first  2 years in Congress there was no such thing as regular order. In fact,  I served on the Budget Committee and they passed two  budget reconciliations on the House floor without it going through  committee: completely bypassed committee.    First one was $1.9 trillion. The next one, $700 billion. Really all  it was, was the Green New Deal: just real quick, hurry up, get it to  the floor. We have to spend trillions and trillions of dollars and hurt  as many Americans as possible in the 2 years that we have left in  power.   With this REIN IN Act, this bill will hold Joe Biden accountable for  this reckless spending that he has approved by my Democrat colleagues,  who hastefully sent all of these bills to him, rushing him to spend  trillions and trillions of American taxpayer dollars.   His administration will now be required to publish the inflationary  impact of executive orders before enacting them.   Madam Chair, my constituents are struggling to deal with the  disastrous effects of Bidenflation. Under 2 years of a one-party rule,  Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi unleashed a record inflation crisis on the  American people that has decimated their bank and retirement accounts,  increased gas prices to record levels, raised utility bills, drove up  grocery costs, and made it harder to live for the people in my  district, Colorado's Third District, and all throughout this great  country.   The primary root cause of this record-breaking inflation was  trillions of dollars of wasteful Federal spending.   In Joe Biden's first year in office alone, he issued more executive  orders than any other President in my lifetime, costing taxpayers more  than $1 trillion.   The American people said loud and clear last November that enough is  enough. They have empowered this new majority to demand transparency by  revealing just how much Biden's executive orders are costing American  families and small businesses.   Madam Chair, I thank my colleague and chairwoman of the Republican  Conference, Elise Stefanik, for her work to hold Joe Biden and his  administration accountable.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to vote in favor of the underlying bill.                                time  1745     Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in favor of Amendment No. 3, which  will require inflation-impact assessments to be published on the Office  of Management and Budget's website, not just reported to Congress.   This simple, straightforward amendment will ensure that the American  people, who bear the brunt of inflation's impacts, will be better  informed of the President's inflation-inducing actions.   Without my amendment, the real-life consequences of Joe Biden's  spending spree in the White House will not be seen by those impacted  most. This will provide transparency for the administration to answer  to the American people.   Thanks to Joe Biden's reckless spending agenda, America will spend  $10 trillion more over the next 10 years than we were estimated to  spend. While the Federal Government continues to spend trillions of  dollars it doesn't have, inflation has hit a 40-year high and our  Nation is now mired in a recession.   Instead of addressing these major economic concerns head-on, the  Democrat solution to inflation is to keep on spending.   The GOP majority has been empowered to hold the Biden administration  accountable and demand transparency by revealing just how much Biden's  executive orders are costing American families and small businesses.   This excessive spending has real consequences. American families will  pay an $8,581 inflation tax over the next year.   Currently, 20 million Americans cannot pay their electric bill. We  have seen a 4.3 percent decline in real wages since Biden took office.  Americans have lost more than $2 trillion in retirement savings. Gas is  nearly $4 a gallon again.   Americans are paying more for everything because of leftwing  extremist policies.   House Republicans are working to reduce inflation by fundamentally  changing the way we vote on appropriations bills and putting an end to  reckless spending omnibus packages passed on Christmas Eve, without any  time to actually read the bills, multi-thousand-page bills spending  trillions of dollars, about 24 hours or less to read it.   We are working to cut wasteful spending, get to the bottom of  fraudulent payments made by the Federal Government, support American  energy production, and oppose tax increases proposed by the Democrats.  Economic strength and job growth result from policies that unshackle  job creators, allow American ingenuity, and provide certainty.   Madam Chair, I again thank my colleague, the chairwoman of the  Republican Conference, Elise Stefanik, for her leadership on this  issue.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and vote in  favor of the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I do want to take a few seconds to  respond. That was great. We are addressed as MAGA extremists, extreme  MAGA Republicans. I will just make a clarification point. It is ultra  MAGA. That is what we prefer.   But I will say to the ranking member, I am very happy that they have  moved on from pronouns to adjectives. When they start acting  democratic, I will be sure to call them the Democratic Party.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Comer).    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
