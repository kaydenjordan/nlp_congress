 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Miguel  Gonzalez, a charismatic and innovative entrepreneur from the San  Fernando Valley who was recently taken from us in a fatal car accident.   Miguel was one of the founders and owners of Vallarta Supermarkets, a  chain of family-owned grocery stores committed to offering the best- quality products from Mexico and Latin America.   Originally from Jalostotitlan, Jalisco, Mexico, he immigrated to the  San Fernando Valley with his family and graduated from Van Nuys High  School.   As a young man, Miguel had an eye for buildings and design. He  pursued his passion in architecture after receiving an associate's  degree in arts. This led him to begin a career at Jet Propulsion  Laboratory in Pasadena, California, as a quality assurance technician  who worked on parts for the Space Shuttle program.   In 1985, his brother, Enrique, Sr., started the family business when  he opened Carniceria Vallarta in a 1,000-square-foot market in Van  Nuys, California. Enrique, Sr. soon expanded the business to a second  location and got his four brothers to join, including Miguel. They  focused on selling traditional cuts of popular Mexican meats. The  brothers would put in 18-hour days, 7 days a week to make sure the  business succeeded.   Miguel brought his passion for design and helped develop the  significant architecture and interior design of the Vallarta stores. He  created the trademark Vallarta aesthetic with the focus of modern and  nostalgic references to his hometown in Jalisco.   Anyone in our community can recognize the iconic design when they are  driving around the neighborhood. When they go in they forget they are  in California, and they are taken directly back to Mexico. That is what  Miguel did, he made a simple shopping experience feel like home.   He was always pushing the envelope to make sure every store completed  its mission to serve our community with respect and pride, while  providing authentic, traditional, fresh products that bring families  together over a meal.   One of his last projects was Sayulita Tap Room established in October  of 2020 in Indio, California. This project epitomized his vision of  spending quality time with loved ones, excellent food and drinks, and  live music.   When he pitched this idea to his family, they all had doubts and  concerns. They asked, ``A bar at a grocery store?'' Miguel said, ``If  Whole Foods can do it, so can I.'' This project represented Miguel's  vision and entrepreneurial spirit to make his dreams a reality.   Miguel wasn't just a shining example of the American Dream, he  inspired countless others to ``work hard and play harder,'' which was  his motto. He left a legacy of 52 stores throughout southern and  central California, all which provide jobs to more than 8,000  hardworking people.   Miguel had a deep passion and love for the employees and families of  Vallarta Supermarkets. He was heavily involved in the Gonzalez Family  Foundation, which offers scholarships to its employees and their  children.   The foundation has given thousands of dollars to help their families  pursue higher education.                                time  1030    On top of that, he was a supporter and donor to the St. Jude  Children's Center. For this and so much more, I know that his legacy  will continue to inspire Latinos and countless others in our community  and across the country. I know that his designs will be seen and  appreciated by more and more people every day.   Miguel leaves behind his high school sweetheart and wife, Maria  Teresa; his two sons, Christian and Luis Angel; his granddaughter, Aria  Soleil; his mother, Eva; his father, Felix; his brothers; sisters;  cousins; aunts; uncles; and many of us who are his dear friends.   Many of Miguel's family made the trip to Washington, D.C., to watch  him be honored in this body.   I have had the honor of knowing Miguel and his family, admiring his  wonderful work and his work ethic.   Miguel came to the United States not speaking English. Miguel's first  language was Spanish. So with that, I honor him and all those who come  to this country and give so much to the United States of America.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)   To Miguel's family, thank you very much for giving so much of Miguel  to the community.   I would also like to thank Miguel for being such a good man, husband,  father, son, friend.   It is very important for everyone to know that, in the United States  of America, we are all equal.  [[Page H4867]]    Miguel achieved many of his dreams and the dreams of thousands and  thousands of families, not only those who work at Vallarta but also the  people and community they serve.   A la familia de Miguel, muchisimas gracias por dar tanto de el a la  comunidad. Tambien quero gradecer a Miguel por ser tan buen hombre,  esposo, padre, hijo, amigo. Es muy importante que todos sepan que, en  los Estados Unidos todo somos iguales.

So today I honor the life of my dear friend Miguel Gonzalez.
