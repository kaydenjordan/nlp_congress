 Madam Speaker, we have a massive problem. We just got  done talking about the budget and the deficit, but there is no possible  way to address that without addressing healthcare.   Healthcare is the biggest spending item for the government. Madam  Speaker, $1 out of every $5 spent by the government is spent on  healthcare, and it is the quickest growing inflationary cost to  Americans.   Right now, if we consider Medicaid and Medicare, and we consider the  amount of money we spend on private pay, which is about one-fifth of  the economy also, in a GDP of roughly $24 trillion, we are spending $6  trillion on healthcare alone. If it were taken by itself, it would be  the third largest GDP in the world. It would have twice the GDP size of  India, which has 1.47 billion people. This is a massive problem.   What are we going to do? How do we take on something so complex? I  think it is an underserved problem in the  [[Page H2747]]  United States Congress. We have been kicking the can down the street  for far too long, from the Clinton administration all the way to the  Obama administration. The Affordable Care Act did nothing to make it  affordable.   We have done nothing to curb the inflationary costs, and it is  certainly not the doctors' problem because doctors took a 2.3 percent  pay cut last year alone. If you are an ER doctor in Georgia, you  probably took about an 18 percent pay decrease in 1 year, and that is  after serving during COVID for 3 years on nights, weekends, and  holidays. That is your congratulations.   How do we address this? Quite frankly, we are going to have to make  some hard choices. America has to understand, first of all, how complex  this issue is when you have PBMs, GPOs, pharmaceutical companies,  insurance companies, Medicaid, Medicare, when you have the government  involved, private pay, when you have hospital systems and healthcare  providers. These are just some of the problems we have.   Right now, 90 percent of the ingredients that go into drugs are  produced in China. You have almost all of the market for amoxicillin  and Augmentin cornered by an adversarial nation.   We have admin costs that have grown in the hospital system from 25  percent to 40 percent in just the last 10 years. Take that into  account. Forty percent of every dollar spent on healthcare is spent on  administrative costs. That means too much regulatory burden, not enough  competition.   We continue to talk about a single-payer system as the end-all, be- all to healthcare. Let's take that into account right now. Medicaid is  done at a loss. It doesn't pay the bills. As a matter of fact, we have  an act right now that talks about supplementing people with a tax break  so they can actually see more Medicaid patients and afford it and stay  open. It is not the answer.   If we go to a single-payer system, you are talking about adding $30  trillion of expense to the government in the next 10 years. That means  $30 trillion more in either tax or debt.   We have pretty much lost our minds over the $32 trillion of debt we  are already in. Imagine adding $30 trillion more to spending. It would  be the largest increase in spending and government control there has  ever been in American history. We have a massive problem.   On top of that, despite spending about $32 billion on electronic  medical records and spending a lot of money on coders, in many cases,  we still have 45 percent of claims not being reimbursed by insurance  companies. This simply can't continue to happen.    People are using their insurance companies the wrong way. If we used  car insurance the same way we use healthcare insurance, you would be  spending your car insurance to actually change your car oil. It would  probably cost about $500 per pop, and you wouldn't be able to afford  car insurance.   We need to look at this in a different way. The problem is, if I talk  about cutting administrative costs in medicine, people will immediately  vilify me for trying to cut Medicaid and Medicare. This is why it has  to be a bipartisan issue. We have to have a real conversation, and it  can't be about calling people names but about actually solving a  problem.   If we want to talk about a real solution, I think we have to start  thinking about not just taking this as subcommittees, not just a  subcommittee of Energy and Commerce, not just a subcommittee of Ways  and Means, not just a subcommittee of VA or a subcommittee of Foreign  Affairs. We actually have to have staff that are dedicated to a process  that is so complex, so big, has so many lobbyists involved that it is  impossible for a physician with an MBA to figure out how to handle it  himself.   This is something we are going to have to take as a problem that all  of us have to solve without vilifying each other. If we don't do it  soon, we will increase government and increase spending, and we will  have rationing simultaneously.   Final point: If you want a good example of a single-payer system, the  VA is exactly what you are going to get, and it is not popular.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I take this opportunity to address a  very important visit by Prime Minister Modi this week.   I am excited that this person is coming to America to extend goodwill  between our two nations in one of the most strategically important  relationships we have in the world.   If you consider their relationship to Pakistan, China, and  Bangladesh, and the economic power that they hold, it is an economy  that has been blossoming in the last 10 years and has increased by over  30 percent while Canada and Russia have actually maintained a flat or  decreasing GDP.   The reason this has happened is because they have embraced a  constitution very similar to the United States' and values very similar  to ours.   I call that we continue to extend our military actions, our military  purchasing power, and our economic reliance on each other into the  future as we accept Prime Minister Modi here in the United States in  the most important accolades that we recognize leadership across the  world.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I am new to Congress, so maybe I don't  see the same problems that other Congressmen and Congresswomen do, but  I will tell you one thing, I know the people.   I have yet to hear one constituent say we need more regulation.  Nobody is telling me that they want the President to make universal  decisions for all of us.   The fact is, we are out of balance. Congress doesn't have the same  power it is supposed to have enumerated in the Constitution of the  United States. The fact that we have a President that can spend more  money than we can save is the exact reason why I just voted against the  lifting of the deficit cap.   I can sum this up in one thing: You just made mention from the other  side of the House, look, we make hundreds of rules by bureaucracies,  hundreds of rules per year. How can we address that in Congress?   Well, that is exactly the problem. We spend half our time in Congress  litigating and debating the rules that were made by bureaucracies. You  are right. We don't have time for that.   We don't have time to tell you that we shouldn't put people in jail  for something that was made, essentially, law by a bureaucracy.   We don't have time to fight over money that was given away by  bureaucracies or spent by bureaucracies.   We don't have time to fight a President in the Supreme Court because  of a decision that he made without the approval of Congress when it  comes to the budget which we, by the Constitution, should have  responsibility for.
