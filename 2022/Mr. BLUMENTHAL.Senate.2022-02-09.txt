 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Mrs.  Gloria Miller Blick, a Connecticut resident who turns 100 on March 1,  2022.   Mrs. Blick is a lifelong advocate for the elderly, who has worked  tirelessly to inspire positive change.   She was appointed to the Commission for the Aged by then-mayor of  Stamford, Dannel Malloy. Mrs. Blick was also active as a member of  Stamford's Smith House Nursing and Rehabilitation Center's board of  directors and Southwest CT Agency on Aging's advisory board. Later, she  served 8 years as the chairwoman of Stamford's Senior Centers board of  directors.   Mrs. Blick's advocacy had far-reaching results. Passionate about  providing end-of-life options and other choices for the elderly, she  spoke before the Connecticut State Senate. Her statement took  prominence in the State's discussion regarding access to medical  marijuana for elderly people with glaucoma, a condition she has faced  for nearly two decades. Her commitment to supporting those who are  marginalized and underserved inspired her son, Dr. Gary Blick, to  pursue a medical career and a lifetime of humanitarian work. She even  worked as the office manager for his practice for over 20 years and his  billing specialist for over 30, commuting independently at age 97.   A remarkable advocate, I applaud Mrs. Blick on her outstanding record  of service. I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Mrs.  Gloria Blick, her son Gary, and the rest of her family on this  milestone of her 100th birthday.                            ____________________
