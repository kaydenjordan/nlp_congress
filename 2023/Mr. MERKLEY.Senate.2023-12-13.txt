 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, a question: Do we want a government  surveillance state in the United States of America?   Movies like ``Gattaca,'' where citizens are tracked through their  DNA, or ``Minority Report,'' where citizens are tracked through their  retina scan, warn us what can happen under a fictional government  surveillance state. But we don't need to depend upon movies and fiction  to understand what a surveillance state means because we have, right  now, a real-life government surveillance state in China. China's  government surveillance state already tracks more than 1 million Uighur  citizens through facial recognition.   As cochair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, I have  had a front-row seat on how China uses facial recognition technology to  track and to enslave a million people. And I have watched with some  alarm as the U.S. Government has begun to expand its own use of facial  recognition technology tied to databases, especially because there has  never been a debate, let alone a vote, here in the U.S. Senate about  whether or not we want to have a national facial recognition system  controlled by the government. We have never had a debate related to the  risks that that involves in terms of its potential threat to our  freedom and to our privacy.   So I want to force there to be such a debate. I want to force there  to be a vote. A government with power to track us everywhere we go is a  real threat to privacy, a real threat to freedom. That is why Senator  John Kennedy and I have introduced the bipartisan Traveler Privacy  Protection Act to curtail the use of facial recognition technology by  TSA.   Step-by-step, slowly, steadily, TSA is expanding its system of facial  recognition technology. And let's just take a look at what that looks  like. In 2018, TSA began with a 3-week test of facial recognition where  passenger photos and data were deleted immediately. Then, in 2019, they  did a second test, but they allowed the photos and data to be stored  for up to 6 months. By 2020, we are talking about the ability by the  TSA to hold photos and data for up to 2 years. In 2021, we are now  talking about TSA beginning to match facial recognition photos against  the Customs and Border Protection database--all of these steps taking  place really with no recognition by Americans that this program is  expanding in this fashion, certainly no discussion here in the Senate  committees and Senate floor about this steady expansion. Ultimately,  what the TSA is aiming at is a world in which your face is your  driver's license; your face is your passport. Well, that means a  massive database and massive tracking of Americans wherever they go.   This summer, the TSA announced plans to expand from the current 25  airports where facial recognition technology is used to 430 airports  across the country. So no matter where you live, this system of  tracking citizens is coming to your community.   In fact, as you see the geographic expansion, we are also seeing that  technological expansion. TSA Administrator David Pekoske said in April  of this year, a few months ago, at the South by Southwest Conference:         Eventually we will get to the point [where] we will require       biometrics across the board.    What he is really saying here is, right now, we are allowing some  opt-out from the use of facial photos at the airport--and I will have  more to say about that in a moment. It is very difficult to exercise  that opt-out, but in the near future, the opt-out is going to go away.  Everyone will have to be scanned everywhere you go in the TSA system.   Requiring facial recognition should set off alarm bells for everyone.   Once you have built the infrastructure of the database and the  cameras, then it is easy and tempting for the government to use that  infrastructure to track you in the name of security. I am reminded of  Benjamin Franklin's warning that ``those who would give up essential  Liberty to purchase temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor  Safety.''   I know there will always be a story about some bad guy hiding out in  some town somewhere who gets caught on a camera and might not have  gotten caught otherwise, but allowing the government to know where you  are at all times is an enormous price to pay. It is a price paid in the  loss of privacy and the loss of freedom. And that is why it needs to be  debated, and that is why we need to put a brake on this system until we  consciously lay out what we consider acceptable for the use of such  technologies. We really don't know how a future government will use or  misuse this technology, but we do know how it is misused in nations  like China.   You know, passengers, as you go to the airport, are confronting a  long line in which they see a lot of signs that I will show you in a  moment. But what they don't understand is when they get to the front of  the line, the TSA is going to go like this, directing you to stand in  front of the camera. Many of us in this Chamber have experienced that  because when you travel through Reagan National, that is exactly what  happens every day, every week.   I was pretty surprised to see that show up with no signage saying  that this was an opt-in program, which is the way the TSA had  originally described it. But they changed it to an opt-out program,  again, without clear debate or laws here in our Chamber being discussed  or being passed.   As you stand in the line--these are pictures I have taken in previous  trips through Reagan National. The things they want you to know have  these big signs like this: ``You are entering an  [[Page S5947]]  area where all persons and property are subject to additional  screening.'' OK. Good to know. You might trigger an alarm or have  additional screening or, hey, you got any questions or comments? Here  is how you reach us for live customer service assistance--or firearms,  including shotgun chokes, are not allowed through security checkpoints.  All firearms must be declared.    That is fine. These are things that they want you to know. There are  actually seven different signs at Reagan National as you stand in line,  but there is no sign saying that when you get to the TSA checkout  point, you have an option to check out--to opt out of the program--no  clear signs like this.   So I brought the head of TSA in and had a conversation about the fact  that they are not informing citizens, and as a result of that, there is  now some information--some information but not adequate information.   Now, here is a chart or a picture that I took. As you are directed  here to the checkout, and you can see the driver's license--the sign is  set sideways so nobody can read it until the moment that you are  stepping up to the carousel. By then, you are all focused on doing what  the guard is telling you to do, what the TSA agent is telling you to  do.   I found this a little humorous that they put out these signs--after I  gave them a hard time--but they placed them deliberately so people  couldn't see them.   Let's take a look at what that old sign says: ``Self-service  biometric identity verification technology paving the path for a safe  and secure travel experience.''   Well, these type of signs are very different than the signs I just  showed you. They are very detailed, and this is only when you actually  reach the kiosk. Nobody has the chance to read this entire thing and  realize what it is about. It doesn't say ``facial recognition'' at the  top. It doesn't say: ``Remember, you have two options here'' in nice  big print.   You have embedded in this--there are some details. Right down here it  says ``Photo capture is optional,'' but you have to read through this  and understand what it is talking about. Meanwhile, TSA is saying: Get  in front of the camera. So that is really not a sufficient way of  educating citizens and having a true opt-out or an opt-in program.   Now they have got a new sign. Now, this one also doesn't say ``facial  recognition.'' And if you look down here to see what is highlighted:  ``Use your physical ID. Use your eligible digital ID.''   These are not about opting out. No, they are about how to actually  use facial ID. But there is a little tag down here at the bottom: ``If  you decide to opt out of facial matching, notify the officer.'' Well,  nobody, in the 2 seconds or 3 seconds you have as they motion you to  step forward, where you can actually see this sign, is going to read  this whole document and go: Oh, what is this all about--hidden at the  bottom?   I mean, it is completely clear the TSA has no intention of actually  having an opt-in program, and they have no intention of truly having an  opt-out program because they are hiding all the information about the  fact that you have that right.   Now, because of my complaints to the TSA--because of my advocacy--I  said: You know, you need to have signs on the way in that alert people,  and then you need to have a sign by the camera. Well, they didn't do  any signs on the way in, but they did do a little sign right by the  camera at the last second. It says: ``You may opt out of facial ID  validation,'' and in smaller print, ``Please inform the TSA officer if  you do not want the camera used. See additional information on the blue  signs nearby.'' So they refer you over to read a more complex document.   Again, none of this makes sense if you want to give people real  information because this is the last second as the officer is pointing  to you to step in front of the camera.   The sign looks pretty large in this chart, but it is actually a  little kind of 5 by 8 sign, again, to my point.   This sign also says: ``Your photo and limited biographic information  will be deleted after your transaction.'' Well, if you hear that-- ``Your photo and limited biographic information will be deleted after  your transaction''--it sounds like it will be deleted, like,  immediately.   But what is TSA's real policy? That they can retain your data for 2  years. That is a big difference between a sign that implies that it is  deleted immediately and the fact that they are going to keep your data  in a database for up to 2 years.   It is outrageous that TSA continues to shuttle people through its  facial recognition system and not tell people, clearly, it is optional  and not tell people they are holding onto their biometric data. Worse,  the agents are not at all clear about the rules of opting out, because  I have repeatedly opted out and have tried to opt out.   And so I have the experiences to share with you. Here is what  happens:   You get 4 or 5 feet out, waiting for the next person to leave,  because there is a line that says: Don't go there. Then they mushroom  you forward. The TSA immediately points to the camera, and on the far  side of the camera is where you have to put your driver's license in,  forcing you to step in front of the camera.   So you say: I am choosing to opt out, Officer.   And they say: Get in front of the camera--because they are not really  familiar with what that means because nobody is informed; so nobody is  doing it.   Then you say: No. There is an option to opt out, and I am choosing to  opt out.   Then you have to explain it to the TSA agent: So I am giving you my  driver's license, and I will even put it into that machine, but I am  not stepping in front of the camera, which means you have to reach  under the machine like this and, like, slide it in there. Then you have  got to take it out, bring it back, hand it to the officer. They look at  the photo on the screen that has been taken of your driver's license.  They compare it to your face--all very good. Or they say: You stand  over there.   So twice, of the several times I have attempted to opt out, I have  been directed to stand over there, in a rather hostile fashion, while  they have gone and found somebody to address the fact that this  passenger is refusing to do what they say and step in front of the  camera. Eventually, it gets resolved, but the first time, it included:  And you, sir, are going to hold everyone up at this airport.   Well, thank you very much. It is supposed to be possible just to opt  out and hand you my driver's license.   Stand over there, sir. No, don't move--all of which I would be happy  to share with you on a recording because it is legal to take photos  when you are in line at the TSA.   This is not OK. The massive expansion of state surveillance, which  will create a national surveillance system here in America, with the  potential for great abuse by the government, has to be debated here,  has to be addressed here in the Senate Chamber. We need to put a halt  on this expansion of this technology, and we need to do it soon.   Let me be clear: The legislation that Senator John Kennedy and I are  proposing would not affect Customs and Border Protection. So don't tell  me that some terrorists who will come into the country would have been  caught because of facial recognition technology but for our not having  it. What I am really talking about is creating a surveillance state--or  stopping a surveillance state--inside the United States of America, not  at the borders. What the legislation would do is guarantee that you  could move about freely without being tracked everywhere by the  government.   Let me also note that the TSA has been refusing to share their error  rate from their initial studies. In many facial recognition systems,  there is a lot higher error rate for people with brown or black skin,  but they won't share that data.   They just say: Oh, it is accurate.   They say: It only has a 3-percent error rate.   Well, I would sure like to see the breakdown on that. A 3-percent  error rate means they have 68,000 people a day who are erroneously  addressed through this computer system.   Then they try to say: Well, this will be a more efficient system. It  will be faster.   They still have to have the agent right there. I have watched it go  faster  [[Page S5948]]  for individuals--TSA agents--who are both grabbing the driver's license  and then comparing it to the face than it does in the photo system.   So they will make arguments, but I think we need to thoroughly  examine those arguments. They will make arguments about a slight  increase in security, and they will make arguments about a slight  increase in efficiency--but at what cost to our privacy? At what cost  to our freedom? Are those arguments actually even valid? They won't  release the data.   I don't want America to be a surveillance state. I don't want it to  be like the surveillance state with DNA portrayed in ``Gattaca.'' I  don't want it to be like the surveillance state displayed with irises  in the ``Minority Report'' movie. I don't want it to become an American  surveillance state like China, using facial recognition. In China, that  facial recognition is used to track and control their citizens,  including the enslavement of more than a million ethnic Uighurs. I  don't want America to become a surveillance state because we ignore the  issue and let it just gradually expand, never debating it and never  voting on it.   So I urge my colleagues--and Senator Kennedy and I will be  encouraging folks--to join us on this bill, the Traveler Privacy  Protection Act. Let's say no to this steady expansion without a debate  and without a vote--the steady expansion of the American Government  surveillance state.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
