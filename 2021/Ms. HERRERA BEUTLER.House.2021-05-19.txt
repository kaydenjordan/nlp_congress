 Mr. Speaker, for 10 days, moms, dads, and  grandparents have been lying awake at night, waiting for the inevitable  warning call of sirens to pick up their children and run to the nearest  bomb shelter.   No one should live with this type of fear. No one should live with  the fear that missiles could rain down and destroy their homes and  lives at any moment. Yet, this is the reality that many Israeli  families are living right now.   For 10 days, Israel has been defending itself from attacks launched  by Iranian-backed terrorists. Let's be clear: Israel has the right to  defend herself and its homeland from terrorist attacks.   Israel is one of the United States' greatest allies in the Middle  East, and we cannot waver in our support of Israel during this  challenging time.   Today, I am standing with the people of Israel, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   My hope is that peace and calm can quickly be restored in the region.  Until that happens, we must continue standing in solidarity with the  Nation of Israel and its people.                            ____________________
