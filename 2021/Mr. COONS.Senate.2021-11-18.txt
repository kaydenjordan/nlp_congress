 Madam President, I rise as chairman of the Select  Committee on Ethics, and on behalf of the vice chairman, members of the  committee, and its staff, to pay tribute to Deborah Sue Mayer as she  retires after 23 years of Federal service including the last 6 as chief  counsel and staff director of the Select Committee on Ethics. As a  paramedic, a naval officer, and attorney, Deb's career tells the story  of a life dedicated to public service. She joined the Senate in January  2015 after 4 years as director of investigations for the House  Committee on Ethics. From 2002 to 2011, Deb was a prosecutor with the  U.S. Department of Justice; beginning as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in  the Eastern District of New York's Organized Crime and Racketeering  Section. Deb went on to serve in the Department of Justice Public  Integrity Section of the Criminal Division, where she investigated and  prosecuted corruption at all levels of government throughout the United  States. Since 1998, Deb has served as a Judge Advocate in the U.S.  Navy, first on Active Duty and continuing her career in the Reserve  Force.   In her time as chief counsel and staff director, Deb personally  advised members of the Committee and Senate,  [[Page S8438]]  oversaw the nonpartisan staff in providing ethics advice and education,  administered the Senate's financial disclosure program, modernized and  redesigned the committee's website, and conducted investigations and  enforcement of ethics rules, laws and standards of conduct. Beyond the  Senate, Deb represented the committee at conferences and on councils  around the country and abroad. In all these efforts, Deb brought her  trademark dedication to rigorous accuracy and precision. On behalf of  the members and staff of the Select Committee on Ethics, I thank Deb  for her decades of service to our country and commitment to the U.S.  Senate. I offer my sincere best wishes and gratitude to Deb and her  family as she begins her retirement.   Thank you, Deb.                            ____________________
