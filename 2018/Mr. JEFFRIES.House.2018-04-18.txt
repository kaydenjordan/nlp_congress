 Mr. Speaker, in this country, our democratic republic,  we have a brilliant system of government of the people, by the people,  and for the people.   It is a system that consists of two predominant parties with a  contrast of ideas. And nowhere in this country is that contrast more  prominent than here in the House of Representatives where we have got a  vision of the country on the Democratic side of the aisle that wants to  move America forward, while the folks on the other side of the aisle  want to turn back the clock.   We want to bring people together. They are tearing us apart. We  believe in an economy that works for everybody. They are all about an  economy for the wealthy and the well-off. They have a raw deal. We have  a better deal.   They want to take away healthcare for more than 20 million Americans,  impose a draconian age tax on people between 50 and 64, and take away  existing protections for preexisting conditions. We want to strengthen  the Affordable Care Act and dramatically lower the cost of prescription  drugs for every American. Raw deal versus better deal.   They have a fake infrastructure plan that would do nothing to fix our  Nation's crumbling bridges, roads, and tunnels. We have a real  infrastructure plan that would invest $1 trillion and create 16 million  good-paying jobs. Raw deal versus better deal.   They support a budget that would cut more than $2 trillion from  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. We support a budget that would  strengthen Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for working  families, middle class folks, and senior citizens all across this  country.   They recklessly jammed a tax scam down the throats of the American  people where 83 percent of the benefits go to the wealthiest 1 percent  of this country--tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, corporations,  and big donors to subsidize the lifestyles of the rich and shameless.  Raw deal.   We support tax cuts for working families and middle class folks that  are made permanent and that meaningfully put money back into the  pockets of everyday Americans. That is a better deal.                                time  1015    They are all about chaos, crisis, confusion, and special interests.   We are about the people's interests: better jobs, better wages, and a  better future for the American people. We believe the American people  deserve a better deal.                            ____________________
