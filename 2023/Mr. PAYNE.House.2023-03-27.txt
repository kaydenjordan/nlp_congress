 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise Theresa Maughan.   The East Orange Educator is New Jersey's 2022 State Teacher of the  Year. She teaches 10th grade social studies at East Orange STEM  Academy, and she is an inspiration to everyone in my district.   Ms. Maughan was born in Belize and immigrated to America when she was  in elementary school. In her childhood, she was inspired to teach by  her own social studies teacher. She has worked in education for 40  years.   Ms. Maughan tells her students that she tries to learn something new  every day, and her commitment to my district's teachers and students  has helped her win numerous awards, such as the 2021 Essex County  Teacher of the Year.   Congratulations, again, to New Jersey's 2022 Teacher of the Year,  Theresa Maughan. She is a great example of how teachers benefit our  lives and communities every day.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank my colleague, Mr. Jackson of the great State of Illinois, for the  opportunity to speak with you today.   Let me acknowledge my colleagues who are leading this fight, the  Honorable Cori Bush from the great State of Missouri, the Honorable  Ayanna Pressley from the great State of Massachusetts, and all the  women who have held us down in the struggle. There would not be the  great strides of African-American men if it were not for African- American women. I understand that, and I appreciate that every day.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the tremendous work of African- American women in the continued fight to pass the equal rights  amendment, and I thank, once again, Representative Bush for hosting  this Special Order hour tonight.   The equal rights amendment is one of America's most important pieces  of legislation. The amendment would guarantee equal legal rights for  all Americans, regardless of gender.   The Constitution is an amazing document, and it is amazing how many  people were left out of it. The ERA was written 100 years ago by Alice  Paul, a New Jersey advocate for women's rights.   There have been several prominent African-American women who have  made significant contributions to the Nation's fight for the equal  rights amendment.   Pauli Murray was a lawyer and civil rights advocate who wrote the  book ``States' Laws on Race and Color.'' Supreme Court Justice Thurgood  Marshall called her book the bible of the civil rights movement.   Shirley Chisholm was the first African-American woman in Congress,  and she introduced dozens of bills for gender and racial equality.   Flo Kennedy challenged the reputation of African Americans in the  media and advertising.   Barbara Jordan was a lawyer and the first African-American woman from  the South to be elected to Congress.    Many of my congressional colleagues continue their fight for women's  rights every single day.   I am proud to be from a State with a long history of support for  women's rights. In 1790, New Jersey was the first  [[Page H1461]]  State to enfranchise women in its constitution. Then, New Jersey's  constitution was rewritten in 1947 to include equal rights for women-- but that was only White women. In New Jersey, equal rights have been  the law for 76 years.   Thanks to New Jersey's constitution, it is impossible to take those  rights away. That is why we need a national equal rights amendment.   I am so proud of the gentlewoman from Missouri for spearheading this  fight. It would keep extremist legislators from taking the hard-earned  rights of women away from them.   If you look now at what is going on in this country, there is an  effort to take rights away from many people--making it harder for them  to vote, eliminating polling sites in minority areas, and not allowing  people to get drinking water handed to them from someone else. There is  already an assault to turn the clock back.   Is that what making America great again is all about, returning to a  day when people don't have equal rights and making sure that minorities  have a more difficult time exercising their rights?   Everyone thought that Roe v. Wade was the accepted law of the land,  and look at where that has gone. It is chipping away at rights slowly  but surely.   When African Americans got the right to vote, why was it only for a  period of 25 years and then we have to revisit this topic every 25  years: Should we let Blacks vote, or should we not?   That baffles me. That absolutely baffles me. Why was it not just made  the law of the land and forget about it?   It is because of times like now that we see what is going on. We are  turning the clock back. We are questioning whether or not people should  have the equal right to vote.   We are in a very dangerous time in this country. People are arming  themselves with AR-15s. Someone is requesting that that be made the  national gun of this country.   We are in a very dangerous time, and now an extremist Supreme Court  has taken away the fundamental right for women to determine their own  healthcare for their own bodies.   Mr. Speaker, one day my friends on the other side of the aisle say  that government is too much in your business and your privacy--except  when they want to take a woman's right to her healthcare. They want  government to be involved in that. They don't want the government to be  involved in anything important to them, but they feel that they have  the right to determine what another woman does with her body. It is  hypocritical. It is hypocrisy.   We must not let the legal rights that women deserve to be taken away  from them. That is why we must pass the ERA, and we must pass it now.
