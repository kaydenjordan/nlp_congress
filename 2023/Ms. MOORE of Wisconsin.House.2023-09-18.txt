 Mr. Speaker, I rise to appeal to the majority  here  [[Page H4357]]  to not make draconian cuts to the Women, Infants, and Children program.   What is before us is a proposal to cut $800 million out of the fruit  and vegetables portion of the WIC program.   Study after study has shown that WIC improves birth outcomes, reduces  the likelihood of preterm births and low birth weights, and helps  lactating mothers. As of May, WIC has already served an average of 6.6  million monthly participants.   Mr. Speaker, this is our future workforce, and how we treat these  babies is what shows us who is right to life and who is not. You want  to be a right-to-life person? Feed the babies.                            ____________________
