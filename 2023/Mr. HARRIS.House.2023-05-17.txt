 Mr. Speaker, I will take a few moments today to honor the  memory of Wicomico County Sheriff Deputy Glenn Hilliard, a brave  Eastern Shore police officer who was killed in the line of duty while  trying to arrest a wanted criminal on probation.   Officer Glenn Hilliard lived his life as a devoted husband, father,  and police officer who was commonly referred to as a hero by his fellow  officers on the police force.   On June 12, 2022, just a little under a year ago, Officer Hilliard  was shot and killed by a fugitive who had committed multiple felonies  and was running from justice.   As we honor National Police Week, both Glenn Hilliard's life and  death are a testament to why we should support and fully fund police  officers as they risk their lives daily to keep us safe.   Officer Glenn Hilliard served Wicomico County with honor, valor, and  distinction. In the end, Officer Hilliard's memory is most treasured  not by how he died but by how he lived as a selfless and heroic police  officer who put the safety of his community above his own.                            ____________________
