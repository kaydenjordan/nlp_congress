 Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma.                                    H.R. 2    Mr. President, I want to thank Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman  Roberts and Ranking Member Stabenow for their hard work in putting  together the 2018 farm bill. It was a long and difficult process, and  they negotiated in good faith.   I also want to thank my friend and colleague from Iowa, Senator Joni  Ernst, for her dedication to reforming the Conservation Reform Program.  In the Midwest, we refer to that as the CRP. The program's intent is to  reduce land erosion, improve water quality, and help wildlife  populations. Over the years, it has strayed from its intended focus.   Some landowners have been receiving more than $300 per acre to enroll  their entire farms in the CRP. That puts young and beginning farmers at  a competitive disadvantage. In fact, even well-established farmers have  had rented land taken away from them because it was enrolled in the CRP  at lucrative rates paid by the government that the individual farmer  could not compete with.   Farmers can't and shouldn't have to compete with the government,  especially with the current debt our country has. Senator Ernst has  been an advocate for these reforms, and these reforms have been  accomplished as a result of her efforts.   Unfortunately, the 2018 farm bill did not include another critical  reform that would help young and beginning farmers, that is my payment  limitations amendment. This is a process I have been trying to get  accomplished and have been unsuccessful through at least this farm bill  and two previous farm bills.   Each time I have been successful in getting these reforms throughout  the U.S. Senate--in the 2014 farm bill, I was able to get them through  both the House and Senate in the same form--but do you know what? In  the dark rooms of conference committee meetings and phone calls, people  who don't like to save the taxpayers money and who don't want to help  young and beginning farmers and medium-sized and smaller farmers and  who worry more about the wealthy farmers have been able to undercut the  effort, even when a majority of both bodies has supported it.   I didn't give up as a result of the 2014 bill and the disappointment  there. I got through the U.S. Senate those hard caps on what any one  farmer can get and to make sure the people who benefited from it were,  in fact, farmers, not nonfarmers who maybe had a distant relationship  from some farming operation, maybe even being on Wall Street.   Once again, I was undercut in this effort to save the taxpayers money  and to concentrate our farm bill on medium- and small-sized farmers who  need the help, when things have happened naturally or politically or  internationally that are beyond their control that drive down prices or  acts of God such as a drought. It is the small- or medium-sized farmers  who need the help from the government, not these big farmers and  corporate farmers whom we are going to end up helping, the way this  bill is written.   To say the least, I am disappointed that the bill makes more  subsidies available to the wealthiest farmers and many nonfarmers. I  would say that is a severe understatement. I am more than just a little  disappointed, especially when the impact of large farmers being allowed  to manipulate the system is that young and beginning farmers face even  larger hurdles.   So far, the bill has not won much praise outside of the Washington  lobby groups whose members will receive more taxpayer subsidies from a  few select changes.   At its core, farm policy should be a limited safety net to help  farmers weather the storm of natural disasters, unpredictable commodity  markets, and other unforeseen challenges. This bill goes well beyond  that limited safety net.   Today we have a farm bill that is intentionally written--I want to  emphasize ``intentionally written''--to help the largest farmers  receive unlimited subsidies from the Federal Government. There is no  other way to characterize what the conference committee has done in  this area.   In the last farm bill, both bodies of Congress approved a commonsense  amendment I offered that would have limited the abuses related to title  I subsidies. This time the House would not even have that debate--no  debate on my reforms. The Senate did, however, include it in their  bill.   However, the 2014 conference committee put in a loophole that  exempted family farms, which account for approximately 95 percent of  farms, from the new rules. This bill makes their original loophole even  larger. So as bad as the 2014 farm bill was, this new 5-year farm bill  widens that loophole almost beyond explaining.   The new farm bill will allow nieces and nephews to qualify as part of  a family farm without any new requirements that they actually have to  work. Despite what some of my colleagues may say, this is not about  helping nieces and nephews get into farming. Why? Because every person  who really farms already qualifies for title I payments by themselves  without this new gimmick. So this new gimmick is just to award this big  taxpayer money to people who aren't actually working the farm.   Allowing nieces and nephews to qualify as part of a large farm entity  merely allows larger farmers to get more subsidies. They just need to  hire the right lawyer to structure the farming operation in a certain  way, and they can then receive unlimited taxpayer subsidies.   For years I have been using this figure about the top 10 percent of  the farmers receiving more than 70 percent of the subsidies from the  government. That is only one of the many reasons it is so hard for  young and beginning farmers to get started.   I know it is hard to believe, but I have never heard a single young  or beginning farmer tell me that the way to help the young and  beginning farmer is to give more money out of the U.S. Treasury to the  largest farmers.   Many farmers are hurting from the downturn in commodity prices. That  has been a downturn over the last three or four years. Corn and  soybeans have had significant price declines in those years. If only  all crops were as lucky as cotton, with its high prices ensured by the  Federal Government over the last year, then all people would be, what  we say, ``living in the clover.''   However, market corrections do not justify Congress expanding subsidy  loopholes that only benefit the wealthy--especially at a time when our  long-term fiscal situation is as bad as it has ever been.   The last time we passed a farm bill, our national debt was $17  trillion. Today it stands at $21.8 trillion, and we all know that it is  growing. So whether it is talking about saving the taxpayers' money or  whether it is talking about targeting the farm program to small and  medium-sized farmers as opposed to the wealthy, or whether it is  talking about getting young people into farming, Congress needs to get  serious about spending.   This bill represents an open-ended spigot of taxpayer subsidies in  the title I programs of the bill. Because of this, when we cast our  vote about 1 hour ago, I voted against this farm bill, which,  otherwise, is a pretty basic program. We could have done a lot more to  save the taxpayers money, and we didn't.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, during this season of Advent, millions  of Americans join Christians around the world to celebrate the coming  of Jesus Christ.   A central tenet of Christianity is born in the belief that Jesus is  the Light of the World.   On December 25, we celebrate the light, the hope, and the joy our  Lord and Savior brings into the world.   Today, I come to the floor of the U.S. Senate to pay tribute to a  servant of Christ who dedicated her life to bring light, hope, and joy  to children and families around the world.   Her name is Becky Weichhand.   Becky blazed a trail of hope and love to spread joy to children,  especially those awaiting adoption.   To those who knew her best, Becky was an unconditional prayer  warrior, who graciously shared love and loyalty to friends and  strangers alike.   By all accounts, Becky shared uncommon devotion in her advocacy for  children, especially those in our Nation's foster care system.   Since 2014, Becky served as executive director of the Congressional  Coalition on Adoption Institute.   Before that, she served as director of policy, where she shined light  on the needs of children here in the United States and abroad,  including the United Kingdom, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Cambodia, Vietnam,  South Korea, and Haiti.   Since first joining the corps of dedicated professionals working to  help the foster youth community, Becky had a plan.   She had a plan for kids who went to bed each night praying for a  forever home.   She had a plan for young people who were growing up without a mom or  dad.   She had a plan to connect as many kids as possible with a forever  family.   Becky worked tirelessly to educate, organize and advocate here on  Capitol Hill and at the grassroots.   She devoted her life and career to making dreams come true for  adoptive parents and their children.   Among her priorities and achievements, I know that Becky was  committed to growing the Foster Youth Internship Program that connects  foster youth and congressional offices.   The program provides opportunities for foster youth to work on  Capitol Hill.   Through this program, foster youth collaborate and bring real-life  perspective to the policymaking tables.   I have been fortunate to have an intern through this program who  worked with my staff to help develop Federal child welfare reforms.   They identified more effective ways to serve foster kids, including  those who age out of the system.   Becky also worked to grow the Angels in Adoption Program.   It brings recognition to families who go above and beyond the call to  action in their local communities to open their hearts and homes to  children awaiting adoption.   Shining light on the good deeds and unmet needs of others was her way  of bringing light to the world.  [[Page S7428]]    As a founder and cochair of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth,  I would like to turn the spotlight on Becky's good works.   She was driven to find a forever family for every child. She was a  problem solver brimming with energy. Her advocacy led to important  reforms. She believed in miracles. She made every effort to work  miracles for children and families.   Becky mentored foster youth and paved the way for kids to dream big.  She gave them reason to hope that their dreams can come true.   I extend my condolences to Becky's family, friends, and loved ones.   At age 36, Becky lost a brave battle to cancer.   Her legacy will live on and bring joy to countless children and moms  and dads where it matters the most: in a forever family united through  the blessing of adoption.   On Saturday, December 15, a celebration of life will take place at  the First Church of God in Becky's hometown of St. Joseph, MI.   On this day, her loved ones will celebrate the light, joy, and hope  she brought to this world.   May the blessings of God's Heavenly embrace welcome Becky into her  new forever home for life everlasting.                            ____________________
