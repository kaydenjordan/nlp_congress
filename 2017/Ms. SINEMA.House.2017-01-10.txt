 Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle for working with me, yet again, on this bipartisan bill to help  entrepreneurs and startup companies create jobs and grow our economy.   American startup businesses are growing both in number and diversity.  Entrepreneurs are finding new and better ways to bring together talent,  innovation, and investment capital in an increasingly competitive small  business environment.   The HALOS Act clarifies SEC regulations to ensure small businesses  may participate in educational demo days without the burden of having  to verify that attendees are accredited investors. Demo days provide  invaluable opportunities for entrepreneurs to meet and exchange ideas  with students, professors, business professionals, and potential future  investors.   The HALOS Act creates a clear path for startups to participate in  demo days sponsored by a government entity, nonprofit, angel investor  group, venture association, or other entity permitted by the SEC.  Specifically, the act clarifies the definition of general solicitation  to exempt communications and presentations at these events where  advertising for the event does not make specific investment offerings  and where no specific securities offering information is communicated  at the event.   This permits startups to connect with business experts, potential  future investors, and other entrepreneurs, all while maintaining  existing accredited investor verification requirements and exemptions  under Regulation D for the actual purchase or sale of securities. It  does not, in any way, permit the sale of securities to unaccredited  investors at demo days.   Companies such as Amazon, Costco, Facebook, Google, and Starbucks  were all initially funded by angel investors. As we work to make  America more  [[Page H263]]  competitive in the new global economy, we need to encourage the growth  of innovative startups and job-creating small businesses.   Again, I thank Representative Chabot for working with me on this  commonsense, bipartisan bill. I am committed to working with my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that Arizona startups  have the support they need to grow their businesses and create jobs.                                time  1445
