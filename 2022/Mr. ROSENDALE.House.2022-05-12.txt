 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Montana's police  force for National Police Week. Montana law enforcement officers put  their lives on the line every day to keep our communities safe and  protect those who cannot protect themselves.   They don't do it for money. They don't do it for recognition. They do  it because they feel called to protect those around them.   The absence of law enforcement means our communities are less safe,  enables crime to surge, and thugs will roam the streets freely without  consequence.   I stand here tonight to say thank you to the Montana police officers  for their sacrifices and for willingly putting their lives on the line  to protect our neighborhoods.   Without reservation, I back the blue and will continue to do  everything I can to get them the resources they need to do their jobs  and keep America safe.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the tremendous chairman of the  Freedom Caucus, the tip of the spear for this body, the conscience of  the conservative movement here in Washington, D.C. I am proud to stand  here with him to be a voice for life today.   It is painfully ironic to me as I look back that, in 1973, the same  year that the Endangered Species Act was passed to protect endangered  plants and animals, our Supreme Court made that terrible, flawed  decision in Roe v. Wade, allowing abortions to take place.   Now, I don't know how many wolves or how many bears have been saved  since 1973, but I can tell you that 63 million children have been  killed. Sixty-three million children have been killed since that day.   Roe v. Wade created abortions on the basis of a supposed right to  privacy under the 14th Amendment, but they  [[Page H4917]]  forget about the guarantees in our Constitution to life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness. The very first promise that we have from our  creator is life.   The Dobbs decision would suspend the Federal protection of abortions  and finally return this question back to the States.   When we leave here, after this decision is finally released, and we  are all are very optimistic that it is going to overturn Roe v. Wade,  let us not rest, folks. Let us not rest. We are still going to have to  go back to our respective State legislatures and give them the support  and give them the guidance that they are going to need to make sure  that they protect the lives of the unborn.   Let's be very clear about this. Democrats, not Republicans, are the  ones who are out of step with the American public. The rest of the  world, they are out of step with them. Today, they continue to push for  taxpayer-funded death on demand. Let's call it what it is. We are no  longer talking about yanking an unborn child from a mother's womb.   The Democrats are so out of step they are literally having  discussions about whether they will kill a child once it is outside of  its mother. Taxpayer-funded death on demand is what they are trying to  push forward, and I am so proud that all the Members are standing here  to fight against that today.   Roe v. Wade was outdated and was made before scientific advances  helped us understand the clear humanity of the unborn child. An unborn  life is a separate, unique individual with its own DNA.   Let's follow the science. That is what they always say. Let's follow  the science, our friends to the left. Well, let's follow the science.  That child has separate and unique DNA. It is a new person.   Let's protect it.                                time  1900    I have always been a staunch supporter and defender of the most  vulnerable, especially the children. My wife and I have participated in  pro-life marches across the State of Montana in many, many different  cities and municipalities. This is the first year that we were able to  join many people here in Washington, D.C., our Nation's Capital--the  encouragement and the enthusiasm amongst the tens of thousands of  people to protect life was overwhelming.   Madam Speaker, I have three children; I have three sons. I can  remember the first time that I held my children, each and every one of  them. I looked at their faces to see if they matched mine, to see if  they had that little dimple in their chin. I looked to see if they had  all 10 of their fingers and 10 of their toes.   I will tell you that I thanked God that each one of them was a  healthy human being that he had gifted to my wife and I and gave us the  responsibility to nurture that child.   I now have the experience of doing the exact same thing with a  granddaughter; to look into her face and see this precious individual.  I look at my son and my daughter-in-law and know that this child is  dependent upon them for safety, food, and protection, and know that  they are going to do the exact same thing that I have been blessed to  do with them.   Every life is precious, not perfect. Every life is precious. That is  what we need to remember today. We have an obligation to protect each  one, healthy, imperfect, or infirm.   I pledge to you, God as my judge, that I will do that just as long as  I am able to take in air and breathe.
