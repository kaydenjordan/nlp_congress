 I want to thank my colleague and friend Senator Cruz  from Texas, who has presented our bill, the Pay Our Coast Guard Act,  which he noted is a bipartisan bill in the Commerce Committee--the  chairman, the ranking member. I am the ranking member on the  subcommittee in charge of the Coast Guard. The chair of that committee,  Senator Baldwin, is also a cosponsor of this bill.   Senator Cruz laid it out really well. This is a very simple bill. The  men and women who protect our coastline, who protect our country, who  are in the military, whom I see working so hard, risking their lives  day in and day out in Alaska, where we have some of the most members of  the Coast Guard stationed in our great State than in almost any other  State--they need to be protected, and they need to know the U.S. Senate  has their back.   Now, it is kind of hard to believe what Senator Cruz just mentioned,  but let me repeat what happened in 2019. When there was a partial  government shutdown, every branch of the U.S. military--the Army, the  Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force--they all got paid. They all got  paid, with one exception--the Coast Guard.   Imagine how you felt if you were in the Coast Guard, watching your  brothers and sisters in the other services getting paid and you  weren't. There were operations going on in the Persian Gulf where  members of the Marine Corps, the Navy, and the Coast Guard were doing  joint operations against Iranian aggression and one of those members on  those ships and boats wasn't getting paid--the Coast Guard members.   So this happened in America. As a matter of fact, the Commandant of  the Coast Guard, at the time, ADM Karl Schultz, said:         [T]his marks the first time in our Nation's history that       servicemembers in a U.S. Armed Force have not been paid       during a lapse in government appropriations.    So what are we doing on the floor today? We are saying: Let's not let  this happen again.   In the event of a shutdown, which none of us want, let's make sure  that what happened--and Senator Cruz just mentioned it. Coast Guard men  and women across the country, including in Alaska, woke up for 34 days  and did not know whether they were going to get a paycheck and,  essentially, had to rely on donations from the communities in which  they served to do their job.   Now, look, the communities came together, and that was a wonderful  thing. But I have committed to my Coast Guard members in Alaska and  throughout the country that this should never happen again. This is a  no-brainer, and I certainly hope no Senator is going to come down here  and object and say: Well, this is an appropriations issue.   Come on. This is a right or wrong issue. Fix it. We are trying to fix  it--right now.   I was the one who came down during the last government shutdown and  tried to get unanimous consent. I talked to the President of the United  States. He said he was going to sign our bill to pay the Coast Guard,  and the Democratic minority leader, at the time, blocked it. I  certainly hope none of our colleagues, Democrat or Republican, are  going to block it again.   This is a bipartisan bill. It makes sense, and the Coast Guard and  their family members are watching. Does the U.S. Senate have their back  or not?   I strongly encourage my colleagues to work with us to pass our Pay  Our Coast Guard Act bill right now.    Mr. President, I am shocked, disappointed, and, to be  honest, stunned. I didn't think anyone was going to object to this  bill. It makes no sense to do so. I didn't understand the Senator from  Washington's explanation. Her colleague from Washington is actually the  chairman of the Commerce Committee and a cosponsor of this bill.   So, again, this is a no-brainer. None of us want a government  shutdown, but, if it happens, we can't let what happened in 2019 be  repeated. And what happened in 2019 was that every member of the  military services was paid, with the exception of the Coast Guard. And  I have told them that we won't let that happen again.   So I am going to keep coming down to the floor with Senator Cruz, and  we are going to get this bill passed.   And if you are watching and you are a Coast Guard member and you  understand what happened, Democratic leadership in the U.S. Senate just  blocked this bill--a bipartisan bill to make sure you get treated  fairly in the event of a government shutdown.   It is the right thing to do. Senator Cruz and I will keep working it  to make sure this happens.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am on the floor for a couple of  reasons but No. 1 and most important is to congratulate General Smith,  Gen. Eric Smith, to be the new Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps.   Now, the Presiding Officer may have seen the vote--a pretty  impressive vote, 96 to 0. That does not happen a lot in the U.S.  Senate. But every Senator on the floor just an hour ago gave Gen. Eric  Smith a huge vote of confidence--and with good reason.   This is a Marine officer who has a stellar career--stellar career. He  has commanded at every level in the Marine Corps: as an infantry  officer, Weapons Company, 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment. As a  general officer, he commanded the U.S. Marine Corps Forces Southern  Command, 1st Marine Corps Division, III MEF--Marine Expeditionary  Force--and Marine Corps Combat Development Command. That is about as  stellar a career as it gets.   Additionally, he is a serious combat veteran. As I have noted to my  colleagues before, a lot of the flag officers in the military right now  were the lieutenants and captains right after 9/11. This is a group of  senior military leaders who have seen more combat than certainly almost  any other generation since World War II. And General Smith was one of  those: wounded in action in Iraq, did not want to go home; frontline  commander in combat; served in Afghanistan.   Unfortunately, like a lot of commanders during these challenging  wars, he had a number of marines and friends killed in action whom he  was in command of. So he knows war. He knows the Marine Corps.   I look forward to working closely with General Smith on a whole host  of issues related to the Marine Corps and now, as a member of the Joint  Chiefs, related to the national defense of our country, including  Marine Corps force design, including the Navy's requirement that is in  law--in law, if you are watching, Secretary of the Navy Del Toro; it is  in law--31 amphibs for the Marine Corps.   So these and many other issues I look forward to working with General  Smith on. But again, 96 to 0.   Great job, General. Semper Fi.   Mr. President, I also think it is important to just talk a little bit  about how we got here, and to be honest, we should have gotten here a  lot earlier--weeks, if not months, earlier.   I am a pro-life and pro-military Senator, so I have been very  involved in these negotiations between leadership  [[Page S4647]]  and some of our Members on issues of moving forward nominees but also  on not agreeing with Secretary Austin's memo as it relates to travel  issues.   There have been a number of us who have been trying to get to a  resolution on some of the holds that are happening here on the Senate  floor.   By the way, holds happen all the time. The way they are resolved 98  percent of the time is through compromise. So that is why I am trying  to help my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the administration  and the Department of Defense. But in the meantime, there was nothing  preventing the majority leader from bringing qualified military members  to the floor for a vote--nothing. As a matter of fact, in the Senate,  we vote on members of the Joint Chiefs all the time. That is a  tradition here--when the Democrats have been in charge, when the  Republicans have been in charge--but that has not been the priority  here.   In the last several months, we have had 76 rollcall votes, everything  from the Assistant Administrator of the EPA to district court judges,  NLRB judges, Board members for the National Archives, Assistant  Secretaries of Education, HHS. You name it, we have been confirming  them, with the exception of one group: military officers.   A lot of the press is saying: Well, that was the Senator from  Alabama.   That is not true. That is not true at all. We could be voting on  individual members of the Joint Chiefs. That wasn't the priority. That  wasn't the priority.   Senator Tuberville was going to make a resolution, signed by 17  Senators, to file cloture on General Smith, and all of a sudden, the  majority leader thought it was important to start moving forward on  Joint Chiefs of Staff nominees. I think that is good. That shows some  compromise. And I think even that little bit of compromise is going to  help us on the broader issues that we are all trying to address.   But I do want to just correct the record. In our Ukraine briefing  yesterday, Secretary Austin, Secretary of Defense, said he really  appreciated Senator Schumer's leadership on filing cloture on these  Joint Chiefs we just voted on. Well, with all due respect to Senator  Schumer and Secretary Austin, it wasn't his leadership; it was our side  of the aisle that forced his hand to do it. That is a fact. That is a  fact.   So, Mr. Secretary, I know the Senate procedures can be a little  confusing, but you might want to thank this side of the aisle for  actually moving forward to make sure that Joint Chiefs are getting  confirmed.   So I hope we continue to do that and continue to work like a number  of us have been on a broader compromise here to move forward on these  other military nominees.   By the way, I do welcome many of my Democratic colleagues' newfound  interest in national security. A number of them have been howling about  national security and we are not ready and readiness issues. A lot of  them, I have never heard them talk about national security, but they  are all talking about it now. That is great. Welcome.   By the way, join me in criticizing President Biden for sending to us  3 years in a row three budgets each year that dramatically cut our  Department of Defense.   President Biden's budget this year shrinks the Army, shrinks the  Navy, shrinks the Marine Corps. It is exactly the wrong message to be  sending Xi Jingping and Putin during one of the most dangerous times  our has Nation faced since the end of World War II.   So if you are worried about national security, join me on some of  these. It is great. I hear a lot of howling from silent voices on  national security from the other side of the aisle, so I welcome you to  be caring about these issues.   I want to end where I started, and I want to thank and congratulate  again General Smith. I also want to congratulate the new soon-to-be  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General C.Q. Brown, who is also  exceptionally qualified, and the new Chief of Staff of the Army,  General George. All three were recently confirmed by the U.S. Senate in  overwhelming numbers--overwhelming. That is progress. On both sides of  the aisle, that is progress. That is what we needed. I am hopeful that  progress will lead to more compromise on these other issues that we all  know are important.   I yield the floor.
