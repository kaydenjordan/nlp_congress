 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the Caribou VFW on  their 70th anniversary. The Caribou VFW, known as the Lister-Knowlton  VFW Post 9389, was founded on May 11, 1947, by veterans returning home  from World War II. The post was named after two brave Caribou natives,  Private Evan Lister and CPL Edward Knowlton, who served their country  during World War II and made the ultimate sacrifice when they were only  23 years old. Their dedication and service to our country will never be  forgotten.   I also want to recognize the ladies auxiliary, who will celebrate  their 70th anniversary on June 19. The ladies auxiliary was formed by  women who were mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters of veterans who  served in our Armed Forces and whose service made them eligible for the  Veterans of Foreign Wars. In addition, the auxiliary includes female  veterans who served abroad in times of war.   While I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge all of the  veterans for their service, I want to make special note of David O.  Michaud. David is a World War II veteran and the sole surviving charter  member of the Lister-Knowlton VFW Post 9389. I would also like to honor  Josephine Bell, an original charter member of the VFW Ladies Auxiliary  in Caribou who is still with us today.   These 70th anniversaries, of both the Lister-Knowlton VFW post and  the ladies auxiliary, provide occasion to celebrate the storied  tradition of service, both past and present, that the Veterans of  Foreign Wars represent. Each of us is forever indebted to those members  of the VFW who served in the protection of the United States and to  their families for the care and support they have provided. We are also  grateful to the VFW for their continued service, supporting those  veterans who have returned, advocating on their behalf at all levels of  government, and organizing a variety of community building projects.   In closing, I am glad to join with the members of the VFW and the  ladies auxiliary in Caribou in honoring this 70th year of working on  behalf of veterans, the State of Maine, and our great Nation.                            ____________________
