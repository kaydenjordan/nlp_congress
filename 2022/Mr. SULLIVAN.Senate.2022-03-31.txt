 Today's opening prayer will be offered by our guest  Chaplain, Rabbi Mendy Greenberg, Director of Mat-Su Jewish Center,  Chabad-Lubavitch, in Palmer, AK.   The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:   Almighty God, Master of the Universe, we stand before You in prayer  in these troubling times when innocent men, women, and children have  lost their lives and millions fled their homeland due to the  catastrophic war in Ukraine. In the words of King David, Psalms,  Chapter 121:         I lift my eyes to the mountains--from where will my help       come? My help will come from the Lord, Maker of heaven and       earth.    May You, Almighty God, grant the Members of this honorable body  wisdom and understanding that the ultimate way to eliminate the cause  of war and bring true peace to the world is by embodying the universal  values of the seven commandments issued to Noah after the great flood,  foremost of which is not to commit murder.   Almighty God, I beseech You to bless the U.S. Senate assembled today  to fulfill one of Your seven commandments to govern by just laws and in  the merit of the global spiritual giant and leader, Your servant, the  Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, whose 120th birthday will be  celebrated this coming month on the 11th day of Nissan, Tuesday, April  12.   In 1978, this honorable body established the Rebbe's birthday as  Education and Sharing Day USA and is proclaimed annually by the  President of the United States in recognition of the Rebbe's global  campaign to bring awareness and educate our youth about these ethical  values of the Seven Noahide Laws as the basis for a just and  compassionate society.   Almighty God, may it be in the merit of realizing the Rebbe's vision  for humanity, we speedily see the fulfillment of Isaiah's promise:         Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither       shall they learn war anymore.    With the coming of Moshiach, Amen.                            ____________________     Madam President, thank you for allowing me to open the  Senate with you. It was a true honor to have Rabbi Mendy Greenberg, who  is doing amazing work in Palmer, AK, open the Senate with his very  powerful and meaningful prayer and very appropriate prayer for what is  happening in the world.   I just want to say a little bit about our incredible Jewish community  in Alaska. Rabbi Greenberg's parents are actually up in the Gallery  watching--his father, Rabbi Greenberg and his incredible wife, Esti.   I just want to say what they do for our--community--communities  throughout Alaska--is so powerful, so meaningful, and touches so many  lives way beyond the Jewish community of Alaska--way beyond that  community. I love the phrase referring to our wonderful Jewish  community of Alaska, the ``frozen chosen,'' because it is a little cold  in our State, as most Americans know.   But here is the thing about this community: They are incredible in  terms of  [[Page S1876]]  bringing all Alaskans together. We have this annual event called the  Jewish Gala that has hundreds and hundreds of Alaskans of all faiths  who participate in this every year. It is one of my favorite things to  do as an Alaskan, to come and celebrate not just the Jewish community,  but the spirit of togetherness, the spirit of faith, and the spirit of  taking care of one another. That is what this incredible community  does, led by both Rabbi Greenbergs, who we saw the younger today give  this very powerful prayer.   I want to thank him and his parents for being here today. It is not  always easy to get to DC from Alaska--a couple of thousand miles at  least. To our Jewish community back home, to the Greenbergs for all  they have done, I just want to, on the Senate floor here, offer my  deepest thanks for the example they set for the entire State of Alaska.  It is great having them here, and what they do for our State is really  powerful, really important.   Thank you, Madam President, for allowing me to participate in the  opening and the prayer this morning.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Majority Leader
