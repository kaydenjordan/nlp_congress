 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for  organizing this. This is an essential topic in this essential time that  we find ourselves.   We have a unique foundation, in that our Nation rests on the  understanding that our inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness are not a grant from this government but, rather,  a gift from God.   Among these inalienable rights enshrined in our First Amendment is  the freedom of speech. Indeed, the peace and tranquility of our entire  Republic rest on the understanding that the people have a right to have  their voice heard.   But we have entered into a most troubling time in our Nation. For all  the talk of unity by this current administration, this government has  sought only conformity.   In this Chamber, we have witnessed the unilateral march of the  extreme-left legislation designed not to protect our liberties but,  rather, force the American people to conform to their extreme ideas of  government-mandated social engineering and the restructuring of an  economy from the most successful model in history to one of socialism,  which has failed everywhere it has been tried.   Then there is Big Tech. These companies that arose to prominence in  an environment that only economic freedom and opportunity provide have  now embraced authoritarianism, fostering a world that is worse than the  one they hoped to correct.   They have selectively canceled conservative voices while allowing  leftist members, even in this body, to repeatedly call for unrest in  our streets and violence against dissenting voices.   They have allowed their platforms to raise money to bail out violent  rioters, these true insurrectionists who have called for an end to  America, that have burned our flags and literally taken over city  blocks, declaring them autonomous to the United States.   Yes, these Big Tech platforms continue to provide a platform for  Communist China, for terrorist groups, and others to spew their  propaganda.   Then there are the multinational corporations that have bought into  this diabolical movement. They are either ignorant to history or simply  care more about their quarterly earnings report than the liberty,  opportunity, or personal prosperity of their neighbors, the American  people.   They would rather cozy up to the powerful to gain access to crush  their competition and to protect corporate profits than stand up for  the very principles and economic opportunity that enabled their own  success. They do a disservice to the people of this Nation. The  hypocrisy is not overlooked.   To some in our Nation who have experienced the relative peace and  security that comes with being heirs of these blessings of liberty,  these trends could seem novel or perhaps part of the natural ebb and  flow of politics in a free society.   Sometimes it is harder for us born here to see the signs, but some of  the most compelling voices sounding the alarm right now are the  immigrants who come here. I have spoken to many from Cuba, Ecuador,  Iran, and Venezuela. They see the signs in a way that many of us do  not, and they are fearful, angered, and heartbroken.                                time  1945    Venezuela, just a few short years ago, was the economic jewel of  South America. Today, it is a wasteland fraught with poverty, conflict,  and oppression.   A couple in my district came from Iran. They are terrified by what  they are now seeing here. One of them liked a post about the killing of  Soleimani and found her account temporarily halted on the platform. The  irony is too rich.   I spoke to a lady from Ecuador. She had come to this country at about  18 years of age with her family. Under severe persecution, she had fled  the country to come here. She didn't refer to this as the United States  of America.  [[Page H2189]]  She said: ``I come to freedom country. We have to do everything we can  to protect freedom country.'' Those were her words.   So we know that while the terminology and the methods may be new, the  cancel culture movement is hardly new to history. Despotic regimes have  worked to silence dissent for millennia.   What is different about this moment is the broad embrace of the  movement by those in positions of power within the United States of  America in order to consolidate political power or perhaps preserve  their personal status quo, all at the sake of the liberties of their  fellow citizens.   Ronald Reagan reminded us that freedom is never more than one  generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in  the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for  them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling  our children and our children's children what it was once like to live  in the United States where men were free.   It is time to restore power to the American people. It is time for  people across this Nation to stand up in boardrooms and classrooms and  houses of worship and in this hallowed Chamber, to stand up with  courage to this evil movement.   God forbid we be the generation that allows this precious and unique  experiment in self-government, this imperfect but beautiful Republic,  to sink, enveloped by the undertow of the forces of envy, strife, and  division. Let us not let that happen.   Let us be that generation, like generations before, that work toward  that more perfect union, one that protects and preserves our beloved  freedom country.
