 Mr. President, I would like to first thank my colleague  from Kentucky for his consistent, over the years--consistent fighting,  I use that word--fighting for the Constitution. I truly appreciate it,  and I appreciate his raising this constitutional point of order in an  hour or so.   The issue he raises is one of constitutionality versus  unconstitutionality. I have been reading positions on both sides. I  understand there are legitimate arguments on both sides of that  question. But the fact is, 3 weeks ago, we came together in this body  and we collectively decided that it was not wise, it was not smart-- regardless of the constitutionality or the ability for us to do so, it  was not smart for Congress to overrule, overturn the wishes of voters  and of States that certified the electors. We felt that was not wise.   Again, in a couple of hours, we are going to be voting on--we won't  be able to debate, which is why I am rising today or at this moment--we  are going to debate whether a trial of someone who is no longer a  President, no longer a civil servant, a private citizen, whether that  is constitutional or not constitutional. Again, there are good  arguments on both sides. Senators will vote differently and have  justification for whatever side of that argument they take.   What I would like my colleagues to consider when they decide how to  vote on that is not the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of  that; I want them to consider, is it wise? Will a trial of a former  President, of a private citizen--will it heal? Will it unify? I think  the answer is clearly it will not. A trial of a former President is  simply vindictive. It will divide. It is like opening up a wound and  throwing salt in it. That is not a healing process.   Again, the question when we vote on this in a couple of hours, for  every Senator, should be, Is it wise? Is it the right thing to do? I  think from that standpoint, the choice is very clear: It will not heal.  It will not unite.   Let's put an end to this now. Let's dismiss this trial and rule it  unconstitutional.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
