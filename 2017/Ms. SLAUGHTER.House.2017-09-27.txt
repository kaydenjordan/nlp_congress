 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, extending the Federal Aviation Administration's  authority is traditionally something that gets bipartisan support. That  hasn't been the case this time, as we saw on Monday when a prior  version of this bill failed on suspension. It contained several  extraneous provisions, but it didn't include some of the most important  priorities that we face.   September 30 is nearly upon us. That is the deadline to reauthorize  programs that the American people depend on. That includes things like  the Perkins student loan program, which helps low-income students to  finance their education.   There are 500,000 students across the country, including nearly  50,000 from New York, relying on it right now, but the Perkins Loan  Program isn't anywhere in this bill.   The bill also does nothing to extend the Children's Health Insurance  Program created in 1997 with broad bipartisan support. More than 9  million children get their health insurance through this program.  Without continued Federal funding, States are going to begin running  out of money to take care of some of the most vulnerable kids, and they  can't wait until the end of the year for us to act.   Community health centers have also been left out of the bill, and  they have told us that they will have problems from day one. If we  don't extend their funding, an estimated 9 million people would lose  access to healthcare.   These are essential bipartisan programs, Mr. Speaker, and what does  it say about the majority's leadership if they are not extended by the  deadline? It does not bode well for our ability to fund the government  later this year, to raise the debt ceiling, extend the Flood Insurance  Program, or reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.   This bill is an incredibly important one. No one in this Chamber or  anywhere that I know of in the world wants the FAA program stopped and  their employees furloughed or airport projects brought to a halt. We  should work together and get it right.   This package, however, has not been negotiated on a bipartisan basis.  It didn't go through regular order. Committees have been shut out of  the process, and Democrats, who represent half the population in the  United States, didn't get a say.   We are all glad to see provisions included here to provide some tax  relief for victims of the recent hurricanes. With regular order and a  more open process, this could be a more comprehensive package of  extenders that provide more tax relief for victims to recover and to  rebuild. After all, the Democrats did suggest 21 bipartisan tax  provisions which were included in previous relief legislation after  previous disasters.                                time  1545    But none of those, except five, I think, are included in this bill.  That is a shame.   We have said it before. This is, I think, the 44th closed rule this  session, and that is just about all the bills we have done. This bill  could either have been bipartisan extending the FAA authorization, or a  comprehensive package of extenders that provided the tax relief  necessary for hurricane victims to recover and rebuild. The bill before  us is neither. I doubt many of us have had time to review the changes  that were made last night.   I have often said that a bad process leads to a bad product, and, Mr.  Speaker, I am afraid that is what we see with this bill. Another  opportunity for bipartisanship has been turned into another political  fight.   I, regretfully, reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I  will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream  Act. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would help thousands of  young people who are Americans in every way except on paper.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Sanchez).    Mr. Speaker, I think the previous speaker made a very  important statement, that we should treat all Americans alike.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Roybal-Allard).   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, the President's decision to rescind  DACA has brought fear to hundreds of thousands of DREAMers and their  families.   They are DREAMers like Saul Jimenez, who teaches special needs  students in Los Angeles, and is just one example of how DREAMers  contribute and add value to our country and our communities.   DREAMers are American in every way except for their immigration  status. To send DREAMers to a country they have never known would be  tragic for them and our Nation, which will lose their valuable  contributions.   The American people overwhelmingly oppose deporting our DREAMers, and  our faith-based community and business leaders are imploring Congress  to pass the Dream Act. Yet the Republican leadership is ignoring their  wishes and refusing to allow us a vote on this bipartisan, bicameral  bill.   To my Republican colleagues who say they want to protect our Nation's  DREAMers: If that is true, this is your chance. Vote ``no'' on the  previous question so we can vote on the Dream Act and put our DREAMers  on the road to the security and future they have earned in the only  country they know, the United States of America. The time to pass the  Dream Act is now. Vote ``no'' on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond to  my friend.   I appreciate the information that the gentleman just gave us. We have  been told the community health service will be in trouble from day one.   Mr. Speaker, I inquire of the gentleman whether he has the same kind  of information about them?    I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I appreciate that  because millions of people use the community health services, and the  children, we cannot let them go unattended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Judy Chu).   Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, it has been 3 weeks since  President Trump announced he would be ending DACA; 3 weeks of fear in  homes, classrooms, and offices where DREAMers wonder if they still have  a future here in the only home they have ever known; 3 weeks for  Congress to answer President Trump's request for a bill that would stop  him from executing his own cruel order.   Here is that bill. Members from both parties have said they want to  do something to protect DREAMers. Here is that something. Over 80  percent of Americans believe DREAMers who live, work, contribute, and  follow the law should stay here. Here is our chance to show we are  listening.   We must pass the Dream Act because of people like Jose Antonio  Vargas, an immigrant from the Philippines, who never knew he was  undocumented until he applied for his learner's permit. But being  undocumented didn't stop his pursuit of the American Dream. He worked  hard and became a journalist, ultimately winning the Pulitzer Prize for  his articles.   Let's act to bring DREAMers like Jose out of the shadows. Let act to  encourage more to achieve what he did. Let's right this wrong, stop the  cruel end of DACA, and finally pass the Dream Act today.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Mitchell). Members are reminded to  refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  New York for her leadership. I thank my fellow Texan on this effort.   I am not on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, but I do  believe the FAA should have this extension. I do believe I should  advocate for the many employees and consumers of aviation needs, that  the air traffic controllers should not be privatized. And I understand  that this particular bill does not have that provision.   The focus should be on extending a number of these health matters  that are very important to us, and particularly, the inspiring health  programs dealing with the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical  Education Program, the Special Diabetes Program for Indians, and the  Medicare Intravenous Immune Globulin Demonstration project, a number of  these.   I do take concern with the diminishing of the Medicare Improvement  Fund by $50 million and, frankly, I believe that we should move forward  on these emergencies, particularly as it relates to hurricane victims  or areas.    Let me, however, focus on what is of devastating need in the areas of  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and make mention of the fact that  the U.S. Virgin Islands is included in these tax benefits, and Puerto  Rico, agreed to by the Members representing that area.   It is important that people do not have a penalty on their account  tax provisions. I hope this can move quickly through the Senate. The  employee retention credit for employees: the bill provides a tax credit  for 40 percent of wages, up to $6,000 per employee, paid by a disaster- affected employer to an employee from a core disaster area.   Charitable deductions: the bill suspends limitations on charitable  contributions.   In our community, there are people who don't have the gap to survive.  They are working. Their job is closed down because of Hurricane Harvey.  I imagine in other areas they may be receiving charitable moneys. Those  who give the charitable contributions need to be helped.   The disaster-related personal casualty losses and the special rule  for determining the earned income tax credit is extremely important.   We want more. We are desperate, and we need more, Mr. Speaker. I hope  that we will be able to work together to get more for those who are  desperate from these hurricanes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say to the  previous speaker that my understanding is the fallback provision on  flood insurance came to the Federal Government because the private  insurers didn't want to do it.   If we can get them to take it over, I think everybody would be  relieved.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Mrs. Torres).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Mrs. Torres).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gallego).    I thank the chairman for giving me that answer, and I  yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this is our 44th closed rule for this session of  Congress which prevents Members from offering amendments to the floor.  This has put this Congress well on its way to becoming the most closed  Congress in modern history. Democrats have been routinely unable to do  the job we were elected to do and amend bills to represent the concerns  of the people of the United States which we are both privileged and  obligated to serve.   Despite his promises, Speaker Ryan has shown a complete disregard for  regular order since assuming the gavel. Bills routinely come before the  Rules Committee that haven't even been considered by the relevant  committees. The majority even moved a healthcare repeal bill through  this Chamber earlier this year without a score from the nonpartisan  experts at the Congressional Budget Office.   This measure would impact one-sixth of our Nation's economy and tens  of millions of people if it became law.   This is no way to run the people's House. The public expects more,  and it is high time that we heed those calls.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, the rule,  and the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. This will be a 5-minute vote.
