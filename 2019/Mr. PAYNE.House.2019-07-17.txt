 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge Tykhil Greene. Mr.  Greene is the first African American valedictorian of the University  Academy Charter High School in Jersey City, New Jersey.   Mr. Greene's hard work over the past 4 years is an incredible feat.  He achieved the highest level of academic success in his class. He also  received the Salutatorian Award from the Jersey City Community Middle  School. These honors are so well-deserved.   At University Academy, Mr. Greene challenged himself by taking AP  classes every year. Each summer, Mr. Greene worked for the Jersey City  Department of Recreation. Even with this rigorous schedule, Mr. Greene  had only 10 absences in 4 years.   He continues to pursue these challenges as he prepares for college.  Mr. Greene will study international business and prelaw at Seton Hall  University.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Tykhil Greene on his hard work and  success. He has a very bright future ahead of him, and we are proud of  him in the 10th Congressional District in the State of New Jersey.                            ____________________
