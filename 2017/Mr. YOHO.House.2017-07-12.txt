 Mr. Chairman, you will hear, and you have already heard, in  favor of the Nadler amendment, such as GTMO is contrary to American  values; detainees can be held safely at less cost in the U.S. prisons,  and GTMO is a recruiting tool for terrorists.   Points against the Nadler amendment: the number one task of the  Federal Government is to provide for the common defense and security of  the United States of America and American citizens.   Americans are safer with detainees in Guantanamo versus the homeland.   GTMO is the safest and most appropriate location to hold detainees.  It is appropriate and lawful to hold detainees until all al-Qaida and  associate forces are defeated.   The law for war detainees, including GTMO detainees, states that they  cannot be commingled with Federal prisoners, thus requiring separate  facilities costing hundreds of millions of dollars.   Evidence of the use of Guantanamo as a recruiting or propaganda tool  is conjecture, subjective, and inconclusive.   Terrorists will continue to attack whether GTMO exists or not.  Terrorists will invent any excuse to attract new recruits.   I will not support this.
