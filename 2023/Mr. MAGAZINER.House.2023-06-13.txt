 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 300th  anniversary of the town of South Kingstown, Rhode Island, home to some  of our State's most iconic, historic, economic, and cultural treasures.   Formally established in 1723, South Kingstown's origins can be traced  back to the Pettaquamscutt Purchase of 1658, where the founder of our  State, Roger Williams, and Narragansett sachems signed a document  establishing the settlement of Kingstown Village, which became one of  the five original State capitals of Rhode Island.   With the coming of the industrial revolution, the villages of Peace  Dale and Wakefield in South Kingstown became economic engines,  employing thousands and defining life for many South Kingstown  residents well into the 20th century.   Some of these old South Kingstown mills are still standing today,  including Kenyon's Grist Mill, the oldest continuing manufacturing  business in Rhode Island, dating back to 1696.   South Kingstown is also home to the University of Rhode Island,  founded in 1892, our State's flagship public land-grant university,  that today is leading research and innovation in the blue economy, with  disciplines ranging from engineering to oceanography, entrepreneurship,  healthcare, and so much more.   The town has grown and evolved but has never lost its rural  character, beautiful seascapes, and hardworking roots. Whether it was  the farmers who tilled the land, the millworkers who built the middle  class, or the university researchers on the cutting edge of innovation,  everyone in South Kingstown, from Wakefield to Matunuck, Peace Dale,  and Usquepaug, has contributed to the town's success in one way or  another.   The people of South Kingstown built a strong and vibrant community  over the past 300 years, and may South Kingstown continue to thrive for  generations to come.                            ____________________
