 Mr. President, in 8 days, just a short distance from this  Senate Chamber, Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th President of  the United States. On that date, January 20, 2017, the fate of more  than 750,000 young American immigrants will hang in the balance. They  will be waiting to learn if they have a place in America's future or  whether they will lose their legal status to stay in the United States.  For many of them, it is a period of the highest anxiety, wondering what  is going to happen next.   It was 7 years ago that I sent a letter to President Obama. I had  introduced the DREAM Act, which said that if you were brought to  America as a child, an infant, or an adolescent, lived here all your  life, went to school and did well, and had no criminal record of any  consequences, we would give you a chance to stay. Over a period of  time, you would be able to become legal in America--a citizen in  America. Sixteen years ago, I introduced it, and we passed it once in  the Senate, once in the House, and never, ever made it the law of the  land.   I wrote to President Obama, with Senator Dick Lugar, Republican of  Indiana, and said: Find some way, if you can, as President, to protect  these young DREAMers, as we call them. And he did. It is called DACA,  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.   What it basically said is that if you qualify under the DREAM Act,  you could pay a filing fee of almost $500, go through a criminal  background check and interview, and, then, if you qualify, you will be  given a 2-year temporary protection from deportation and the ability to  work. So far, over 750,000 young people have come forward. They have  made such a difference in their own lives, in the lives of their  families, and even in our country.   I have come over 100 times to tell their stories, and I will tell  another one today. But I want to also announce that today we have a  significant bipartisan breakthrough for this Congress: Republican  Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and I have introduced the  BRIDGE Act. The BRIDGE Act, which has bipartisan sponsorship, would say  that even if we eliminated President Obama's Executive order, we would  protect these young people from deportation and allow them to continue  to work and study.   I want to thank Senator Graham. He has been a terrific partner.   This is an issue which weighs heavily on my mind and conscience. We  believe this is a reasonable way to extend this protection and to say  to Congress in the meantime: Get to work. Roll up your sleeves. Pass a  comprehensive immigration bill. Work with the new President, work with  both sides, Democrats and Republicans, and come up with an approach.   I thank Senator Graham for joining me in the introduction of this  BRIDGE Act.   For the young people across America, I can tell you, I understand  your fears. I understand your anxiety. There are many of us who are  dedicated to making certain that this ends well for you and for your  family.   There are pretty amazing young people who are in that category I have  addressed. One of them is Jose Espinoza. At the age of 2, Jose Espinoza  was brought here from Mexico. He grew up in the northwest suburbs of  Chicago and became an excellent student. In high school, he was a  member of the National Honor Society, and he graduated in the top 3  percent of his class. He was elected to the student council every year  in high school, the treasurer, vice president, editor of the high  school yearbook, mentored and taught physical education to a freshman  class of 40 students. He was also captain of the varsity track and  field team and a member of the soccer team and the school orchestra.   In his spare time, if there was any, Jose volunteered with the United  Way, and as a result of his academic record and volunteer service, he  received a college scholarship from the United Way.   Incidentally, DREAMers--undocumented--don't qualify for any Federal  [[Page S299]]  assistance for their education, so they have to find it in other  places. His work with the United Way helped to pay his way at the  college. He went to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and  received multiple academic awards and continued his volunteer service  with Alpha Phi Omega, a national service fraternity. He received the  Distinguished Service Key, the fraternity's highest award. He graduated  with a bachelor of science in kinesiology and then went on to earn a  master's degree in public health at the University of Illinois.   In his last semester of graduate school, President Obama announced  the DACA Program, which I described earlier. He applied, signed up, and  became part of that DACA Program.   What is he doing today with his master's degree, with his opportunity  to work in fields of public health and such? He signed up for Teach For  America. We know Teach For America is a national nonprofit organization  that places talented recent college graduates in urban and rural  schools that have a shortage of teachers. Jose is currently a high  school physics and public health teacher in the city of Chicago.   He wrote me a letter, and he said:         DACA changed my life in more ways than I can ever explain.       It has given me the power to help others, the freedom to       travel, and the right to legally work without fear of       deportation. Simply put, without DACA, I wouldn't exist for       my students and my community.    If DACA is eliminated, what will happen to Jose? The day after DACA,  he won't be able to teach. He could be deported back to Mexico, where  he hasn't lived since he was a 2-year-old toddler. That would be a  tragedy, not just for Jose and his family but for this Nation. This is  a fine young man who, against great odds, undocumented, has written  this amazing record in his young life. He is a giving person. He could  be making a lot more money than his pay with Teach For America in an  inner city school.   Do we need Jose Espinoza in America's future? I think we do. That is  why I am happy that this BRIDGE Act would give him a chance and  Congress a chance to address this issue of DREAMers. I hope President- Elect Trump will understand this and continue the DACA Program. If he  decides to end the DACA Program, I hope his administration will work  closely and rapidly with Congress to pass the BRIDGE Act into law.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
