 Madam Speaker, last week, we celebrated the 200th  day of the 117th Congress and 200 days of getting shots in arms,  students in classrooms, money in pockets, and Americans back to work.   Thanks to House Democrats and President Biden, we passed the American  Rescue Plan, delivering funding and relief to the Commonwealth and to  Americans across the country.   In Massachusetts, nearly 74 percent of adults are fully vaccinated,  allowing them to reunite with friends and loved ones, and we have sent  over 500,000 stimulus checks to Bay Staters.   When I came to Congress, I promised our students and families that  they would return to in-person learning. The American Rescue Plan  delivered on my pledge, providing Massachusetts schools with $1.8  billion in Federal relief to support their students and staff as they  re-entered the classroom.   We lifted up our care economy, securing over $1 billion to reduce the  cost of childcare and pay our care workers a fair wage.   As a parent, I worked hard to provide our working families with the  historic tax relief that they deserve. The child tax credit we passed  will cut child poverty in half and help nearly 60 percent of children  in my district, from Brookline to Fall River.   We passed the INVEST Act, a transformational bill that will reimagine  transportation while delivering clean energy and spurring job creation.  Now, the Senate has the legislative framework it needs to make our  infrastructure plan a reality.   From the depths of the crisis, House Democrats delivered needed  recovery for Americans in just 200 days.                            ____________________
