 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Jimmy Ray of Chatham County for being recognized as Veteran of the Year  by the Veterans Council of Chatham County.   Georgia's First Congressional District is home to many of our  Nation's veterans, so being recognized as Veteran of the Year is an  incredible honor. With this title, Jimmy will represent the Veterans  Council at various events throughout the year.   Jimmy is a past commander of the American Legion, Chatham Post 36,  which is an organization dedicated to advocating for patriotism across  the United States. Among his many lifetime achievements, he helped  spearhead the fundraising and construction of the World War II Memorial  on River Street in Savannah.   He has also been an active member of the Savannah St. Patrick's Day  Parade Committee for 35 years, and was even the 2013 parade grand  marshal.   I can't thank Jimmy enough for his outstanding service to our Nation  throughout his life, and I want to congratulate him again on this  wonderful accomplishment.

Congratulating Camden County for Receiving Certificate of Achievement                   for Excellence in Financial Reporting     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Camden County in Georgia's First Congressional District for being  awarded the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial  Reporting from the Government Finance Officers Association of the  United States and Canada.   Camden County was recognized for its Comprehensive Annual Financial  Report, or CAFR, for the fiscal year which ended June 30, 2019.   The CAFR is judged by an impartial panel, and the high standards of  the program include demonstrating a constructive spirit of full  disclosure. In doing this, Camden County clearly communicated its  financial story.   This is a great honor because the certificate of achievement is the  highest form of recognition in the area of government accounting and  financial reporting.   Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Camden County and its management  for this significant accomplishment, and I express my gratitude for the  work that they do for our community.                                time  1045                        Congratulating Brian A. Mixon     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Brian Mixon on his retirement after 4 years of Active Duty and 32 years  of civilian service with the Department of the Army.   Brian served honorably as an air traffic and airspace officer and was  recognized for his work when he was awarded the Air Traffic Control  Manager of the Year Award by the Air Traffic Control Association in  2019. The national award is formally known as the General E.R. Quesada  Memorial Award, and it is a medallion award presented to an individual  for outstanding achievement and contribution during the previous year  as an air traffic control manager.   This is not the first time Brian has been recognized for his  exceptional work. He also earned two other national awards, among many  others.   Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia's First Congressional District is one  of the premier power projection platforms in the Army, which is  utilized to deploy thousands of soldiers and essential equipment.  Brian's contributions have been essential to the readiness capabilities  of the units that utilized Hunter Army Airfield.   Mr. Speaker, I can't thank Brian enough for his many years of  steadfast dedication in serving our great Nation, and I wish him the  best as he begins his retirement.                            ____________________
