 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Jennifer  Albert from Fernandina Beach, Florida, for winning the Milken Educator  Award.   This award recognizes innovative teachers, principals, and education  specialists around the country who have made exceptional contributions  to their profession.   Ms. Albert teaches science and math to fifth graders at Emma Love  Hardee Elementary School in Nassau County, and was the only teacher in  the State of Florida chosen for this prestigious award.   Our educators are tasked with the awesome responsibility of teaching  the next generation of Americans, and Ms. Albert has inspired all of us  with her creativity and commitment to student achievement.   Her use of small groups, project-based learning, and games even, has  elevated her class to 81 percent proficiency in science, and 79 percent  proficiency in math. These are impressive numbers to speak to the  success of her positive and innovative techniques.   On behalf of the Fourth District of Florida and the students and  parents of Emma Love Hardee Elementary School, I want to thank Ms.  Albert for her lifelong dedication to excellence in the classroom, and  congratulations on receiving the recognition she so well deserves.                            ____________________
