 Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It allows a  point of order to be raised if the tax reform reported back to the  floor by the committee increases the deficit. It is as simple as that.  Do you believe we should act on tax reform that increases the deficit?  If you agree with me that we should not be increasing the deficit with  the tax reform reported back from the committee, then vote for this  amendment or, if necessary, vote for waiving the point of order that  may be raised.   I urge my colleagues, if you are serious about the deficit, we  shouldn't be passing legislation that increases it.   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.    Mr. President, what the chairman is saying is, basically,  the process will be used in order to add to the deficit. Therefore,  pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move  to waive section 305(b) of that act for purposes of the pending  amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The question is on agreeing to the motion.   The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk called the roll.
