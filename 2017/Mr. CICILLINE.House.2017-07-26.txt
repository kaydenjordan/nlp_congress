 Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, Democrats unveiled A  Better Deal for the American people. This is an economic agenda that  will create 10 million good-paying, full-time jobs; raise pay; lower  costs; and give workers the tools that they need to get ahead.   A job is much more than just a paycheck. It is about knowing that  your hard work is valued and honored. It is about being treated with  the dignity and respect that every human being deserves. We don't have  enough of that in this country today.   People in my State and all across America feel like the system is  completely stacked against them. And do you know what? They are right.   Our Tax Code rewards companies that ship jobs overseas. Millionaires  and billionaires don't pay their fair share. Corporate special  interests spend secretly in our elections. It doesn't have to be this  way; and with A Better Deal, it won't be this way.   We are going to invest in our infrastructure, we are going to build a  new manufacturing economy, double investments in apprenticeships, and  we are going to make sure that working families are valued again.   The American people have had enough broken promises to last them a  lifetime, but Democrats are going to deliver real results to them with  A Better Deal, better jobs, better wages, for a better future.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment to H.R. 3219 will help  ensure that buildings such as the Capitol and the House and Senate  office buildings have adequate baby changing tables.   Last year, this Congress passed into law my legislation called the  BABIES Act requiring that both male and female restrooms in many public  buildings be equipped with baby changing facilities that are physically  safe, sanitary, and appropriate.   That legislation ensures that there are appropriate and sanitary  facilities for parents and caretakers to change the diapers of infants  and toddlers in publicly accessible Federal buildings controlled by the  General Services Administration.   In the same vein, I was pleased that the Legislative Branch  Subcommittee included report language in its fiscal year 2017 bill  recognizing the importance of providing designated baby changing  stations for members of the public who visited the Capitol complex and  encouraging the Architect of the Capitol to take steps to provide baby  changing stations at easily accessible locations.   I want to thank my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and  Chairman Yoder for their support of these efforts. My amendment today  to H.R. 3219 would similarly encourage the construction of safe,  appropriate, and sanitary baby changing stations in Federal public  buildings controlled by the Architect of the Capitol such as the  Capitol complex, the House, and Senate office buildings, the Botanic  Gardens, and the Library of Congress.   With more than 20 million visitors coming to Washington, D.C., each  year, families are often surprised by the lack of adequate baby  changing facilities in public buildings. Currently, there are only nine  baby changing stations in the House office buildings, none of which are  in the Rayburn Building, where my office is located. That means that  when Rhode Island families who come to visit my office have to try to  find a changing station, they go all the way to Cannon or Longworth, or  they have to decide to change their baby on the bathroom floor, which  is a terrible option. It is not sanitary either for the parents or for  the children.   Access to these changing stations in restrooms in Federal buildings  will help in protecting the health and safety of children at a very de  minimus cost, about $200 per changing station. This nominal amount will  go a very long way to encouraging a family-friendly environment and  ensuring the safety and comfort of our constituents who visit us.   And I want to again thank Chairman Yoder and Ranking Member Ryan for  their support of this amendment, and I look forward to working with  them to help ensure that our constituents are able to have a safe and  enjoyable visit to our beautiful Capitol buildings.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan), the ranking  member.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  Yoder).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I  rise today to speak in strong support of the amendment offered by my  colleague, Congresswoman Pingree, which would strike the harmful  provision that undermines the importance of the National Ocean Policy.   For over 7 years, the National Ocean Policy has helped guide ocean  management through spurring coordination among government agencies.  Ocean planning and coordination is an important aspect in supporting  economic growth, protecting coastal habitats, and strengthening coastal  communities.   The National Ocean Policy does not create any regulations, supersede  current regulations, or modify any agency's established mission,  jurisdiction, or authority. Rather, it helps coordinate the  implementation of existing regulations by Federal agencies to establish  a more efficient and effective decisionmaking process.   Throughout the northeast, the Regional Ocean Council allows our  States to pool resources and businesses to have a strong voice in  decisions that will impact their communities and facilitate  coordination with Federal partners.   I am proud to say that the Northeast Regional Ocean Council is the  first in the Nation to release a draft regional ocean plan. My home  State of Rhode Island, the ocean State, has benefited greatly from the  National Ocean Policy. With help from NOP, the Block Island Wind Farm  project was successfully completed and today is capable of powering an  estimated 17,000 homes.   At a time when our oceans are facing significant challenges and  changes, maintaining coordination and planning is necessary in  continuing to strengthen our country's coastal communities and ocean  industries. Allowing Federal agencies to coordinate implementation of  over 100 ocean laws and giving State and local governments a voice in  the ocean planning process is smart policy, and I urge my colleagues to  support this amendment and strike this ill-advised provision.
