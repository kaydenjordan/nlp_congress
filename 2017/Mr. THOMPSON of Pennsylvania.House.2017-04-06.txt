Michael was a second-generation executive. Nittany Media is a locally  owned and operated cable provider that has served rural Pennsylvania  since 1957. They are credited with bringing the internet to some very  rural areas as early as 1997.   His parents, Harry and Anna Hain, founded the business, and Michael  has been actively involved since he was a child. He climbed his first  cable tower at age 3 during a neighbor's barbecue. Michael told a news  outlet: ``When the other kids were going down to the river fishing, my  dad and I were going up to the mountain with an inch-and-a-quarter mast  with an antenna. And we were fishing too; fishing for a distant  signal.''   A love for cable runs deep for Michael Hain.   On behalf of the people of the Fifth Congressional District of  Pennsylvania, I extend my sincere congratulations to Michael Hain of  Nittany Media for this outstanding achievement.                            ____________________
