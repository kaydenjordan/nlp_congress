 Mr. President, I congratulate KTVB News anchor and  journalist, Mark Johnson, on his remarkable career, as he retires after  40 years in the television news business.   Mark's dedicated career started in television sports in Missouri in  1981, brought him to Idaho, then took him to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania  before, thankfully, bringing him back home to Idaho and KTVB in 1996.  He served as KTVB's sports director before his 2003 promotion to serve  as the station's main anchor. He is well-described by the station as,  ``A constant in the lives of generations of Idaho families, Mark  Johnson has watched 30 years of Idaho history unfold from his spot in  the KTVB studio.''   He has understandably earned significant recognitions for his work.  This includes KTVB earning regional Emmy awards for the News at 10  while Mark was a pivotal part of the team as lead anchor and his  winning of a national Edward R. Murrow award for his work involving the  2002 Salt Lake Olympics. In addition to the time and talent he has  committed to reporting, he has also supported many community efforts.   His heartfelt appreciation for and deep interest in the people of  Idaho and its valued spaces are reflected in his thoughtful journalism.  Those who have had the opportunity to work with Mark and know him  consider themselves lucky. His calm demeanor during challenges and his  sense of humor have shaped the way many have faced the events that are  part of daily life, and it is clear he will be greatly missed in the  anchor chair.   Mark, as you start your next chapter, I wish you more, well-earned  time with your many friends and loved ones, including your wife Chris;  daughters Hannah, Lindsey, Alexa, and Grace; and grandson. I  congratulate you on an amazing career and thank you for bringing  Idahoans the news for all these years.                            ____________________
