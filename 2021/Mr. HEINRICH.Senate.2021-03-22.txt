 Mr. President, it is an honor to recognize the lifetime  of service and historic contributions of Navajo Nation Supreme Court  Justice Lorene B. Ferguson, who died on March 1, 2021, with her  daughters at her bedside, from complications of COVID-19.   Justice Ferguson was the first woman justice on the Navajo Nation  Supreme Court. In 2001, she was nominated to serve as Associate Justice  by President Kelsey Begaye and was confirmed by the Navajo Nation  Council. She served as an Associate Justice on the Navajo Nation  Supreme Court until 2007, including as Acting Chief Justice from 2004  to 2005.   Prior to her appointment to the Supreme Court, Justice Ferguson  served as a Navajo circuit judge in the Kayenta District Court and as a  Navajo Tribal Court judge in the Shiprock, To'hajiilee, Ramah, and  Alamo Courts. She also served for 8 years as a staff attorney at the  Navajo Nation Department of Justice, where she drafted the first Navajo  Election Code and Navajo scholarship policy for the Department of  Education.   Justice Ferguson was born in the Sawmill, Ni'ii Ji'ih, Chapter of the  Navajo Nation in the Fort Defiance Agency in Arizona. She graduated  from Fort Lewis College in 1965. She worked in community development,  welfare rights, and Native American education as a Head Start teacher  and Indian education training technician. She began her legal career  after graduating from the University of New Mexico School of Law in  1983.   Justice Ferguson served as a mentor and role model for numerous  Navajo attorneys and law clerks. She was a strong advocate for  education and Tribal traditional law. She served as a judicial  education faculty member for the National Judicial College at the  University of Nevada in Reno and was the first Tribal judge to serve as  a judge in residence at the University of Tulsa School of Law. She  frequently spoke at law schools around the country to educate students  and faculty on the importance of Tribal law.   Justice Ferguson was also a loving wife, mother, grandmother, and  matriarch for her family. My thoughts are with all of her loved ones  and all those who were touched by her life during this time of loss.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is an honor to recognize over two  decades of dedication and service to New Mexico from Dr. Dan Alpert, my  senior legislative assistant, who is retiring after a distinguished  career in the U.S. Senate.   A dedicated public servant, Dr. Alpert began his career as a nuclear  engineer at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM, working on  nuclear power, renewable energy, and energy efficiency programs for 20  years.   In 1997, Dr. Alpert took his extensive experience at Sandia to  Capitol Hill for a 1-year fellowship sponsored by the American  Association for the Advancement of Science, AAAS, in the office of my  predecessor, Senator Jeff Bingaman. Since then, Dr. Alpert has served  the people of New Mexico in the U.S. Senate for more than two decades.   Dr. Alpert's dedication to New Mexico and expertise has been  instrumental in steering my legislative priorities on the Senate Energy  and Natural Resources Committee. Dr. Alpert's distinguished career  includes leadership in energy storage research and development,  cutting-edge energy transmission planning, and careful oversight and  stewardship of our Nation's nuclear laboratories and the Waste  Isolation Pilot Plant. While he probably did not plan on it when he was  earning his nuclear engineering Ph.D., Dr. Alpert also served as a  longtime and well-respected agriculture and infrastructure expert in  Senator Bingaman's office.   Anyone who has ever worked with Dr. Alpert also knows that his policy  [[Page S1671]]  expertise is matched by his dedication to his colleagues and to  mentoring the next generation of public servants. Dr. Alpert has  demonstrated his heart of gold, a natural kindness, and wonderful sense  of humor to all who have had the pleasure to meet him. I also recognize  that Dr. Alpert could not be where he is today without the love and  support of his sweetheart, Ann.   On behalf of the people of the State of New Mexico and on behalf of  my entire staff and Senator Bingaman's staff, I thank him for his  service. I know I speak for so many when I thank Dr. Alpert for his  contributions to New Mexico and to our Nation. I know that he will  continue to make a difference in the lives of everyone he meets. I ask  my colleagues to join me in recognizing the dedicated service of Dr.  Alpert and congratulate him on his retirement from the U.S. Senate.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the tragic passing of Dr. Karen  Trujillo, a devoted mother and compassionate leader who dedicated her  life to New Mexico's students and teachers, is a tremendous loss for  the entire State of New Mexico.   Like so many in New Mexico, I will be forever grateful for the  opportunities I had to spend time with Dr. Trujillo and learn from her.  She was a tireless advocate for education whose enthusiasm for learning  was truly infectious. I am especially appreciative for how much she  advocated for all students to have access to outstanding education in  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.   Dr. Trujillo served for more than 25 years as an educator. She began  her career in the classroom as a math teacher at Las Cruces High School  and went on to teach at Cobre High School in Bayard, Hot Springs High  School in Truth or Consequences, and at Alma d'Arte Charter High School  in Las Cruces. She also served in many education leadership roles,  including principal at Las Cruces Catholic School, associate dean of  research at New Mexico State University's School of Education, New  Mexico secretary of public education, and superintendent of Las Cruces  Public Schools.   Dr. Trujillo's legacy will be felt for years not only in all the  students she inspired but in classrooms across our State led by  educators whom she mentored and led. At NMSU, she directed K-12  outreach for the Alliance for the Advancement of Teaching and Learning  and started the Southwest Outreach Academic Research Lab and Educators  Rising NM, an organization that recruits high school students for  careers in teaching.   Dr. Trujillo was proud of her deep New Mexico roots and her close- knit family. After early years growing up in Santa Fe, she and her  family resettled in Las Cruces, where she graduated from Mayfield High  School and received her bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees  from New Mexico State University. Her father Gilbert set a positive  example of public service for her as a longtime Dona Ana County  commissioner.   Even while she took on leadership roles throughout the State, Karen  could often be found with her family at the Hatch Valley High School  gymnasium, where her husband Ben is the athletic director, her older  daughter is a basketball coach, and her younger daughter played for the  team. She often took on duties as the basketball announcer.   I am keeping Ben, their kids, Taralyn, Tim and Tavyn, the Trujillo  and Apodaca families, as well as all of the New Mexicans who are  grieving this devastating loss, in my thoughts.                            ____________________
