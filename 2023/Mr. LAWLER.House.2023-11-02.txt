 Mr. Speaker, we must stand with Israel in its time of  need. This funding will go a long way toward ensuring that Israel has  the ability to defend itself from the horrific campaign of terror waged  by Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, and other terrorists organizations.   What occurred on October 7 is akin to what happened to our country on  December 7, 1941, or September 11, 2001. Israel has a right to defend  itself and fight back against those who would see them eradicated from  the face of the Earth. No one told the United States after Pearl Harbor  or 9/11 not to hold the perpetrators of those attacks accountable.   The perpetrators of this attack on Israel are an insidious  organization that has attacked their country. Hamas' stated goal is the  elimination of the State of Israel, and by extension, the genocide of  the Jewish population living in it. We cannot let that happen.                                time  1615    We cannot let that happen. We have Members in this body who have  voted against condemning Hamas and voted against holding Iran  accountable. Members of this body are calling for a cease-fire despite  the fact that Hamas has already stated this is just the first step.  They will not abide by a cease-fire.   This legislation before us today would provide $14.3 billion in aid  to Israel. This is a significant defense supplemental that includes  $801.4 million in extra funding for ammunition procurement, $3.5  billion in funding for foreign military financing, $50 million in  evacuation assistance support for the U.S. Embassy in Israel, $4  billion for Iron Dome and David's Sling defense systems and other  Defense-wide procurement, and $38.6 million for Air Force procurement.   This bill is necessary for our closest ally in the Middle East, which  is why I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us  in passing this critical aid for Israel to show our support for this  beacon of hope and freedom in the Middle East.   We cannot let our differences divide us on this critical issue. We  cannot allow the bright candle of democracy in the Middle East to be  extinguished by Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran. We cannot allow Israel to  lose.   This legislation is not conditioning aid. It is paying for it.  Apparently, my Democratic colleagues still don't understand that we  cannot just continue to borrow and print new money at every  opportunity.   We have a debt that is approaching $34 trillion. It costs money, and  we have to pay for it. To oppose this simply because you don't like the  fact that there is an offset is absurd.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to everyone joining in passing this  bipartisan legislation.
