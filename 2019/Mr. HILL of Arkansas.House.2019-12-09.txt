 Mr. Speaker, I rise today again to bring  attention to the travesty happening in Idlib, Syria.   A week ago, Syrian dictator Assad, his protector Putin, and his  Iranian coconspirators continued to bomb civilians in the town of  Idlib.   The Wisdom House School, a school supported by my constituents in  Arkansas, has had to close for the third time due to this bombing and  the massive attacks.   I recently watched a video posted on Twitter of the airstrikes  hitting a civilian home in the same town where Wisdom House School is  located. Many of the children attending the Wisdom House School are now  orphans. There are no military targets in this area, which has been  repeatedly bombed by the Assad regime.   When we look back on this calamitous conflict, the United States and  our allies in Europe will hang our heads in shame for ignoring red  lines that gave a green light to Assad's slaughter of his own civilians  by the hundreds of thousands.                         Fund NATO to Counter Russia     Mr. Speaker, since its formation, NATO has  served as the foundation for security between the United States and our  allies in Europe.   Years ago, the now-29 members agreed to a goal of spending at least 2  percent of their gross domestic product on defense. When President  Trump took office, only three countries met that objective. Now, it is  nine. President Trump has done a good job urging NATO to meet its  obligations among members.   Russia, under Putin, is a threat to freedom that many in the post- Cold War world have fought and died for. For decades, Russia has  engaged in propaganda and political meddling in the Western  democracies. It has invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea and territories  in Georgia.   NATO members need to meet their defense spending guidelines now more  than ever. Actions speak louder than words, and NATO must continue to  counter Russia and Russia's political and military actions around the  world.                  Honoring Life and Legacy of Jerry McKinnis     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of one of Arkansas' great outdoorsmen, Mr. Jerry McKinnis, who  recently passed away at the age of 82.    A longtime Little Rock, Arkansas, resident, Jerry was a pioneer in  outdoor cable TV programming. He was best known for his television  program ``The Fishin' Hole,'' which featured fishing trips with  celebrity guests like Hall of Fame baseball player Ted Williams.   Jerry created the show after playing baseball professionally for a  short time. ``The Fishin' Hole'' aired for 44 years and was the longest  running show on ESPN short of ``SportsCenter.''   Jerry has been inducted into the International Game Fish Hall of  Fame, the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame, the Arkansas Outdoor Hall of  Fame, the National Fishing Hall of Fame, and the Bass Fishing Hall of  Fame.   Jerry was an inspiration and friend to many across our State, and I  extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his friends, family, and  loved ones.                       Congratulating Rachelle Stewart     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Chief  Deputy Rachelle Stewart for receiving the Lifesaving Award from Saline  County Sheriff Rodney Wright.   Stewart responded to an unknown medical emergency to assist EMS  personnel with a patient who was unconscious and not breathing. Chief  Deputy Stewart quickly recognized the patient was experiencing an  opioid overdose and administered Narcan to save the patient's life.  Chief Deputy Stewart's action marked the fifth life saved by Saline  County sheriff deputies successfully using Narcan in the field.   I extend my congratulations to Chief Deputy Rachelle Stewart and the  Saline County Sheriff's Office for saving lives and continuing the hard  work of protecting and serving central Arkansas.                            ____________________
