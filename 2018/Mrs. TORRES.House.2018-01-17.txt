 Mr. Speaker, we have waited too long to protect the  DREAMers. This is unacceptable to me and to the vast majority of  Americans.   My Republican colleagues say that we have until March to fix this  issue, but that is simply not true. 16,287 DREAMers have lost their  protection since September. For those DREAMers, the deadline has  already passed.   This is not a partisan issue. I would like to remind my colleagues  that the Dream Act is a bipartisan bill. Unfortunately, the Republican  leadership and the White House have not acted in good faith. They have  politicized this issue. They have backed themselves to the wall. They  are holding the fate of DREAMers hostage.   They say that they want to help DREAMers, but then they say they will  only help DREAMers in exchange for border security, demanding that we  give up on our commitment to keeping families together, ending the  Diversity Visa program, knowing that these are poison pills.   If Republicans truly want to help DREAMers, Democrats stand ready. If  Republicans want to compromise on a comprehensive immigration reform  bill, we are ready to do that, too.   We can talk about all of the changes to our immigration system that  Republicans want at the same time that we talk about how we bring 11  million people, undocumented people, out of the shadows and on a  pathway to citizenship. But the issue of DREAMers and comprehensive  immigration reform should simply be kept separate.   Show some leadership. President Trump says he wants a ``bill of  love.'' So do I and so do my colleagues.
