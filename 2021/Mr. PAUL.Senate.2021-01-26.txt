 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today we will be considering the nomination  of Antony Blinken to be President Biden's Secretary of State.   The problem I have with this nomination is that, for decades now, we  have been at war in Afghanistan. The war is now called ``the forever  war.'' People lament that it goes on so long, and people say: How could  it possibly keep going on?   Sixty-five to seventy percent of the American people, 65 to 70  percent of American veterans--veterans who served in the theater--say  the war is enough. We should end the war in Afghanistan. How does it go  on? We have got a new President. Are things going to change?   Here is the problem: Why do the wars continue? Why do the wars in  Syria and Libya and Somalia and Afghanistan continue? Because the more  things change, the more they stay the same.   Mr. Blinken has been a full-throated advocate of military  intervention in the Middle East for 20 years. We are fooling ourselves  if we think we are going to get a new policy. We are going to get more  of the same.   In his hearing, I said to him: ``The problem isn't that we don't  compromise or that we don't have bipartisan consensus; the problem is  we have too much bipartisan consensus for war.''   For 20 years, he has advocated for military intervention. He  advocated for the Iraq war, as did the President. President Biden was  also an advocate of the Iraq war.   Now, later on they said: Well, the war wasn't that great of an idea,  but we were lied to by George Bush and the intelligence, and I am  willing to admit there is some truth to that. But there is a bigger  lesson here. The lesson is that regime change doesn't work.   They often get unintended consequences, and you often get the  opposite of what you think you are getting. They said: We must go to  Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein because he is a terrible dictator. Well,  yes, he was a despot, a dictator, an autocrat. You know, he wreaked  havoc on his people, probably gassed the Kurds--many different horrible  things. And yet, when he was gone, what did we get? We got a power  vacuum. We got more terrorism. We are back in there 10 years later  because the government is nonfunctional. And what is the final result?  Iran is stronger.   What does everybody talk about? Iran, Iran, Iran. Why do we worry  about Iran? Well, because we toppled their biggest adversary. We used  to have a balance of power between Iraq and Iran--despot on one side,  despot on the other but at least a balance of power.   But who is Iran's best ally now? Iraq. Think about it. Iraq is allied  with Iran. Iraq is also allied, in many ways, with Russia, as well as  us, but they have also asked us to leave. They are like: Oh, thanks for  our freedom, but you all can take off now.   But who supported the war? President Biden, Antony Blinken. We are  back where we were 20 years ago.   Now, like I say, there is some retrenchment, there is some backing  off of the position, but I don't hear from either President Biden,  Candidate Biden, or from Antony Blinken that regime change is wrong.   Now, if it were wrong, you would expect there was a learning from the  Iraq war, and they would say: OK. Now that we are in charge, we won't  do the same.   But it turns out, when we had an Obama administration, with Blinken  and the other military interventionists, in a supposedly progressive  administration, we got more war. They went into Libya. Once again, the  same sort of idea--the idea that regime change works, and that we will  topple this terrible dictator, Qadhafi, and out of the mist, out of the  embers, out of the fire will arise Thomas Jefferson. The Thomas  Jefferson of Libya will take over and freedom will reign. It didn't  work out so much.   So Mr. Blinken, in his hearing, admitted as much. He said: Well,  maybe we overestimated the possibility that there would be rivals to  replace him. Do you think?   But, see, this is sort of the expected pattern of the Middle East.  The Middle East doesn't have this 1,000-year English tradition of  trying to control central power, dating back to even before the Magna  Carta.   But even 350 years ago, the English had a revolution trying to  restrain the power of the King; 250 years ago we had our revolution to  further restrain the power of the King. We have this longstanding  tradition.   But in the Middle East, there is more of this tradition of tribalism,  and so you have an iron fist, but when you get rid of the iron fist, it  is replaced by another iron fist or nothing--by chaos.   So in Libya you get rid of Qadhafi--supported by President Obama Vice  President Biden, Antony Blinken. You have the toppling of Qadhafi, but  what did you get? Chaos. More terrorism. It is unclear even whom we  support--whether we support the current government, the U.N.  government, or General Haftar, or whom we support.    The Middle East is divided, arms are flowing in on both sides, and  like we always do, we fan the flames by shipping arms to everybody in  the region as well. It didn't work.   So Mr. Blinken acknowledges: Yes, we underestimated the possibility  there would be a rival government or a rival faction strong enough to  rule Libya. Well, yeah.   So did they learn their lesson? No. About this time or a little bit  later, they decided: We must go into Syria. So they spent about $500  million--$500 million--to train about 60 fighters. They did it in a  remote area of Syria and they got them trained and they spent their  $500 million and they sent 10 of them into battle. They were all  captured or killed in the first 20 minutes. Five hundred million to  train sixty of the so-called moderates. But guess what. The same holds  for Syria that held for Iraq, that held for Libya, that now holds for  Syria. Guess what. Another despot.   But who are the people fighting against the despot? The most fierce  fighters in Syria all along were al-Nusra and al-Qaida. The more  jihadists, the more vicious and violent and the better the fighters  were.   Were there doctors and lawyers and academics and people who want a  secular form of government? Sure. But the people out there fighting and  the people winning the battles were the jihadists.   So there was always the danger, if you get rid of Assad, we get  another jihadist regime.   So we have to think through the policy of this. But Blinken and Biden  both supported the Iraq war. It was an utter failure. They admit as  much. They supported the Libyan deposing of Qadhafi and war. Then they  acknowledge: Well, maybe it wasn't the best--but then they don't take  any learning or knowledge from that and say: Maybe we shouldn't go into  the next one--Syria. And yet, they went into Syria.   And what Blinken's response is should tell you a little bit about the  danger of what we may get from Blinken as Secretary of State.   He said the problem in Syria was not doing too much but doing too  little. He said: What we really should have done is gone in with full  might. If we had put 100,000 troops in there, like we did in  Afghanistan and like we did in Iraq, if we would have used sufficient  enough force, we could have toppled Assad. But in the end, he said: We  didn't do enough.   So the lesson to Blinken and Biden and this administration isn't that  regime change doesn't work; it is that if we are going to do it, we  need to go bigger. We need to go all in.   I would posit that regime change doesn't work; that we should not  support evil regimes. If they are despots or dictators, we shouldn't  arm them. But I am not for toppling every one of them  [[Page S139]]  either because I am not so sure what you get next.   So how would this be in the real world? Saudi Arabia has shown  themselves to be an autocratic, anti-woman, anti-modern administration  that would actually kill a journalist and dismember him. They were  rewarded by the previous administration with arms. Terrible idea.   But what would we do if there was a rational, realistic--more realism  in foreign policy? We would not topple the Government of Saudi Arabia,  but we might not sell them arms. I think that would be a reasonable  thing.   We also might not sell them arms because they were committing  atrocities and killing civilians in the war in Yemen. But if you look  back at the war in Yemen, the Obama-Biden administration did not have  very strong opposition to the war in Yemen. They do now, but in the  beginning, they didn't.   And so the supplying of weaponry and bombs and smart bombs to Saudi  Arabia occurred under the Obama-Biden administration and then continued  under the Trump administration.   So we have to ask ourselves: We have so many unintended consequences;  how will we ever make things different?   Now, our Founding Fathers envisioned something different. Our  Founding Fathers envisioned that war should be difficult. It was James  Madison who said that the executive branch is most prone to war and,  therefore, the Constitution, with studied care, vested that power in  the legislature. To declare war was to be split between the House and  the Senate and by a majority vote to declare war. We don't do that. It  is passe. Oh, that is an anachronism, some say.   And when Antony Blinken was asked about this, when he was asked about  a use of authorization of force--he was asked: Do you need it? And this  was when he was working for the Obama-Biden administration. And he  said: Oh, we would welcome discussion and debate and advice from the  Senate, but, you know, we don't really need it.   Now, he is not alone in this. This isn't a Democratic or Republican  thing. This is most of the foreign policy establishment in both  parties, particularly once they work for a President. They will tell  you, yes, they will listen to your advice. Oh, we really welcome your  coming down. Please come down. We would love to sit down and have tea.  But, really, don't tell us what to do. We can do whatever we want under  article II.   And you think, well gosh, that sounds harsh. It sounds like you are  describing Blinken as some sort of John Bolton. Yeah. There are  similarities, but there are similarities between both parties when they  get to the executive branch that they don't think they need Congress's  permission. This is a real problem.   So some in the Senate have tried to narrow the definition of where a  war would be, and I looked at their narrower definition last time and I  said: Well, yeah, you would narrow it from the whole world to 24  countries. I don't want to be at war in those 24 countries either.   Think about it. We have more military action in Africa right now than  we do in the Middle East. Somalia, Mali, all throughout Africa we have  got troops.   We had four soldiers die a little over a year ago in Mali, and people  were like: We have 800 soldiers in Mali? No one even knew. People on  the Armed Services Committee were like: We have 800 soldiers in Mali?  And yet that goes on without our permission. Without a vote of the  people's representatives, without consulting the people at all, it just  goes on and on and on.   So my opposition of Mr. Blinken to be Secretary of State is not so  much because I oppose the administration; it is because I oppose the  bipartisan consensus for war.   If we are ever to end these wars, we are going to need to not keep  nominating the same retreads who have gotten us into these wars.   So I will vote against Mr. Blinken because I am against war. I am  against war that is not declared by Congress. I am against war that is  executed primarily by the President. I am against them doing it without  the permission of the people.   So I will oppose Mr. Blinken's nomination. I don't think I will get  many people from the other side. It is difficult to vote against  nominees of one's own party, but I will say that if we are ever to end  war, we need to have a real discussion in this body about when we go to  war, whether or not we have to declare war, and we have to talk about  whether our involvements have worked in the Middle East, whether or not  there are unintended consequences. Instead of saying ``Oh, it was all  George Bush's fault. It was faulty intelligence''--yeah, yeah, there is  some truth to that, but it is really about regime change. It is about  the idea that we know what is best for everyone else and that by  putting a new regime involved in a country in the Middle East, somehow  it is going to be better. It usually turns out worse.    So I hope my colleagues will today consider voting against Mr.  Blinken because I think he is more of the same.    Mr. President, this impeachment is nothing more than a  partisan exercise designed to further divide the country. Democrats  claim to want to unify the country, but impeaching a former President,  a private citizen, is the antithesis of unity.   Democrats brazenly appointing a pro-impeachment Democrat to preside  over the trial is not fair or impartial and hardly encourages any kind  of unity in our country. No, unity is the opposite of this travesty we  are about to witness.   If we are about to try to impeach a President, where is the Chief  Justice?   If the accused is no longer President, where is the constitutional  power to impeach him?   Private citizens don't get impeached. Impeachment is for removal from  office, and the accused here has already left office.   Hyperpartisan Democrats are about to drag our great country down into  the gutter of rancor and vitriol, the likes of which has never been  seen in our Nation's history.   Instead of doing the Nation's work, with their new majorities in the  House, the Senate, and the executive branch, Democrats are wasting the  Nation's time on a partisan vendetta against a man no longer in office.  It is almost as if they have no ability to exist except in opposition  to Donald Trump. Without him as their boogeyman, they might have to  legislate and to actually convince Americans that their policy  prescriptions are the right ones.   Democrats are about to do something no self-respecting Senator has  ever stooped to. Democrats are insisting the election is actually not  over, and so they insist on regurgitating the bitterness of the  election.   This acrimony they are about to unleash has never before been tried.  Why? Because calmer heads have typically prevailed in our history and  allowed public opinion to cast blame where blame is deserved.   This sham of an impeachment will ostensibly ask whether the President  incited the reprehensible behavior and violence of January 6, when he  said: ``I know everyone here will soon march to the Capitol to  peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.''   ``Peacefully and patriotically''--hardly words of violence.   But what of Democrat words? What of Democrat incitement to violence?   No Democrat will honestly ask whether Bernie Sanders incited the  [[Page S141]]  shooter that nearly killed   Steve Scalise and a volunteer coach. The  shooter nearly pulled off a massacre--I was there--because he fervently  believed the false and inflammatory rhetoric spewed by Bernie and other  Democrats, such as: ``The Republican healthcare plan for the uninsured  is that you die.''   As this avowed Bernie supporter shot   Steve Scalise, nearly killing  him, and shot one of our coaches and two or three of our staff, he  screamed: ``This is for healthcare!''   Ask me or anyone if that is incitement.   No Democrat will ask whether Cory Booker incited violence when he  called for his supporters to get ``up in the face of Congress  people''--a very visual and specific incitement.   No Democrat will ask whether Maxine Waters incited violence when she  literally told her supporters: ``If you see a member of the Trump  [administration] at a restaurant, [at] a department store, [at] a gas  station, or any place, you create a crowd and you push back on them.''  Is that not incitement?   My wife and I were pushed and surrounded and screamed at by this same  type of mob that Maxine likes to inspire. It is terrifying to have a  swarm of people threatening to kill you, cursing at you, and literally  holding you hostage until police come to your rescue. That night we  were assaulted by the crowd, I wasn't sure if we would survive even  with the police protection. But no Democrat has ever considered  impeaching Maxine for her violent rhetoric. In fact, Republicans, to  our credit, have never once thought it legitimate to censure or impeach  these Democrats.   No Republican has sought to use a government to hold these Democrats  responsible for Antifa and Black Lives Matter violence that has  consumed our cities all summer, resulting in over $1 billion of  destruction, looting, and property damage. Not one Republican said,  ``Oh, let's impeach the Democrats who are inciting this'' because it  would be ridiculous.   Many on the Democrat side of the aisle cheered them on. Kamala Harris  famously offered to pay the bill for those who were arrested. I wonder  if she will be brought up on charges of inciting violence for that now  that she is Vice President. Should Kamala Harris be impeached for  offering to pay for violent people to get out of jail who have been  burning our cities down? No. No Republican has offered that because we  are not going down the road the Democrats have decided, this low road  of impeaching people for political speech.    Should Republicans impeach the Democratic mayor of Seattle who  incited and condoned violence by calling the armed takeover of part of  her city ``a summer of love''? Did any Republicans try to impeach her?   Then on June 8, the New York Post, citing U.S. Justice Department  statistics, reported that more than 700 law enforcement officers were  injured during the Antifa-Black Lives Matter riots. There were at least  19 murders, including 77-year-old retired police officer David Dorn.  Yet Democrats insist on applying a test of incitement to a Republican  that they refuse to apply to themselves.   I want the Democrats to raise their hands if they have ever given a  speech that says ``Take back; fight for your country.'' Who hasn't used  the word ``fight'' figuratively? And are we going to put every  politician in jail? Are we going to impeach every politician who has  used the word ``fight'' figuratively in a speech?   Shame. Shame on these angry, unhinged partisans who are putting forth  this sham impeachment, deranged by their hatred of the former  President. Shame on those who seek blame and revenge and who choose to  pervert a constitutional process while doing so.   I want this body on record, every last person here: Is this how you  think politics should be?   Look, we have now got crazy partisans on the other side of the aisle  trying to censor and remove two of the Republican Senators for their  political position. Look, I disagreed. I don't think Congress should  overturn the electoral college. But impeaching or censoring or  expelling a Member of Congress you disagree with--is the truth so  narrow that only you know the truth? We now have the media on your side  saying there is only one set of facts, one set of truths, and you can  only interpret it this way.   Now we have seven Senators on the other side trying to expel, censor,  or impugn two Senators on this side. I defend them, not because I  defend their position--I disagreed with their position--but you can't  impeach, censor, or expel people you disagree with. What is this coming  to?   In a few minutes, I will insist on a vote to affirm that this  proceeding we are about to enter is unconstitutional, that impeachment  of a private citizen is illegal and essentially a bill of attainder,  and that no sense of fairness or due process would allow the judge in  the proceeding to be a partisan Democrat already in favor of the  impeachment.   A sham this is. A travesty. A dark blot on the history of our  country. I urge my colleagues to reconsider this kangaroo court and  move forward to debate the great issues of our day.   With that, I would like to relinquish the last moment or two of my  time to the Senator of Wisconsin.    Mr. President, article II, section 4 of the Constitution  says: ``The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the  United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and  Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and  Misdemeanors.''   Article I, section 3, clause 6 states: ``When the President of the  United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.''   As of noon last Wednesday, Donald Trump holds none of the positions  listed in the Constitution. He is a private citizen. The Presiding  Officer is not the Chief Justice, nor does he claim to be. His presence  in the Chief Justice's absence demonstrates that this is not a trial of  the President but of a private citizen.                                Point of Order    Therefore, I make a point of order that this proceeding, which would  try a private citizen and not a President, a Vice President, or civil  officer, violates the Constitution and is not in order.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the precedents of the Senate  regarding constitutional points of order, including those of the Senate  while sitting as a Court of Impeachment, the Chair submits the question  to the Senate: Is the point of order well taken?   The majority leader.    Mr. President, I voted against the confirmation of Janet  Yellen to be Treasury Secretary. Dr. Yellen is well known as an  academic, as an economic policy adviser to President Clinton, and as  Chair of the Federal Reserve. In all of these positions, she has proven  herself to be wrong on fiscal, monetary, and economic policy.   At her confirmation hearing, she vigorously supported the additional  $2 trillion stimulus package President Biden has put forward. Her  argument is that this time is different--but since the great recession,  big spenders have not receded from that argument, even during the times  of unprecedented spending growth in the Trump administration. Moreover,  we know what the problem is in our economy today: government-mandated  business closures. The economy contracted by nearly one-third in the  second quarter of 2020 when lockdowns were in full force, but in the  third quarter, the summer, when restrictions were relaxed, the economy  made nearly a full recovery. This clearly indicates that our economy is  not in need of stimulus; it needs fewer tin pot dictators in Governors'  mansions.   Much more troubling than Dr. Yellen's call for more spending is her  dismissal of the harms of continued borrowing. She has said that  borrowing and spending is not a problem because interest rates are low.  And the key part of her argument is that stimulus will generate more  growth than interest will cost to borrow. That is the definition of  ``modern monetary theory.'' She did not use that phrase because it is  so obviously wrong-headed. Modern monetary theory is self-conflicted  because proponents of it, like Dr. Yellen, say we can borrow in good  time, but they never say we need to be austere in bad times. In fact,  bad times are when they call for even more borrowing and spending.   Modern monetary theory is nothing more than window dressing on a  deep-seeded desire to always spend more, no matter what, and its  proponents hope to reap electoral benefits now and to leave office  before the bill comes due. Well, the bill is coming due. The  Congressional Budget Office already estimates that interest on our  current debt will begin growing at nearly 22 percent annually in just 6  years. What does that mean? Higher taxes or Venezuela-style inflation-- Probably both. I simply cannot support a candidate who seeks to inflict  such pain on the American people in just a few short years for an  entirely unneeded stimulus today. We know what works--opening the  economy. We know what does not work--modern monetary theory.  [[Page S148]]                                ____________________
