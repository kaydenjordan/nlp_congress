 Madam Speaker, to Mr. Jordan's point,  we are beset with problems.   Two of the most significant are that the Producer Price Index is at  10 percent. We face a cost environment that is unsustainable, and that  affects every American's livelihood every time they visit a gas pump or  go to the store. We face an employment environment where Americans have  been disincentivized to work.   Every time I speak to people in my district--well, it may be  different in the last couple of weeks and the latest catastrophes we  have seen. But certainly, until then, the leading concern is the  availability of people who are inclined to work in order to fulfill job  opportunities.   The Judiciary Committee's report on this legislation points out that  I and Representative Cliff Bentz from Oregon raised a question about  this legislation in the markup, that it may prevent employers from  regulating hairstyles for workplace safety reasons.   One of the cases involved, I believe, was about long dreadlocks that  could become ensnared in machinery on a workplace floor.   Let me tell you what the Judiciary Committee's report by the majority  says is the answer to that problem. They say that concern is misplaced  because under the longstanding burden-shifting scheme applied by courts  in title VII cases, an employer may defeat a discrimination claim by  asserting that workplace safety was a legitimate, nondiscriminatory  reason for  [[Page H3837]]  taking an adverse employment action against an employee, with the  burden then shifting to the employee to prove that the asserted reason  was a pretext for discrimination.   Assuming the employee cannot demonstrate that the employer's  assertion of workplace safety was pretextual, the employer would  prevail against an employment discrimination claim. How extraordinarily  comforting.   So, if an employee wants to wear dreadlocks, and an employer is  legitimately concerned for the health and safety of the employee, that  his scalp might be ripped off by a machine, then the employer can enter  into the litigation.   It certainly couldn't be arbitrated. We took care of that yesterday  right on the floor of the House. We have to have litigation. We will  have expensive lawyers.   We will start, get the complaint filed, the answer filed. Maybe there  will be a motion to dismiss that will be denied. We will get into the  discovery process. We will send out the interrogatories and the  document requests. We will ask for the other occasions where somebody  has been fired, examine the processes and the practices of the employer  for the last decade.                                time  0945    We will get some experts in. We have got to have some experts to come  in and testify to the likelihood that long dreadlocks are going to get  caught in the machinery. We will have conflicting experts on each side.  They will disagree. Then the court will receive a motion for summary  judgment, say if there is enough evidence to submit the case to trial,  and the judge will have a 130-page opinion that will examine the  burden-shifting scheme and the initial burden, and then the response  burden, and the burden shifts to the employee to show pretext.   And the inflation rate creeps higher, and the folks willing to enter  into jobs seem to be less and less, and the catastrophes keep coming.  But this is the top priority.   I don't think we need to drive lawsuits between Americans. I think,  in the main, Americans well understand the rules of the road. As the  Judiciary Committee itself reports, courts have generally even  recognized that hairstyle, to the extent it is associated with race, as  a basis for decisions on employment or the like, is already unlawful.  The EEOC's own manual says that discriminating on the basis of, for  example, Afros is unlawful.   This bill is another solution to a problem that doesn't exist in any  significant scope in this country, and the result being inflation that  gets higher, more supply constriction that drives inflation higher,  more animosity and obstacles between employees and employers, between  merchants and customers to drive more lawsuits to pay more lawyers to  make the quality of life in America so much better. That is where we  are. That is where we are today on the floor of the House.    Madam Speaker, to the point just made  by Mr. Jordan, it does strike me that what is being described, by the  majority leader or by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is that  some courts in the hundreds of Federal courts that we have--I am not  even sure they are all Federal they are describing, but I assume so-- have decided that this is not an issue that is covered under one or  more of these laws.   But you know what usually happens is, the Congress waits for the  court system to work this out to the United States Supreme Court; and  when there is a decision there, if the decision is contrary to the  intent of Congress, Congress responds.   So again, in terms of picking up something that is unnecessary, that  is what the majority is doing. It is not Republicans who bring the bill  to the floor. It is not Republicans who pick a fight over something  that most wouldn't even disagree about except in circumstances of  safety, and then the question becomes one of the degree of burden  imposed on employers, whether you want to drive lawsuits.   I was thinking maybe, as Mr. Jordan was speaking, that it would be  nice to bring, since the minority can get issues to the floor--I didn't  know that. I have been here just since 2019, and we have been in the  minority the whole time. I can think of a lot of things we should bring  to the floor. We should bring a bill to unleash American energy  independence. We really need that right now. Not just a bill cutting  off imports from Russia, not just a bill driving prices higher so that  Americans will not only be paying $4 and $5, thanks to Joe Biden, at  the pump, but they will soon be paying $6, $7, $8 at the pump.   If the minority could bring a bill to the floor, we could bring a  bill to the floor that would say let's open up the ability to drill,  let's encourage the energy industry in America to produce the energy  that the world needs so that prices will be low and that Americans  across the board, not just a few who have these extraneous handful of  cases out of the whole Federal court system in which the result has not  turned out the way we would like it to have turned out, let's worry  about the millions and millions of Americans who will soon have to pay  $7 or $8 at the pump every day, while it is $4 or $5 now. That is what  I would do if the minority could bring something to the floor.    Will the gentleman yield?    Let me just ask, do you think anyone  has ever discriminated against you because you are bald?    Did you bring a lawsuit?    It is not a question of avoidance. It  is a question of priority.   Here is a priority. In 2020, homicides across America increased 30  percent, from 16,500, roughly, to 21,500, an additional 5,000  homicides.   And even if you want to view it through a racial lens, since that  seems to be the subject, 55 percent of homicides are suffered by Black  Americans, even though they make up 13 percent  [[Page H3839]]  of the population. Of the increase I just described, Black Americans  suffer 65 percent.   So we could have--if the minority were capable of bringing a bill to  the floor, we could bring a bill that would address the rising crime in  America, the historically exceptional, historically unprecedented, I  believe, at least I saw something since maybe 1900 or 1902--I don't  know what the circumstances were then. But since then, the most, the  highest increase of homicides in a single year in the history of the  United States, grossly disproportionately borne by Black Americans.  Driven by rhetoric about defunding police. We could prioritize that.  That wouldn't be avoidance. And yet, we do not because, indeed, we are  in the minority and the priorities are being set not by the minority  but the majority.
