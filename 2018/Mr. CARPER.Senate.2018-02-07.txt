 Mr. President, I don't want to get in the way of a  disagreement between two of my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle. I would just say to Senator Grassley that there was a hearing  today before the Environment and Public Works Committee, on which I  serve as the senior Democrat. The subject of the Renewable Fuel  Standard actually came up in the discussion. We had a number of folks  from the agriculture community from across the country--one, the  current secretary of agriculture from the State of Delaware. We talked  about the Renewal Fuel Standard and its effect on the economy.   One of the reasons we encourage farms through our Federal Government  policies--the reason we encourage farmers to raise, say, corn is that  we can use it, and we frankly use a lot of other substances that they  raise to create energy, to fuel us. Not only can our farmers feed us,  they can also fuel us. This really got underway with the George W. Bush  administration trying to do a better job of getting farmers involved to  reduce our dependence on foreign oil by creating biofuels, advanced  biofuels, ethanol, and corn ethanol.   I will mention one of the things we talked about today, and then I  will talk about what I am really supposed to be here to talk about,  which is DREAMers and the economic security of this country.   In the State of Delaware, we have only three counties: New Castle  County, Kent County, and Sussex County, the third largest county in  America. I think we raise more chickens there than any county in  America. The last time I checked, we raise more soybeans there. We  raise more lima beans there. Agriculture is a big deal for us. We also  have great beaches in Delaware. We have Rehoboth Beach, Dewey Beach,  Bethany Beach, and others. And there are a lot of interesting people  who live close to the beach and not so close to the beach in Sussex  County, so there is pressure from development. Sometimes we have the  interests of farmers and that community coming up against the interests  of developers.    One of the ways we decided to ensure that we still have farmland and  don't overdevelop our counties and our State is to make sure that  farmers can make money and support themselves. One of the ways they can  do that is through the ability to not only feed us with the commodities  they raise but also to fuel us.   There is something called RINs, or renewable identification numbers,  a commodity traded on the market. The value of the RINs should  literally be measured in pennies. Over the last year or so, it has been  measured in more than a dollar for RINs. The refinery that has been  discussed, which is up in Philadelphia, spent a lot of money on  purchasing RINs in the last year or so. That shouldn't be the case. Our  committee has been reaching out to the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission in order to get them involved to say: How do we make this  RINs market less volatile? How do we bring down the price of RINs? How  do we enable us to do both, for our ag community and farmers to feed  us, as a nation and a world, and also to fuel us?                                     DACA    Mr. President, I am really here to applaud the work of a number of  our colleagues--Senator Durbin, who is on the floor, and Senator  Graham--for the great leadership they have provided to make sure that,  at the end of the day, we do the morally right thing--to make sure that  we don't send away 700,000 or 800,000 or more people who were born in  other countries but who were brought here by their parents at very  young ages, grew up here, were educated here, are working here, and are  making a contribution here. Why does it make sense to send them home?   Discover, one of the companies headquartered in Illinois--a State  that Senator Durbin has represented for as long as I have been  privileged to represent Delaware--has operations in my State as well.  They sent a letter that basically says:         One of the basic tenets of our culture is to ``Do the Right       Thing''--and we urge Congress to do the same, without delay .       . . We are proud to count Dreamers as part of the Discover       community and believe they should have the ability to       continue pursuing their American dreams.    Every now and then we have the opportunity to do something right and  beneficial. Some have heard the saying: It is possible to do good and  do well. With respect to Dreamers, I think it is possible to do good  and do well.   These are logos of about 100 companies--large and small, from coast  to coast, from north and south, east and west--that believe it is in  their best interests as employers to have a strong, capable, able,  educated workforce, where people come to work and will work a day's  work for a day's pay, will make a contribution, and will enable the  company to be successful. They are companies on the east coast, on west  coast, in the north, and in the south. They are all over the place.  Some are big; some are small.   These companies have shared with me--and I have shared with others on  both sides of the aisle--that they think the morally right thing to do  with respect to Dreamers is to say: You came here not of your own  volition. You were brought and raised here by your parents and now you  are making a contribution.   Again, over 100 companies are listed here, and these companies want  their employees to be able to stay and continue making a contribution.   Here we have a comment from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. These are  the words of Tom Donahue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  who is very vocal on this subject:         A great place to reform our immigration system to meet the       needs of our economy is by retaining the over 1 million       individuals who are currently allowed to work here legally       but are at risk of losing that status. [This] includes the       Dreamers, some 690,000 young people brought here illegally as       children, through no fault of their own. These hard-working       individuals contribute their talents to our economy in       integral ways, and we'll lose them if Congress doesn't act       early this year.    A lot of times we talk about what is the morally right thing to do.  Sometimes we talk about what is economically smart for our economy. We  just got the jobs report for our country for the month of January about  a week ago, and the jobs report is encouraging. The longest running  economic expansion in our country began, I think, in the first year of  the Obama-Biden administration. We are now into our eighth or maybe our  ninth year.   One of the keys to maintaining an ongoing economic expansion is to  make sure we have a workforce that is able, trained, and educated and  with the work ethic and the skills needed to fill the jobs we have in  this country.   When the jobs report came out last Friday from the Department of  Labor for the month of January, they reported an unemployment rate for  the country at about 4.1 percent. We are essentially at full  employment. There were about 2 million to 3 million jobs last month  that went unfilled. Nobody showed up to do those jobs, in some cases  because folks applying for those jobs didn't have the education, the  skills, the work ethic, or the willingness to do those jobs, or maybe  there was the inability to pass a drug test. What those people can do  is to enable a lot of companies in our country to be successful.   There is something I call economic insanity. We can talk all we want  about what is the morally right thing to do with respect to the  Dreamers. I think we ought to think about what is in our naked self- interest as a country with an eye on our economy. We are not going to  always have an economic expansion, but we want to keep it going for as  long as we can and have smart policies. One of the smart policies is to  make sure we have the right workers, who show up and do the work that  needs to be done in the workplace.   As it turns out, there is an impact that Dreamers have collectively  on the annual GDP loss for the U.S. if we don't pass the Dream Act,  authored by Senators Durbin and Graham and sponsored by a number of  Democrats and Republicans. The annual GDP loss for the United States  over 10 years if we don't pass the DREAM Act by March 5 is $460  billion.    Just in Delaware alone, we have 1,400 Dreamers. The impact on GDP in  Delaware if Congress doesn't pass the Dream Act by March 5--in a tiny  little State--is $88 million. That is an eye-popping number. It is in  our naked self-interest to find a path forward to make sure these folks  don't head back to the country where they were born years ago and maybe  start their own businesses and compete with us rather than be  productive citizens here.  [[Page S695]]    This is a commentary from the Center for American Entrepreneurship,  from earlier this year. The message that we received said:         The reduction in immigration mandated by the RAISE Act--    That is the administration's broad policy on immigration reform,  which the administration has proposed--       would reduce economic growth by two to three tenths of a       percentage point every year over the next decade.    Now, that doesn't sound like a lot, does it, to reduce it every year  by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points for the next decade? So that would be a  reduction in economic growth in our country over the next 10 years.   Right now we are doing pretty well. As I said, we are in the eighth  or ninth year of the longest running economic expansion in the history  of our country. Right now we are doing pretty well. The stock market  has been up and down, kind of crazy and haywire. But we can't afford to  do this. We would be foolish to throw away 2 or 3 percentage points of  economic growth over the next decade. That would be crazy. It means  slower growth, fewer jobs, less opportunity, and stagnant wages--none  of which benefits our people or our country.   We don't have to make a foolish decision like the administration's  proposal would have us make. I am tempted to call it economic insanity.  I think it is morally wrong. This is one of those places where doing  the right thing actually lines up with enabling us to do good and do  well at the same time. That is what we should do.   I want to thank Senator Durbin, Senator Lindsey Graham, and a bunch  of other colleagues--Democrat and Republican, from one end of the  spectrum to the other--who have been working very hard to do right and  do what is in the economic best interest of our country.   I thank my friend from Illinois for allowing me to go ahead of him.
