 Mr. Speaker, I was absent due to representing the  United States government at the United Nations 2023 Water Conference.  Had I been present, I would have voted in the following way: ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 144, suspending the rules and agreeing to H.R. 1159, and  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 145, suspending the rules and agreeing to H.R.  1159.                            ____________________
