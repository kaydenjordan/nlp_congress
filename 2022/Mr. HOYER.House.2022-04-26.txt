 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan for  yielding. And the Speaker pro tem, Ms. Jacobs, how proud Madeleine  Albright would be of the two of you standing here, presiding here, and  giving tribute to an extraordinary woman who must have been,  particularly for women--she was for me as well, but particularly for  women, an extraordinary example of success, of focus, of intellect, of  achievement. And I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Slotkin)  for taking this Special Order.   Madam Speaker, tomorrow, as the Speaker just said, at the National  Cathedral, really the cathedral--America's cathedral, many of us will  gather to remember and celebrate the extraordinary life of former  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.   Secretary Albright was a dear and valued friend for over 35 years. As  the chair of the Helsinki Commission, I worked closely with her on  issues related to human rights and foreign affairs for years, for a  decade that I was chair.   Secretary Albright was a diplomat, a teacher, and a mentor to so many  who now serve in our diplomatic corps and the world of foreign policy.   She was an author who used her pen and her voice to urge us both to  see the untapped possibilities in our world, and not to ignore the  dangers that confronted our country, our freedom, and our democracy.   Perhaps most of all, Secretary Albright was someone who never forgot  the experience of being a refugee and a survivor of war and genocide.  It gave  [[Page H4494]]  her great insight and determination to confront the enemies of freedom  and human rights.   Her family fled Czechoslovakia when it fell under the oppression of  Nazi occupation. Her determination was spurred as well when  Czechoslovakia fell under Stalin's heel. That experience pushed her to  spend her life working to keep others safe from those evils and to  ensure that the world's democracies, led by America, took action to  help those fleeing conflict and danger.   In 2018, she released a masterful book that everyone ought to read:  ``Fascism: A warning.''   She said in that book: ``Throughout his time in office,'' she wrote  of Vladimir Putin, ``He has stockpiled power at the expense of  provincial governors, the legislature, the courts, the private sector,  and the press. A suspicious number of those who have found fault with  him have later been jailed on dubious charges or murdered in  circumstances never explained.''   She saw then very clearly the threat that he and others pose to  democracy in our time.   I miss her wise words. Luckily, she wrote a lot of them down and  those were some that we certainly ought to remember; those insights, as  Ukraine's brave fighters battle a new tyranny and another criminal  dictator.   After she died, just days following Vladimir Putin's criminal and  unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, former Secretary of State Hillary  Clinton, whom the Speaker just mentioned, said: ``As has happened so  often, the man with the guns was wrong, and Madeleine was right.''   Right now, as the world confronts Putin's aggression, as we and our  fellow democracies stand up to authoritarianism and tyranny, we do so  better prepared, Madam Speaker, because of the warning and lessons that  Secretary Albright gave us.                                time  1945    In many ways, the most fitting tribute to her memory is the unity we  and our allies are demonstrating in the face of Putin's threat to  democracy, decency, and international law.   Before Secretary Albright's death, President Biden had committed $424  million toward his Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal,  which drew heavily on Secretary Albright's proposals and sought to  tackle the challenges she identified in her book, ``Fascism: A  Warning.'' ``It is easier,'' she wrote, ``to remove tyrants and destroy  concentration camps than to kill the ideas that gave them birth.''   This is a war of ideas, and America must lead the fight for  democracy.   Now, Secretary Albright's legacy is felt throughout the global  alliance of our democratic allies and partners confronting Vladimir  Putin and Russia together, where billions of dollars in both military  and humanitarian assistance are being mustered and deployed in defense  of democracy and human rights, the cause for which she lived and of  which she spoke so eloquently.   After Secretary Albright died, I spoke at length with my foreign  policy adviser, Mariah Sixkiller, who was a part of the group that met  at Secretary Albright's home for 15 years for discussions about  American leadership around the world. I asked Mariah to write a few  words of her recollections. She told me: ``I was honored to be at her  table for 15 years and to learn from this great stateswoman. She was,''  as the gentlewoman from Michigan has pointed out, ``witty, wise, bold,  and brilliant, even until her final days,'' even, as the gentlewoman  from Michigan said, someone as old as 80.   Mariah Sixkiller went on to say: ``She had the perfect combination of  good humor and unique charm.'' Our Speaker just reflected that, as the  gentlewoman from Michigan did. ``She made us laugh even at the hardest  times.''   All of us who knew her and who worked with her during her time in  government remember that characteristic wit and charm, along with her  keen intellect and her vision of a more perfect Union and a more  perfect, peaceful world.   Madam Speaker, I particularly admire the dedication she had to the  mission of standing up for the rights of women and girls worldwide.   As the first woman to serve as Secretary of State, a successor to  Thomas Jefferson and so many other extraordinary leaders who have  served in that post--including, of course, Secretary Clinton--at a time  when women were still having to prove they belonged in boardrooms and  around Cabinet tables dominated by men, she felt a unique  responsibility to be a voice for girls and women striving to be all  they could be, undefined by gender alone. And she was that voice.   She knew that when women had more political, social, and economic  freedoms, societies are better off in every way. Democracies, she  believed, are stronger, and democratization is more successful when  women and girls can pursue opportunities in safety, equality, and  freedom. The fight for women's rights never ended for her.   Even as recently as just a few months ago, Secretary Albright was  working furiously to push for more action to help women and girls in  Afghanistan.   We left Afghanistan. We left Afghanistan with the hopes that there  would be some civilized action by the Taliban. Sadly, we have seen that  they returned to their old ways of discrimination and putting down,  disallowing young women to go to school to prepare themselves for  leadership. Secretary Albright was active and, as a matter of fact, the  leader of the National Democratic Institute, which she chaired and  which argued strenuously for the rights of those girls and those women.   That was the last time we spoke directly, as we worked together to  help save these courageous Afghans who dedicated themselves to the goal  of creating a democratic future in their country.   In the final months of her life, Secretary Albright wrote down some  reflections to be included in a new memoir. Discussing what she  perceived to be her own shortcomings, she shared this: ``My parents  taught me what the best teachers tell us all: that it is no sin to make  a mistake but unpardonable not to try to make the most of our  talents.''   Fortunately for America and people around the globe, Madam Speaker,  Secretary Albright made the most of the many, many, the legion of  talents which she had and with which she was gifted.   One of the greatest was as a teacher. As the Speaker said, she was a  teacher for 40 years, and I would correct the Speaker and say she was a  teacher for at least 60-plus years. Although probably prior to 20, she  was a teacher as well. She taught thousands of students over the course  of an almost 40-year career in academia.   As a professor in the practice of diplomacy at the Georgetown  University School of Foreign Service, Secretary Albright helped train  and launch the careers of so many who are leaders today for America's  foreign policy and national security.   That is why so many of us are going to honor her tomorrow, and we  will not ever forget what she contributed to this country, a perfect  example of how important it is to accept and have come to this country  the brightest minds, the most committed people. What an extraordinary  example she was of the enrichment that immigration has given to this  country.   Moreover, she had an unwavering belief that women in the field of  foreign policy must support each other.   Mariah didn't give that quote. I know Mariah is listening right now.  Mariah Sixkiller was my national security adviser, and she worked with  me. Very frankly, Mariah knew what I believed before I believed it. She  was extraordinary. The inspiration that Secretary Albright gave to  Mariah is still fired up in her eyes, in her speech, and in her  thinking.   Secretary Albright served as a mentor to scores of other young women  who were students, as well as her colleagues at the State Department,  and she strove to ensure that these women got a seat at the table.   Secretary Albright's legacy will live through these women who have  followed in her footsteps and become the Foreign Service officers and  ambassadors working hard on behalf of the American people today and for  a long time to come.   Madam Speaker, we are so fortunate to have their talents in service  to our country as a result of Secretary Albright's example and  advocacy. I, again, repeat, as I am sure she is watching, she is so  proud--I hope of our  [[Page H4495]]  friendship--but so proud of Congresswoman Slotkin and so proud of  Congresswoman Jacobs as they rise on her behalf as leaders of this  country.   Tomorrow, we will bid Secretary Albright farewell, but our country  and its leaders would be wise to keep her close in our hearts and in  our minds in the weeks, months, and years ahead.   In many ways, the battle underway between democracy and despotism is  one that Secretary Albright so presciently foresaw. That battle, which  currently rages in Ukraine, reminds us, as she did, that the price of  liberty is, in fact, eternal vigilance.   We face a torturous road ahead, one that will demand our energy, our  faith, our perseverance, and our courage, all of which Secretary  Albright displayed throughout her life.   She believed that democracy would surely prevail, but she knew that  that result required our constant attention. When democracy prevails,  as surely it must, it will be in no small part due to her work, her  contributions, and her service.   God blessed America with an extraordinary woman whose name was  Madeleine Albright, and that name will be remembered for a long, long  time to come.
