 Madam President, I agree with the comments made by the  Senator from Alabama. There is one problem with this, and that is, it  is not paid for. I am supporting it. I am actually a cosponsor of the  bill and was a cosponsor of the bill long before this year, but we are  going to have to really get busy to figure out how to pay for this. It  is very expensive. But I do encourage people to vote for it.
