 Madam Speaker, I thank the majority leader for his kind  and overly gracious remarks.   Madam Speaker, I rise to offer my heartfelt thanks and my deepest  appreciation to the people of Maryland's Seventh Congressional District  for the high honor and the distinct privilege of again representing  them here in the Congress of the United States.    I am happy to have been joined by members of our distinguished  delegation from the State of Maryland, and I appreciate their presence  here among us.   I thank Almighty God for the victory and for my wonderful family and  friends. I am joined here in the gallery by my wife, Dr. Tiffany Beth  Mfume, and a longtime family friend, attorney Eric Bryant, and others.   I am honored by those supporters who are Black and White, Latino and  Asian, who could not be here at this time but who have worked so very  hard to make sure that this moment would be possible. And I believe, as  they do and as we continue to do, that racism, sexism, and anti- Semitism are wrong, that Black bigotry can be just as cruel and evil as  White bigotry, that gay bashing, immigrant bashing, and union bashing  ultimately deplete us as a Nation and rob us of our ability to make  true and lasting change.   Today marks my return to this body after 24 years and following the  death of the Honorable Elijah Cummings, my friend of 42 years. I do so  against the backdrop of COVID-19 and in the midst of our Nation's  greatest health crisis of the 21st century.   Simultaneously, we are also locked in the Nation's greatest economic  collapse, where there are now families and individuals who haven't had  a paycheck in weeks as they struggle to buy food and to pay bills.   Madam Speaker, our challenges as a Nation at this hour, as you and  others know better than I, are economic, educational, social, and  systemic, and they require both the courage of conviction and the  unwavering resolve that the American spirit has always exhibited in  order to solve them.   Thus, in yielding back my time, I call forth the words of Dr. James  Cheek, when he so eloquently exclaimed: ``I have not given up on the  American idea or on the American possibility, and I ask my colleagues  in this body not to give up also.   ``I am convinced that our Nation still stands before the world as  perhaps the last expression of a possibility of mankind devising a  social order where justice is the supreme ruler, and law is but its  instrument; where freedom is the dominant creed, and order . . . but  its principle; where equity is the common practice, and fraternity the  true human condition.''   It is against that backdrop that I welcome and embrace both this  challenge and opportunity before me.   Madam Speaker, I thank you and I thank the distinguished majority  leader for his words of introduction.                            ____________________
