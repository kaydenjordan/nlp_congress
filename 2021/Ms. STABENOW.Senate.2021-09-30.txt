 Mr. President, unfortunately I was unable to attend the  rollcall vote No. 389 on the confirmation of Todd Robinson to be  Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law  Enforcement Affairs. Had I been able to attend, I would have voted in  support of his nomination.                            ____________________
