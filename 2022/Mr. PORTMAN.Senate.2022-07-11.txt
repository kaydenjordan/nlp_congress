 First, I want to thank my colleague and cofounder and  cochair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus for his comments today.   What you just heard was that the White House has sent the application  for membership to NATO for Finland and Sweden to the U.S. Senate. It  now goes to our committee, the Committee on Foreign Relations, and  then, I hope, to the floor soon. I suspect there will be an  overwhelming vote because everybody in this Chamber understands the  importance not just of NATO expansion but of these two countries in  particular.   I thank my colleague for offering those words today, and my hope is  we can move very quickly on that.                            ____________________     Before we talk about Ukraine, this has been a time over  the last couple of weeks since we were last here in session of a lot of  change and volatility around the world.   I want to begin by expressing my shock and sorrow over the  assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. I know I  speak for all Americans when I express my deepest condolences to the  people of Japan for this tragic loss.   Prime Minister Abe was a dear friend to the United States and a  leader in building new coalitions in the Indo-Pacific to support  democracies in the region and counter the nuclear threat from North  Korea and China's various malign influences.   When I visited Japan a few months ago with a bipartisan group of  Senate colleagues, I saw firsthand the changes  [[Page S3204]]  that he brought to Japan that are now beginning to bear fruit: a  stronger and more effective national security posture for Japan; a more  confident Japan in the region; better trade and security ties,  including the quad dialogue with Japan, Australia, the United States  and India; and the Indo-Pacific economic framework.   His imprint on Japan and the very special alliance we have with Japan  will be long lasting and beneficial to both of our countries.                            ____________________     I also come to the floor today, as was noted, to talk  about Ukraine. Russia's brutal assault continues. We must do more here,  not just in the United States but around the world, to help Ukraine  stand up to this brutality.   This marks the 17th consecutive week in session that I have been on  the floor to discuss the unprovoked illegal and deadly assault on the  people of Ukraine.   This invasion started 138 days ago, and it is more critical than ever  that the United States and our allies support the efforts of Ukraine to  defend itself against this assault.   Let me just recap briefly the situation on the ground. A lot has  happened since we talked a couple of weeks ago. First, here in the  north, you can see the light blue, which is the Ukrainian advances. The  Ukrainians have been successful in pushing back against the Russian  offensive and taking back some of the territory around the city of  Kharkiv. This is a critical area, obviously.   Kharkiv is the sister city of my hometown, Cincinnati, OH. I was  involved in that sister city arrangement 40 years ago, and it is a  beautiful city. It has been almost flattened by the unending and  barbaric attacks from Russia.   In the outskirts of Kharkiv, again, Ukrainian forces are not just  holding the line but also making gradual advances, same as through  here, in Kherson. You can see there is, again, the light blue here that  indicates where the Ukrainians have made progress here in the south.   In the south and in Kharkiv, there has been progress made. This is  very important in the south here because, as you know, Russia's goal is  to try to shut off the entire Black Sea from Ukraine being able to  access and, therefore, to continue to be one of the great exporters of  the world. They have blocked any passage here of the ships that could  be sending wheat and other grains to the rest of the world, including  to Africa, where they are very dependent on Ukrainian wheat to keep  people from starving, and yet the Russians are blocking these. But  these cities are still in the control of Ukraine, and it is essential  that continue, that Russia not create a landlocked Ukraine, which  would, over the long term, be incredibly detrimental to the economy of  Ukraine. It is vital that they do well there.   I will say, though, that here in the east, it is a different  situation. Here is Donetsk and Luhansk, the Donbas region. Here is  where Russia has made incremental progress in the last couple of weeks,  using, again, bombs and missiles that are flattening cities, killing  civilians.   This city of Severodonetsk, you have heard about--it is about right  here--has fallen to the Russian forces after a months-long battle in  the last couple of weeks.   Its twin city, Lysychansk, which is also in this region, has also  fallen, completing Russia's brutal conquest of what is called the  Luhansk region. So Donetsk is still partly in Russian control--partly  not. Luhansk is now in Russian control.   But it is important to remember this: Russia paid dearly for every  inch of Luhansk--by the way, much of which they flattened. They  literally destroyed before occupying it. They lost troops, and they  lost military equipment.   But, significantly, because taking this area required massive amounts  of resources from Russia, it drew attention away from the north-- Kharkiv, as we saw, and down here in Kherson.   So it enabled these brave Ukrainian forces in these other places to  make progress, not just to hold out against the overwhelming Russian  onslaught but to make progress. The Russians have now announced they  are in an ``operational pause,'' meaning they are claiming they are  going to stop their large-scale offenses until their soldiers have  rested.   But as in the past, they can't be trusted. And, in fact, small-scale  offensive missile strikes and rocket attacks continue all along this  front line.   We also must not downplay even what these sporadic strikes can do.  Consider the tragedy that occurred about 2 weeks ago at a shopping mall  in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk. This is in central Ukraine, the  area we just talked about.   As more than 1,000 innocent Ukrainian civilians shopped with their  friends and families at this shopping mall, a Russian strategic bomber  launched a large Kh-22 missile. Now, this is a long-range, nuclear- capable missile that was initially designed to destroy aircraft  carriers--aircraft carriers--and they shot it into the middle of a  shopping mall--turned it into a burning inferno. You can see here in  this photograph.   As a result of the explosion and the fire, 20 people were killed  immediately, and more than 50 were wounded. Dozens more were declared  missing. We are still getting the final numbers from this horrific  tragedy, but it occurred during the summit of the so-called G7. That is  the group of developed countries, larger economies--Japan, United  States, and a few European countries--who were meeting to talk about  the issue of Russia and Ukraine, among other things. The G7 rightfully  condemned this atrocity as ``an abominable attack,'' an attack on  civilians in a shopping mall.   Just yesterday evening in Chasiv, Chasiv Yar, which is a residential  town in eastern Ukraine, a Russian rocket attack struck an apartment  complex and killed at least 15 people. More than 20 people are believed  to be trapped in the rubble as emergency workers continue to work today  to be able to free those who were trapped, to try to rescue innocent  civilians who are under attack. Again, this is an apartment complex.  People are trapped inside it, even as we talk.   These barbaric, cowardly, long-range missile attacks on civilian  targets have to be condemned by all of us, but they have to be stopped  in two ways. One is by providing Ukrainians what they need in terms of  anti-aircraft, anti-missile technology, but also by giving the  Ukrainians the ability to use these longer-range missiles themselves.   Right now, the Russians can sit back with impunity and launch these  attacks. I join the people of Ukraine in mourning for the loss of these  innocent civilians at the hands of Russia's cruelty. The terror, by the  way, that is caused by these attacks is not an accident. It is part of  the Russian war plan, to cause terror. Striking civilian targets is  certainly one thing they are doing. Continuing to blockade those Black  Sea ports I talked about is another one, increasing the economic cost  of this war on the Ukrainian people.   This is one reason why, by the way, a couple of weeks ago just before  we left for the recess, we had a vote in the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee on a resolution to name Russia as a state sponsor of  terrorism. That passed on a bipartisan basis, and my hope is that it  comes here to the floor of the U.S. Senate, so we can all go on record,  again, condemning what is going on over there and making it clear that  Russia has become a pariah country, that this is not normal behavior,  even in the tragedy of war.   Striking civilian targets deliberately is, unfortunately, continuing  day in and day out.   In response to these brutal acts, the bravery and effectiveness of  the Ukrainian defenders has been impressive but not surprising. Think  about it. They are defending their families. They are also defending  freedom, defending their homeland. The stakes of this war are high, and  the fate of a sovereign country hangs in the balance. But I will say  today, it is not just about Ukraine, as important as that is. It is  bigger than that because, if President Putin is successful in taking  more of Ukraine than he already controls--let's see the map again.    If he does, in fact, expand beyond what he has already done, taking  Crimea, taking this area of Luhansk and  [[Page S3205]]  Donetsk, taking the southern part of Ukraine, he is not going to stop  there. I don't think anybody believes that or is so naive to believe  that.   In 2016, he stated, ``The borders of Russia never end.'' This was  after he attacked Ukraine the first time. That was in 2016.   In a speech claiming victory in May of this year, President Putin  painted Ukrainians as Nazis. Remember, the President of Ukraine is  Jewish. His family went through the ordeal of the Holocaust.   But he was painting Ukrainians somehow as Nazis, saying that the  invasion of Ukraine was inevitable and that he was forced into this  conflict by NATO. NATO is not an offensive association; it is strictly  defensive.   The disinformation and lies also come from those around him. Vladimir  Medinsky, one of President Putin's senior advisers, lamented that  Russia's territory was greatly diminished from the time when Moscow  controlled more than 14 currently independent nations, including  Finland and Poland. This territorial retreat ``is not forever,'' he  said.   Europeans are waking up to this one-time unimaginable threat.  According to a European Council on Foreign Relations opinion poll  conducted 2 months ago, a possible Russian invasion of their nation is  seen as one of the top three threats now by 53 percent of Swedes, 54  percent of Romanians, and 40 percent of Germans. I was just in Romania  a few weeks ago and got to hear from Romanians directly about this  concern.   I also went to Moldova, where there is even more of a concern because  there is a Russian-occupied area called Transnistria right along their  country. So what can be done to stop and reverse the Russian gains here  in the east? The most important issue to me is to help these brave  Ukrainians be able to defend themselves by giving them the weapons to  level the playing field with Russia so they are not constantly  outgunned.   I have heard this from President Zelenskyy. We have all heard it from  Russian forces that they are making some progress in the east because  they have these weapons, these missiles, and the Ukrainians do not.   We also heard about this from members of the European Parliament who  came here to visit us about 3 weeks ago, came to the Ukraine Caucus. We  talked about the caucus earlier. We also heard from some fighter pilots  who came about 2-and-a-half weeks ago and met with our Ukrainian  Caucus. What they need are the weapons to be able to respond.   Their words have been explicit and direct: Russian artillery outguns  theirs in terms of range, in terms of accuracy. They can sit back and  fire on the Ukrainians' military and civilian targets, and the  Ukrainians cannot respond. They cannot reach them. Ukraine needs  advanced Western rocket artillery systems to even those odds.   Thankfully, the United States and several of our allies have these  exact systems. The UK has some systems. Germany has some systems. Over  the past month, the United States has provided Ukraine with several of  what are called HIMARS or high mobility artillery rocket systems.   We have got hundreds of these in our inventory, by the way, and many  of which are not with active units, in other words, they would be  available. These are superior to Russian artillery in almost every way:  mobility, reload time, accuracy, and most importantly, range. And yet,  during Ukraine's hour of need, we continue to move too slowly.   In the initial tranche of HIMARS, say about 6 weeks ago, only four of  these units were announced. They are now in service, as we understand  it, and they are working. Four more were announced a few weeks ago, and  another four were announced this past Friday. Reports are these are  still in transit. They are not yet being used to protect these  Ukrainian civilians who are being bombed.   They need more, and they need them now. Several have come from  Germany and from the UK; but they need more, and they need them now.   How many do they need? It depends who you talk to, but the Ukrainian  military officials who have spoken out on this, who are the experts,  say they need at least 48 of these systems to be able to begin to turn  the tables in the east. The United States is now committed to 12; only  4 are definitely in place. We need to move faster.   Apparently, there was a lot of discussion within the Agencies, within  the White House, about whether to do this or not; that is what took  longer for these HIMARS to be approved. My view is we have had the  dialogue. These systems are no more escalatory than Javelins were or  other weapons. These are defensive weapons. These are the ability for  Ukraine to defend itself, and I hope we can continue to provide them  and move more quickly. They are working. They are proving their worth.   Let me show you a photograph of what HIMARS can do to Russian  logistics. These are images of Russian ammunition dumps exploding after  reportedly being struck by missiles from a HIMARS system. Previously,  Ukraine could not reach these munition dumps, but now with HIMARS, they  can. Striking these ammo dumps can have a devastating impact on Russian  forces.   These are depots of weapons that are behind the Russian lines but in  the country of Ukraine. And, finally, they can access them. Striking  them is going to have a devastating impact. According to Serhii Kuzan,  the chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center in Kyiv,  Ukraine has used HIMARS rockets to now destroy 20 warehouses of Russian  artillery ammunition.   As I said earlier, Russian soldiers are currently in an ``operational  pause'' to recover and resupply before future offenses, so they say,  but they cannot resupply without ammunition.   So destroying these hubs will set Russia's timetables back and buy  Ukraine more time to prepare and to receive more Western military  equipment like the HIMARS.    These pictures are exactly the proof we need to show that what we are  sending is now making a difference. Imagine what they could do if they  had enough to be able to truly push back.   These HIMARS systems arrived in Ukraine too late to avoid some of the  damage that we have been talking about today and, certainly, some of  these cities, like Severodonetsk we talked about that has now fallen to  the Russians or Lysychansk, which has fallen to the Russians.   They arrived too late for the thousands of brave Ukrainians who were  killed and wounded defending those cities. If we don't act quickly,  then future HIMARS rockets will arrive too late to save more Ukrainian  citizens, more Ukrainian soldiers, more Ukrainian innocents. Time is of  the essence, and I urge the administration not to delay.   Again, I am pleased they are getting those weapons in. I wish it had  been sooner. And we now have to encourage more and faster.   When people, understandably, ask about our support for Ukraine, our  taxpayer-funded aid to the tune of billions of dollars, they deserve to  know that their hard-earned taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely.   In my view, that means spending it on weapons like HIMARS that are  actually making a difference on the battlefield. I believe the aid that  we and our allies are providing is a wise investment that will pay  dividends over time, but let's provide them the right aid.   Ukrainians are defending their country with bravery and skill,  exceeding all expectations, and they are ensuring that their country is  not being handed over to President Putin. We have to assure them that  the United States and their allies are doing all we can to help them  save their country.   We know that making any territorial concessions to Russia would only  embolden President Putin and other future would-be conquerors. The  lesson that they would learn is that with enough patience they can wear  down the West and get what we want.   So I was pleased to see 2 weeks ago, when the leaders of the so- called G7 countries--again, U.S., Japan, European countries--stated:         We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian,       military, and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine for       as long as it takes.    We saw how territorial concessions in the late 1930s only increased  Nazi Germany's appetite, and this is clearly no different.   Russia's goals are not limited to just the Donbas or southern  Ukraine. President Zelenskyy clearly understands this. He said to CNN  recently:   [[Page S3206]]              Ukrainians are not ready to give away their land, to accept       that these territories belong to Russia. This is our land.    I could not agree more. In fact, it goes beyond Ukraine. President  Putin will conquer as much of the former Soviet empire as we let him.  We must stop him here in Ukraine.   With regard to sanctions, the EU is still using Russian oil and gas,  sending roughly $870 million a day to help fund the Russian war  machine.   We have the capacity here in the United States to help our partners  and shore up our domestic energy production--not only important for  Americans to get the cost of gas down with more supply, but also  critical for our allies.   We are seeing some small progress, but much more needs to be done to  reduce this reliance on Russian energy. By the end of this year, we  expect coal and oil to be phased out. The United States must do its  part and increase our energy production, while at the same time be a  leader in developing new energy technologies that can help reduce  emissions and increase national as well as global security.   This is not either or. It should be all of the above. We should be  producing what we need right now to ensure that Europe can stop its  dependency on Russia and sending this almost a billion dollars a day to  fund the war machine, but at the same time we should be producing  energy from all sources, including green energy, including nuclear  energy.   And like sanctions and military aid, when the United States leads,  the world tends to follow. But most importantly, our allies and enemies  watch us.   This is true with regard to a revived NATO right now. In fact, in the  wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as we talked about earlier, both  Sweden and Finland have applied to join NATO, shrugging off long  histories of neutrality.   In Brussels, NATO Ambassadors, on July 5, signed the accession  protocols that put them a step closer. Now, all 30 NATO nations will  review their applications for ratification. Canada, Estonia, Denmark,  Norway, and Germany have already ratified Finland and Sweden's  applications. Let's join them. Let's do it this week. Let's do it  through an expedited procedure and just get it done. I look forward to  voting in favor of those applications in committee and on the floor.   We cannot forget that Russia has claimed this war started because  Ukraine wanted to join NATO. Of course, they did. They reaffirmed that  in 2014 when they threw off a corrupt Russia-backed government. They  are looking westward to Europe, to us, to freedom, to democracy. They  want to join NATO and the European Union and form ever-closer bonds  with the transatlantic community.   I have long believed that NATO deserved a NATO membership action plan  to provide a clear path to eventual NATO membership, and they have made  significant progress in doing this. This brutal invasion is just  Russia's latest attempt to throw that progress off course. We must not  be deterred.   Now, as we enter the fifth month of this war--I have come down here  every week to talk about it--we have seen the resilience and the  fortitude of the Ukrainians. Even as their brothers and husbands go to  fight for the homeland, the women of Ukraine are incredibly brave as  well, and I have seen them at the border with Poland; I have seen them  at the border with Moldova; and I have seen them as they come to the  United States and talk about what is going on in their country. They  know this is the fight, during our generation, where democracy is on  the line. How this war develops will have far-reaching impact on the  entire globe.   In Ohio, I see this all the time. A couple of weeks ago, I was in  Cleveland for what was called ``Amplify the Voice: A Benefit Concert  for Ukraine.'' We had 1,000 people come to this beautiful Severance  Hall, which is the music center for the Cleveland Orchestra, and one of  the premier orchestras in the world, by the way. They made the center  available to the Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus to perform to, again, an  audience of people who were Ukrainian Americans but also from every  nationality, particularly the nationalities communities, as we call  them in Cleveland, which would be people from Eastern and Central  Europe who understand the importance of this fight. So Lithuanians were  there; Poles were there; Romanians were there; Hungarians were there-- people from all over the region.   The concert raised funds for the United Ukrainian Organizations of  Ohio's Fund to Aid Ukraine. They are doing great work.   It is amazing how many people who spoke who are doing something to  help with regard to Ukraine--medical supplies, armored vests, helping  with regard to emergency supplies just so people can have enough food  to get by when they are subject to some of these bombings we have seen  today.   We also heard a beautiful concert. Ukrainians of all stripes  certainly understand what is going on and why this is so important and  have for a long time because they know what it is like to live under  the thumb of authoritarianism. They broke away from it many times  during their history and again more recently in 1991 and again in 2014.   I was in Ukraine after the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, where  Ukrainians decided for themselves that they wanted to turn away from  Russian domination and turn to us.   I believe we can help them win this time. I am confident of it. That  is why I have introduced a bipartisan resolution with Senators Manchin,  Murkowski, and Hassan to recognize the U.S. commitment to help rebuild  Ukraine. According to the United Nations Human Rights Council, more  than 7 million civilians have fled their homeland, and there has been  about $600 billion worth of damage to Ukraine's infrastructure.   By the way, those refugees, those civilians whom I have met--they all  want to go home. And in a sense, it is not perfect to call them  refugees because they are really just Ukrainians who are temporarily  forced to leave their country, but they all want to go home and rebuild  Ukraine.   It is not just a human toll we see captured in images and videos, but  people's homes and livelihoods have vanished overnight. So they are  going to need help. The countries of the free world are with us, and we  have to be sure that they step up, including some countries that were  less comfortable providing military assistance that are providing more  monetary assistance--some of those countries are really going to need  to step up in terms of helping to get Ukraine back on its feet.   Now is not the time for us to back away. We have to be able to win  this militarily and then begin the rebuilding. It is not a time for us  to be tentative or equivocal. At this critical juncture, let's lead our  allies to provide what Ukraine needs to protect their homeland and to  defend democracy.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
