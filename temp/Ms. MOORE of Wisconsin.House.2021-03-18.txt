 Madam Speaker, today, I am pleased to rise in  support of the American Dream and Promise Act (H.R. 6) to provide  permanent protections for Dreamers and those currently protected by  Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED)  programs.   Over the past few years, the lives of these Dreamers, who have  largely known no other home than the United States, have been filled  with even greater uncertainly and court challenges. This bill aims to  permanently change that and give security and a pathway to citizenship  for our Dreamers.   The vast majority of DACA-eligible students over the age of 18  received a high school education here. Our nation has made an  investment in their future that not only transformed their lives, but  also has resulted in widespread economic and other benefits for our  country and communities. A few years ago, it was estimated that if  Wisconsin's DACA workers were deported, it would cost the state more  than $400 million annually.   Despite this uncertainty and outright hateful opposition from the  previous administration, these young men and women remain resolute and  many have served on the frontlines--as health care professionals and  other essential workers--during this deadly pandemic.   We successfully defended against ill-advised efforts to end DACA. Now  it is time to take the next step. We need to ensure that DREAMers can  continue enriching our country.   Likewise, TPS holders have also seen their lives thrown into turmoil  during an already turbulent time, with their fate depending on a series  of court decisions. Like Dreamers, TPS holders are active members of  their communities, many have lived here for years, and are critical  contributors to our economy.   It's always the right time to do the right thing. Now is the right  time to provide permanent protections and a pathway to citizenship for  those who have contributed so much to our country. I am pleased to  support this bill.
