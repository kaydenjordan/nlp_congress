 Mr. Speaker, Mahatma Gandhi, a great leader on  nonviolence, said poverty is the worst form of violence.   Let me be clear: We allow poverty when we take no action to eradicate  it. 145 million Americans today live in poverty in the wealthiest  country in the world.   We allow poverty to continue when we approve bloated military  spending, when structural racism is everywhere, when 55 of the largest  corporations did not even pay $1 in taxes last year, when 32 million  people do not even get paid $15 an hour, and 87 million Americans  remain uninsured or underinsured.   Poor people in this country are suffering, without the food they need  to eat, without the wages they deserve,  [[Page H2594]]  without the dignity they have a right to.   We, in Congress, have the power to end poverty. We must act  immediately with resolve, moral clarity, and with complete attention to  the lives of poor people who demand to be seen and respected with our  actions.   That is why I am so proud to co-introduce with Representative Barbara  Lee this bold and necessary resolution that commits Congress to  eradicating poverty from the bottom up.   Mr. Speaker, today, we say to poor people everywhere, we see you, and  we will eradicate poverty in our country with you.                            ____________________
