 Madam Speaker, due to a previous commitment to co-host  the WATERS summit in Greenville, NC for the purpose of identifying  potential solutions to mitigate flooding of my constituents--and  because of the schedule change by the Speaker--I was not able to make  the vote on the debt limit increase. Had I been present, I would have  noted ``nay'' on Rollcall No. 315.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
