 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 782, the Providing  Resources, Officers, and Technology to Eradicate Cyber Threats to Our  Children Act of 2017, and thank my colleague from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee), who has worked so diligently on this matter.   Mr. Speaker, this bill authorizes appropriations for this program in  the amount of $60 million for each fiscal year from 2018 through 2022.  These figures are consistent with current appropriated levels.   We must continue to protect our children from the daily threats that  permeate the electronic platform and endanger the well-being of our  children.   Earlier this morning, as has been said, the House Judiciary  Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations  held a hearing addressing these very problems. As ranking member of  that committee, I vow to continue my commitment toward eradicating this  infectious poison that has claimed the innocence of so many of our  youths.   I look forward to working with my colleagues and others on these very  important issues. That is why I support the measures put forth in this  bill.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who has been a key supporter and  advocate for this important legislation.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Texas for her commitment, for her work, and for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I spent 5 years as a proud member of the Judiciary  Committee. I miss it and I hope to return one day to add on to my  responsibilities as a member of the Appropriations Committee.   I also thank Mr. Goodlatte for his leadership and solid, consistent  support for this program over the last decade.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 782, Providing  Resources, Officers, and Technology to Eradicate Cyber Threats to Our  Children Act--or the PROTECT Our Children Act--because at this very  moment there are thousands of children out there waiting to be saved.   Our children deserve, as we all agree, a future that is healthy,  prosperous, bright, secure, and, most of all, safe. That is, of course,  what every parent cares about the most: the safety of their children.  But, sadly, our children are vulnerable when they are online.   With the proliferation of the internet and wireless technology,  online child pornography has become an epidemic, and I don't use that  term lightly. The ever-increasing reach of the modern internet has  facilitated an exploding, multibillion-dollar market for child  pornography.   Tragically, the demand for this criminal market can only be supplied  by graphic new images, and these images can only be supplied through  the sexual assault of more children. Let's not forget that these are  not just heinous photos or images. They are, simply put, crime scene  photos created by a thriving industry that uses children as sexual  commodities.   Ten years ago, I introduced H.R. 3845, the Providing Resources,  Officers, and Technology to Eradicate Cyber Threats to Our Children Act  of 2007--or PROTECT Our Children Act of 2007.   At a House Judiciary hearing on that bill, my colleagues will  remember we heard from a very brave young woman, Alicia Kozakiewicz.  She had been abducted by an internet predator when she was just 13  years old. She was held captive in his dungeon basement and sexually  tortured for 4 days.   The FBI found Alicia because the Virginia Internet Crimes Against  Children Task Force--or ICAC--had the technology to lift the digital  fingerprints of this perpetrator's crimes. They were able to discover  the location where he held her captive, chained to the floor, connected  to a collar around her neck. Internet crimes officers tracked the IP  address back to his door and literally rescued Alicia from death.   I remember Alicia's testimony like it was yesterday because it moved  many of the members of that committee, including myself, to tears. Over  the course of that next year, we learned a lot about these types of  offenders: who they are, how they operate, and, most importantly, where  they are.   We saw detailed law enforcement maps that showed the locations of  hundreds of thousands of sexual predators, over half of whom had actual  child victims waiting to be rescued.   That number might lend people to think: Come on, that has to be an  exaggeration. It is not. I have seen the evidence before my eyes:  hundreds of thousands of sexual predators, each on a computer uploading  pictures of child victims that they are sexually assaulting. Those maps  described the truly harrowing environment.   Congress did what it was supposed to do. We acted. We passed H.R.  3845 and, the following year, passed its companion, S. 1738. This  legislation established the National Internet Crimes Against Children-- or ICAC--Task Force Program, a specialized group of law enforcement  officials dedicated to the protection of our children.   In 2009 and 2010, Congress funded the ICAC Task Force at close to  their full authorization levels of $50 million per year. The task  forces grew from 42 to 61, and arrests and child rescues doubled.   Literally thousands more predators were apprehended and children  rescued. An untold number of sexual assaults were prevented by virtue  of the fact that the most dangerous offenders were sitting behind bars,  where they could no longer harm our children.   In 2011, however, the ICAC Task Force budget was slashed, cut from  $50 million to where it is today at $27 million. So, with all due  respect, I have to correct my colleagues. We are not funding the ICAC  Task Force at authorized levels.    This cut remains intact, despite the fact that, as of August 2017,  law enforcement has seen nearly a half million unique IP addresses  trafficking in sexual abuse images in the U.S. That is hundreds of  thousands of separate online sexual predators, and that number is only  from January 2017 to August 31, 2017.   Even more heartbreaking, law enforcement officials tell us that the  victims are getting younger, most under the age of 10, and the abuse is  getting more sadistic. According to the National Center for Missing and  Exploited Children, 44 percent of the images, Mr. Speaker, they viewed  in 2016 depicted sexual torture.   Law enforcement also tells us that only 7 percent of the top 100  traders on peer-to-peer networks trading these types of images are even  under investigation.   Mr. Speaker, this is not just unacceptable; it is tragic. We owe our  children much better than that. They deserve our help and a Congress  that will do whatever it can to ensure their health and safety.   S. 782, the Senate version of a bill that I introduced in March of  this year with my colleague and friend, Lamar Smith, as the chairman  kindly thanked us, reauthorizes the National Internet Crimes Against  Children Task Force.   According to estimates, half of the arrests made by ICAC teams lead  us to the door of a hands-on offender and, thus, a child waiting to be  rescued.   The PROTECT Our Children reauthorization before us today will help us  continue to provide the safety net we so desperately need by allowing  these highly successful ICAC Task Forces to continue to support State  and local law enforcement agencies.  [[Page H7709]]    While I applaud House leadership for making sure this crucial child  rescue program and funding is not allowed to expire, I beseech my  colleagues to also make sure that the ICAC Task Forces are fully  funded. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I press for that  every year.   We have to do better. We have to get as close to the authorization  level as we can, because we actually rescue children with the more  resources we put into this.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, we must give the protection of  these children our full focus and efforts. Please think about these  precious babies being victimized. If you are a parent--and many of us  are--God forbid if it was your own child. It could be any of our  children, because of the prevalence of our children being online.   Let's give these ICAC teams the resources they need to rescue as many  children as possible. If we do that, thousands more innocent children  will be protected from these unspeakable crimes. There, but for the  grace of God, go our families and children.   I thank my Republican lead cosponsor, Congressman Lamar Smith, for  teaming up with me again to reauthorize this for yet another 5 years  for this critical issue. I urge my colleagues to support the PROTECT  Our Children Act reauthorization.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the full committee and Ms.  Wasserman Schultz for very instructive and important statements,  particularly the plea that Ms. Wasserman Schultz made that we must  reauthorize and, more importantly, fund these task forces, because they  do, in fact, save lives.   Let me acknowledge the chairman of this committee for the  collaboration on this bill, and let me again emphasize that we must  make sure that it is authorized at the amount of money needed.   If there is ever an unfortunate and tragic example, it is that of the  story of Alicia. She represents the Johnnys and Marys and Tommys and  Shirleys and Quamis and Lateshas and others across the Nation who fall  victim to this kind of cruel and almost inhuman attack on our children,  innocent as they are, smart as they are, using the internet as they do  online for any number of reasons, but then wooed by a dastardly person  who wants to do them harm.   The task forces that are now based upon knowledge, expertise,  commitment, passion, and with number of staffing that they need, can  really be for not only prevention, but the intervention to stop our  children from falling victim.   So I ask my colleagues to support S. 782, the Providing Resources,  Officers, and Technology to Eradicate Cyber Threats to Our Children Act  of 2017--or the PROTECT Our Children Act--as quickly as possible so  that it can move to the President's desk and, as well, that we continue  the pathway not only of intervention and prevention, but completely  ceasing the online violence against our children because we have been  able to ensure that these individuals, in large numbers, are brought to  justice. By that very point, they cease to survive and thrive on the  internet.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of S. 782, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 178, the Elder Abuse  Prevention and Prosecution Act. I thank the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee for his excellent work in this area.   This legislation would increase protections for elder abuse victims,  which is very important, as a vast majority of cases of abuse, neglect,  and exploitation of older adults in the United States often go  unreported and unaddressed.   Each year, nearly $3 billion is taken from older adults due to  financial abuse and exploitation, and this is happening across all  racial, social, economic, gender, and geographic lines.   This important measure increases protections for victims by, first,  ensuring support for Federal cases involving elder abuse. This support  will include the requirement that the Attorney General designate at  least one assistant United States attorney to serve as an elder justice  coordinator in every judicial district to prosecute, train, assist  with, and conduct public outreach on elder abuse.   Additionally, this measure would also require that the Executive  Office for United States Attorneys operate an elder abuse resource  group and a working group to advise the Justice Department on elder  abuse issues.   Secondly, this measure would require the establishment of best  practices for local, State, and Federal data collection to focus on  elder abuse, including, for example, the total number of Federal  investigations of elder abuse and locations where cases are filed.   Findings under this legislation include the fact that older adults  who are abused are three times more likely to die earlier than older  adults of the same age who are not abused, and that up to half of all  older adults with dementia will experience abuse.   For these reasons, a third component of this measure that I find  extremely important and valuable is the enhanced victim assistance to  elder abuse survivors. This measure would require that an annual report  be submitted to Congress on the funding under the Victims of Crime Act  of 1984 for victims of crimes who are elders.   And finally, this measure adds a new definition of ``telemarketing  and email marketing'' under the telemarketing statute to protect  victims of such scams, which typically involve elders.   We must do everything possible to support victims of elder abuse and  prevent the abuse from occurring in the first place. And so for these  several reasons, I am very pleased to support the bill with the  chairman of the committee.   Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, the elder abuse problem has  devastating consequences to the victims as well as their loved ones,  and it is an affront to America's older adults. It involves the  exploitation of some of our most vulnerable citizens.   This measure includes a multipronged approach to prevent elder abuse  and exploitation, protect the victims of elder abuse and exploitation  from further harm, and bring the perpetrators of these crimes to  justice. Accordingly, I am pleased to urge my colleagues to support  this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin my remarks today by extending my  condolences to the family and friends of the 59 individuals killed in  the shooting in Las Vegas, and I express my best hopes for the recovery  of the more than 500 persons who were injured.   This Congress has a responsibility to find a way to prevent tragedies  like this, as well as the daily incidents of gun violence in our  communities, but instead of considering legislation to prevent gun  violence, the House is spending today pushing a 20-week abortion ban  that will disproportionately hurt women and families who face some of  the most medically complex situations imaginable.   So it is with great pleasure that I oppose H.R. 36, because it is a  dangerous and far-reaching attack on a woman's constitutional right to  choose whether or not to terminate a pregnancy.   Roe v. Wade's basic holding is that a woman has a constitutional  right to have an abortion prior to the fetus' viability, which is  generally considered by the experts to be around 24 weeks from  fertilization. By banning previability abortions, H.R. 36 is a direct  challenge to Roe.   Another serious flaw, in my view, of H.R. 36 is that its narrow rape  exception completely misconstrues the difficult challenges that  survivors of sexual assault face and the very real reasons why a rape  or incest may go unreported. So by requiring that a rape or incest  survivor provide documentation to corroborate her statement that she  was raped, the bill's sponsors seem to be saying that maybe women  cannot be trusted to tell the truth about sexual assault, and they  certainly cannot be trusted to make their own private healthcare  decisions.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous and mean-spirited  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  [[Page H7717]]  from Colorado (Ms. DeGette), the co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman and also Ms.  Jayapal for allowing me to speak today.   Madam Speaker, I rise for my former district director Chris and his  wife, Bridget. This is their story.   Bridget was pregnant with their very much-wanted second child. After  the 20th week, they were stunned to learn that the brain stem of the  fetus was not attached, and if the baby even survived, then the newborn  would likely die within hours. Doctors told the family, if they wanted  more children, it would be a good idea to end the pregnancy. After  consulting with their minister, they decided to do so.   The happy ending is that a year or so later another child was born,  and she is happy and healthy today.   As co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus, I know that difficult  circumstances always surround these highly personal decisions, and I  don't think that the U.S. Congress is the body that should impose its  opinion.   Just imagine the horrible choices families would have to make if H.R.  36 became law. Ninety-nine percent of abortions are conducted before  the 20-week mark. Virtually all the rest are just like this situation.   Madam Speaker, I urge the body to reject this bill and to move on to  important issues that are facing this country.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Deutch), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Nadler), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene).   Ms. DelBENE. Madam Speaker, today I rise for Stephanie from my  district. This is her story.   Stephanie and her husband were building their family. They had one  beautiful daughter when she got pregnant for the second time, a planned  and wanted pregnancy.   But at 19 weeks, Stephanie got heartbreaking news. Her fetus had a  devastating fatal birth detect. Based on her age, medical history, and  test results, she was strongly advised to terminate the pregnancy.   Stephanie ultimately decided not to carry the pregnancy to term. She  told me, through tears, that her daughter needed her mother, and it  wasn't worth the risk. It is a profoundly difficult situation for any  family, but it was their decision.   H.R. 36 punishes women like Stephanie. It takes personal medical  decisions out of families' hands and lets politicians decide. It also  places a cruel burden on survivors of sexual assault and child abuse.  It is unacceptable.   On behalf of Stephanie, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' We must  stop the bans.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentleman from Virginia (Mr. McEachin).   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to share Denise's story.  Already a mother of two young children, Denise was expecting her third  child. Until her 20-week scan, all her tests had come back perfectly.  Her entire family was eagerly awaiting a baby boy.   The scan revealed that her son's brain had several severe  deformities. He was also showing signs of other complications. It was  the most painful and devastating day of Denise's life.  [[Page H7719]]    She spoke to numerous doctors and specialists. She spoke to her  family and sought the guidance of counselors and professionals.   Ultimately, she and her husband decided to end the pregnancy. But  finding a provider and arranging for the procedure was very difficult.  There was not a single doctor in Virginia she could go to.   Denise, as a grieving mother in the middle of an absolutely emotional  crisis, found herself desperately calling doctors and hospitals all  over the country to access the medical care she needed. Thanks to a  family friend, she was ultimately able to find a provider in a major  city within driving distance. H.R. 36 would have denied her that  chance.   On behalf of Denise and others like her, I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on H.R. 36. We must stop the bans.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, how much time remains on each side?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 11\1/2\  minutes remaining and the gentlewoman from Georgia has 10\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Carbajal).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who is a senior member on the Judiciary  Committee.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Conyers and I can remember the same type of hearings and the same  type of legislation many years ago, again denying women their  constitutional rights. I can see as clear as I can see you, Madam  Speaker, the women who were sitting and begging us not to undermine  them, their doctor, and their faith.   So I rise today to say to my friends on the other side of the aisle:  You have got it wrong. There are no mass abortions. There is no call  for mass abortions. The women that are undergoing these procedures are  women who have prayed and who have looked to their faith, their doctor,  and their family.   So I oppose this bill because it puts the lives of women at risk, it  interferes with women's constitutionally guaranteed right of privacy,  and it diverts attention from the real problem facing American women.  Let us reauthorize SCHIP. People are crying about that in my district.  How outrageous.   One of the most detestable aspects of this bill is that it would curb  access to care for women in the most desperate of circumstances. It is  these women who receive the 1.5 percent of abortions that occur after  20 weeks.   What number did I say? 10? 20? 1.5, and this is not diminishing the  aspects of this.   But it is those women who have prayed. They have sought doctors'  help, and they, as well, have sought their family's consultation.   We are making a mockery of these women. These women are not standing  on the street corner saying, ``I want to have an abortion.'' They have  a serious situation, like April Salazar.   At 18 weeks, she and her husband found out that their baby had a  lethal diagnosis, and if she carried the pregnancy to term and he was  born alive, he would die shortly from suffocation. It is not pain of  getting him out--he would die. April hoped the news wasn't true, so she  requested more tests to confirm the diagnosis. At 21 weeks she had an  abortion. This bill would have stopped April.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. This would have stopped April, her husband, her  family, her God, and her doctor from making the decision.   Even the exceptions are bogus because you frighten these women. The  idea of Jeni, in my home State, where they had a 2-day waiting period  listening to a mandatory script about abortion and a sign-off from two  separate doctors. Once you start this, you are taking it away from  women who have sought their faith leader, their doctor, and their  family.   This is a bad bill. We need to do some important things. I would hope  with the carnage of Las Vegas, to save lives, we would ban assault  weapons and we would not have that gentleman having 42 guns in his home  and in his possession. That is what we need to fight to save lives, not  this bill that undermines the rights of women and their faith and their  doctor.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 36, the ``Pain  Capable Unborn Child Protection Act'' and the underlying bill.   I opposed this irresponsible and reckless legislation the last time  it was brought to the floor.   I oppose this bill because it is unnecessary, puts the lives of women  at risk, interferes with women's constitutionally guaranteed right of  privacy, and diverts our attention from the real problems facing the  American people.   A more accurate short title for this bill would be the ``Violating  the Rights of Women Act of 2017.''   Instead of resuming their annual War on Women, our colleagues across  the aisle should be working with Democrats to help rebuild the ravaged  communities hit by hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.   Madam Speaker, we could and should instead be voting reauthorize the  important SCHIP program that has helped families get on their feet for  years.   Instead of voting to abridge the constitutional rights of women for  the umpteenth time, we should bring to the floor for a first vote  comprehensive immigration reform legislation or legislations repairing  the harm to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the Supreme Court's  decision in Shelby County v. Holder.   The one thing we should not be doing is debating irresponsible  ``messaging bills'' that abridge the rights of women and poses a  nationwide threat to the health and wellbeing of American women and a  direct challenge to the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade.   Madam Speaker, one of the most detestable aspects of this bill is  that it would curb access to care for women in the most desperate of  circumstances.   It is these women who receive the 1.5 percent of abortions that occur  after 20 weeks.   Women like Jeni from Texas, who, at 21 weeks, was told that her fetus  had multiple severe defects.   Jeni could end the pregnancy or wait for the fetus to miscarry or  die.   There was no way that the pregnancy would end in a live, healthy  baby.   Jeni and her husband chose to terminate the pregnancy, but because  they live in Texas, they were forced to endure several cruel  restrictions: a two-day waiting period, listening to a mandatory script  about abortion, and a sign-off from two separate doctors.   Madam Speaker, every pregnancy is different.   No politician knows, or has the right to assume he knows, what is  best for a woman and her family.   These are decisions that properly must be left to women to make, in  consultation with their partners, doctors, and their God.   Madam Speaker, I also strongly oppose H.R. 36 because it lacks the  necessary exceptions to protect the health and life of the mother.   In Roe v. Wade, the Court held that a state could not prohibit a  woman from exercising her right to terminate a pregnancy in order to  protect her health prior to viability.   While many factors go into determining fetal viability, the consensus  of the medical community is that viability is acknowledged as not  occurring prior to 24 weeks gestation.   By prohibiting nearly all abortions beginning at ``the probable post- fertilization age'' of 20 weeks, H.R. 36 violates this clear and long  standing constitutional rule.   Madam Speaker, the constitutionally protected right to privacy  encompasses the right of women to choose to terminate a pregnancy  before viability, and even later where continuing to term poses a  threat to her health and safety.   This right of privacy was hard won and must be preserved inviolate.   I strongly oppose H.R. 36 and urge all Members to join me in voting  against this unwise measure that put the lives and health of women at  risk.   I would like to include in the Record stories from two women:         April Salazar, New York: ``It would have been too hard for       me to carry to term, and it  [[Page H7724]]       seemed pointless to make the baby suffer too when she would       never survive.''        At 18 weeks, April and her husband found out that their       baby had lethal skeletal dysplasia. He would never be able to       breathe on his own. If she carried the pregnancy to term and       he was born alive, he would die shortly after of suffocation.       April hoped the news wasn't true, so she requested more tests       to confirm the diagnosis, which took two weeks. At 21 weeks,       she had an abortion. April shares her story because she has       found that it can change opinions. Several people she knows       personally who previously had been anti-abortion told her       that they would have done the same thing she did.        Julie Bindeman, Maryland: ``Everything about a later       termination is already so incredibly difficult even just       picking up the phone to make the appointment. The 20-week ban       adds another hurdle. It's just cruel.''        Julie's doctor told her and her husband that their son's       brain had a serious abnormality, a diagnosis that they       confirmed with tests, more ultrasounds, and an MRI. If the       baby survived birth, he would never speak, walk, or have       conscious thoughts based upon what had developed in his       brain. Julie and her husband decided to end the pregnancy,       and the soonest they could get the appointment was at 22       weeks. Julie could not find a surgeon in Maryland at that       time willing to perform the procedure, so she had to be       induced for labor and delivery. Her baby was born alive and       died very shortly after.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Engel).                                time  1715     Madam Speaker, how much time remains on both sides?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 2\1/2\  minutes remaining, and the gentlewoman from Georgia has 2\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, in closing, H.R. 36 is a dangerous and  unconstitutional bill that demonstrates a fundamental distrust of women  to make private decisions that are best for themselves and their  families. It is, therefore, unsurprising that this legislation is  strongly opposed by the Nation's leading civil rights organizations,  the medical profession, and women's groups.   In addition, 36 religious organizations noted in a letter to Members  opposing this bill that the decision to end a pregnancy must be left to  an individual woman, in consultation with her  [[Page H7725]]  family, doctors, and any others she chooses to involve, in keeping with  her personal beliefs.
