 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, here we are  6 months since the last foreign policy disaster into which this  administration led this country, the disastrous withdrawal from  Afghanistan: 13 servicemembers killed, including 1 from my home State  of Missouri; dozens more wounded; hundreds--hundreds--of civilians  killed; hundreds more, maybe thousands, of American civilians left  behind enemy lines to terrorists, to fend for themselves; still  hundreds of Americans stranded there in Afghanistan as we speak.   And what accountability has there been in this time? Who has been  relieved of duty? Who has been shown the door? What have we learned?   The answer is there has been no accountability. No one has been  relieved of duty. No one has been shown the door.   And now this administration has bumbled to the brink of another  foreign policy crisis that they have helped create, having denied  Ukraine military aid, lethal aid, when it asked for it last spring;  having stuffed dollars in Vladimir Putin's pockets by greenlighting the  Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline. And now here they are, on the verge of  another foreign policy crisis, and still we have no answers, still we  have no accountability.    I will say this, though. We did learn a few interesting details this  week about what happened in Afghanistan. And by the way, if you think  that Vladimir Putin and the other dictators around this world weren't  emboldened by this administration's weakness, by their utter failure in  Afghanistan, then you have got another thing coming.   But what have we learned this week about Afghanistan? What have we  learned? Actually, a couple of interesting things, a number of  interesting things. We learned that, in fact, the White House and the  State Department were warned for months on end--months on end--that  their failure to evacuate civilians would result in disaster; that the  Afghan Government was on the verge of collapse. They were told over and  over.   One servicemember who was in Kabul told investigators ``the writing  was on the wall. The country and its government were actively  collapsing,'' and ``we should not have waited [to start evacuations]  until every provincial capital had fallen except for Kabul.''   Yet that is exactly what the administration did. Our top military  commander in Kabul tried to get the Ambassador on the ground to see the  security threat for what it was but to no avail. As one military  official told investigators--we learned this week--``The Embassy needed  to position for withdrawal.'' Yet they weren't doing it.   Why weren't they doing it? Why weren't civilians evacuated in a  timely manner? Why wasn't the White House prepared? Because the White  House wasn't taking it seriously.   According to Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Farrell Sullivan, as late as  August 6, ``the National Security Council was not seriously planning  for an evacuation.'' Mind you, by this point, our military presence is  gone. We have withdrawn militarily from the country. Here we are in  August, and the National Security Council--the White House--was not  seriously planning for an evacuation.   The State Department hadn't even put a team together that was  responsible for informing individuals, including American citizens,  that they were eligible for evacuation or started collecting the  information they would need to put those Americans on flights to  safety.   And it wasn't as if the White House and the State Department didn't  know better. Our top military commander on the ground in Afghanistan  warned as early as March--as early as March, he has testified--that he  said the security situation in Afghanistan was dire and collapse could  come quickly; when the United States withdrew, collapse could come  quickly. He said it in March. By July, our troops were gone. In August,  the administration still hadn't started planning.   Here is what the top commander in Kabul said. He said:         I think we could have been much better prepared to conduct       a more orderly [civilian evacuation]--    That is what a NEO is--       if policy makers had paid attention to the indicators of what       was happening on the ground, and the time lines associated       with the Taliban advance, and the Taliban intent to conduct a       military takeover.    That is what we learned this week: that the White House was told over  and over and over again and did nothing; in fact--worse than that-- rejected the counsel of military commanders on the ground, saying that  the situation was urgent, saying that civilians needed to be evacuated,  saying that there needed to be other steps taken, new measures taken.  And the White House drug their feet, did nothing.   So what was the consequence of that? Well, we also learned this week  that the consequence was a rapid, chaotic  [[Page S630]]  rush for the exits once the White House suddenly and belatedly realized  they had bumbled into a crisis--once they realized that they had left  American civilians with nowhere to go, once they realized that they had  a collapse on their hands that they had not planned for, despite being  warned repeatedly.   As the CENTCOM found--Central Command found--and we learned this  week, ``Commanders at each gate [around the airport] exercised  authority to open or close their respective gates, as they deemed  appropriate, according to the situation on the ground. . . . However,  there was tremendous pressure from the strategic level,'' meaning the  Combatant Command, the Joint Staff, and, yes, the White House, ``to  continue to process and evacuate civilians to the maximum extent  possible, so gate closures were done rarely, locally, and  temporarily.''   In other words, it was a rush--a mad rush--to the exits once the  administration realized that, in fact, the government was collapsing;  realized they hadn't done the preparation they needed to do; realized  that hundreds, if not thousands, of American civilians were in grave  danger.   And we know the result of that. The result is 13 servicemembers were  killed, hundreds of civilians were killed, and hundreds of Americans-- maybe more--were left behind to the enemy.   Now, I said we learned all this this week. You might wonder, well,  where did we learn it? I mean, maybe at least we are making some  progress. We are getting some accountability. We learned something.   Did we learn it in an oversight hearing before this body? Did we  learn it in sworn testimony given in public on the evacuation of  Afghanistan? No, no. Oh, no. We learned it from a press report. We  learned it because the Washington Post obtained what were previously  confidential, unpublished, nonpublic reports from within the military-- from within Central Command in particular--and the Washington Post  published them.    In what has become an all-too-typical scenario, we learned nothing  from any hearings this body is doing because they aren't doing any in  public. What we have learned is entirely from leaked reports,  secondhand sources--the public having been shut out, having been denied  access.   You know, we had multiple hearings, actually--or briefings--on  Afghanistan and the security situations in Ukraine last week. Did that  happen in public? No. Was there testimony taken in public? No. Were  there questions asked by Senators in public? No.   I am willing to come to this floor as long as it takes and insist on  regular order as long as it takes until there is accountability for  what this administration has done in Afghanistan and now what it is  bumbling towards in Ukraine. We have got to get answers.   Why is it that commanders on the ground warn over and over that  disaster is imminent and the White House does nothing? Why is it that  the White House and the State Department denied a request for a  civilian evacuation? Why is it that we are still here all these months  later, and the only answers we can get are from leaked reports in the  press? Why has not this body done its job to conduct rigorous and  serious oversight hearings in public for the American people to see?   I will come to this floor and insist on regular order, insist that  this body do its job and vote on Defense Department nominees until we  get accountability, until there are public hearings, and until we can  learn what actually happened in Afghanistan and who is responsible.   I will tell you this: I wasn't alive for Vietnam, but I am not  willing to participate in the kind of coverup that happened for years  in the Vietnam war. I am not willing to kick this oversight  responsibility off to some Commission that won't report for years from  now most of its findings, probably in a classified annex. And by that  point, somebody will say: Oh, well, it is just too late to do anything  about it.   The American public was lied to for years on the Vietnam war. It has  been lied to for years on Afghanistan. It is time to get answers. So,  yes, I will be here insisting on those answers, insisting on oversight,  and insisting on accountability until we get it. Until that time, it is  not too much to ask the Senate to do its job.   I believe the majority leader said just the other day that the Senate  is here to vote; that is what the Senate is here to do. Well, that is  an apt phrase, and for once, I agree very much with the Senate majority  leader.   For those reasons, I object.
