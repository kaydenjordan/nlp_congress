 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my  strong support for the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the  next Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Few individuals over  the last century have impacted the American legal discourse as  profoundly as the late Justice Antonin Scalia.   In the wake of his untimely passing last February, Justice Scalia  left behind a legacy of faithfully applying the law and upholding the  principles of our Constitution. Judge Neil Gorsuch is a worthy  successor to Judge Antonin Scalia.   Judge Gorsuch understands the protections granted in the  Constitution, including the separation of powers, federalism, and the  Bill of Rights. He knows that the Constitution provides Americans with  an indispensable safeguard against government overreach.   His past opinions demonstrate that he will honor constitutional  protections afforded through due process, the right to bear arms, equal  protection under the law, and religious freedom.   Legal experts from across the political spectrum are very much in  agreement with the Gorsuch nomination. The American Bar Association's  Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously gave Judge  Gorsuch the highest possible rating of ``well qualified'' for the  Supreme Court. I couldn't agree more.   One of Judge Gorsuch's associates, the chief judge of the Tenth  Circuit who served with Judge Gorsuch, has said about him:         Judge Gorsuch brings to the bench a powerful intellect       combined with a probing and analytical approach to every       issue. He brings to each case a strong commitment to limit       his analysis to that case--its facts, the record, and the law       cited and applicable. He does not use his judicial role as a       vehicle for anything other than deciding the case before him.    President Obama's former Solicitor General Neal Katyal penned an op- ed in the New York Times supporting Judge Gorsuch and wrote:         I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help       restore confidence in the rule of law.        His years on the bench reveal a commitment to judicial       independence--a record that should give the American people       confidence  [[Page S2160]]       that he will not compromise principle to favor the president       who appointed him.    Those are the words of the Solicitor General who argued on behalf of  President Obama's administration in front of the Supreme Court.   Judge Gorsuch has been through the confirmation process before--as we  have heard many times on this floor--when Senators, some of them in  this body today, approved his nomination to the Court of Appeals for  the Tenth Circuit without opposition.   I was privileged to meet with Judge Gorsuch several weeks ago, and it  was clear to me through our conversation, a thorough examination of his  record, and watching last week's hearing in the Judiciary Committee  that Judge Gorsuch will decide cases fairly, based on our Constitution  and laws. Isn't that the way it should be? This is what West Virginians  expect from a Supreme Court Justice.   Newspapers in my State have recognized this nominee's strong  qualifications of independence and respect for the rule of law. The  Charleston Daily Mail editorialized:         Gorsuch has strong legal credentials and deserves to be       confirmed.        He is the kind of pick that any president should make,       Democrat or Republican, because of his proven qualities       necessary for any justice: a strong understanding and respect       for the nation's founding document, the U.S. Constitution.    The Wheeling Intelligencer and News Register wrote:         During hearings last week, Gorsuch's suitability for a high       court post was made abundantly clear.        He is precisely the type of judge--faithful to the       Constitution not ideology on specific issues--the nation       needs.    And the Martinsburg Journal said:         Gorsuch seems to believe in using the plain language of the       Constitution to decide cases, regardless of his own       preferences.        That--someone who believes only the people not the courts       can change the Constitution--is precisely the type of Supreme       Court justice we Americans need.    The American people benefited from an open and transparent Supreme  Court process that led to Judge Gorsuch being nominated.   During the 2016 Presidential election, both candidates were  transparent about the type of Supreme Court Justice they would appoint  if elected. President Trump released a list of 21 names, a list that  included Judge Gorsuch, and promised voters that he would fill this  Supreme Court vacancy with someone from that list. Voters paid  attention.   According to an NBC News exit poll, 70 percent of voters said the  selection of a Supreme Court Justice was either the most important  factor in their vote for President or an important factor. Let me state  that again--70 percent.   The American people weighed in, and President Trump acted wisely in  selecting Judge Gorsuch. He is a mainstream judge who is well qualified  for the U.S. Supreme Court.   Unfortunately, the Democratic leader has indicated that his party  intends to engage in an unprecedented partisan filibuster of this  nomination. A filibuster of a nominee of this caliber would be a  tremendous mistake, I believe, that would harm the Senate as an  institution. There has never been a Supreme Court nomination that has  been defeated by a partisan filibuster of the type that the Senate  Democrats are telegraphing. It is one thing to vote against a nominee  on whatever grounds a Senator may wish, but it is quite another to  filibuster in an effort to block a nomination that has been submitted  by a duly elected President who has the support of the majority of the  Senate.    Senators have always enjoyed the ability to filibuster nominations.  That ability has remained available because Senators have shown  restraint in applying the power that comes along with requiring  unlimited debate. The clear tradition of the Senate--and this is a body  of tradition, I have learned--over the course of its 230 years of  history is a confirmation by a majority vote. That tradition has been  demonstrated in recent Supreme Court nominations.   President Obama nominated both Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan to the  Supreme Court. Neither Justice Sotomayor nor Justice Kagan faced a  filibuster in the Senate.   President George W. Bush nominated John Roberts as Chief Justice.  There was no filibuster attempt against that nomination.   President Bill Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen  Breyer to the Supreme Court. Neither faced a filibuster.   President George H.W. Bush nominated David Souter and Clarence Thomas  to the Supreme Court. Neither Justice faced a filibuster even though 48  Senators voted against the Thomas nomination.   One recent Supreme Court nomination did require a cloture vote when a  group of Democrat Senators attempted to block a vote on the nomination  of Justice Alito's nomination, but a large majority of Senators--72, in  fact--invoked cloture, which preserved the bipartisan practice of  rejecting filibusters against Supreme Court nominees. Among those who  rejected the Alito filibuster in 2006 were the two Democratic Senators  from my State--Senator Robert C. Byrd and Senator Jay Rockefeller.  There were 72 Senators who voted to invoke cloture on Justice Alito's  nomination, but only 58 ended up voting for the final confirmation.   The Senate has a very clear history of rejecting the use of the  filibuster on Supreme Court nominations, but there is no justification  for a filibuster on the Gorsuch nomination. Neil Gorsuch is a  mainstream judge with the highest possible rating from the American Bar  Association. He was confirmed by the Senate, without objection, in the  year 2006. His service on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has earned  him the respect of his judicial colleagues, and he has demonstrated the  independence and respect for the law that the American people expect  from a Supreme Court Justice. I hope that at least eight of my  Democratic colleagues will join us regardless of how they, ultimately,  will vote on Judge Gorsuch's confirmation. I hope they will recognize  the need to invoke cloture on this nomination.   The Senate will confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. For the  good of the Nation and for the good of the Senate, there should be no  filibuster of this well-qualified nominee.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
