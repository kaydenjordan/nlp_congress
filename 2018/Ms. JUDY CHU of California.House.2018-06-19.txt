 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, according to the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, more than 42,000 Americans died from opioid-related drug  overdoses in 2016. That is five times more than the overdose rate in  1999.   As we have heard from countless Members in this Chamber, there is no  congressional district that hasn't been impacted by the opioid crisis.  No town or city is immune from the devastating impact of addiction, and  I hope that the steps we take today are the first of many to address  the needs of our communities.   The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or  SAMHSA, estimated that in 2016, 11.8 million Americans over the age of  12 had misused opioids in the past year and 3.8 million were currently  misusing prescription pain relievers.   But while we are seeing news reports of the devastating toll this  crisis is taking on our Nation's young people, it is important to note  that our seniors are also suffering. From 2005 to 2014, individuals 65  years and older experienced an 85 percent cumulative increase in  opioid-related inpatient stays and a 112 percent cumulative increase in  emergency department visits, the largest increase of any age group.   Compared to other age groups, individuals 65 and older have the  highest rate of opioid-related inpatient stays in 13 States, including  my home State of California.   This crisis is especially acute for the nonelderly Medicare  population. In 2015, nonelderly Medicare beneficiaries, or those who  qualify on the basis of disability, had opioid utilization rates more  than twice that of elderly beneficiaries.   The bill before us, H.R. 6110, contains numerous provisions aimed at  improving access to treatment for Medicare beneficiaries suffering from  opioid use disorders, including access to nondrug opioid alternatives.   While every alternative will not work for every person, when dealing  with a crisis of this magnitude, I believe that we must use every tool  in the toolbox.   This bill contains two bipartisan provisions I authored with my  colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski) for  working with me on language that would direct CMS to study barriers to  patient access to nondrug alternatives for opioids in chronic care  settings.   Studies conducted by the NIH have concluded that alternative  treatments, like acupuncture, can be effective in treating conditions  like chronic pain. This issue is very important to me, because I have  been working to expand access to acupuncture since I first arrived in  the California State legislature many years ago. I have heard firsthand  what a difference acupuncture can make in the lives of patients.   I remember very clearly when I heard the testimony of a woman who had  severe back pain, but did not want invasive surgery and risk possible  addiction to morphine.                                time  1545    Instead, she sought acupuncture, and it worked for her. She avoided  the risks associated with surgery and certain pain medications.   Furthermore, we know access to physical and occupational therapy also  helps alleviate pain and eliminates the need for an opioid  prescription.   By asking CMS to examine where barriers to these alternatives exist,  we can open the door to more treatment alternatives for beneficiaries.   I am also proud that this bill includes a provision I authored with  the gentlewoman from North Dakota (Mrs. Noem) to address the need for  more psychologists in the Medicare program. This bill would direct the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to examine ways for  beneficiaries to familiarize themselves with coverage for psychologist  services and request a study from the General Accountability Office on  the viability of mental and behavioral health services in the Medicare  program.   As one of only two psychologists in Congress, I firmly believe that  expanding access to psychologist services in Medicare is one of the  most important things we can do to improve the mental health of our  senior population.   We know that those who suffer from depression or other mental health  disorders are particularly vulnerable to addiction. For those who have  already taken the incredibly difficult step of seeking treatment, we  need to ensure that they have access to the full range of mental health  professionals who can support them on the journey to recovery.   H.R. 6110 also contains a number of provisions from my colleagues on  the Ways and Means Committee. Congress Members Levin and Marchant  authored a provision to review certain Medicare payments in outpatient  settings to determine whether there are financial incentives in the  Medicare program to use or prescribe opioids instead of evidence-based,  nonopioid alternatives.   Next, the legislation includes a provision introduced by Congress  Members Sanchez and Roskam that would direct the Secretary of HHS to  evaluate the extent to which Medicare Advantage programs offer  medication-assisted treatment, or MAT, and cover nonopioid alternative  treatments not otherwise covered under traditional Medicare as part of  a supplemental benefit.   Finally, this bill would also include a provision from Congress  Members  Danny Davis and Rothfus that would provide grants to federally  qualified centers and rural health clinics to help offset the cost of  training providers to become certified in dispensing medications for  opioid abuse dependence.   While the provisions in the bills before us this afternoon will  certainly move us in the right direction, we cannot stop here. For  example, the Medicaid program pays for the majority of mental health  and substance abuse treatments in this country and, yet, we see  multiple attempts by Republicans over the past 4 years to slash this  program.   We must maintain protections for those with preexisting conditions so  that those who sought treatment for their addiction disorders are not  punished for trying to get sober.   We must maintain the progress we have made with the Affordable Care  Act and work together to bring down the premiums for American families  so that, should they need coverage for mental health counseling or  substance abuse treatment, no one is shut out because of how much money  they make or what State they live in.   So I hope that today represents the first step, and I hope my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle will continue to work with us  to invest in prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts all across the  country.   I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged to see my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle turn their attention to this critical issue. But this is  not a new problem, and the coverage expansions under the Affordable  Care Act have been among the most significant steps the Federal  Government has taken to stem the tide of the opioid crisis. And yet,  Republicans in Congress and President Trump have actively worked to  repeal this landmark law.   The Medicaid expansion and the increased coverage under the  individual market have provided millions of Americans access to health  insurance, and research has shown that Medicaid expansion States have  seen a greater reduction in deaths from opioids than nonexpansion  States.   Again, Medicaid is the biggest payer for substance use disorder  treatment in this country. We simply can't afford to go back.   As we discuss this crisis today and in the week to come, we must  broaden our understanding of the ways in which we, as a Nation,  approach chronic pain. That is exactly what H.R. 6110 does.   While there will always be patients who have a legitimate need for  these medications, we need to look beyond a system where an opioid  prescription is  [[Page H5254]]  the automatic default. This means we need to look to alternative  methods of treating pain, whether it be acupuncture or physical therapy  or a medical device. It means we must examine existing policies that  may have inadvertently incentivized opioid prescribing practices.   But as much as we look forward, we must also address the crisis in  front of us. So I am thrilled to see provisions in this bill that would  study Medicare Advantage plans already doing groundbreaking work in  substance abuse disorder treatment.   I am also glad to see that this bill provides direct resources to the  front lines in the form of grants for federally qualified health  centers to provide additional training for our providers.   I hope that, in the future, we will work to expand access to  alternatives, both within the Medicare program and in the broader  population, and ensure that no matter where someone lives or what kind  of insurance coverage they have, they are able to seek treatment.    I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6110, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I offer my support for H.R. 5774, the COACH Act, which  was introduced by Congress Members DelBene and Curbelo.   This bill focuses specifically on provider education and would  require the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to develop a  toolkit that provides best practices to hospitals for reducing opioid  use.   Every year, approximately 51 million Americans undergo inpatient  surgery each year, and 80 percent of those patients receive opioids to  treat postsurgical pain after a low-risk surgery. This is an alarming  number, as studies have found that an opioid prescription at discharge  is an independent risk factor for chronic opioid use. In fact,  according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, approximately 10  percent of patients who are prescribed opioids for long-term use  develop an opioid use disorder.   This was the case with my constituent Ryan Hampton, who was a  promising young college student when he broke his knee in a hiking  accident and received an opioid prescription at discharge. Ryan fell  hard into addiction, eventually turning to heroin and becoming  homeless.   While Ryan has beaten the odds and is now a national advocate for  those in recovery from addiction, many are not so lucky. So it is with  people like Ryan in mind that I support this bill today.   We should be giving our providers every tool possible to help them  battle the opioid crisis and, hopefully, change behavior in such a way  as to limit unnecessary opioid prescriptions.   In my district, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health,  Substance Abuse Prevention and Control program has worked with  hospitals, plans, cities and providers to develop a 5-year strategic  plan to address the opioid crisis in our country.   We know that not every hospital has the resources or ability to  develop such a plan. By providing a centralized toolkit available to  all hospitals, under-resourced providers will have the best access to  best practices that have helped communities combat the opioid epidemic.   With so many individuals first experiencing opioids via a hospital  procedure, it is critical that we give our providers every resource  they need to make the best medical decisions for their patients while  reducing the number of opioid prescriptions overall.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1600     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I offer my support of H.R. 5775, the PROPER Act. This  bill, introduced by my colleagues Representatives Paulsen and Kind,  would require Medicare Advantage and Medicare part D plans to provide  information to beneficiaries on the risks associated with prolonged  opioid use, as well as coverage information about alternatives, like  nonpharmacological therapies, devices, and nonopioid medications.   It is important to ensure that our providers in hospitals and  outpatient settings have up-to-date and accurate information about  opioid use. But it is equally critical that this information is  provided to beneficiaries.   Additionally, providing information on coverage of alternative  therapies could help beneficiaries who may want to try a nonopioid pain  management therapy to do so, thus avoiding a prescription where it may  not be necessary.   This bill also requires that by January 1, 2019, all pain-related  questions be removed from the hospital consumer assessment of  healthcare providers and systems survey, with some exceptions.   If hospitals are graded on how much pain patients are feeling, they  likely would seek to minimize the patient's pain through pain  management drugs like opioids.   In order to properly address this crisis in the Medicare program, we  must ensure that beneficiaries have the information necessary to make  informed decisions about their pain management plan.   Madam Speaker, just as we are working to improve provider education,  we must not leave our Medicare beneficiaries behind.   I support this bill because it would ensure that Medicare Advantage  and Medicare part D plans provide their beneficiaries with information  on the risks of prolonged opioid use, as well as information about  coverage for alternatives for pain management.   Earlier in this debate, I mentioned a woman who testified that  although she was experiencing severe back pain, she did not want to  risk taking addictive pain medication and instead turned to  acupuncture. It worked for her, and she told me that because of her  acupuncture treatment, she was able to live pain free.   Now, this is not to say that every alternative will work for every  patient, but we should give patients the ability to choose their own  pain management therapy. I believe H.R. 5775 is an important step  toward this goal.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 5773, the PASS Act,  introduced by Congress Members Sewell and Roskam.   This bill focuses on policies to help Medicare plans prevent opioid  use in the Medicare program without limiting access to needed  medications for our seniors.   First, H.R. 5773 requires that Medicare prescription drug plans  establish mandatory lock-in programs for seniors who are at risk of  opioid overuse.                                time  1615    These programs curb fraud, abuse, and misuse of prescribed  medications, while at the same time ensuring that seniors who have  legitimate need of these medications can access them.   For example, these controls prevent doctor and pharmacy shopping and  will prevent duplicative and medically inappropriate drug therapies  that can lead to prescription drug abuse. This bill would also require  that any beneficiaries who are at risk for opioid overuse be eligible  for the benefits provided under the Medication Therapy Management  Program.   This program helps patients understand all of their medications and  how they are working together. It allows a pharmacist or other health  professional to give beneficiaries a comprehensive review of all of  their medications and talk to them about any interactions, risks, or  side effects.   This bill would also include a provision introduced by  Representatives Mike Thompson and David Schweikert that would  streamline the electronic prior authorization system, which is meant to  ensure that certain drugs are covered by an insurer before the drug is  dispensed.   The PASS Act also includes a provision introduced by Representatives  Sewell and Renacci which streamlines communications between the Center  for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Medicare part C and D plans  regarding program integrity.   Finally, H.R. 5773 would direct the Secretary of the Department of  Health and Human Services to annually notify Medicare part D  prescribers who are identified as outlier prescribers compared to their  colleagues in their specialty and region. This has certain exclusions,  for example, patients receiving hospice care, but will be used to help  prescribers, who may not realize  [[Page H5261]]  that they are an outlier, to reevaluate their practices and make  adjustments before any harm is done.   I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Our country is truly facing a crisis when it comes to opioids, and  the Medicare population isn't immune from this. We must be careful in  our approach and ensure that the policies we enact in Congress don't  leave out those who have a legitimate medical need for these  medications, like those with cancer, those in hospice, or those with  genetic conditions like sickle cell disease.   H.R. 5773 is a modest step in the right direction, and I look forward  to continuing to work with my colleagues on ways to address the opioid  crisis within the Medicare program.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 5676, the SENIOR  Communities Protection Act.   The Affordable Care Act granted the Department of Health and Human  Services the authority to suspend payments to Medicare's part A and B  providers pending investigations into credible allegations of fraud or  abuse.   The SENIOR Communities Protection Act would grant that same authority  to Medicare part D plans. This bill would only allow plans to suspend  these payments if doing so would not cause an access or network  adequacy problem for the beneficiaries served by the pharmacies or  hinder any law enforcement efforts.   This change would give Medicare an additional tool to help crack down  on bad actors who put seniors at risk. For example, this could help  plans and Medicare crack down on the practice of  [[Page H5263]]  pill dumping, where a small pharmacy receives millions of opioid pills  from a distributor that far exceeds the population of patients it  serves.   In one case, it was found that a single small town pharmacy received  the equivalent of more than 9,000 pills per resident over the course of  a decade. In another case, an opioid distributor shipped 9 million  pills to a town of 406 residents over just a 2-year period. That is an  average of 717 pills per person per year.   While opioid distributors are required to report suspicious activity,  congressional investigations have revealed that distributors did not  perform sufficient oversight of these shipments. As our communities are  flooded with these drugs, it is important that Medicare plans have the  ability to stop the bad actors when they are identified.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, a 2017 report from the Office of the Inspector General  of the Department of Health and Human Services found that about 70,000  seniors on Medicare received prescriptions for what the report  described as an extreme amount of opioids during a single year. This  means that these seniors were receiving 2.5 times the level the Centers  for Disease Control recommends for patients with chronic pain. Another  22,000 beneficiaries were identified as doctor shopping, which means  that they received a high number of opioids from multiple prescribers  and pharmacies. The opioid crisis is not exclusive to young people.   That same OIG report found that one-third of Medicare part D  beneficiaries received an opioid prescription in 2016, which is about  79.4 million prescriptions. While there are certainly individuals who  have a legitimate need for these drugs, H.R. 5676 will help Medicare  part D plans crack down on the bad actors who are flooding our  communities with excessive opioid pills.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 5723, the Expanding  Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act.   As I mentioned earlier, 80 percent of low-risk surgery patients  receive an opioid prescription to treat their postsurgical pain. These  prescriptions are certainly necessary for many patients, but with such  a high percentage, we must examine if Medicare payment policies are  ultimately discouraging the use of nonopioid alternatives.   This bill, introduced by Representatives Suzan DelBene and Claudia  Tenney, would require the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or  MedPAC, to submit a report to Congress detailing how Medicare  reimburses pain management treatments in a hospital setting. This  report will also examine what incentives exist in the inpatient  prospective payment system and outpatient prospective payment system  for overprescribing and how prescribing data is tracked and monitored  in Medicare claims.   This crisis was not created in a vacuum, and it will take efforts  from all aspects of the healthcare system to find a solution, including  examining how our hospital payment policies have pushed providers  towards prescribing such addictive medications.   I support H.R. 5723 and efforts to determine which policies within  Medicare, if any, have contributed to this opioid epidemic. I am also  strongly supportive of the directive within this report to realign  payment policies to increase access to nonopioid alternatives for pain  management.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I must reiterate that while I support the efforts of  this bill to direct MedPAC to examine which structural policies within  Medicare are contributing to this opioid crisis, I believe that we need  to do more than study the problem. We need to dedicate resources to  fixing it.   We need to invest in longer treatment programs and comprehensive  recovery programs that provide safe housing, peer support, and mental  health services. And while we should absolutely examine the policies  that brought us to this crisis in the first place, we need to do more  to find long-lasting solutions.   So I implore my colleagues today to ensure that this package of bills  is not the end of the discussion. I hope to see more hearings, more  proposals, and more testimony from experts on how we can enact Federal  policies that will save lives.   I hope that instead of attacking our existing healthcare system,  Republicans work with Democrats to improve the Affordable Care Act,  increase access to coverage, work to bring down premiums, and invest in  the public health of our Nation. Addiction is a disease, not a choice.  I look forward to working with my colleagues from both sides of the  aisle to eradicate this disease from our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
