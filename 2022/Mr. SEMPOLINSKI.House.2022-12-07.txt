 Mr. Speaker, I rise because of my concern with the  havoc that President Biden and the congressional Democrats' soft-on- crime policies are wreaking on our country.   This administration's approach to crime has only emboldened criminals  who exploit these weaknesses.   In a recent poll, Gallup found 56 percent of Americans think local  crime has increased, which is more than any time in the past five  decades.   I come from a primarily rural district, and unfortunately, we have  not been immune from this rise in crime. Members of my community are  concerned for their family's safety.   Failed ideas like so-called bail reform, defunding the police, and  putting violent offenders back onto our streets have created a powder  keg.   According to a recent study by Just Facts, if homicide rates were to  continue at the rate of increase in President Biden's first year in  office, over your lifetime, the chance of your life ending by homicide  is 1 in 179.    We have tied the hands of our heroes in law enforcement while untying  the hands of criminals. We must act now to reserve these policies for  the safety and security of our communities.                            ____________________
