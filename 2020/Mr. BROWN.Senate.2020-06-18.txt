 Before Senator Portman and I do our unanimous consent, I  just can't believe what I heard.   Senator Grassley, going to the floor and talking about the media that  way, when his majority--they owe their majority to Rush Limbaugh and  FOX News, and they swear allegiance to a President of the United States  who has lied thousands of times and then attacks the media every time  they disagree with him or call him out, attacks the media as fake news,  is just shocking to me.    Mr. President, I want to thank my friend Senator Portman  and the rest of my colleagues who have been steadfast in their memory  and remembrance of Otto Warmbier, a young Ohioan, as Rob said, whose  life was cut short by the North Korean regime's awful human rights  abuses.   I take this moment to recognize--I never knew Otto, but I have gotten  to know his parents and his family, and I especially thank Cindy and  Fred for their advocacy in memory of their son and turning their grief  into something so positive for the country and for the world.   Last year, we worked together on sanctions legislation to send a  clear bipartisan signal that the United States is serious about  maintaining strong economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea to  give up its nuclear weapons and to stop its human rights abuses.   Those abuses took the life of Otto Warmbier. We must continue to  shine a  [[Page S3092]]  light on what the regime does to its own people and to others.   I thank Senator Portman for his leadership on this
