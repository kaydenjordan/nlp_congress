 Madam Speaker, I rise today to note an odd philosophy  that I have seen amongst my Democrat colleagues, and it is this: The  belief that if one regulation is good, then ten must be better. Of  course, that is not true, but it is actually worse than that. The Biden  administration is proposing 2,500 new regulations; they call this ``the  unified agenda.'' I am not sure what is unifying about suffocating  American businesses and workers under D.C. bureaucrats.   We are killing our economy by the death of a thousand cuts. Our  products will be more expensive, and that is if  [[Page H2992]]  their manufacturing isn't just immediately shipped off to China.   Biden said he wouldn't ban fracking outright, but will make it  impossible to build new projects, build pipelines, or export our clean  American natural gas that would decrease global carbon emissions.   These new regulations will take away our choices on healthcare,  encourage illegal immigration, discourage the enforcement of our  immigration laws, and more than that, this philosophy of regulate at  any cost will result in silly regulations like this: Reducing  disturbances to Hawaiian spinner dolphins from human interaction.   This is not how we govern.                            ____________________
