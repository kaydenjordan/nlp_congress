 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  for her leadership and for the time.   Today is, indeed, a historic day. It is a day that we will say to the  LGBTQ community across the land that you matter, that you count, that  the Equality Act will be the new law of this country. It is a basic  heralding of human decency.   America stands at a crucial crossroads in this generation's fight for  civil rights. We should not have to remind our Republican colleagues  that no one should ever be discriminated against because of who they  are, yet here we are.   Without the explicit Federal protection provided in the Equality Act,  the LGBTQ community is at risk of being marginalized, or worse, in the  workplace, housing, education, and even in the military.   This administration is seeking to make our LGBTQ families and friends  not just second-class citizens, but to deny them the fundamental  American rights etched into our Constitution.   Congress cannot erase hatred with legislation, but Congress has an  obligation to lead, to stamp out discrimination wherever it exists.   We can and must all rise for the LGBTQ community.    Madam Speaker, this is from volume I, page 6.   ``Summer 2016. Russian outreach to the Trump campaign continued into  the summer of 2016, as candidate Trump was becoming the presumptive  Republican nominee for President. On June 9, 2016, for example, a  Russian lawyer met with senior Trump campaign officials Donald Trump,  Jr., Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul Manafort to deliver what  the email proposing the meeting had described as `official documents  and information that would incriminate Hillary.' ''                                time  1645    ``The materials were offered to Trump Jr. as `part of Russia and its  government's support for Mr. Trump.' The written communications setting  up the meeting showed that the campaign anticipated receiving  information from Russia that could assist candidate Trump's electoral  prospects, but the Russian lawyer's presentation did not provide such  information.''   Testimony of Colin Stretch, the general counsel of Facebook. This is  in volume I, page 15.   `` `We estimate that roughly 29 million people were served content in  their news feeds directly from the IRA's,'' ' and that stands for the  Internet Research Agency's, `` `80,000 posts over the 2 years.' ''   The IRA is the Russian organization in which some 30 persons have  been indicted.   `` `Posts from these pages were also shared, liked, and followed by  people on Facebook, and, as a result, three times more people may have  been exposed to a story that originated from the Russian operation. Our  best estimate is that approximately 126 million people may have been  served content from a page associated with the IRA at some point during  the 2-year period.'   ``The Facebook representative also testified that Facebook had  identified 170 Instagram accounts that posted approximately 120,000  pieces of content during that time. Facebook did not  [[Page H3829]]  offer an estimate of the audience reached via Instagram.''
