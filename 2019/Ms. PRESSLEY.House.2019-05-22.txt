 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to  H.R. 1500 and in support of the Consumers First Act.   I also want to thank Chairwoman Waters for her leadership and her  stewardship in this endeavor.   I am proud to cosponsor this bill, which will return the Consumer  Bureau to its intended role as a nonpartisan consumer watchdog that  protects the interests of American taxpayers, not those of special  interests.   In 2017, the Urban Institute found that 71 million Americans had a  debt in collection on their credit report. Meanwhile, collectors  estimate they contact consumers more than a billion times a year--a  billion.   During the 2008 financial crisis, people lost homes, jobs, and hard- earned wealth. This crisis was the prime example of what can happen  when nobody is looking out for the consumers who are left to navigate a  financial system built to confuse, mystify, and capitalize on the most  vulnerable.   In response, Democrats created the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau, an agency with the sole mission of protecting consumers and  holding lenders accountable when they put profits over people.   In my home State of Massachusetts, 46 percent of those living in  communities of color have debt in collections compared to only 18  percent of residents in predominantly White areas.   We know that debt collectors engage in some of the most aggressive  tactics: harassing, berating, and even falsely threatening legal action  against vulnerable consumers.   My amendment would require the Director of the Consumer Bureau to  issue quarterly reports to Congress, including an analysis of  complaints submitted by consumers. The Consumer Bureau's complaint  database has been a crucial tool to monitor harmful industry trends and  agency enforcement efforts in defense of consumers.   Since the beginning of this administration, more than 62,000  consumers submitted complaints on harmful and unfair debt collection  practices. The Consumer Bureau, under Director Mulvaney and now  Director Kraninger's failed leadership, has returned zero--zero--relief  to harmed consumers.   My amendment will require the Director to report on the various  enforcement actions taken against these debt collectors because we  cannot afford to go back to the days in which consumers were left to  fend for themselves in a financial industry that was stacked against  them.   Information is power. The more information we have, the more power we  have to protect consumers from harassment.   Recently, the Consumer Bureau released a proposed debt collection  rule filled with carveouts and loopholes that would allow debt  collectors to more aggressively target and harass consumers through  emails and text messages.   My amendment would prohibit the Director from issuing further rules  that would essentially open the floodgates and allow collectors to  bombard consumers.   I urge my colleagues to stand with consumers and to support my  amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Yes, that is correct.    Madam Chair, how much time do I have left?    Madam Chair, I just think it is important to remind my  colleague across the aisle that consumers are being harassed  aggressively, and many of them did not even incur the debt for which  they are being harassed. So we need to close these loopholes.   The current rule is rife with loopholes and carveouts and will open  the floodgates for debt collectors to further bombard consumers. My  amendment will ensure that the Consumer Bureau continues to put  consumers first and protects them from relentless harassment. We simply  want this data to be accessible on a quarterly basis because it will  make it easier.   The Consumer Bureau is an independent agency, and it needs to  continue to operate as such. Under Dodd-  [[Page H4092]]  Frank, the Director is required to report to Congress annually, and the  GAO office is required to annually audit the agency's finances. The  efforts of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are intended to  weaken this agency.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, again, this is ultimately about honoring  the very mission of the Bureau, and that is to put consumers first.   I support H.R. 1500, and I urge all of my colleagues to support my  amendment, which will be a further effort to protect consumers and to  guard against the harassment that so many Americans are experiencing  every day.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the  significant cultural and economic contributions the Haitian diaspora  has made to America.   The month of May marks Haitian Heritage Month, an expansion of  Haitian Flag Day, which is celebrated annually on May 18. As the first  Black republic in the world to abolish slavery, the Haitian people  continue to demonstrate patriotism, resilience, sacrifice, love, and  Haitian pride.   Last weekend, I joined my Haitian brothers and sisters in the  Massachusetts Seventh for a Flag Day celebration in Randolph and a  Haitian-American Unity Parade in Mattapan. We waved this flag,  shouting, ``Haiti,'' and, ``Unity is strength,'' ``L'union fait la  force.''   Massachusetts Seventh is one of the most diverse districts in the  country, and the Haitian diaspora is a fundamental part of our  district. We have the first-in-the-Nation Haitian-Creole pre-K dual  language program at the Toussaint L'Ouverture Academy. We have some of  the most influential Haitian leaders in the country, like Marie St.  Fleur, Linda Dorcena Forry, Jean Bradley Derenoncourt, Natacha Clerger,  and Eunice Zeigler, to name a few.   With many Haitian Americans contributing to our economy and society,  they deserve more than TPS renewal. They deserve a pathway to permanent  residency. Haitian Americans and the Haitian-American United network  have made significant contributions to this country for decades. They  are owed residency.   We must continue to affirm the dignity of Haitian Americans and to  demand that this administration see their humanity.                            ____________________
