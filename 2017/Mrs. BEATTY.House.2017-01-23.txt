 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Stacy  Plaskett, for leading tonight's Special Order hour, joined by her  cochair, Congressman Marc Veasey, and also my classmate.   Let me say to our chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr.  Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Cedric Richmond for bringing this  Special Order hour here tonight. So much has been said already. But let  me say how honored I am to join my colleagues as we address and talk  about ``A Response to President Trump's Inaugural Address and New Deal  for African Americans.''   Like so many of my colleagues tonight, Mr. Speaker, and the countless  Americans who are watching at home, I remain deeply concerned and  troubled about several of the statements that Mr. Trump made and also  about the stances of Mr. Trump's Cabinet members, comments about  minorities and women and immigrants, and, of course, comments about our  own colleague Congressman John Lewis.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, in Trump's inaugural address, he did  nothing to ease those concerns or to unite us. On the contrary, all I  heard on Friday was another campaign speech of more of the same  divisive rhetoric and recycled ideas from his campaign trail, ideas  like the new deal for Black America that he mentioned on the campaign  trail, a proposal that you have heard a lot about tonight that embraces  the same trickle-down economic assumptions that didn't work for African  Americans in the past and certainly won't work today.   Mr. Speaker, during his campaign speech, Trump talked about gangs  roaming the streets and how African American communities are being  decimated by crime. He went so far as to say, overwhelmingly, the  majority of Black people living in inner cities in the United States  are ``living in hell.''   Well, Mr. Speaker, I want President Trump to know that I am Black. I  grew up in the United States inner city, but I didn't live in hell. And  here I stand now, educated in the public schools, attended a  historically Black university and college, and I am a Member of the  United States Congress.   Mr. Trump said: ``We are one Nation--and their pain is our pain.  Their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success.''   He was referencing mothers and children strapped in poverty in our  inner cities. He was referencing rusted out factories scattered like  tombstones across the landscape of our Nation, and an education system  flush with cash but leaving our young students deprived of knowledge.   Well, Mr. Speaker, I want to see his plans for public education. I  want to see his plans for inner-city students. I want to see his plans  flush with all that cash that he talked about going into our public  schools. I want us to unite to help eradicate the cycle of poverty and  eliminate the too-often traveled pipeline from underperforming schools  to overcrowded prisons.   I want to see Mr. Trump's plan on criminal justice reform. I want a  fair Attorney General vetted and confirmed because they will stand up  every single day for equal rights of all Americans, for freedom of  speech, for freedom to vote, and much more--not an Attorney General who  lacks the ability to represent disenfranchised groups, not someone who  fails to champion the least of us.                                time  2115    I have not seen those things in nominee Sessions.   Lastly, I want Cabinet members who will be champions for our  seniors--people like my 92-year-old mother. I want Cabinet members who  will stand up for minorities and minority businesses. See, we need  greater assistance in minority businesses and funds for minority  business. I want Cabinet members who will build on and strengthen our  healthcare system--yes, to make it greater, not to take away health  care from 30 million people. Let me just say that I want to plan for  workforce development programs and reentry training programs for those  laid-off factory workers. I want to see plans for mothers and families  because we certainly know, when women succeed, America succeeds.   Yes, Mr. Speaker. I dare ask that women get equal pay for equal work.  I don't want recycled, failed policies that will do nothing to heal our  communities. I am proud to be a member of the Congressional Black  Caucus. We are the conscience of the Congress.   Let me end by saying that there are so many programs. We have a task  force on poverty, led by Congresswoman Barbara Lee. I won't repeat the  program that Assistant Democratic Leader Clyburn has already  introduced--the 10-20-30 plan.   Let me again thank my colleagues for bringing their powerful voices  to this floor.   Mr. Speaker, it is incumbent upon all of us to join the members of  the Congressional Black Caucus, the entire House Democratic Caucus, and  all Americans of every color--in standing up to President Trump and  continuing to let him know, as our preamble of the Constitution says-- to form a more perfect Union for all Americans.
