 ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of community pharmacies not only in my district, the Sixth District of  Tennessee, but across the country.   Late last week, I received this letter, notifying me that my  community pharmacy would no longer be in-network and that if I had any  future prescriptions filled at this pharmacy, I would have to pay  personally in full. This change would take place almost immediately.   Like most Americans, I have a years-long relationship with my  community pharmacy, Gordonsville Drugs, and my community pharmacist,  Amy Dudney.   But I was not part of a select few individuals to receive this  notification; there have been approximately 60 independent pharmacies  throughout Tennessee that recently found themselves out-of-network for  certain plans administered by the pharmacy benefit manager, CVS  Caremark.   This is not happening just in Gordonsville, Tennessee. Many Americans  have a community pharmacy like Gordonsville Drugs and a pharmacist like  Amy Dudney in their community.   Thankfully, due to sustained lobbying efforts by the independent  pharmacy community, CVS Caremark has reached out to many of these  pharmacies and offered them contracts to remain in-network.   However, letters like the one I received remain extremely damaging to  our independent pharmacies. In the specific case of Gordonsville Drugs,  although CVS Caremark made the right choice to keep the independent  pharmacy in-network, they have yet to send a letter with this updated  change to customers like me. CVS Caremark must commit to sending new  letters, notifying customers that they can continue to use their  neighborhood independent pharmacy with whom they have long-term  relationships.   We continue to let our community pharmacies be bullied by pharmacy  benefit managers like CVS Caremark, but we can't let this continue.  With winter upon us and the pandemic surging, there has never been a  greater need to ensure the viability of our community pharmacies.                            ____________________
