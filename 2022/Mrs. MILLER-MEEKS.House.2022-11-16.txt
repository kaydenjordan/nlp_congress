 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary life of Chuck Larson, or Charles Larson, Sr.   Chuck passed away earlier this month, surrounded by his family at the  age of 87. Chuck's life was dedicated to public service, serving both  in the military and in government. He was active in the United States  Army Reserves for 33 years, where he was a recipient of the Legion of  Merit award and retired as colonel.   Following his military service, Chuck worked with Iowa Governor Terry  Branstad as a member of his cabinet, served on Iowa's Board of Parole,  and served as the director of the Alliance on Substance Abuse.   Additionally, Chuck served under President Ronald Reagan and  President George H.W. Bush as the U.S. attorney for the Northern  District of Iowa.   I am grateful for Chuck's career in public service, and my thoughts  and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.                 Congratulating Todd Hafner on His Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Todd Hafner  for his retirement from William Penn University.   Todd has been the head coach of the football team at William Penn  University in Oskaloosa for the past 19 years. During his career, the  Statesmen had a winning record of 112-93-1, giving him the most wins of  any coach in the school's history. Under Todd's coaching, he won league  titles in 2010, 2012, and 2016.   Todd's accomplishments have not gone unnoticed by his colleagues. He  was named a three-time conference coach of the year, the Victory Sports  Network National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics coach of the  year, and the AFCA Region 2 coach of the year in 2010.   I thank Todd for his role in furthering William Penn's football  program, mentoring of young athletes, and his 19 years of success.                            ____________________
