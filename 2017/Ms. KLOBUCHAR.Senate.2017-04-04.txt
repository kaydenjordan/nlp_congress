 Mr. President, I come to the floor to join my  colleagues in speaking on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve  as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court. As you know, Senators  have a solemn obligation to advise and consent on a President's nominee  for the Supreme Court, and I take that obligation very seriously.   My goal during the hearing as a member of the committee was to  understand the judge's view on the law, his judicial record, and his  philosophy. We needed to know what kind of Justice he would be and what  that would mean for Americans.   Although many cases decided by the lower courts are less complicated,  even though some of them are complicated, many of them are more  straightforward than the ones that come before the Supreme Court. The  cases that go before the Supreme Court are the hardest cases. They  involve the most complicated legal gray areas.   I have heard my colleagues many times talk about some of the  unanimous decisions that the judge was involved in. I know that. But  when I look at the kinds of cases that come before the Supreme Court,  those are different kinds of cases. As I looked over the judge's  record, I tried to focus on situations where he faced hard cases like  those he might decide as a Supreme Court Justice. In my mind, the  question was this: What would Judge Gorsuch do if he were appointed to  the Supreme Court? What kind of philosophy would he have?   In difficult cases, one judicial approach is to try to find consensus  by ruling on the narrowest possible grounds. Judge Merrick Garland, who  was nominated last year, was known and praised for that approach by  Senators on both sides of the aisle.   Congress actually provides a helpful analogy. When Democrats and  Republicans pass legislation, we try to find common ground. We often  have different views, but we do find areas of consensus. Sometimes that  ground is narrow, but we can find agreement and then come together.  [[Page S2356]]    In reviewing the judge's record, I saw that he often took a different  approach, one where he often tried to go a step further than the  consensus opinion, sometimes really further than the consensus opinion  by suggesting a provocative change in the law or by making a broader  ideological leap, which I felt was not consistent with the precedent  and was not consistent with the kind of philosophy of a judge that,  regardless of their political beliefs--I did not expect to agree with  everything he said or how he answered the questions, but what I saw was  a strikingly different philosophy.   Many of the judge's opinions presented opportunities for narrow  judicial consensus, but the judge decided more than the case in front  of him. That is what concerns me if he were to be confirmed to the  Supreme Court, where he would have to decide the toughest cases and  hardest legal questions facing our country.   So after thorough examination and consideration of his answers and  the record, I have decided not to vote in favor of the judge's  nomination. His judicial approach and his record on critical cases,  including the rights of children with disabilities, campaign finance,  and preserving health and safety protections, have led me to conclude  that I cannot support his nomination to the Supreme Court.   Let me make this clear. Again, I did not expect to agree with every  opinion he wrote or everything he said. I certainly did appreciate the  introductions of the Presiding Officer, as well as Senator Bennet, and  the support he had from Colorado. That meant something to me. But then  when I looked at the record, what I saw time and time again was a judge  who clearly demonstrated the contrast between a narrow consensus-based  approach and a more far-reaching one.   One area where the judge has gone further to issue broad rulings that  would have profound consequences on people's lives is in the case he  decided on children with disabilities. During the hearing, because this  case had been decided by the Supreme Court right before I got to ask  questions, I asked a lot of questions about this case on the IDEA, also  known as the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act.   The IDEA was passed to ensure that students with the disabilities are  supported in school. In my State, 124,000 children rely on this  critical protection. I occupy the Senate seat once held by Minnesota's  own Hubert Humphrey--someone who, of course, was never at a loss for  words. In fact, this very desk that I am standing behind was the desk  Hubert Humphrey signed and used. He delivered a speech 40 years ago,  and one line of that speech is just as appropriate today as it was back  then.   He said: ``The moral test of government is how that government treats  those who are in the dawn of life: the children; those who are in the  twilight of life: the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of  life: the needy, the sick, and the disabled.''   The Supreme Court has honored that principle. On the day of the  judge's hearing, the Supreme Court, in an 8-to-0 unanimous decision,  ruled against the narrow interpretation of the IDEA embraced by Judge  Gorsuch--an interpretation that limited the educational opportunities  of children with disabilities. I could not agree with the 8-to-0  decision more.   All children, particularly those with disabilities, deserve the tools  they need to succeed in life, and every Justice on the Supreme Court  has a duty to protect these kids. So when the Supreme Court ruled that  morning and overturned the standard that the judge had embraced in this  Tenth Circuit case, I asked him about his ``merely more than de  minimus'' standard that he wrote into that opinion back in 2006.   In explaining his ruling, the judge said that he was bound by  precedent to use the narrow standard that he used in that case. He  cited a 1996 case from the Tenth Circuit--his circuit--that he said he  was bound to follow. Now, he was not on the court back in 1996, but  when he did the case in 2006, he used that 1996 case. So I looked at  that case.   During the hearing and at the Judiciary Committee business meeting  earlier this week, my Republican colleagues repeated those words. They  said that the judge was bound by precedent to use his narrow, ``merely  more than de minimus'' standard that had, in fact, been rejected by the  Supreme Court just this past month. So I looked to see if, in fact,  that was true. Was he truly bound by precedent? That is pretty  important to me. There have been a number of decisions where he has  gone much further than he needed to, where he, in my mind, has  abandoned precedent.   I thought, well, here we have a case that is fresh, right before us,  and he has said that he was simply following the precedent, that he had  no choice at all. Here is what I found: While the 1996 case made a  number of findings and concluded that the school district satisfied the  requirement in the IDEA statute of providing an appropriate education,  the case never actually turned on the standard that the judge said he  was bound by, that the judge said was precedent. Here is why: The 1996  case only mentioned the de minimus standard once. It was a passing  reference. Even in that mention, the de minimus language is from a  different circuit; it was from the Third Circuit.   In that 1996 case that he claimed he was bound by and that my  Republican colleagues keep mentioning that he was bound by, there is no  discussion about whether the benefits provided to the high school  student satisfied that standard. The case simply did not turn on the de  minimus language. I know this seems in the weeds, but the court in 1996  never relied on the de minimus standard to reach the result that it  did.   Was that enough? No. In the one passing mention in the 1996 case,  which was not binding, the language actually says ``more than de  minimus,'' but the judge went out of his way to add the word ``merely''  to that standard, which had never even been in the case that was not  binding on him to begin with. So he changed it and said ``merely more  than de minimus,'' that that is all the kind of education a kid with  disabilities in that school district in Colorado would have to get.  This is like if you say more than empty--the gas tank is more than  empty, which means it could be a lot more than empty. Adding ``merely''  puts it closer to empty. You just say it is merely more than empty. The  addition of a single word made it more difficult for children with  disabilities to get help at school.   That is why it is hard for me to understand why the judge said that  the ``merely more than de minimus'' standard was binding on him when he  wrote that opinion in 2006. It was not. He added the word ``merely,''  and then he used a standard that did not even decide that 1996 case;  that was from a different circuit.   When interpreting the IDEA, the judge once again went a step further  instead of deciding the case on a narrow ground. That matters because  decisions like this have a dramatic impact on the lives of children and  families, which is exactly what Justice Roberts noted when he wrote the  opinion 8-to-0 rejecting the standard that Judge Gorsuch had used.   I have heard from families in my State, and so many of them tell me  how IDEA has made a real difference for them.   My mom taught second grade in the Minnesota Public Schools until she  was 70 years old. I know from her how much she worked with those kids  with disabilities and how much she cared about them.   Here is an example I just learned about from my State. A mom from  Watertown, MN, told me about her son, who was born with Down syndrome.  She is so thankful for IDEA because its protections ensures that he can  have everyday life experiences. IDEA allows her son to be fully  integrated with the rest of the students in his school. As a result, he  has made many friends and built a strong social network. When she asks  her son whether he likes school, he always says, in a resounding voice:  Yes. Those are the stakes of this legal debate.   Second, I wanted to focus on campaign finance. In my view, one of the  most troubling court decisions in recent years is Citizens United.  Since Citizens United, dark money has been spent in extraordinary sums,  adding up to an estimated $800 million in just the past 6 years. This  continues to have an outsized influence on our politics, distorting our  representative democracy and hurting, in my mind, campaigns on both  sides of the aisle.  [[Page S2357]]    How does this apply to the judge? It applies to the judge because of  an opinion he wrote that is very relevant to this area of the law. That  case, which is called Riddle v. Hickenlooper, is a narrow case about  how campaign finance laws apply to certain kinds of contributions in  Colorado, about if they are a major party or not major party.   The judge again decided that a narrow consensus decision was not  enough. It was part of that decision, but then he went out of his way  to write a separate concurring opinion to suggest that the court  should, in fact, apply strict scrutiny to laws restricting campaign  contributions. If the Supreme Court adopted the approach in the judge's  opinion, it would compromise the few remaining campaign finance  protections that are still on the books, and it would make it even more  difficult for Congress to pass future reforms.   The notion that Congress has little or no role in setting reasonable  campaign finance is in direct contradiction with where the American  people are. In recent polls, over three-quarters of Americans have said  that we need sweeping new laws to reduce the influence of money in  politics. While polls may not be a judge's problem and should not be a  judge's problem, democracy is. When unlimited, undisclosed money floods  our campaigns, it drowns out the people's voices, and it undermines our  elections and shakes the public's trust in the process.   My colleagues and I repeatedly asked the judge about his views on  campaign finance laws and public disclosure requirements. He declined  to tell us what the proper legal standard would be for evaluating  campaign finance laws. He also would not give us a real sense of his  views on public disclosure of campaign contributions, although a  majority of current Justices support this.   During our exchange on campaign finance, I was reminded of Justice  Scalia's support for greater public disclosure and his comments on that  topic. Justice Scalia said:         Requiring people to stand up in public for their political       acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is       doomed. For my part, I do not look forward to a society       which, thanks to the Supreme Court, campaigns anonymously and       even exercises the direct democracy of initiative and       referendum hidden from public scrutiny and protected from the       accountability of criticism. This does not resemble the Home       of the Brave.    The most striking example of a judge choosing not to decide a case  narrowly based on the facts was the one last year in which he wrote the  opinion and then wrote a concurrence to his own opinion. As I noted at  the Judiciary hearing, it is better to write a concurrence to your own  opinion than write a dissent to our own opinion. But still he felt  compelled to write a concurrence to what was an opinion that he wrote.  Mostly, judges are happy when they get their peers to agree to a  decision, but in this case, he went a step further.   In Gutierrez--the name of the case--the judge went beyond the facts  to suggest overturning the long-established precedent of Chevron.   Chevron is a 33-year-old Supreme Court case that ensures that the  most complex regulatory decisions are made by the experts who are best  equipped to handle them, not by judges or lawyers without any relevant  technical knowledge.   Justice Scalia again embraced the Chevron doctrine, and it has been  used in more than 13,500 decisions. Chevron ensures that Federal  health, safety, and education rules stay on the books. These rules  protect everyone, from the hard-earned pension of an hourly Minnesota  grocery store worker, to the clean water in our Great Lakes, to the  difference between life and death for Minnesota iron ore workers.   The judge's approach would have titanic, real-world implications on  the daily lives of Americans. When the judge wrote an opinion that  suggested it might be time to ``face the behemoth,'' he suggested a  change in the law that would jeopardize countless rules, compromise  important protections, and create widespread uncertainty in our laws.   I asked the judge about the uncertainty that would result from  overturning Chevron. I asked what he would replace it with. I didn't  get a direct response. The judge even said that he ``didn't know what  all the consequences would be'' and that he ``wasn't thinking about  being a Supreme Court justice'' when he was writing the decision.   So what does all of this mean? It means that the judge has repeatedly  gone beyond the facts of the case, issuing separate concurrences with  far-reaching effects or, as in the disability decision, writing  opinions with profound consequences.   When I read these opinions, I am reminded of Justice Byron White, who  I know Judge Gorsuch clerked for and greatly admired. Justice White has  been described by many as a Justice who was focused on deciding only  the case in front of him. Here is a quote: ``Time and again, Justice  White avoided broad, theoretical bases for a decision, when a narrow,  fact-specific rationale would suffice.''   There is a reason we have judges to apply the law to the facts of a  case. It is because answers aren't always as clear as we would like  them to be, and sometimes there is more than one reasonable  interpretation of the law. The cases that get to the Supreme Court are  not the ones where everyone agreed at the lower court level. They are  the really hard cases.   It is that discretion in making those decisions that makes it so  critical that Justices interpret the law evenly, without fear or favor  and with the humility to recognize the gravity of the office, to  respect the role of the judiciary, and to understand the impact of  their decisions on people's lives.   As I look back at the judge's record and his answers in the hearing,  I am again reminded that it wasn't a law professor or a Federal jurist  who was helped by a court's reliance on Chevron in interpreting a Labor  Department rule. It was an hourly Minnesota grocery store worker who  got to keep his hard-earned pension after the Eighth Circuit Court  relied on Chevron.   When the Supreme Court stripped away the rules in the Citizens United  case that opened the door to unlimited super PAC spending, it was not  the campaign financiers or the ad men who get paid to write these ads  who were hurt. It was the grandma in Lanesboro, MN, who actually  thought it mattered when she sent her Senator a $10 campaign  contribution.   When Chief Justice Roberts wrote the unanimous opinion just this past  month, rejecting the ``merely more than de minimis'' standard that  Judge Gorsuch had used to limit the help kids with disabilities can get  at school, the Justice said: ``When all is said and done, a student  offered an educational program providing `merely more than de minimis'  progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an  education at all.'' That is what the Supreme Court said about how the  standard that Judge Gorsuch wrote in his opinion in the Tenth Circuit  affected students with disabilities.   In the end, I believe we need Justices who understand that the law is  more than a set of dusty books in the basement stacks of a law library.  It is the bedrock of our society. Above all, we need Justices who  understand and will uphold the motto on the Supreme Court building, to  ensure all Americans achieve ``Equal Justice Under Law.''   That is why I won't be supporting the judge's nomination to be an  Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.
