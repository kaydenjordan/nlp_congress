 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the  great State of Illinois for organizing this special session to talk  about what I consider to be the single most transformative piece of  legislation that we are considering right now, the PRO Act, the  Protecting the Right to Organize Act.   And why would it be so transformative? Because, as Representative  Garcia mentioned, inequality of wealth and income has grown to  proportions we have not seen in 100 years in this country.   From 1980 to 2014, income for the bottom half of earners, the whole  bottom half of American workers, grew 1 percent; whereas, income for  the top 1 percent grew 205 percent.   And why? Because workers have lost all voice and power in this  economy. Workers do not have the freedom to form unions.   At its high-water mark in the late forties and early fifties, a third  of American workers had collective bargaining, and they built the  middle class in this country over the post-war decades. Today, 6  percent of workers in the private sector--6 percent--have collective  bargaining, have unions, and so they have no real ability to get their  fair share of the American pie and to rebuild the American Dream.   The PRO Act would do so much to change this.   Truly, it reminds me of my days organizing nursing home workers, kind  of a long time ago, in the 1980s, in Michigan and Indiana and  Massachusetts and Rhode Island. It was so hard for workers to form a  union. Their employer could do almost anything, and that is true to  this day.                                time  1915    So, for example, your employer can make you go in a room, and if you  refuse to attend, they can fire you. And the sole purpose of the  meeting is to tell you how bad forming a union would be for both of  you. They can make you individually go into their office and tell you  that the union would be a bad thing.   This kind of intimidation tactic has led to a crisis in our economy.  And people like to talk about free markets and capitalism. All I want  to see is a free market for worker organizing in this  [[Page H9113]]  country. And all the best research suggests that if we really had one,  about a third of workers would, again, be in unions, and it would  completely transform the economy.   So let me just hit a couple of the things that the PRO Act would do  that would be so important.   First of all, it would recognize the realities of the 21st century  economy. Workers could organize and bargain with whatever companies  share control of their employment. So, hello, McDonald's franchises,  hello, Courtyard by Marriott. Any companies that have franchises, both  the franchisee and the franchisor could be joint employers.   Employers could not prevent workers from organizing and could not  avoid the responsibility for workers by misclassifying them as  independent contractors. That is rampant in today's economy. Employers  under the PRO Act would not be able to just call their workers  supervisors willy-nilly to deny them the right to organize. And  workers' rights to organize would be recognized in all the electronic  formats that we use to communicate today.   Another thing that is key is that at long last, the PRO Act would end  the right to freeload, a disease that has been spreading in this  country since the late 1940s that says that in our system, even though  a union has to represent all the employees in a workplace, it prevents  union employers from negotiating contracts that simply say that all the  workers have to pay their fair share for administering the contract. We  would end 60 years of efforts to destroy the labor movement simply by  allowing what I learned in law school as the freedom of contract. An  employer and a union are free to negotiate that all the workers pay  their fair share.   The list of improvements in the core area of an organizing campaign  is really impressive. Just to pick a couple of them.   Employers couldn't gerrymander the bargaining union to pick out who  is for or against the union, so to choose the voters in a sense.  Elections would have to happen much faster. If a worker is fired for  organizing a union, as I saw happen so many times, the NLRB would have  to go for an immediate injunction to get them reinstated. If the  workers felt intimidated by having an election on the employer's work  site, then the NLRB could have it at a neutral location. So many  commonsense things just to allow workers to organize freely.   So let me just sum up and say, I would love to talk about all the  provisions, but it would take me all night, and I want to yield to my  colleagues.   All we are asking for is that workers in this country have their  rights recognized across the globe in the international labor  organizations provisions so that they can have freedom of assembly,  freedom to organize, and freedom to bargain a contract. And,  Representative Garcia, that would do more to make our country more just  and beautiful than anything else we could do.   Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to stand up tonight for the PRO Act, and I  thank Representative Garcia for his leadership in making this happen.   Mr. GARCIA of ILLINOIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Levin for  sharing that story, his own personal knowledge and experience of  working to empower working people so that they have good wages, good  working conditions and very critically what is at the heart of the PRO  Act, organizing to have leverage to level the playing field and to  arrive at what is the best contract for workers in a worksite setting.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), who  happens to be the chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor.
