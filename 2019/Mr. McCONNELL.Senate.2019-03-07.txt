 Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the  desk due a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the measures on the calendar under  the provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceeding en bloc.    Mr. President, before I begin, I spoke yesterday about  the evil of anti-Semitism and the recent disturbing invocation of anti- Semitic stereotypes by a Member of the House Democratic Conference. I  took for granted, as a result, that the House Democrats would at  least--at least--make good on their plans to symbolically condemn anti- Semitism.   Even as I called for the House Democrats to do more and pass the  substantive foreign policy legislation the Senate sent them weeks ago,  I at least assumed a few pages of symbolism was not too much to ask  for, but alas, I spoke too soon. The House has put off consideration of  a resolution to condemn anti-Semitism. Apparently, even nonbinding  symbolism--this is all they were going to do--is too controversial  within their own caucus. Let me say that again. Apparently, within the  Speaker's new far-left Democratic majority, even a symbolic--symbolic-- resolution condemning anti-Semitism seems to be a bridge too far.   Well, I expect I and other Members will have more to say on this  subject, but for today I would let this speak for itself.                            ____________________     Now on another matter, already this week the Senate  has confirmed two more well qualified judicial nominees. Soon, Allison  Rushing and Chad Readler will take their respective seats on the Fourth  and Sixth Circuit Courts of Appeals, and later today the Senate will  vote on confirmation of Eric Murphy, also to the Sixth Circuit.  Together, these nominees bring decades of legal experience, prestigious  clerkships, and the recognition of their peers. They will be charged  with upholding the Constitution and the rule of law, and each is well  equipped to do exactly that.   Now, my colleagues need no reminder of Senate Democrats' historic  obstruction of nominations over the past 2 years. Under this  administration, 135 nominations have required a cloture vote--135  nominations have required a cloture vote--and five times more were  required during the first 2 years than in the same period of the last  six administrations combined--combined.   The final nomination we will consider this week captures what I am  talking about perfectly. John Fleming was nominated by the President to  serve as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development on  June 20 of last year. This is an Assistant Secretary of Commerce.   Mr. Fleming has an impressive record. When the Environment and Public  Works Committee first considered his nomination last summer, a  significant bipartisan majority voted to favorably report his  nomination. This is an Assistant Secretary of Commerce out of committee  on a bipartisan basis last summer, but partisan obstruction ran out the  clock. The nomination was sent back to the President at the end of the  Congress.   So earlier this year Mr. Fleming was resubmitted, returned to the  same committee, and was favorably reported by the same bipartisan  margin. But the obstruction still wasn't finished. Here  [[Page S1718]]  on the floor, I had to file cloture to ensure he would get a vote. I am  pleased that cloture could be withdrawn yesterday, and we will be happy  to vote on the confirmation today, just as happened last week on  another nomination, but I am sorry these cloture filings and wasted  time were needed for these uncontroversial and impressive nominees. I  am sorry the case studies of pointless obstruction just keep on piling  up.                            ____________________     Now on another matter, this week Democrats in the  House are expected to pass sweeping legislation I call the Democratic  politician protection act. It aims to give Washington, DC, vast new  control over elections, give tax dollars to political campaigns, and  give election lawyers more opportunities to determine the outcome of  our elections.   Today I want to discuss how it would open up the bipartisan Federal  Election Commission to a hostile partisan takeover.   When Congress passed and amended the Federal Election Campaign Act  after Watergate, the FEC was created as a six-member body, with an even  number of commissioners and no more than three from the same party. At  least four votes--four--would be required to take action--a built-in  safeguard against one party seizing control of the FEC.   Well, House Democrats want to get rid of that. Their Democratic  politician protection act would cut the FEC to a five-member body with  two members from each party and a nominal Independent who,  interestingly enough, would be handpicked by whoever the sitting  President was.   Now, people on both sides of the aisle used to see right through  these kinds of tricks. Back in 1976 Senator Alan Cranston--a California  Democrat who was, by the way, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate--warned  about this. He said: ``The FEC has such potential for abuse in our  democratic society that the President should not be given power over  the Commission.''   As recently as 2 years ago, an outgoing Democratic FEC commissioner-- one of the most active and liberal regulators in the Commission's  history said: ``I don't have a problem with the 3-3 split at the  commission . . . it was established that way in order to ensure that  there was not going to be a partisan effort to use investigations  against one political party or another.''   But now--now--Democrats want to scrap the neutrality and bring on the  partisan takeover. Democrats respond by saying this fifth member would  have to be affiliated with neither the Republican nor Democratic Party.  They would have to be an Independent.   Give me a break. Give me a break.   One current commissioner is nominally an Independent, except the  Washington Post reports this gentleman ``often votes with the  Democrats,'' and he happens to be a longtime friend of former Majority  Leader Harry Reid. He had actually previously worked as an election  lawyer for Senator Reid. This is the Independent on the FEC now. He had  often worked as an election lawyer for Senator Reid to help ensure he  won close elections. In fact, Senator Reid repeatedly slipped and  characterized this gentleman as the Democratic nominee several times  here on the floor.   This is our current Independent on the FEC?   So I think we all know what kind of Independent fifth commissioner a  Democratic President would select--one who would join with other  Democrats and champion the campaigns of the left, while bringing waves  of investigations, hearings, and subpoenas against their political  opponents and punishing groups who dared to disagree.   What is more, the Democratic Politician Protection Act would give the  sitting President the chance to name the Chairperson of the FEC,  abandoning the current practice of rotating Chairmen, and this person  would get broad new powers, like the sole authority to issue subpoenas  and to compel testimony and the ability to hire and fire the general  counsel with just two more votes from just one party.   So make no mistake, the Democrats are envisioning a hostile takeover  of the body that regulates political speech, designed to tilt the  playing field in their direction. Democrats claim this is necessary  because the current structure is ``dysfunctional.''   Well, let's look at some of the current dysfunction and where it is  coming from. Let's look at the Democrat who currently serves as the FEC  Chair. She has been a Commissioner for 16 years. In fact, her term  ended 11 years ago, but she has been held over ever since, and now this  seasoned veteran of the left's anti-speech crusade has announced that  she will bar the FEC's attorneys from defending the Commission when  liberal watchdogs come after it in court.   By unilaterally withholding her vote, she plans to make the FEC  essentially forfeit its legal fights against liberal groups by simply  not showing up. So the defendants in these matters would be out of luck  unless they happen to have the financial means to keep up their own  defense.   This Democrat Commissioner has also indicated that if this trick  doesn't produce the political outcome she is after, she is willing to  simply ignore subsequent court orders altogether. This is a current  member of the FEC.   So House Democrats are lecturing about dysfunction at the FEC, but it  is their ally who is now using her vote to tie the FEC's hands behind  its back.   Democrats and their allies claim Republicans are keeping the FEC from  enforcing campaign finance laws. That is their talking point for all of  these radical changes. But let's take a look at who is really refusing  to work within the law. The Democratic Chairwoman says she will keep  the FEC from defending itself and is threatening to disobey court  orders. That is my definition of dysfunction.   Democrats aren't after an FEC that enforces the law. They want an FEC  that advances their particular ideology. These current words and these  current antics prove it, and the Democratic politician protection act  would make it much, much worse.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
