 Mr. Speaker, in our conversation about gun violence, one  side sees the need for background checks. The other side prefers to  ``enforce the laws we already have.'' Yet we do not have universal  background checks, so we cannot enforce it. Meanwhile, our children are  exposed.   This year there have been 45 school shootings in 46 weeks, 370 mass  shootings by the end of October. That is more than one per day.  Something has got to give.   Senator McConnell said he will hold a vote on our background check  bill only if President Trump says he will sign it.   So let me address the President directly from the heart: Sir, I have  two granddaughters. Aubrey is eight; Ella is just one-month old. When  Aubrey attends terrifying active shooter drills, what would you have me  tell her? How about when she notices that we have laws barring certain  people from owning guns, but that much of the time we don't bother to  check who is who? Or when she realizes that her leaders could have put  basic lifesaving safeguards in place, and they chose not to, what shall  I say to her? What would you tell her?    President Trump, my granddaughters, your grandchildren need your  leadership, and so does America.
