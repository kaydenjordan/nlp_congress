 Mr. Speaker, this week is Infrastructure Week. With every  day that passes, the need for Federal infrastructure investment grows  more and more urgent. Robust and reliable infrastructure is the  foundation for economic success and security. But for too long, the  United States has underinvested in our infrastructure.   Today our bridges, our roads, our tunnels, our canals, and even our  dams are crumbling. It is so bad that the American Society of Civil  Engineers gives our Nation's infrastructure a grade of D. That is  really a shame.   All across this great country, our constituents are begging us to  rebuild America's infrastructure. Instead of that, the President has  put forth a plan that will sell off Main Street to Wall Street and his  rich friends.   Mr. Speaker, that is not going to work for the American people. My  colleagues and I have a trillion-dollar plan that will rebuild bridges  and roads. It would fix our airports and schools, and it would put 16  million people to work.   That is what the American people deserve.                            ____________________
