 Madam Speaker, I hereby remove my name as a cosponsor of  H.R. 3287.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to stand up here with my  friend and colleague, Representative Cliff Bentz of Oregon, as we both  go over in detail the dire situation currently happening in the Klamath  Basin in the area bordering northern California and southern Oregon  here, upper Klamath Lake.   So this has been an ongoing problem over several decades, really. In  March of this year, the Bureau of Reclamation, which oversees the water  in the Klamath Project promised that the growers there in the basin  would receive 130,000 acre feet of water. This on the heels of 2020  with a similar situation where the Bureau promised water to the growers  in the amount of 140,000 acre feet.   Now, this is of a total of a true water right of 390,000 acre feet  that is promised in the basin for the project. These are already big  cuts to what the original project intent was, with 390,000 acre feet,  and the amount that these folks have endured in cuts in recent years.   So when they made that initial March allocation, the Bureau followed  up in April, cutting that figure another 70 percent. Remember, 390,000  acre feet cut to 130,000. In April, they cut, additionally, 70 percent  more down to 33,000 acre feet. So that is 8 percent of the water the  irrigators would have been promised initially.   Last week, another cut was made, now down to just 3,000 acre feet. An  acre foot, for those scoring at home, is about 326,000 gallons, or the  amount of water it takes to cover 1 acre with a foot of water.   At that point, the 3,000-acre delivery, the Bureau has decided, is  not worth the effort to deliver into the district into the canals, et  cetera.   So basically what this means, in 2021, no water would flow to the  Klamath Project, this is for the first time since 1907, the headgates  of the A Canal would remain closed.                                time  2015    From June 1907 to May 2021, some amount of water has always flowed  into the Klamath project. From the upper lake here to the A canal. I  will show you more pictures later, Madam Speaker, on how the A canal  works to feed much of the district.   This area, of course, is populated by Tribes, descendants of  pioneers, frontiersmen, and veterans of World War I and World War II  who quite literally won a lottery to homestead in the footprint of Lake  Modoc.   The water hasn't always been enough, and a mountain of unpleasantries  have been shared over the allocation of this resource, but there has  always been water at least.   So, I would like to start the conversation on the Klamath going back  to the fundamental water rights. The first private ditch in the basin  was dug in 1868, and the few irrigation projects that were there at the  time were quite small. In 1882, the first bit of land within the  current project was irrigated. Authorized by Congress in 1905, it is  the second oldest project in the West. There are several hundred miles  of main canals, lateral canals, and drainage ditches, and 200,000 acres  of irrigated farmland across 1,400 farms. Excuse me, 27,000 irrigable  land in the lower Klamath, and to the Lake National Wildlife Refuge.   Today, it is over $200,000 worth of value in alfalfa, hay, wheat, and  potatoes, including the ones you would get at In-N-Out Burger french  fries as well as pasture.   In 1917, the rock sill between Upper Klamath Lake and the Link River  was lowered allowing more flows to agriculture areas and downstream  basins.   In 1921, the Link River Dam was completed allowing water to be  retained during spring peaks and increasing the total amount of water  in the lake.   After nearly 50 years of construction, the final piece of the project  was completed in 1964 with the Iron Gate Dam along the Klamath River,  one of four dams that are providing hydroelectric power and are  currently in peril, too, due to a fish passage issue.   In total, the project allows for nearly 600,000 acre-feet of water to  be stored.   So the Bureau of Reclamation has been making an incorrect claim for  quite a while to the Klamath project water. They have been involved, of  course, since Congress authorized the project in 1905. Every year, the  farmers in the basin spend about $30 million to maintain this project,  paying the government for that.   The Bureau has acted and operated the project and the head works of  the irrigation systems. In 1970 and 1973, Congress passed the National  Environmental Policy Act, known as NEPA, and the Endangered Species  Act, both well-intended. This legislation effectively requires,  according to interpretation, the bureau to prioritize the environment  over the well-being and economic security of humans. That is not the  original intent of Congress. This is what courts have ruled over the  years.   So the fish involved in the current issues are several species. The  Lost River sucker fish and the shortnose sucker only exist in the Upper  Klamath Lake. From 1984 to 1986, the sucker population began a steep  decline heading to their listing as endangered in 1988.   The biological opinions which heavily influence water decisions and  allocations coming out of the Upper Klamath Lake are the results of  Interior attorneys--longtime career attorneys--here in Washington, D.C.  So the recent biological opinions put out in the end of the Trump  administration were partly responsible for setting the record straight  and helping last year to get a little bit more water to the farmers, as  we had to rescue that situation in May in order to have their  allocation kept at 140,000.   So when the Lost River sucker was listed, two Klamath scholars  actually noted that no one seems to anticipate that the listing of the  sucker fish might have serious impacts on the operation of Klamath  Project, which the impacts economically to people are required as  originally part of the Endangered Species Act. That has all seemed to  have gone out the window.   Coho salmon is the other population of fish native to the Klamath  basin and adjacent rivers and rivers all up and down the West Coast.  Salmon populations have followed a general trend of decline that is  seen all across the Pacific Coast.   With all these populations, they are not just in the Klamath River,  so year after year, extra water flows down the Klamath River have been  used to deal with what is known as the C. shasta virus.   Now, there is a lot of debate whether these flows are actually  effective or  [[Page H2533]]  not. There are counter opinions that keeping the river wet and all  these flushes actually help propagate the virus instead of drying it  out and making the virus dry out basically on the vine.   Then there is a similar debate with the sucker fish in the lake that  a high level of water in the lake will cause them to be more subject to  predators in the lake where the lower level, since they are bottom  feeder fish and it is less conducive for the atmosphere for the  predators of those fish.   So it is seemingly going in opposite directions. But we also have  counter purposes for the Federal agencies that are regulating right  now, Fish and Game, Fish and Wildlife, that are trying to preserve the  deep lake for the sucker and at the same time they want to have the  flows go down the river to take care of the C. shasta virus for the  salmon--you can't do both--as well as have any water available for  agriculture, for the communities, and for the refuges for the wildlife.   So the irrigators despite their receiving no water, the Bureau still  plans to send 375,000 acre-feet downstream for salmon.   Now, let's get to what the water rights look like. In 1975, shortly  after NEPA and the Endangered Species Act went into effect, the Oregon  Water Resources Department began the process of detailing and  adjudicating the water rights of irrigators. Under Oregon law Chapter  539, it lays out the process of determining water rights before 1909,  when the water rights code in Oregon was initiated, and a large part of  this is on the Oregon side of the lake.   This process culminated in the 2013 Findings of Fact and Order of  Determination, which were then amended in 2014. Oregon water laws  uphold the rights of the irrigators and distributes water based on the  seniority of the claim.   So what are the ramifications for failing to deliver the water?   Now, there is still work to be done in reaffirming these property  rights, which at the time seemed to be ironclad, but everything is  fudgeable these days. So securing the property and water rights of the  basin will still continue to be a battle.   While we continue that fight, we must highlight the dire straits of  the basin today without water. The canals, the ditches, and the  irrigation districts are drying up. This will cause permanent damage to  the ditches and the irrigation system there. Basically it is kind of  like a wooden boat. They need to be gotten wet, each irrigation system.  Also, the groundwater recharges provide for the people and the nearby  neighbors with their domestic wells.   Every year the project goes dry or loses water the costs of returning  to standard operations will increase. As I mentioned with the canals  coming apart, the first water that needs to go in them is actually  absorbed by the canals to get them back into shape.   So when I mention the 3,000 acre-feet that are cut down to and the  Bureau decided that is not even worth delivering, at least that could  be positively used, to some extent, for those systems, as well as I  mentioned the groundwater damage without the recharge.   So, most of the basin has to plan and plant, based on what the Bureau  tells them in April will be their allocation. For example, one grower  there, a fellow named Scotty Fenters, notes that the panic set in when  the Bureau revised down their allocation last year in May 2020. He had  already bought seed, already paid the rent, and already put the  fertilizer in fields.   Can you imagine, you have something halfway done and committed, and  they say, No, you are not going to have the inputs anymore to finish?   So in total, about $75 million had been spent planning and preparing.   Now, last year again in 2020 after the Bureau initially reduced their  allocation, the basin community rallied. There was a convoy of tractors  and trucks that stretched 30 miles to say, You have to keep your word,  Federal Government.   So, indeed, it was an impressive turnout.   So we come back to the water rights being upheld.   Last year, Klamath irrigation took the Bureau of Reclamation to court  over its decision to increase downstream flows for salmon in the  Klamath River. The State ultimately agreed with KID stating that the  Bureau had the right to store water in the Upper Klamath Lake, but it  does not own that water. It only has the right to move the water on  behalf of the growers and the intent of the project. They do not have  the right to take the water for salmon or suckers--salmon in the rivers  and suckers in the lake.   Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time remains.    Now, there is still much ground we need to cover here  tonight, but I think I have set the table for what we are looking at  and the devastation.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Bentz) for  his presentation.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate us being able to team up on  this dire situation up in our common area like that.   Let me just touch on this part here. Going into the wildlife refuge  aspect and the areas there in the basin that have sustained much  wildlife and waterfowl over the years, this is 2020, when deliveries  were already inadequate.   Now, it might be hard to see on camera here, but this is a photo of  part of the duck kill and the birds that were plucked out of the Tule  Lake area here. You can see some of the dots here that indicate dead  ducks.   I volunteered one day to go out and help retrieve some of that, to  get this problem out of the water there.   They become infested with maggots, and they help spread disease and  all that. So this is what this really looks like, the waterfowl that is  being devastated up there in 2020, even when it had some water. There  were 44,000 acre-feet delivered then. Sixty thousand waterfowl are  estimated to have died in  [[Page H2535]]  2020. This year, if zero acre-feet are delivered, what is that number  going to look like? What is that going to mean for the fly away?   This is one duck we managed to rescue. They had an operation up there  to take them back and pluck the live ones that were sick and take them  to a nursery and spiff them up and release them once again. That was  one small positive. Indeed, part of the bill package that Mr. Bentz and  I will be working on, we will have funding for that.    Let's get down to the bottom line here. What do we have that we could  be doing this year? This chart indicates the Klamath Project water,  what it brings to the table. This is stored water from the 4,143 mark  here down to 4,136. This is what mankind can have influence over, and  actually, it can be used for a lot of things. I think a lot more of  this needs to go back into agriculture and be used for the wildlife  refuges as well.   Currently, the lake sits at 4,140. That is 307,000 acre-feet of  available water, down to the level where you can't control it anymore.  It becomes what they call dead pool.   This is what the suckerfish need here in this zone. This is deemed by  U.S. Fish and Wildlife, the additional 2 feet, 134,000 acre-feet, as  the suckerfish number that they want to see.   So if we look at this total number, we still have available, between  the current level and the 4,138, 173,000 acre-feet in this lake that  could go right now to help keep those canals going, whatever  agriculture still could use at this late date in mid-May, and go into  the refuges. And it still concedes the 2 feet of surface water, 134,000  acre-feet, to the suckerfish, which is above what is really their right  as the Klamath Project is designed and intended and dedicated to  agriculture when it was built over 100 years ago.   So, we have 173,000 acre-feet above this arbitrary U.S. Fish and  Wildlife number for suckerfish that we could use and put into play.   Will that happen? It is hard telling. It is probably going to take  yet more litigation up there to back up what the Oregon courts have  already ruled does belong, under the Federal law, to the growers, to  the project.   Will we see water going down this A canal here, the initial canal  coming out? I don't know.   Do we see it coming through this river dam to get to these end needs?  Who knows. Things have gone a different direction under this  administration right now.   It is tragic, tragic what is going to be happening to the wildlife I  showed you, to agriculture, to the products that we still need.   In the interim, Mr. Bentz mentioned that. We are going to be  introducing legislation that has a total package of about $57 million:  $40 million will help to fill in what is going to be lost to  agriculture and irrigators there; $2.5 million for refuges, which will  include the botulism assistance for the disease that is going to be out  there for all the dead ducks that are going to happen; $2.5 million for  residential wells, as some of them could be going dry if A canal and  others are not recharging and replenishing the groundwater supply; $3  million for commercial fishermen; $4 million to repair the inevitable  damage that is going to happen to these canals if they don't get wet  like my wooden boat analogy; $5 million for food aid through USDA and  the BIA, Bureau of Indian Affairs, for Tribes and Tribal governments  and their food aid.   Also, at this same time, the Bureau of Reclamation has an expansion  and construction of a new headquarters in Klamath Falls that the  growers get the bill for in order to get no water this year. We are  setting aside, in this legislation, the concept that they need a new  building up there to house who knows how many personnel that aren't  doing the original goal of the project.   Madam Speaker, $4.3 million is currently obligated. This needs to go  back into the relief of what it is going to take to either run the  district as it is and direct relief.   Finally, the relief to the farmers themselves is not having to make  the payments to the Bureau of Reclamation that they do every year to  help pay the bills and keep things going because they are not getting  the water.   I am proud to offer that legislation with Mr. Bentz and bring the  relief they need. But wouldn't it be something to actually bring them  the water that is going to be much more sustaining for the wildlife,  for the infrastructure, for the domestic wells, for agriculture, since  everybody watching this probably enjoys some of these food products,  whether it is the french fries, the horseradish, the mint, the alfalfa  that goes for feed for many of the beef products.   There are amazing things that they do up there when you tour that  area and talk to these good people who are just trying to do what they  have done for generations, what they were promised by the Federal  Government, especially our returning veterans after World War I and  World War II who were given this promise, especially in lieu, in some  cases, of their after-war bonus that they would receive. We need to  uphold this promise and quit jerking the chain on the people of the  Klamath Basin.   I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
