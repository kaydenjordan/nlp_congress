 Mr. Speaker, as a proud American, I ask to bring up  H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban on women  like the Yazidi refugee from Iraq whose life is in danger because of  her husband's work with Americans and who was refused boarding on a  flight to the U.S. out of Erbil.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman's time has expired.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the incredible  work of former-Congressman and now California State Attorney General  Xavier Becerra.   Attorney General Becerra holds nearly three decades of elected public  service as a State legislator, a Member of Congress, and now as  California's attorney general.   I am proud to call Xavier Becerra my friend. It has been a pleasure  to work alongside him as he courageously fought for all Americans, for  women, LGBTQ communities, minorities, and comprehensive immigration  reform.   He is the first Latino to serve as a member of one of the powerful  committees in our House, and he is also the first Latino chairman of  the Democratic Caucus. Through his leadership and guidance, our  priorities have become more defined and have driven the legislative  process.   Attorney General Becerra, thank you for your tireless service and  commitment to our country as you have certainly become one of the most  influential leaders of our time.                            ____________________
