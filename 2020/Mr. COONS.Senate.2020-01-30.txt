 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Delaware.    On behalf of myself and Senator Klobuchar, I send a  question to the desk, addressed to the President's counsel and the  House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The House will go first in answering  the question from Senators Coons and Klobuchar:         Mr. Sekulow said earlier that the President's Counsel would       expect to call their own witnesses in this trial if Mr.       Bolton or others are called by the House managers. Can you       tell the Senate if any of those witnesses would have first-      hand knowledge of the charges against the President and his       actions?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Justice and Senators, there certainly are  witnesses that the President could call with firsthand information. I  don't know that they are--the witnesses that they have described so  far, their position is, apparently, if you are the chairman of a  committee doing an investigation, that makes you a relevant witness. It  doesn't--or you all become witnesses in your own investigations.   They want to call Joe Biden as a witness. Joe Biden can't tell us why  military aid was withheld from Ukraine while it was fighting a war. Joe  Biden can't tell us why President Zelensky couldn't get in the door of  the White House while the Russian Foreign Minister could. He is not in  a position to answer those questions. He can't tell us whether this  rises to an impeachable abuse of power, although he probably has  opinions on the subject.   But are there witnesses they could call? Absolutely. They have said  Mick Mulvaney issued a statement saying: The President never said what  I had said he had said earlier. Well, if that is the case, then why  don't they call Mick Mulvaney? He should be on their witness list. If  Secretary Pompeo has evidence that there was a policy basis to withhold  the aid and it was discussed, well, then, why don't they call him? That  is a relevant fact witness.   They don't want to allow the Chief Justice to decide issues of  materiality because they know what they are trying to do involves  witnesses that don't shed light on the charges against the President.  They do satisfy the appetite of their client, but they don't have  probative value to the issues here.    So, yes, there are witnesses. Now, the reason they are not on the  President's witness list is because if they were truthful under oath,  they would incriminate the President. Otherwise, they would be begging  to have Mick Mulvaney come testify; otherwise, they would be begging to  have the head of OMB, who helped administer the freeze on behalf of the  President: Let's bring him in. He will tell you it was completely  innocent. It was all about burden-sharing.   So why don't they want the head of OMB in? Why don't they want their  own people in? Because their own people will incriminate the President.   But there is no shortage of relevant, probative witnesses. They just  don't want you to hear what they have to say.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, so besides the fact that Mr.  Schumer said--and it is on page 675 of the transcript--that we can call  any witnesses we want, Mr. Schiff just said we don't really get--we can  call their witnesses. That is what he said. We can call their witnesses  because, under their theory, if we wanted to talk to the whistleblower,  even in a secure setting to find out if he, in fact, may have worked  for the Vice President or may have worked on Ukraine or may have been  in communication with the staff, that is irrelevant.   We can't talk to Joe Biden or Hunter Biden because that is  irrelevant--except the conversation that is the subject matter of this  inquiry, the phone call transcript that you selectively utilized, has a  reference to Hunter Biden. The conversation with Burisma, they raised  it for about a half a day, saying there was nothing there. Well, let me  find out through cross-examination.   But I just think of the irony of this--before we go to dinner--that  we could call anyone we want, except for witnesses we want, but we can  call their witnesses that they want.   Remember we said ``the fruit of the poisonous tree''? It is still the  fruit of the poisonous tree. It doesn't get better with age, as I said.   This idea that this is going to be a fair process--call the witnesses  they want; don't call the witnesses you want because they are  irrelevant. They may be irrelevant to them. They are not irrelevant to  the President, and they are not irrelevant to our case. Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.                                    Recess    The CHIEF JUSTICE.
