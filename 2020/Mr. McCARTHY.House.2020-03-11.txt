 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  And I apologize if I jumped ahead in any way, shape, or form. I  appreciate the opportunity to speak.   Madam Speaker, with all that is going on this week, Democrats have  still found time for their favorite pastime, voting on partisan  legislation that would actually make our country weaker.   Democrats could not have picked a worse week to try to undermine  American travel restrictions.   President Trump's quick decision to restrict travel to countries like  Iran and China; now that was smart. It was a smart response, and it is  helping to keep America safe. The President's actions, then and now,  are clearly within his rights.   But today, I want to talk about the rights of this Congress, of this  body, and how Democrats want to take those away.   For the second time this Congress, the House is considering two  important pieces of legislation by attaching them to completely  unrelated shell vehicles, thereby preventing the minority from offering  a motion to recommit.   Now, the last time this occurred, Representative Ro Khanna actually  admitted the maneuver was intentionally designed to silence dissenting  opinions. He didn't just admit it, he bragged about it, that they would  be able to deny the voice of Congress.   And now, with last week's passage of the sixth motion to recommit  this Congress, Democrat leadership is once again choosing to restrict  debate on an issue of national security. It is not only that this is  bad for America, it is bad for the tradition of fairness and free  debate that, you know what, Democrats promised to uphold.   Don't take my word for it. I listened to my friend, Chairman McGovern  of the Rules Committee say, in September 2018, and I quote, Madam  Speaker, he boasted on this very floor: ``If Democrats are trusted with  the majority, we will have a more accommodating process. This place  will be run like professionals. Ideas will be allowed to come forward,  and the House of Representatives will actually debate again.''   If there is one thing we know about this Democrat majority, it is  that they overpromise and under-deliver. Today is no exception.   The right that Democrats want to take away is an important right,  maybe one of the most important in all of Congress. It is the last  chance for a minority party to offer amendments on legislation. It is  called the motion to recommit.   As you know, the motion to recommit has been a hallmark of the House  for more than 100 years. It was created to give the minority party the  right ``to have a vote upon its position upon great public questions.''   I have got to be very clear. Eliminating this would be a nuclear  option.   That is why I sent a letter--actually two letters--to Democrat  leadership to stop this madness. Unfortunately, my last letter to  Leader Hoyer on this subject went unanswered, so did my letter this  week to Leader Hoyer and Chairman McGovern.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record both of the letters at this  time.                                       House of Representatives,                                   Washington, DC, January 27, 2020.      Hon. Steny H. Hoyer,      Majority Leader of the House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Hoyer: I am writing to request that       you suspend consideration of this week's Iran-related       legislation until basic and essential rights of the minority       are observed.        As we both can agree, the decision to go to war is the most       significant choice Congress can make, followed only by       impeachment. No matter what one thinks of the 2002 AUMF,       there are weighty consequences--both real and symbolic--when       the House debates overturning military authorization and       possibly cutting funding for American troops serving in a       volatile theater. I would hope that such an extraordinary       step would be taken with a careful eye towards promoting full       and thorough deliberation.        Unfortunately, the manner in which you intend to bring       these measures to the floor is anything but full and       thorough. Specifically, by attaching these items to an       unrelated Gold Medal bill, you purposefully eliminated the       last opportunity afforded to the minority party to amend       legislation--the Motion to Recommit--a maneuver       Representative Ro Khanna recently admitted was intentionally       designed to silence dissenting opinions.        Simply put, this is wrong--and I believe you know it to be       in bad faith. In fact, we are unaware of the House ever       debating matters of war and peace in such an unprecedented,       irregular, and restrictive way.        From its inception in 1909, the Motion to Recommit was       created with the stated purpose of giving the minority party       the right ``to have a vote upon its position upon great       public questions.'' Certainly, the issue before us this week       meets the standard of a great public question.        More recently, you, yourself, stated: ``More members, from       across the ideological spectrum, need to have input into the       work we do.'' I would respectfully ask that we strive towards       that standard and immediately remedy this overreach so the       minority may be allowed to offer input on the legislation       before us, as has been tradition for over one hundred years       in the House.        It had been my hope that in this new year. we would begin       to move on from the numerous abuses or power we witnessed on       the part of the House majority during the impeachment       proceedings. If, however, we can no longer count on       fundamental safeguards to minority rights being guaranteed, I       fear your decision this week will only serve to further erode       trust, fairness, and comity in this institution moving       forward.        I look forward to your response on this critical matter.            Sincerely,                                                    Kevin McCarthy,      House Republican Leader.                                   ____                                         House of Representatives,                                      Washington, DC, March 9, 2020.      Hon. Steny H. Hoyer,      Majority Leader of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jim McGovern,      Chairman, House Committee on Rules,      Washington, DC.        Leader Hoyer and Chairman McGovern: I am writing to request       that you suspend consideration of this week's Judiciary       legislation until basic and essential rights of the minority       are fairly observed.        For now the second time this Congress, it appears the House       will consider two pieces of legislation by attaching them to       a completely unrelated shell vehicle, thereby precluding the       minority from offering a motion to recommit.  [[Page H1609]]         The last time this occurred, Representative Ro Khanna       admitted the maneuver was intentionally designed to silence       dissenting opinions. Coming on the heels of the 6th motion to       recommit being adopted this Congress, it serves to reason       that Democrat Leadership is once again willfully choosing to       restrict debate, rather than promote a full and thorough       deliberation of these measures.        My last letter to Leader Hoyer on this subject regrettably       went unanswered. Given the gravity of this new precedent you       are setting for our institution, I believe all members       deserve a public response to the following questions:        Will you commit to ending this practice, which has been       pursued without any consultation or sign-off from our side of       the aisle?        If not, are you contemplating using any Republican-      sponsored vehicles in this ploy, which presumably would be       done without their approval?        What is the status of the request by freshmen Democrats to       consider ending the use of the motion to recommit entirely?        As you both know, the motion to recommit has been a       hallmark of the House for over one hundred years. It was       created with the stated purpose of giving the minority party       the right ``to have a vote upon its position upon great       public questions.''        In my view, eliminating the motion to recommit would be       akin to the ``nuclear option'' in the House. I sincerely       believe neither of you seeks to have that ignominious       distinction on your resumes. However, your actions thus far       in the 116th Congress sadly do not inspire confidence.        Though we may not serve in the majority at present, our       members still represent millions of Americans across the       country who lend us their voice and count on us to fight for       their priorities in Washington. In that spirit, I would       respectfully ask that we not proceed on these measures until       the minority is allowed to offer meaningful input on the       matters before us through a motion to recommit, as has been       tradition in the House since 1909.        We look forward to your response on this critical matter.            Sincerely,                                                    Kevin McCarthy,                                           House Republican Leader.     Madam Speaker, I believe the Members of this House  deserve a public response about this situation. Will Democrats commit  to ending this abusive practice, or do they plan to follow the lead of  their freshmen and end the use of the motion to recommit entirely, to  end a 100-year history of the body of this House?   MTRs not only promote full and thorough deliberation, but they also  improve legislation. Think for a moment, just within this Congress, 6  out of 60 MTRs have been adopted by this Congress. Think about that.   That means a bipartisan majority of this House felt the need to  improve 10 percent of the bills put forward on which MTRs were offered.  That should show you how vital the last amendment is and always should  be.   Madam Speaker, though we may not serve in the majority right now, our  Members still represent millions of Americans who lend us their voice  and count on us to fight for their priorities in Washington.   Madam Speaker, the last 8 years this House had a different majority.  I happened to have the privilege of serving as majority leader. Not  once did we ever consider taking away the MTR, because we believed in  the minority's rights and the traditions of the institution in which we  are privileged to serve.   We believed that the power of the idea should win. We believed in the  promises that we made and that is why we kept them. We would not make  promises while in the minority, and when we captured the majority, in  less than a year, break them time and again. We would not go  unanswered, a question from the minority as well.   There is something bigger than politics. It is the voice of the  American public--to use the sheer power of politics to silence millions  of Americans is just wrong; to change a tradition that has been around  more than 100 years; to make sure a bill cannot become better simply  because you want the partisan side; or to be so afraid of the debate to  deny it to happen, we are so much better than that--the rights and the  traditions of this institution in which we have always been privileged  to serve. I wish I could say the same for this new Democrat majority.    Madam Speaker, my dear friend raised an issue that is  very interesting, because he knows this. At any time that it was used  it was in consultation with the minority. Even when it was taken away,  you know what we did, we added back an amendment so you could have the  debate on the floor. It was only during appropriations consultation  with you to be able to move something in a timely manner. He  understands that.   Madam Speaker, my only question to my friend on the other side is:  Will the gentleman answer the letter? When the minority leader of the  House sent the Rules Committee chairman a letter--the simple question  is--with three simple questions: Will the gentleman take this  opportunity to answer the letter? That is all I ask.    Madam Speaker, before I begin, I want to thank the  gentleman, the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee. He warned  the American public when he was chair. He warned them and told them  that FISA was not used correctly, that the power of the government  overstretched their arms.   But even when the other elements of government said no, they did not,  even when others got on to that exact same position and told us  everything was fine with FISA, it was not until the inspector general  got his report that the truth was known.   I thank Congressman Devin Nunes for being the truth, telling it to  the American public, and staying with it when others wanted to lie.   That is why we are here today. That is why this will not continue or  ever happen again.   Madam Speaker, at the heart of our Constitution is a simple idea, the  idea  [[Page H1634]]  of checks and balances. These principles protect Americans' freedoms by  creating safeguards against the potential of government overreach of  power.   Unfortunately, in 2016, those checks and balances were not in place  to stop individuals at the highest level of the FBI and Justice  Department from spying on Carter Page, an American citizen who could  have been one of us.   They used the secretive FISA courts, which are meant to keep  Americans safe from foreign enemies, to attempt to undermine their  domestic political opponent at that time, then-candidate Donald Trump.   After years of thorough and independent investigation, we now know  the truth: what happened in 2016 was politically motivated; it was  completely unjustified; and it must never happen again.   This bipartisan legislation addresses the need for greater accuracy  and accountability in the FISA process. It does not damage the  legitimate authorities our intelligence community relies on to keep us  safe, but it does strengthen protections for civil liberties.   Among its many reforms, this legislation increases the punishment for  unauthorized disclosure of FISA applications, authorizes an amicus to  be appointed to cases involving political activity, and enhances  oversight by Congress and creates a new Office of Compliance.   These reforms are an astonishing accomplishment in a period of  divided government. That just tells you how important FISA reforms and  checks and balances truly are.   Outside this Chamber, there are quotes from famous Americans who  dedicated their lives to preserving American freedom.   One of those individuals, Patrick Henry, was so passionate about his  defense of freedom that he famously said: ``Give me liberty or give me  death.'' We can learn a lot from Henry's total devotion to the American  cause.   We can learn a lot from those who are willing to stand up to  oppressive Big Government, who would use an arm illegally against the  check and balance just to try to have an outcome in a political race.   We could thank those like Devin, who stood for the American public  and the truth, or those in other committees who helped work on this,  the   Jim Jordans, the Doug Collinses, that we would not be here today  and getting a new compliance office, a check and balance to make sure  what happened in 2016 cannot happen again.   I do urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' I do urge that this is a  turning point, that even though in these committees they could have  told us, and they did, that there was nothing wrong, that we had to  continue to fight to get an inspector general to have the truth.   Now, we have a check and balance that we will not have to wait for  that. Even if somebody tries to use it in the wrong manner, it cannot  happen again.
