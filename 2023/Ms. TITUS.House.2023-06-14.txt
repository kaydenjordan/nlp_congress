 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Vegas Golden  Knights on winning the Stanley Cup last night defeating the Florida  Panthers in a 9-3 rout at home in game five and securing the first  major men's professional sports championship in the history of Las  Vegas.   The Knights have been a uniting force for southern Nevada since their  founding, playing their first home game just 9 days after the October 1  shooting in my district where they retired the number 58 in honor of  the 58 victims of the shooting.   Jonathan Marchessault was named playoff MVP. Last night's dominant  performance was capped off by team captain Mark Stone's hat trick.   The franchise had many detractors in the beginning despite these  accomplishments. Nate Silver even wrote an article titled: ``Las Vegas  is a Terrible Place for an NHL Team.'' Owner Bill Foley nonetheless  promised that the Golden Knights would bring home a Stanley Cup within  6 years, and that is exactly what they did.   Indeed, the Vegas Golden Knights organization and its fans have  proven that Las Vegas is a hockey town.   Congratulations to owners Bill Foley and the Maloof family and other  members of the team as well as the players and coaches. We are very  proud of them, and we are excited to have the Stanley Cup at home in  fabulous Nevada's District One.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
