 Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Smith and Chairman  Rogers for their support of my bipartisan amendment to require the  Department of Defense to track whether their equipment is made in the  United States. I was surprised that the Department of Defense does not  know whether essential weapons equipment today have component parts  that are made overseas and what percentage are made overseas.   We have a problem in this country in terms of our industrial base. Of  the top 15 steel companies in the world, 9 of them are in China. Not  one is in the United States. We just realized, in terms of artillery to  Ukraine, that we don't have enough conventional artillery, forcing us  to be considering cluster bombs.   We need to build our industrial base, and to do that, we need to  figure out where the Department of Defense is getting weapons and the  component parts, what are essential weapons and essential supply  chains, and how we can ensure that those essential supply chains are  made in the United States of America.   This bipartisan amendment will help us get that information and that  data.   Mr. Chairman, again, I thank Ranking Member Smith and Chairman Rogers  for including this in the NDAA.
