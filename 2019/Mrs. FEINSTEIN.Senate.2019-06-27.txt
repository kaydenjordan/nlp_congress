 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  Cannabidiol and Marijuana Research Expansion Act with my colleagues.   Anecdotal evidence suggests that marijuana and its derivatives, like  cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, may be helpful in treating serious  medical conditions. However, anecdotal evidence alone cannot be the  basis for developing new medications. Rather, medication development  must be based on science.   Unfortunately, marijuana research is subject to burdensome  regulations which may unintentionally inhibit research and medication  development.   The Cannabidiol and Marijuana Research Expansion Act will reduce  these barriers without sacrificing security or enabling diversion. It  will ensure that marijuana-derived medications are developed using  strong scientific evidence, and provide a pathway for the manufacture  and distribution of FDA-approved drugs that are based on this research.   First, the bill streamlines the regulatory process for marijuana  research. Specifically, it requires the Drug Enforcement Administration  (DEA) to quickly approve or deny applications to research CBD or  marijuana and establishes a process by which applicants may submit  supplemental information, if necessary.  [[Page S4634]]    It also improves regulations dealing with changes to approved  quantities of marijuana needed for research and approved research  protocols. These improvements will eliminate lengthy delays that  researchers encounter under current regulations.   Second, this legislation seeks to increase medical research on CBD.   It does so by explicitly authorizing medical and osteopathic schools,  research universities, practitioners and pharmaceutical companies to  produce the marijuana they need for approved medical research. This  will ensure that researchers have access to the material they need to  develop proven, effective medicines. Once the FDA approves these  medications, pharmaceutical companies are permitted to manufacture and  distribute them.   Third, the bill fosters increased communication between doctors and  patients.   Because it is a Schedule I drug, some doctors are hesitant to talk to  their patients about the potential harms and benefits of using  marijuana, CBD, or other marijuana derivatives as a treatment, for fear  that they will lose their DEA registrations. Yet, if patients are using  marijuana or its derivatives without their doctors' knowledge, it could  impact the effectiveness of the care they receive. That is why our bill  authorizes these discussions to occur.   Finally, because existing Federal research is lacking, the bill  directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to expand and  coordinate research to determine the potential medical benefits of CBD  or other marijuana-derived medications on serious medical conditions.   I have heard from many parents who have turned to CBD as a last  resort to treat their children who have intractable epilepsy.  Anecdotally, CBD has produced positive results. I have heard similar  stories from people who use marijuana to treat various other medical  conditions.   But a common concern echoed in many of these conversations is that  there is a lack of understanding about the proper delivery mechanism,  dosing, or potential interactions that CBD or marijuana may have with  other medications. Some also worry because these products aren't well  regulated or factory sealed, and often are labeled incorrectly.   Without additional research, our ability to adequately address these  concerns is limited and uninformed.   The need for additional research, along with the need to increase the  supply of CBD and marijuana for research purposes, was highlighted in  the National Academy of Sciences report, titled ``The Health Effects of  Cannabis and Cannabinoids: The Current State of Evidence and  Recommendations for Research.''   I firmly believe that we should reduce the regulatory barriers  associated with researching marijuana and CBD. If and when science  shows that these substances are effective in treating serious medical  illnesses, we should enable products to be brought to the market with  FDA approval. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Mr. Van Hollen):   S. 2036.
