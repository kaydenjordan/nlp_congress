 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and service  of a decorated veteran, fierce advocate, and great man, Garry  Augustine.   As the executive director of the Disabled American Veterans, DAV,  from 2013 to 2018 and a 50-year life member, Garry helped shape the  legislative landscape for disabled veterans and their families  nationwide by advocating before Congress, the White House, and  Department of Veterans Affairs.   While Garry is no longer with us, his legacy lives on. On behalf of  myself, Congress and my fellow Americans, I would like to extend our  deepest gratitude for his life and service to this Nation.   A native son of Cleveland, OH, Garry enlisted in the U.S. Army in  August 1969. As a member of the 198th Infantry Brigade in South  Vietnam, he served on the Batangan Peninsula. During a combat patrol  operation on April 9, 1970, he was severely wounded by a land mine  explosion.   After 18 months and multiple surgeries at Walter Reed Medical Army  Hospital, Garry returned home to Cleveland, where he continued physical  rehabilitation.   Following his time in uniform, Garry's commitment to serving others  never faded. In 1978, Garry went on to earn a bachelor's degree with  honors from Ohio University and a master's degree in sociology from  Cleveland State University in 1983. That same year, he became a life  member of DAV Chapter 42 in Mentor, OH.   In Mentor, he served in various positions, including chapter  commander and adjutant, and on statewide committees, as well as  director of service for the DAV Department of Ohio. He was also  selected as one of the Outstanding Young Men of America in 1989.   Along the way, Garry met and married his loving wife Kelly Lambing  and raised two children, Chelsea and Kyle. He was rightfully proud of  them, and spoke of them often.   He began his tenure with DAV in 1988 as a hospital service  coordinator for the Department of Ohio at the Cleveland Wade Park VA  Hospital. That same year, he joined DAV's professional staff as a  national service officer apprentice and went on to serve as assistant  supervisor and supervisor at the national service office in Cleveland.   Eventually, Garry left this role to help lead DAV's efforts  nationwide. He was appointed to assistant national service director at  DAV's Washington headquarters in 2002 and then deputy national service  director in 2004 and national service director in 2010.   He was named as Washington headquarters executive director in 2013,  where he was tasked with overseeing DAV's service and legislative  programs and leading DAV's advocacy efforts on behalf of more than 1  million DAV members.   As executive director of DAV, Garry was in charge of an organization  that has always been at the forefront of advocating for veterans and  securing the resources, healthcare, and benefits veterans have earned.  In the position, he was a tireless and successful advocate for VA  healthcare reform, expanding caregiver benefits, securing critical  resources for veterans' initiatives, modernizing the disability appeals  system, and improving VA care and services for women veterans.   As the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee and  Committee member since 2007, it was a great honor of mine to work with  Garry and DAV on countless important pieces of legislation like the  Deborah Sampson Act, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization  Act, and the VA MISSION Act.   These bipartisan efforts, many of which were signed into law, serve  as a testament to Garry's dedication and leadership on behalf of all  veterans. Future generations of veterans will look at these bipartisan  reforms and feel the reach of his mission to serve veterans in their  communities.   Garry's enduring legacy lives on at DAV, which--thanks to his  leadership--continues to be a cornerstone for communities across the  Nation.   After three decades of service to DAV, Garry retired as executive  director on December 17, 2018, and moved to Maryland's Eastern Shore.  Even in his retirement, he continued to use his experience to serve as  a strategic adviser on veterans' healthcare technology.   On March 14, 2022, Garry passed away in Washington, DC at the age of  71 years old. He is survived by his wife Kelly, daughter Chelsea, son  Kyle, and grandson Austin, and will be laid to rest at Arlington  National Cemetery.   It is my honor to recognize Garry's lifetime of service as a soldier,  veteran, and leader of DAV--but also as a loving husband and father. On  behalf of myself and a grateful nation, I extend my  [[Page S1269]]  greatest appreciation for Garry's enduring sacrifices, service, and  advocacy on behalf of all veterans. His work will be felt by veterans  nationwide for years to come, and he will be sorely missed.                            ____________________
