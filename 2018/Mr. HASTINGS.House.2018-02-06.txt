 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck) for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.   I rise today to debate this rule, the Common Sense Nutrition  Disclosure Act, the Mortgage Choice Act of 2017, and the Small Bank  Holding Company Relief Act of 2018.   H.R. 772 would amend the labeling requirements for nutrition  information displayed by restaurants and other retail food  establishments. This measure would unnecessarily complicate and further  delay the implementation of nutrition labeling requirements established  by the Affordable Care Act.   In what can only be described as a rather astounding attempt to avoid  good sense, this bill will make calorie and nutrition information less  accessible and less useful to consumers at a time when we are spending  $147 billion annually on healthcare measures related to chronic  illnesses that are directly tied to obesity. Consumers need more access  to this information, not less.   The second measure, H.R. 1153, the Mortgage Choice Act of 2017, would  introduce some of the high fees that borrowers faced leading up to the  2008 mortgage and financial crisis. This bill would roll back important  home-buyer protection reforms, taking us back to the days when the true  cost of a loan could be obscured in mortgage documents to the detriment  of home buyers everywhere.   The third measure, the Small Bank Holding Company Relief Act of 2018,  would direct the Federal Reserve Board to triple the Small Bank Holding  Company Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion, allowing even  larger banking institutions to use greater amounts of debt to finance  acquisitions, seemingly ignoring the lessons  [[Page H792]]  from the previous financial disaster that we continue to climb out of  to this very day.   Indeed, these Financial Services bills would weaken and politicize  the policies created after the financial crisis to identify and guard  against systemic risk in our financial system; and will allow even  larger bank holding companies to leverage themselves with debt when  financing the purchase of other banks.   Reviewing this legislation, I had to ask myself: Are the memories of  my Republican colleagues really so short that they do not remember the  complete breakdown of our financial system only a few short years ago?   Let me remind my friends across the aisle that the financial crisis  of 2008 was the worst economic downturn America has faced since the  Great Depression. Four million homes went through foreclosure and 9  million Americans lost their jobs.   Yet, instead of supporting efforts to ensure a financial collapse of  such magnitude does not happen again, the majority has, instead, chosen  to weaken the very protections put in place to prevent it.   With this in mind, we are left with two questions of equal  importance: On the one hand, why are the Republicans so set on  weakening much-needed and proven economic protections and making it  harder for people to knowingly buy healthy food? And, secondly, why are  they doing so now?   Mr. Speaker, the government runs out of funding this Thursday at  midnight. We, once again, are forced to stare down the very real  possibility of another shutdown because the Republican leadership  either cannot or will not govern in a mature and reliable manner.  Instead, our country is forced to lurch from continuing resolution to  continuing resolution for no discernible reason. I think we are coming  up on continuing resolution number 5.   Rather than taking the time to address their ever-present inability  to govern responsibly, we are here today to debate evidence of that  very inability, namely, the three bills we will be asked to vote on  shortly.   It strikes me as odd, and is certainly frustrating, that I must, once  again, remind the majority that we have yet to pass a budget agreement  that provides an equal increase to both defense and nondefense  spending.   Caveat right there. Later today, when we take up the CR, it is likely  going to be said by a lot of people that our primary responsibility is  to provide for the defense of this Nation, and I agree 100 percent. But  that does not ignore the secondary responsibility of promoting the  general welfare, and there are a variety of measures that are  unattended and need to be attended. I might add, military people,  veterans, and others find themselves in need of those particular  services that are unattended as well.   We have yet to enact disaster aid so that our fellow Americans in  Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, California, and  southwest Louisiana can recover from the devastating hurricanes and  wildfires.                                time  1030    We have yet to provide funding, and we will be talking about that a  little bit later in our previous question request. We haven't provided  funding for what we all know is the urgent opioid crisis. We have yet  to protect hardworking Americans' pensions, and we have yet to see a  serious proposal from Republican leadership to protect DREAMers and  those whose temporary protected status will soon run out.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, every day, more than 115 Americans die from an opioid  overdose. In 2016, the opioid epidemic claimed more American lives than  car accidents and even breast cancer.   In order to tackle this growing crisis, we need to pass legislation  that invests in effective solutions. Even President Donald John Trump  agrees. Last year, he said: ``It is a national emergency. We are going  to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort, and a lot of money on the  opioid crisis.''   Well, Mr. Speaker, we have not spent a lot of time, a lot of effort,  or a lot of money on this crisis. Instead, the President and the  Republican Party spent most of last year trying to take  [[Page H793]]  away healthcare from millions of Americans and passing a tax cut for  billionaires and corporations. And to that, Mr. Speaker, I say: Enough.  We need to act now.   For that reason, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to  offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Kuster's  bill, H.R. 4938, the Respond to the Needs in the Opioid War Act.   This legislation would create a $25 billion opioid epidemic response  fund to invest in programs that will help States respond to the  epidemic over the next 5 years.    I happen to live in south Florida, which has an equivalent crisis  with everyone around the Nation. The people with addiction problems  seem to gravitate to several areas in south Florida, particularly  Delray Beach and Palm Beach County, where I live.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster) to discuss our proposal,  who is a true champion on this issue.   Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding time to me.   Mr. Speaker, in New Hampshire and all across this country, people are  dying every day. Communities have been devastated by the heroin and  opioid epidemic. Last year, we lost nearly 500 people to substance  abuse disorder in my small State of New Hampshire.   Helping families, first responders, treatment providers, law  enforcement officials, and activists in the Granite State confront this  crisis has been one of my top priorities in Congress.   Our communities need our help, and there is strong bipartisan  commitment here in the House to respond effectively to this crisis.   While we have passed effective legislation over the last 2 years,  including the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, the most  important thing that we can do is to provide the funding to help those  on the front lines of this crisis do their jobs.   While I and my Democratic colleagues welcome the President's  declaration of an opioid public health emergency, the lack of  corresponding funding means that this commitment has been little more  than empty rhetoric.   We need leadership from Congress and the President to save lives  across the country by providing real solutions to the opioid epidemic,  and I call on my colleagues to act now.   During the State of the Union, the President, once again, expressed  his commitment to working to address the opioid and heroin epidemic,  but, unfortunately, his actions have fallen short of his rhetoric.   I have come to the floor today so we can defeat the previous question  and bring up for consideration my legislation, the Respond NOW Act.   This critical legislation creates a $25 billion opioid epidemic  response fund to provide $5 billion annually over 5 years targeted to  numerous key initiatives involving agencies such as the Substance Abuse  and Mental Health Services Administration, the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health.   This includes $18.5 billion for SAMHSA grants to States, particularly  those targeted at expanding medication assistance treatment, which  opioid experts agree is among the most critical ways to help those  suffering from substance use disorder.   My bill also provides funding to increase the number of substance use  treatment providers and to expand medical research related to the  opioid epidemic.   Additionally, it provides $2.5 billion for critical CDC initiatives,  such as expanding and strengthening evidence-based prevention and  education strategies.   Finally, the bill includes funding specifically to support children  and families impacted by this opioid epidemic, including $250 million  to support the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, which can help  address the risk of adverse childhood experiences, a known driver of  this epidemic.   We need to break the cycle, and these programs are ideally suited to  support substance abuse treatment services to help families stay  together and keep children in safe and stable homes.   The opioid crisis is a multifaceted challenge, and we are fortunate  that so many amazing researchers, first responders, law enforcement  officials, community activists, and others are doing amazing work in  communities all across our country. But they need the resources to  effectively meet these challenges. We must stop playing political games  and act immediately to provide emergency funding to help stop this  crisis in New Hampshire, in Florida, and all across this country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H794]]    I ask the gentleman from Colorado: Does Lamont own more than one  establishment?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H794]]    I ask the gentleman from Colorado: Does Lamont own more than one  establishment?    I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.    Does he own more than 20?    If he doesn't own more than 20, then he is not affected  by this law. I just want you to know that. I am with you. I want Lamont  to be successful.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, Democrats do not want  to weaken financial protections keeping our economy stable and strong.  Democrats do not want to make it harder for Americans to know the  nutritional value of their food.   Rather, Democrats are ready to pass a budget that creates jobs and  grows the paychecks of hardworking Americans. Democrats are ready to  provide relief to our fellow Americans suffering from natural  disasters. Democrats are ready to protect American's pensions.  Democrats are ready to protect DREAMers; people who have known no other  country than the United States; people, who, but for one piece of  paper, are just as American as anyone who will walk in this Chamber  today; people who served in the United States military, almost 1,000 of  them.   Preferably, we would like to do that work in a bipartisan way. All we  need is for the Republican Conference to stand up to the extreme  faction in their party and to finally work with us.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
