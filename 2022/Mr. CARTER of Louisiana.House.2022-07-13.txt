 Mr. Speaker, wars were fought, movements  were launched, constitutional amendments were passed to give every  American of every race and gender full citizenship and the right to  vote.   But last month, the Supreme Court released a shadow docket ruling  reinstating Louisiana's GOP-drawn, unrepresentative congressional maps.  This sends Louisiana back to a tarnished history of diminishing the  votes and voices of African Americans.   It is shameful that the Court refused maps that fairly represent the  population of Louisiana. We need maps that follow the simple math and  give Black Louisianians their rightful representation per current  population.   The Supreme Court is out of control in so many ways, but this and  other most recent rulings make it clear that this Supreme Court will  stop at nothing to silence the voices of Black and Brown Americans.  This ruling shows that many of these Justices are committed not to the  Constitution but to the far-right political agenda that includes  further attacking of the Voting Rights Act.   Together we must fight against the age-old pattern of silencing Black  voters. While the forces of injustice may have won the battle, we will  win the war.                            ____________________
