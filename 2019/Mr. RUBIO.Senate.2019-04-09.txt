 Madam President, as chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my privilege to  recognize a small business that exemplifies creativity, hard work, and  dedication to improving their community. This week, it is my honor to  name The Big Cheese of Miami, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week.   Having just celebrated their 35 year anniversary, The Big Cheese has  grown from a 12-seat and 2-person operation to a landmark Miami Italian  restaurant. Lifelong friends Bill Archer and Garry Duell founded The  Big Cheese in 1984 and due to their rapid success, expanded to a larger  location across the street. Bill is the culinary expert of the duo and  has developed original recipes for all 120 items on the menu, while  Garry focuses on the day-to-day operations. Along the way, they have  shared in the restaurant's success.   Today, The Big Cheese remains family-oriented and affordable and uses  only the finest ingredients. They have an extensive menu that includes  everything from Italian favorites to Miami classics. Many of their  employees have been there since inception, and others are second- generation employees, with an average employee tenure of 16 years.  Bill, Gary, and longtime manager Salvatore Aiello strive to create a  welcoming and friendly atmosphere and they have certainly succeeded.   Their dedication to fair prices and made-from-scratch dishes has not  gone unnoticed. They were voted The Best Inexpensive Italian Restaurant  in Miami and received the 5 Kids Crown Award from South Florida  Parenting Magazine for their pizza. They are proud to feed people from  diverse socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds and remain focused on  serving their community.   One example of their efforts to help community members in need was  during Hurricane Irma recovery, when they donated food to the emergency  operations center in Monroe County. They are also the official sponsor  of the University of Miami Athletics Department, providing both the  Hurricanes and their competitors with pregame meals. Since their  founding, they have served thousands of University of Miami students  and collected more than 200 pieces of original memorabilia. Their  dedication to the school was recently honored when they were chosen to  represent the University of Miami during the Taste of the NFL, a  charity aimed at bringing awareness to the millions of Americans who  struggle with hunger.   The Big Cheese is an exemplary community-focused small business. They  have remained true to their original values and serve their community  in times of need. Like many Main Street restaurants throughout our  country, The Big Cheese is a place where community members have  gathered and enjoyed meals together for decades. By focusing on quality  food and superior customer service, The Big Cheese has stayed in high  demand. It is with great pleasure that I extend my congratulations to  Bill, Gary and all of the employees at The Big Cheese. I wish you well  as you continue serving the people of South Florida, and I look forward  to watching your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
