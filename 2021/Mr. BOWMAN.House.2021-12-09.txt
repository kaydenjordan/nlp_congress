 Madam Speaker, we know that about 1.5 million Uyghur and  Kazakh Muslims have been detained in reeducation camps and that  products made in the Xinjiang region have been made with forced labor-- in other words, slavery.   The House considered the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, led by  Chairman McGovern, that would ban the import of goods made with forced  labor and sanction people responsible for modern-day slavery.   This is ethnic cleansing happening here. The world cannot look away  from one of the most egregious and deadly incidents of ongoing  Islamophobia, genocide, and slavery.   I was proud to vote ``yes'' on this legislation and hope to ensure  that we hold China accountable for this egregious human rights abuse.                            ____________________
