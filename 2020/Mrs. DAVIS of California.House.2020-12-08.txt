 Mr. Speaker, this will be my 20th and final  NDAA. As I prepare to seek other challenges, I want to remind my  colleagues of the incredible work that can get done with this  legislation, especially when patience is required.   Since joining the Armed Services Committee, I have seen our focus  change. At the height of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, we focused  on the critical needs of our troops fighting every day. Now, our focus  has shifted more towards innovation and future needs of our troops. But  we can't forget that this bill is not just about spending on things, it  is about our servicemembers and their families. We cannot forget the  importance of the sacrifices that they make. It is hard to even convey  the magnitude of their service.   The military can enhance performance by caring for every member of  the military community, something that we hear every day from military  leaders that, quite honestly, we didn't hear 20 years ago. But there is  more work to be done. We must ensure no military family goes hungry and  no military spouse is forced to leave the workforce because of a  military move or lack of childcare.   The military can enhance performance by fostering an environment  where the opportunities for advancement include all who are willing to  work hard. When I began serving on the HASC, the idea of women in  combat roles or LGBTQ Americans serving openly was only a distant  dream. Today, we understand the importance of diversity in our ranks.  That strategic focus brings the best and the brightest Americans  forward to serve. Where any discrimination persists, it must end.   We have focused so much on the prevention of sexual assault and  harassment.   I recently came across a picture taken at a breakfast on this issue  with General James Amos in 2010, then the commandant of the Marine  Corps. He asked one of his mid-level officers if she would report an  assault if it occurred. She responded unequivocally, no. Much to his  surprise.                                time  1315    We have made sincere policy changes to address this horrible problem,  but the fight continues.   This bipartisan legislation is the culmination of many of the efforts  of many Members. There is much good in it and much that is needed to  support our servicemembers and their families.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, very quickly, our outstanding Chair  Smith, our dedicated Ranking Member Thornberry, and the amazing  professional staff who made this all possible. I will miss them all,  and I know the critical work in service to our Nation continues.
