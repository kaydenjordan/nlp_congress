 Mr. Speaker, it is simple until you make it complicated.  There is a poster in my office that says just that, and it kind of  describes where we are at today.   We are having a lot of debate in this House about the current  government funding situation, our military, and the Children's Health  Insurance Program, which, by the way, House Republicans actually voted  to extend more than 2 months ago and did again this past week.   Here is the simple part: the Children's Health Insurance Program can  be reauthorized, the government can be reopened, and paychecks sent to  our troops without delay if Senators Chuck Schumer and Bob Casey and  other Senate Democrats change their votes to make that happen.   The short-term funding bill and Children's Health Insurance Program  reauthorization is about as bipartisan and noncontroversial as you can  get around here, yet Senator Schumer decided to make a crisis out of  it.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to be able to ask Senator Schumer and  Senator Casey: Would you vote to reopen the government today? Would it  make a difference, if I said ``please?''                            ____________________
