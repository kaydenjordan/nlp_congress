 Mr. Speaker, as May marks Lyme Disease Awareness Month, I  rise today to recognize the countless individuals currently living with  Lyme and to honor the medical experts and advocates combating this  epidemic throughout the Nation.  [[Page H3752]]    In upstate New York, where I reside, we are aware of the real and  continuing threat that Lyme and related tick-borne diseases pose. With  an estimated 300,000 new cases each year, the Lyme crisis is spreading.  It is found in about half of all U.S. counties and in nearly 80  countries worldwide. Transmitted by tick bites, Lyme disease has no  known cure, is difficult to diagnose, and can attack the nervous  system, even sometimes leading to death if left untreated.   There is no silver bullet to combat this devastating disease, but  better public education and more Federal research can lead to  significant advancements. The medical and public health communities  urge you to check yourself and your loved ones, especially children,  each day for ticks and to seek out the best information on best  practices for preventing tick bites and Lyme disease.   I look forward to continuing to work with members of the upstate New  York community, Lyme disease advocates throughout America, and my  colleagues here in Congress on both sides of the aisle to increase  awareness and to find a cure, finally, for this devastating disease.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the gentleman from  Oklahoma, and my colleague, the gentleman from Illinois, as well, for  their fine comments in relation to this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer support for H.R. 4722, a bill to  designate the postal facility at 111 Market Street in Saugerties, New  York, as the Maurice D. Hinchey Post Office Building.   Congressman Hinchey was a lifelong New Yorker and a true public  servant. He passed away in his home in Saugerties, New York, on  November 22, 2017. He is survived by his wife, Ilene Marder, and his  three adult children.   He is fondly remembered as a staunch advocate for what he believed,  including care for our military veterans and the environment through  his support of the Clean Air Act and the Hudson River Valley National  Heritage Area, among many other accomplishments.   The week of his passing, I took to the House floor with the entire  New York delegation to mourn the death of our colleague. Today, I stand  here with this legislation as a token of remembrance for a father, a  husband, a veteran, and a distinguished Member of this House who was  dedicated to his constituents and all the people of our Nation.   Mr. Hinchey served 3 years in the U.S. Navy, 18 years in the New York  State Assembly, and 20 years in the U.S. House of Representatives,  during which time he represented a broad swath of New York State from  the Hudson Valley and the Catskill Mountains over to the southern tier  of our State as well.   Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to have served 6 years in the New York  State Assembly with Mr. Hinchey, and I am also honored to represent  many of the same areas of upstate New York here in Congress as Maurice  Hinchey did. I am joined by 27 bipartisan cosponsors, including the  entire New York congressional delegation, to offer this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I especially want to thank Liam Fitzsimmons, who served  on the staff of Congressman Hinchey as well as on the staff of the late  Congresswoman Louise Slaughter. Congresswoman Slaughter assisted and  was a colead on this legislation, and I know she would be pleased by  the House passage today of this bill.
