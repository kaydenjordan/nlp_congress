 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Pregnant  Workers Fairness Act.   I thank Chairman Nadler for introducing this vital bill, and I also  thank Chairman Scott for his incredible leadership and his work in  getting it to the floor.   Ending discrimination against pregnant workers is a critical  component in closing the economic divide between men and women in our  country.   Before coming to Congress, I ran Colorado's Consumer Protection  Agency, which included our State civil rights division, and I saw up  close in the complaints that we adjudicated the unfortunate reality is  that women are often denied even the simplest of workplace  accommodations because they are pregnant, and too often women are  forced out or not considered for hire due to their pregnancy. This must  end. And we have an incredible opportunity to do precisely that by  getting this bill across the finish line today.   I am a proud supporter of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, and I  would encourage every Member of this body to vote ``aye'' on this  critical legislation.   Madam Speaker, I submit for the Record a letter from the  International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a 1.4 million-member  organization highlighting their support for this critical legislation.                                          International Brotherhood                                                    of Teamsters,                                                 September 11, 2020.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members       of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, I urge you to       support H.R. 2694, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act when it       comes to the floor in the next week. The Teamsters Union is       proud to support this important legislation which would       promote healthy pregnancies and economic security for       pregnant women.        In the last few decades, there has been a demographic shift       in the workplace. Women now make up almost half of the       workforce. There are more pregnant workers than ever before       and they are working later into their pregnancies. Yet, too       often, instead of providing a pregnant worker with an       accommodation, her employer will fire her or push her onto       unpaid leave, depriving her of a paycheck and health       insurance at a time when she needs them most.        While pregnancy discrimination affects women across race,       ethnicity and economic status, women of color and low-wage       workers are disproportionately impacted. Women of color are       more likely to hold certain inflexible and physically       demanding jobs that can present specific challenges for       pregnant workers, making reasonable accommodations on the job       even more important.        In 2018, the New York Times ran a front page article       detailing the tragic loss experienced by a number of women       working at a Verizon fulfillment center/warehouse in Memphis,       TN, operated by XPO Logistics and previously operated by New       Breed Logistics. New Breed and XPO should be quite familiar       at this point, as they have garnered considerable press       attention in recent weeks. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy was       CEO of New Breed and served on the XPO Board during the time       at which these tragedies took place.        The women who worked at the Memphis warehouse generally       spent twelve hour shifts moving boxes full of Verizon cell       phones and other devices. Upon becoming pregnant, all had       asked for reasonable accommodations, including light duty.       Three of the women said that they even brought in doctors'       notes recommending less-taxing workloads and  [[Page H4521]]       shorter shifts, but supervisors disregarded the letters.        Certainly, some of these women considered leaving their       jobs with New Breed/XPO, or taking unpaid leave to protect       theirs and their unborn child's health, but at an average       hourly wage of $11/hr, unpaid leave and elective terms of       unemployment are entirely unrealistic.        In response to the New York Times article and additional       coverage by the Los Angeles Times and the PBS Newshour,       nearly 100 members of Congress submitted a letter to the       House Committee on Education and Labor urging investigation       into the disturbing treatment of workers at the Memphis       facility. With pressure mounting, XPO solicited the counsel       of an outside expert to draft an internal policy to address       the needs of pregnant workers. This was a step in the right       direction, but it should not take congressional action and       national press coverage to compel an employer to do the right       thing. Make no mistake, this new XPO policy only exists       because of the workers in Memphis who stood up and spoke out.        Unfortunately, XPO's new policy has zero chance of helping       women at the Memphis facility. Two months after announcing       the policy, XPO Logistics abruptly announced that it would       shut down the warehouse where all of the women featured in       the New York Times article had worked. This action creates a       chilling effect on other workers who might choose to access       reasonable accommodations at XPO. What pregnant worker is       going to feel comfortable asking for reasonable accommodation       when the end result of speaking up might be job loss? Key       among its many protections is that H.R. 2694 would prohibit       retaliation against pregnant workers who request       accommodation.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will provide a clear,       predictable rule: employers must provide reasonable       accommodations for limitations arising out of pregnancy,       childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless this would       pose an undue hardship. No woman should have to choose       between providing for her family and maintaining a healthy       pregnancy. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would ensure       that all women working for covered employers would be       protected.        The Teamsters Union is proud to stand with XPO workers and       all pregnant workers demanding change. I urge you to stand up       to unscrupulous employers like XPO and swiftly enact H.R.       2694, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.            Sincerely,                                                    James P. Hoffa,                                                 General President.
