 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I just want to say I know many of us  recognized your enormous service yesterday, and we really appreciate it  and so much today, the day after your 50th birthday, appreciate the  fact that you are presiding over this august body.   I yield the floor.
