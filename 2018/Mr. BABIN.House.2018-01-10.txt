 Mr. Speaker, some folks in Washington are upset because we  just passed the largest tax cut in American history. They think that  this money is Washington's money and that politicians and bureaucrats  should decide how to spend it.   I couldn't disagree more. You and I know that this money belongs to  the American people. It came out of their wallets.   Under our new law, we put hardworking families first by helping them  cope with the costs of raising children by doubling the child tax  credit.   We also help small businesses by cutting their taxes so that they can  compete with foreign companies and create jobs right here in America.   For those folks who don't think that they need an average extra  $1,500 or more a year to spend, or who think that politicians and  bureaucrats can spend their money better, I have a good solution: go  ahead and drop your new refund check in the mail. Send it to the  Internal Revenue Service. The IRS will be glad to take your money.                            ____________________
