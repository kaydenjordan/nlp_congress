 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for 1 minute.    Madam President, as Democrats in the House of  Representatives work to pass Speaker Pelosi's prescription drug bill, I  remind my colleagues that for any bill to become law, it must be  bipartisan and President Trump must be able to sign it.   Unlike current House efforts, the Grassley-Wyden Prescription Drug  Pricing Reduction Act fits the bill. It is bipartisan, and President  Trump has endorsed it. My Republican colleagues in the House recently  pointed to it--in other words, the Grassley-Wyden bill--during an  Energy and Commerce Committee hearing as the only path forward to lower  prescription drug prices. I welcome this support from Republicans in  the House of Representatives.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Reserving the right to object, this bill is in the  jurisdiction of a committee that I am chairman of, the Senate Finance  Committee. I think the Senate Finance Committee has a reputation for  doing things in a very bipartisan way and moving a lot of important  legislation. For example, we moved a bill out of committee to,  hopefully, get consideration on the floor. It is a very bipartisan bill  that reduces the cost of prescription drugs. We did that on a 19-to-9  vote.   There are a lot of other things we are working on, including some  trade legislation. We want to consider, hopefully, in a bipartisan way  the U.S.-Mexico agreement. We also have an agreement out on encouraged  savings and things of that nature.   I want to respond to my friend by reminding him how our committee  works. Last night was the first time that I heard there was an interest  in moving Senator Durbin's bill. The bill has not been through the  committee process, and, therefore, there has been no opportunity to  weigh in with what we know and to determine what we need.   There are a number of programs focused on reducing maternal  mortality, and it is unclear how this bill coordinates with those  efforts. This bill makes a number of long-term changes to Medicaid, and  the policy and budgetary impacts are unknown.   I am offering a counterproposal in the Medicaid Program to address  maternal health and identify underserved areas. Additional funding is  provided for existing Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grants.  This focus is fully offset by a policy that saves money by focusing our  limited resources on moms and babies, rather than spending on prisoners  at a higher percentage in our most vulnerable populations.   I am going to offer Senator Durbin this proposal that I just  described. I ask the Senator to modify his request to include my  amendment, which is at the desk.   I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered and agreed  to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and  passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    I object.
