 Madam President, before I begin my remarks today, I do  want to thank the senior Senator from Texas for his remarks on the  Violence Against Women Act and the Debbie Smith Act. I think it is  vitally important that both of these acts are reauthorized this year  and the sooner the better so our advocates can get their work done.  Thank you very much for those remarks.
