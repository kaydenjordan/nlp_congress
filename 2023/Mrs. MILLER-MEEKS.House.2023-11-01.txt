 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National  Veterans and Military Families Month.   National Veterans and Military Families Month honors the service and  sacrifices of veterans and the crucial role of their families in  fostering community support and awareness of their unique challenges.   As a 24-year Army veteran, and also the daughter of a career military  man, I will continue to work tirelessly to support legislation that  supports our VA healthcare system, reduces the barriers to healthcare  for our veterans, and provides support for our military spouses and  families.   This month is an opportunity for individuals and communities to come  together and show their appreciation for the service and sacrifices  made by veterans and military families and to support their successful  reentry into civilian life.                                time  1215            Recognizing Iowa PBS for Receiving Public Media Awards     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Iowa PBS,  [[Page H5185]]  which received two prestigious Public Media Awards presented by the  National Educational Telecommunications Association. These accolades  were given during the 55th Annual Public Media Awards ceremony in Grand  Rapids, Michigan.   Iowa was recognized for Military Chronicles in the Content category  for the documentary ``USS Iowa,'' retelling stories from World War II.  They also won the Short Form Content category for their feature ``Iowa  Miss Amazing,'' about the Iowa Miss Amazing organization that is  dedicated to empowering girls and women with disabilities.   These awards highlight the dedication and hard work of the whole Iowa  PBS team, showcasing their commitment to capturing the spirit of Iowa  in these remarkable productions.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate their team and thank them for sharing  Iowa's story.                  Recognizing and Celebrating Adam Zeithamel     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  celebrate a young man, Adam Zeithamel, and the remarkable participants  of the 2023 National Youth Orchestra program.   Adam completed the rigorous selection process and represented Iowa  City as a cellist in the National Youth Orchestra-USA program. The  National Youth Orchestra program unites the most gifted musicians from  across the Nation and provides them with an opportunity to debut their  talents at the renowned and historic Carnegie Hall.   Adam and his cohort underwent an intensive training during their  residency in New York and were guided by an exceptional faculty of  professional musicians. Following their residency, the ensemble  embarked on a tour of the great music capitals of the world while  serving as music ambassadors.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Adam Zeithamel on this significant  achievement, and I thank him for making Iowa proud.        Recognizing Iowa Women's Basketball and Head Coach Lisa Bluder     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a shining  moment in Iowa women's basketball history. At the charity game hosted  at Iowa City's University of Iowa football stadium, Kinnick Stadium,  55,646 passionate fans shattered the NCAA single-game record for the  largest attendance in women's basketball history--and it was outdoors.   The exhibition game between Iowa and DePaul directed all the profits  toward the Iowa Children's Hospital, showcasing sportsmanship and the  spirit of giving back.   The idea for the Kinnick Stadium outdoor game was spearheaded by Head  Coach Lisa Bluder.   Caitlin Clark, the reigning Naismith National Player of the Year,  delivered a remarkable performance by recording a 34-point triple- double and leading Iowa to a 94-71 victory over DePaul.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Coach Bluder for her inspiring leadership behind  this event, and I congratulate the entire University of Iowa women's  basketball team on this incredible milestone. Go Hawks.      Congratulating Dennis Lauver    Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Dennis Lauver with  Coldwell Banker Howes & Jefferies in Clinton, Iowa, for his 1-year  appointment to the National Association of Realtors Federal Taxation  Committee.   Congratulations, Dennis.                            ____________________
