 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to  H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering  Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2017.   My amendment would exempt a claimant who is or has been living in  public housing or any dwelling unit for which rental assistance was  provided under the Section 8 housing program. While I firmly believe  that every individual should be exempt from this outrageous provision,  my amendment recognizes that we, the Federal Government, are the  landlords, the owners, if you may, of public housing.   Speaker Ryan is a landlord of public housing. Our leader, the  gentlewoman from California, is a landlord of public housing. The  President is a tenant of public housing. The White House is public  housing. While the White House has hot water, a nice roof, and likely  no asbestos, it is still public housing. We, the taxpayers, pay the  rent. We, as the Federal Government on both sides of the aisle, are the  owners and the landlords of public housing.   As the owners of public housing, we have a unique obligation to the  people living in these units. We are responsible for the dilapidated  conditions of  [[Page H1993]]  our public housing units, and we are responsible for the health and  well-being of low-income tenants living in them.   Much of our public housing was built in the 1950s and 1960s,  coinciding with what was perhaps the peak time for the use of asbestos- containing products in building and construction materials. This has  left thousands of our most vulnerable citizens at risk of exposure to  asbestos, which has killed as many as 15,000 Americans each year.   People who have a legitimate claim and have been exposed to asbestos  while living in either public housing or Section 8 housing should be  afforded the due process they deserve and given the opportunity to  bring their claims in a timely manner. I think this entire bill is a  misnomer and should be renamed the unfairness in class action  litigation act.   No one--no one--should have their due process rights delayed or  denied. There is no doubt that the consequences of this legislation  will be especially and uniquely detrimental to low-income individuals.  This legislation will completely upend privacy and bankruptcy laws.   As it stands today, our laws guarantee that a claimant's information  is protected. This bill, however, will require that an individual  claimant's personal information and the amount they have received from  the trust be made available on a public website. Not only is this a  complete and total disregard for the individual's privacy, but it makes  the most vulnerable in our society prey for financial predators.   My amendment will guarantee that tenants living in public housing and  Section 8 housing are not subjected to such an outrageous shift in  privacy rights. The bill sends trusts on a wild goose chase for  information that may not even be there, while they should be spending  their time working through the pending claims.   These companies hid the dangers of asbestos for decades, for far too  long, and there is absolutely no reason why we should be helping them  now. Rather than wasting time and taxpayer dollars obstructing the  judicial system, we should be focusing on initiatives that will update  our crumbling infrastructure. And, yes, public housing is undoubtedly  infrastructure.   Finally, the CBO has indicated that, financially, this amendment will  cost nothing. This amendment will cost absolutely nothing. But I can  promise you that not adopting it will come at a great cost to our  system of justice. I ask my colleagues to adopt this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 140.
