 Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take  its toll on communities throughout the country, and my region is one of  the latest to be declared a hotspot.   In San Joaquin County, more than 10,000 have been diagnosed and 110  have lost their lives to this disease. Our hospitals have less than 14  percent availability in the ICUs, and my district, like many others, is  in dire need of assistance.   Mr. Speaker, over 2 months ago, the House of Representatives passed  the HEROES Act, but this critical legislation is still sitting in the  Senate majority leader's desk being ignored by Senate Republicans. This  week, Senator McConnell announced his alternative to the HEROES Act,  which falls way short, leaving individuals, cities, and States without  the resources they need to survive this crisis.   My district deserves better, the American people deserve better, and  the House Democrats have offered better. It is time for the Republican- controlled Senate to join us and meet this challenge head-on.                            ____________________
