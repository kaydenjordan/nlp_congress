 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Colorado and the gentleman from Maryland for supporting this  legislation.   I am a proud sponsor of the Martin Luther King, Jr. National  Historical Park Act.   First, let me thank each and every member and the staff from the  Natural Resources Committee for their hard work and support of this  act.   Mr. Speaker, this nonpartisan bill will simply change these historic  Atlanta places from being a site to a park. At no additional cost to  taxpayers, this bill will create the first national historic park in  the State of Georgia. This small change will significantly improve the  way the National Park Service preserves, shares, and presents the  history of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., site or park.   Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was our moral compass. He represented  the best of America. His mission was to create the beloved community, a  community at peace with itself and our neighbors. Throughout his life,  Dr. King urged each and every one of us to recognize the dignity and  worth of every human being.   Passing this simple piece of legislation will improve how this  important history and legacy is shared with visitors from across our  country and from around the world.  [[Page H2066]]    Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chair and ranking  member for their support of this legislation.
