 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4468, the  CARS Act.   President Biden has made it clear since day one that he will use the  full weight and power of his office to push a radical climate agenda at  the expense of consumer choice and American energy security.   His rush-to-green agenda, drawn up and enforced by Washington  bureaucrats, pushes for a one-size-fits-all approach to vehicle  purchases.   The Biden administration's standards would mandate that two-thirds of  all new vehicles sold by 2032 be electric. The standards strong-arm  manufacturers into building cars that simply do not reflect market  demand.   In fact, last month nearly 4,000 car dealers from all 50 States  joined a letter to President Biden urging him to slow down the EPA's  proposed rule.   Just last week, Consumer Reports released a survey showing that  electric vehicles proved far less reliable than internal combustion  engine counterparts.   The survey found that EV model years 2021 through 2023 encountered  nearly 80 percent more problems compared to the conventional vehicles.  It is no wonder Ford and GM recently announced they are cutting back  investments in EV production and reassessing their EV production goals  for the first half of 2024. The American people just aren't buying  them.   Furthermore, the EPA's rule, if implemented, will increase the strain  on our electric grid at a time when misguided State and Federal energy  policies are already driving power plants to retirement.   With the passage of this legislation today, we can reaffirm our  support of the free market and consumer choice.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote in support of the  CARES Act today.
