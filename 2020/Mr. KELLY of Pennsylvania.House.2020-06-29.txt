 Madam Speaker, the objective of this bill  is to prop up the Affordable Care Act, so we want to pump money into  Medicaid the program and then impose price controls on prescription  drugs.   H.R. 1425 lifted the provision in Speaker Pelosi's drug bill, H.R. 3,  that gives the Secretary of HHS the power to set Medicare drug price  controls for pharmaceutical manufacturers and use it as a pay-for. The  savings from this price-setting power is meant for the expansion of the  Affordable Care Act.   Now, the facts are clear. Private investment in drug research and  development fuels the innovation ecosystem for the new medicines. It is  just that simple.   Madam Speaker, the Congressional Budget Office has already determined  that H.R. 3's negotiation provision would result in fewer cures. You  have to be especially tone deaf to introduce legislation that punishes  the very pharmaceutical companies that are going to innovate and mass- produce the vaccine the entire world is counting on to counter the  spread of COVID-19.   Last year, we were 80 percent of the way there on a bipartisan  measure before we got sidelined by H.R. 3 and legislation just like  this. Let's get back to the people's work and work together on  solutions that make sense, like H.R. 19, drug legislation that would  actually make it to the President's desk.   Now, with all that in mind, let's talk about who it is that we are  really talking for today, who it is that we represent on the people's  floor, and who it is that we are looking out for because too often this  becomes about November 3, 2020, and not about everyday lives back in  the Districts and the folks whom we represent.   I want to read a letter that I have read before because I think it  really deserves to be repeated. This was sent to me in October of 2019.   ``Dear Congressman Kelly: My name is Sara Stewart, and I'm from St.  Petersburg, Pennsylvania. It is my understanding that the House Ways  and Means Committee is having a public hearing on H.R. 3--the Lower  Drug Costs Now Act of 2019.''   This is the very H.R. 3, by the way, that is being included in H.R.  1425.   ``It appears this legislation does not have bipartisan support and  needs to take a more balanced approach. The balance is needed for  patients like my 10-year-old daughter Maddie.   ``Maddie suffers from a rare mitochondrial deletion condition called  Pearson's syndrome, which is a disorder that occurs as the result of  mutated genes in the body. These genes impact the mitochondria of her  cells and prevent them from producing enough energy for the body to  function properly. Pearson's syndrome is difficult to diagnose because  it affects each individual differently. Maddie's symptoms through the  years have included being blood transfusion dependent for several  years, the inability to heal after sun exposure damage, becoming type 1  diabetic, progressively losing her hearing and her vision, kidney  failure, and several other daily complications including developmental  delays when having a body that runs on limited energy. It has been  truly heartbreaking to see her endure this disease, but she continues  to defy the odds.''   This child is a 10-year-old.    ``My simple message to you, Mr. Kelly, and  the rest of the committee''--and the rest of Congress--``is: There is  no cure or treatments for Pearson's syndrome. Each day is a struggle to  keep Maddie balanced so her body is able to better cope with symptoms  of this terrible disorder. All we have, as well as many other families  across the world, is hope. Please, don't let partisan bickering impact  the ability of researchers to discover and innovate new therapies that  could save Maddie's life one day. The clock is ticking, and Maddie is  waiting.''   Madam Speaker, it simply comes down to this: if you want to develop  new drugs, then don't penalize the people who develop them. Don't hold  them as the bad guys when we require them. Please come up with  something to address COVID-19.                                time  1145
