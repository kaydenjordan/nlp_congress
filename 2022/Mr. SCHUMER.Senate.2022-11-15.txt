 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, first, on Respect for Marriage, the 117th  Congress will go down, I believe, as one of the most successful  Congresses we have seen in decades. We are all so proud of that fact.  Over the last 2 years, this Chamber has passed historic and bipartisan  bills that have covered everything from infrastructure to gun safety,  to CHIPS and Science, to veterans' aid, and more. Again, a common theme  for many of these bills was bipartisanship. Very soon, the Senate can  add to our accomplishments when we vote to proceed on the Respect for  Marriage Act.   For the information of all Senators, we will hold our first  procedural vote on this bill tomorrow, and after that, I hope both  sides can work quickly together to move this bill through the Senate  and on to the President's desk.   I firmly believe that passing bipartisan marriage protections would  be one of the more significant accomplishments in what has already been  a significantly productive Congress. It will do so much good for so  many people who want nothing more than to live their lives without the  fear of discrimination.    And make no mistake that passing the Respect for Marriage Act is as  personal as it gets for many of us in this Chamber--myself included--so  we want to get this done as soon as we can.   A mere decade ago, marriage discrimination was legal in many places  across the country. And just a few months ago, when the Supreme Court  overturned Roe, Justice Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion that  Obergefell, which recognized the constitutional right to same-sex  marriage, could similarly be overturned. I hope that never happens, but  the Senate can eliminate the risk of LGBTQ Americans having their  rights curtailed if we act now to codify marriage protections into law.   The Respect for Marriage Act is precisely the kind of bill that  Democrats and Republicans can rally around together and which Americans  across the country want to see us work on. It already passed the House  earlier this year with significant--47--Republican votes, and I am  optimistic we can achieve a similar result in this Chamber. Senators  Baldwin, Sinema, and a number of my Republican colleagues, including  Senators Collins and Portman and Tillis, have done excellent work  building support for this bill, and I want to recognize all their  efforts here on this floor.   I hope that, at minimum, 10 Republicans will be ready to throw their  support behind this sound, commonsense bill. Millions of people will be  better off if we are able to work together on this important and highly  personal issue, and so I urge all of us to vote yes when the time comes  to move forward tomorrow.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on the midterm elections and MAGA  Republicanism, over the past week, there has been a lot of discussion  here in Washington and across the media about how the results of these  midterms defied history and defied conventional wisdom.   I remember back in April and May: No way Democrats are going to keep  the majority. They are going to lose a whole bunch of seats. People are  asking what happened. Well, I think the answer, however, is rather  simple. This year, Democrats ran strong candidates. We compiled an  extremely strong legislative record, which the candidates could run on.  And Republicans, on the other hand, ran with flawed candidates who  spent more time talking about MAGA extremism than the things that truly  mattered to the American people.   After the failures--Republican failures--in elections in 2018 and  2020 and now in 2022, I hope the message is sinking in. If Republicans  continue to embrace MAGA radicalism, they are going to keep losing. So  for their own sake, but more importantly for the sake of the country, I  hope that very soon the GOP rejects the MAGA wing and makes a  commitment to work with Democrats in the next Congress.   The worst thing Republicans can do right now is to double down on the  MAGA platform and embrace gridlock. But, sadly, it seems that is the  path that some on the other side still want to take.   In fact, Senator Rick Scott of Florida, who notoriously led the  unsuccessful Republican Senate campaign efforts, recently suggested  that one of the reasons Republicans lost on election day was because  they actually worked too much with Democrats to pass bipartisan  legislation; that they weren't MAGA enough. That defies all logic.   If Republicans want to follow Rick Scott's lead, make our day.  Following Senator Scott is like following a blind man right over the  cliff.   Remember, it was Senator Scott who released a platform calling for  tax hikes on working and middle Americans, which our candidates  reminded people of in the election over and over again. It was Senator  Scott who threatened to put Medicare and Social Security on the  chopping block, which, again, was one of the most powerful arguments  for why Republicans were wrong for the country. And it was Senator  Scott who embraced Trump and believed that the MAGA wing was the road  to success; that denying the elections and spreading the Big Lie,  encouraging the MAGA extreme wing was the right thing to do. The  American people knew better.   American voters ran in the opposite direction and voted for  Democrats, including many Republicans, who said: I may be a Reagan  Republican, I may be a Bush Republican, but this Republican Party ain't  one for me.   After three failed elections--three in a row--it should be obvious  that embracing MAGA is a total loser for the Republican Party. If  anyone thinks otherwise, just look at what happened last night in  purple Arizona. Katie Hobbs, the Democratic nominee for Governor, was  declared the winner in her race against Kari Lake. Everyone thought  Kari Lake would win because of her communication skills, but even she  lost--proof positive that MAGA just doesn't work.   I earnestly hope that in the next couple of months, Republicans will  realize it is better for the country--and even better for their party-- to focus instead on working with Democrats over the next 2 years to get  things done for the American people.   Now, I know this is not going to happen overnight or in the next week  or two. Our immediate focus, of course, is the lameduck, where there is  a lot of work to be done. But when the dust settles come January and  Republicans have, hopefully, resolved some of their own internal  fights, we hope that at least some of them will realize that the  scorched-earth MAGA policy is a failure not only for America but for  them.   The usual pundits and skeptics and critics are saying: Oh, this won't  happen. But look at the major bills we did this summer, five of them  major bills, bipartisan, and before that, the BIF bill, the Postal  bill, all done bipartisan--significant legislation. We Democrats are  going to work hard to replicate that effort.   Americans are tired of the chaos. They are tired of the MAGA  insanity. They are tired of the MAGA attack on the very roots of our  democracy. They want leaders who will take their problems seriously.  Most Americans know that Donald Trump is out for himself and only  himself, even if it hurts democracy, even if it hurts the Republican  Party. Republicans should learn that lesson or risk even more failure  in the future.                            ____________________     Now, let me finish, Mr. President, on a truly  bittersweet note.   Over the many years I have had the honor of serving in public  service, I have learned that there are a handful of genuinely  irrefutable truths, and one of them that certainly applied for me  [[Page S6679]]  my whole career is that no Senator can hope to succeed without the help  of an amazing team of staffers who get you through the day, sometimes  merely get you through the hour. Another truth I have learned is that  there is never an easy way to say goodbye.   Today, both of those truths come together as I say goodbye to one of  my most trusted staffers, my amazing communications director, Justin  Goodman.   It is hard to remember the days before Justin was a part of my team.  Like so many on my staff, he first joined the office as an intern back  in the summer of 2009, where he quickly demonstrated his talent, his  dedication, and his knack for communications, which was obviously  totally an alien concept for me, shy as I might be.   A couple of years later, Justin returned to work at the DPCC as a  full-time member of my staff, and I am sure even he had no idea what  kind of roller coaster he was in for in the years to come.   Indeed, when he first joined my team as a full-time staffer, Congress  was in the midst of a brutal government shutdown, and he had to wait 3  whole weeks before being able to come to the office or get paid. What a  way to start. Well, that was his introduction to the Schumer operation.  And every day since then has been an absolute joy--for me at least,  maybe not always for him.   Over the years that Justin worked on my team, from his years leading  the DPCC to working as my national press secretary, to serving as my  communications director, he has become one of the people I lean on most  to get through the day. To call him indispensable would be an  understatement. One of the things I am going to miss is dialing 55 on  my cell phone about 50 times a day.   To describe Justin as one of the most decent people I know doesn't  even begin to touch it. So let the record show that Justin began his  time on my team in the midst of a shutdown and now departs as we finish  one of the most successful sessions in recent memory. It is a pretty  great record, if you ask me.   So, Justin--I don't want to look at you because I will get a little  weepy. So, Justin, thank you so much for your work over the many years.  My best to you. My very best to your loved ones and your new little  ones. And I don't think I need to tell you that you will always,  always, always be part of the family here in ``Schumerland.''   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
