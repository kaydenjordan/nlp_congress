 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 833 and ask that  it be reported by number.    Mr. President, my amendment helps ensure that the EPA  cannot, through regulation or otherwise, ban fracking in the United  States. This is an issue of energy independence, locking in our  CO2 emissions reduction provided by clean natural gas, and  it gives us time to find the cleanest, least expensive options down the  road.   Due to our American renaissance, the United States passed Russia as a  leading energy supplier in 2011 and passed Saudi Arabia in 2018.   But fracking has been a boon to the economy as well. According to the  Global Energy Institute, if fracking were banned in 2021, the U.S.  economy would lose 19 million jobs in 4 years, local and State tax  revenues would plummet, and gas prices would double. This is why  President Biden promised: We will not ban fracking; we will protect and  grow jobs.   Yet many in this body have called to ban fracking. The American  people deserve to know who stands with energy security and American  workers. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.
