 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding and for his incredible leadership in this body.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3110, the PUMP for Nursing  Mothers Act, a bipartisan bill I authored with Representative Herrera  Beutler. Our bill has also been introduced in the Senate by Senators  Merkley and Murkowski.   When I first came to Congress, working mothers would come to me,  often in tears, and advocate for a place to safely pump breast milk.  Often, they were fired, ridiculed, forbidden, or forced to pump milk in  bathrooms.   Since those years, I have worked for on-site lactation rooms, here in  government and really everywhere in our country.   In 1998, I passed a provision allowing State WIC agencies to purchase  breast pumps for new mothers, making it easier for low-income moms to  choose breastfeeding.   In 1999, Congress passed my bill to guarantee the right to breastfeed  on Federal property.   Most recently, Senator Merkley and I passed the Break Time for  Nursing Mothers as part of the Affordable Care Act. This act provides  employees with critical protections to provide break time for nursing  mothers and a private place to pump milk.   The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act we are considering today builds on  the Break Time Act by protecting the nearly 9 million employees who  were not originally included in these protections. Those covered by the  PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act now include teachers, nurses, farmworkers,  and software engineers, to name a few.   The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act would also ensure that nursing  mothers have remedies if their employers fire them or violate these  breastfeeding protections. In addition, if an employee is fired for  taking a break, the PUMP Act ensures that workers can seek  reinstatement.   It also extends breastfeeding protections for 2 years, in line with  recommendations from the World Health Organization.   Over 150 organizations have endorsed this important legislation. I  include in the Record letters of support from some of those  organizations, including the Center for WorkLife Law, and MomsRising,  to name a few.    Written Statement of the Center for WorkLife Law Before the United            States House of Representatives--September 24, 2021         Dear Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader McCarthy, Members of       the U.S. House of Representatives: The Center for WorkLife       Law submits this letter to the U.S. House of Representatives       in full support of the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections       (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act (H.R. 3110).        The Center for WorkLife Law is a research and advocacy       organization that seeks to advance gender, racial, and class       equity in employment and education. We collaborate with       employees, employers, attorneys, and government officials to       identify practical and legal solutions to work-family issues.        WorkLife Law's 2019 report Exposed: Discrimination Against       Breastfeeding Workers found that shortcomings of the existing       Break Time for Nursing Mothers law have caused lactating       employees to face significant obstacles at work. Even with       the current law's protections, breastfeeding employees       leaking milk have been denied permission to take pumping       breaks; they have been fired just for asking; and refused       privacy, forcing them to pump milk with their breasts exposed       to coworkers, clients, and the public in physically unsafe       conditions. Employees who do not receive the break time and       private space they need can face serious health consequences,       including illness and painful infections, diminished milk       supply, and weaning earlier than doctors recommend. Many       employees also suffer economic losses when they are fired or       forced to resign following a request for lactation       accommodations.        The PUMP Act would correct key shortcomings of existing law       that undermine the economic security and health of women and       their families.           Closing the Coverage Gap that Excludes Millions of Workers         Nearly 9 million women of childbearing age are currently       excluded from the protections of the Break Time for Nursing       Mothers Law, meaning they have no clear federal right to       receive break time and private space to pump milk during the       workday. This exclusion was unintentional at the time the law       was enacted. The resulting coverage gap is considerable and       impacts employees in a wide range of occupations, including       many of those working in the top two pink-collar occupations:       nursing and teaching. The PUMP Act would correct this       senseless exclusion to bring all workers whose employers are       covered by the FLSA under the law's protection.            Providing Appropriate Remedies to Encourage Compliance         Even when clear violations occur, the Break Time for       Nursing Mothers provision cannot be counted on to deliver       appropriate remedies in a court of law. Because employers       cannot be held accountable for intentional legal violations,       noncompliance has been widespread. As one judge expressed in       the case of an EMT who was fired simply for asking that she       be given break time and space: ``While the Court is       sympathetic to Plaintiff's argument that this renders [the       Nursing Mothers law] ineffective, there is no support from       the case law or DOL [Department of Labor]'' to provide a       remedy. Another federal judge observed: ``An employer faced       with a request to allow an employee to take breaks to       breastfeed may simply fire the employee rather than attempt       to accommodate the request for breaks. And indeed, the Center       for WorkLife Law has heard from too many workers whose       employers have done exactly that.        The PUMP Act would correct this absurdity and encourage       employers to follow the law by making remedies that are       already available in other employment law contexts equally       available to breastfeeding workers.        However, the PUMP Act is not expected to lead to a       significant increase in lawsuits. A recent analysis by the       Center for WorkLife Law found that while enforceable laws       increase breastfeeding rates, they do not cause a meaningful       increase in litigation rates. The study reviewed all cases       filed in each state with enforceable lactation break time and       space laws (similar to the PUMP Act) through 2020 and found:        Litigation rates for violations of the state laws were       extremely low. Over the combined forty-seven years that the       four jurisdictions' break time and space laws have been in       effect, there were only six (6) cases total.        The annual likeihood a private employer will be sued under       a break time and space law is essentially zero (0.0002       percent). A business owner is over 25 times more likely to be       struck by lightning in their lifetime.        Notably, the state laws WorkLife Law studied do not include       the additional employer protection found in the PUMP Act that       gives businesses 10 days to correct space violations before       any lawsuit can be filed, a provision that will further       decrease the number of lawsuits that would be filed should       the PUMP Act pass.        The PUMP Act is a balanced approach that meets the needs of       breastfeeding employees while also serving employers who make       reasonable attempts to follow the law. When employers have       clear standards to meet, and appropriate consequences if they       don't, employers have shown that they are able to provide the       break time and space that working mothers need. Complying       with break time and space requirements is simple, and       creative solutions exist in all industries. As described by       the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, employers       that support breastfeeding with affordable solutions realize       cost savings from increased loyalty and retention, reduced       sick time, and decreased health care and insurance costs.        Our organization urges all members of Congress to vote in       support because the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act would ensure       that all breastfeeding women have the full protection of the       law and ability to meet their basic needs while away from       their nursing babies during the workday. It is a simple       solution that promotes maternal and child health, as well as       the economic security of women and families.

Sincerely,                                                     Liz Morris,                                            Center for WorkLife Law,      UC Hastings College of the Law.                                   ____     Written Statement of Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner Co-Founder & Executive  Director, MomRising Before the United States House of Representatives--                            September 24, 2021         Dear Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader McCarthy, Members of       the U.S. House of Representatives: MomsRising submits this       letter to the U.S. House of Representatives in full support       of the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for       Nursing Mothers Act (H.R. 3110).        MomsRising is a national online and on-the-ground       grassroots organization with more than a million members       nationwide. We work on a broad range of issues and policies       to achieve economic security for all moms, women, and       families in the United States.        While nearly four out of five U.S. mothers start out       breastfeeding, less than half are still breastfeeding at six       months postpartum. One of the main causes for the drop-off in       breastfeeding rates is the lack of break time and a private       place to pump in the workplace. MomsRising members around the       country have shared their stories and pictures about needing       better places to pump breastmilk.        Currently, federal law requires employers for most hourly       wage-earning and some salaried employees (nonexempt workers)       reasonable break time and a private, non-bathroom location to       express breast milk for one year after the child's birth,       This is a great first step, but it leaves millions of workers       without any protections at all. We must close the gap in the       law and expand protections for all breastfeeding mothers who       work outside of the home. The PUMP Act will close gaps and       include meaningful enforcement.        Breastfeeding isn't just good for moms and babies. The fact       is that breastfeeding is good for the physical and economic       health of our nation. Recent studies have shown if mothers       could meet current medical recommendations for breastfeeding       it would save the US economy nearly $13 billion per year in       paediatric health costs and premature deaths.        With three-quarters of moms being the primary or co-      breadwinner these days, we must close the gap in existing law       and expand protections for all breastfeeding mothers who work       outside of the home. Sadly returning to work is too often a       significant barrier to breastfeeding, but we can do better.        Please support all breastfeeding and working moms and       support the PUMP Act.        Thank you for your consideration,                                        Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner,                                    Co-Founder & Executive Director,                                                         MomRising.     MALONEY of New York. As these organizations have  demonstrated, without these protections, nursing mothers face serious  health consequences, including the risk of painful illness and the  inability to continue to breastfeed.   Studies have shown the health benefits for breastfed infants. It is  really important and can prevent other diseases.   These basic protections would ensure that working moms who want to  breastfeed can continue to do so and prevent nursing mothers from being  singled out, ridiculed, or fired.   This bill is an important step for work-family balance. We say we  support families. Today is a vote for families, work-family balance,  and mothers and infants.   Madam Speaker, I urge a strong ``yes'' bipartisan vote.                                time  0930     MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise strongly  in support of the amendment offered by Representative Deborah Ross from  North Carolina, and I thank her for her leadership in North Carolina  and here in Congress for working mothers, for infants, for families. We  need more work-family balance. We need more support for working  mothers.   We now know with COVID that many families are not going back to work;  they are reassessing their values. When you have a child and you want  to breastfeed, and there is no accommodation, there really is no way  you can go back to work, so this is pro-business, pro-worker, and pro- family.   Her amendment directs the U.S. Government Accountability Office, GAO,  to conduct a study on how employers are complying with the PUMP for  Nursing Mothers Act. Even the best legislation must be monitored.   I am excited about the opportunity to ensure that employers are  protecting the rights of nursing mothers. It is pro-family when you  protect our mothers and our children.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding and for her leadership on this important bill.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support the amendment offered by  Representative Strickland from Washington. It is sensitive, important,  and strengthens the bill. It directs the Comptroller General to conduct  a study on racial disparities in breastfeeding and submit  recommendations to Congress that address those disparities.   As a member of the Black Maternal Health Caucus, we are studying  disparities in this caucus on healthcare and the challenges that some  women face.   Breastfeeding contains many health benefits for children and for  their mothers and should be accessible to all women no matter what  their race, and we should study any disparity and try to strengthen  access and availability.   This is an excellent amendment, and I support the gentlewoman for her  work and sensitivity.
