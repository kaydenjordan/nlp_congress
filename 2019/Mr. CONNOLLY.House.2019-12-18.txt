 Madam Speaker, each of us here took an oath to protect  and defend the Constitution of the United States, not the President,  and not our political party.   Today, history will judge. Did we abide that oath?   To extort a foreign country to investigate your political opponent is  an unconstitutional abuse of power. To solicit foreign interference in  an American election is an unconstitutional abuse of power.   The need to protect against just such abuses prompted our Founders to  grant the sole power of impeachment to this House.   The delicate balance of power that underpins our democracy is  threatened when a President disregards the Constitution by obstructing  Congress' power in order to cover up illegal behavior. In doing that,  President Trump violated his oath.                                time  1430    Today, we must put country over party, conscience over complicity.  Today, we must assert no one is above the law. Today, we are summoned  by history to do the right thing.
