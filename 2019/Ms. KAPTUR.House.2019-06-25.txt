 Mr. President, American workers and organized labor do  not support your renegotiated NAFTA. Corporate America and wealthy  elites might, but don't make any effort to sell NAFTA's half-baked,  repackaged broken promises to our workers, be they industrial or  farmhands. You defy the liberty of our democracy when corporate elites  speak as the democratic process.   The promise of higher wages and returning jobs is not to be believed  without engagement to ensure the dignity of labor, of labor rights, and  labor enforcement on this continent.   Hidden between the lines of the current NAFTA text are dollar signs  and profits for self-dealing, transnational corporations that have  outsourced our jobs, and very wealthy lobbyists who negotiated NAFTA  2's deal. They do not prioritize living-wage jobs, family-sustaining  wages, or workers' environmental safety and health conditions across  America. NAFTA 2 is still an escalator to the bottom for workers in  industrial plants and farmhands.   The ravages NAFTA inflicted on America's workers are etched across  American communities devastated by the outsourcing of factories, many  left in economic ruin. NAFTA served as the ``model'' of modern  integration of First World and emerging world economies. It was  replicated in Central America with what is called CAFTA-DR. The same  plundering of non-rich communities ensued throughout Mexico and Central  America. Many fell victim then to drug cartels and gangs, overridden  with violence. Economic hope further vanished.    Many of those refugees are coming to our borders, if we but  understand the force driving them.   Today's proposed new NAFTA will be worse. In the quarter century  under NAFTA, more than a million American jobs were outsourced, our  workers' wages stagnated, and U.S. trade deficits with Mexico and  Central American countries increased exponentially, not just a little  bit.   The minimum million jobs lost in our country are only those that are  certified. Can you imagine how many other jobs were lost related as  suppliers to those jobs?   Our Nation lost thousands of jobs to penny-wage environments where  workers could not even afford to buy what they made as they toiled in  sweatshops, which I have visited in the maquiladoras, exposed to  unimaginable toxins. And millions upon millions of Mexico's small  farmers were obliterated due to NAFTA.   This man knew the fate that would be dealt him back in 1993, and it  was. This is a Mexican farmer that no longer holds his land.   The original NAFTA fueled massive migration from Mexico's countryside  to our Nation, as thousands of very, very, small farmers had their  livelihoods extinguished. A minimum of 2 million--million--Mexican  farmers were displaced as U.S. agricultural products, heavily  subsidized, flowed tariff-free south over a 10-year period, and  Mexico's white corn industry was decimated.   Does anybody here care?   Wages in Mexico have gone down under NAFTA, and U.S. wages and  benefits have been stuck for the majority of over a quarter century in  our country.   Due to NAFTA and CAFTA nations alone, our southern neighbors stock us  with fresh produce. Meanwhile, our multinational grain outfits send  millions and millions of tons of feed grain down there, displacing  Mexico's farmers, and creating an endless flow of desperate, cheap  labor across this continent.   Some very powerful people must love this system, as ordinary,  hardworking people are quashed across this country and held in bondage.   America must wake up to the impact our trade deals impose on people.  Surely our own citizens, but also people who are exploited from other  places when you have unequal economies that are joined at the hip by  transnationals who don't give a hoot about people.   When multinational corporate interests dominate negotiations, and  they have a heavy thumb on the scales of economic justice across the  Americas, trade with our closest neighbors is never simply a zero-sum  game, because too few control those levers of negotiating power.   It is no surprise that nearly half a million migrants have been taken  into custody at our southern borders this year alone. Half a million.  In the past, undocumented immigrants were overwhelmingly single men  from Mexico, but that flow has changed.   As the President continues to negotiate NAFTA, I urge him to include  an enforceable labor rights section, a Labor Secretariat in NAFTA 2, or  this exploitation will continue.   Let's stop NAFTA 2.    Madam Speaker, I thank our able chairwoman, Nita Lowey  from New York, for yielding me this time. I come to the floor to urge  my colleagues to support this emergency supplemental request to address  the humanitarian cry on our southern border.   It aims to save lives and health. All people of conscience know it is  urgently needed. These funds are vital to ensure the health and safety  of these migrant refugees and migrant children.   A record number of desperate families and unaccompanied children have  crossed into the United States, and our Border Patrol, Immigration and  Customs Enforcement, and Office of Refugee Resettlement are simply  overwhelmed.   Just this week, we learned that four toddlers being held in a Border  Patrol  [[Page H5157]]  station in McAllen, Texas, had to be hospitalized because of dangerous  neglect.   The AP reported last week that children have been locked up in Border  Patrol facilities for as many as 27 days without adequate food, water,  and sanitation, for heaven's sake.   This administration has failed to provide detained children with  soap, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and beds, and it doesn't have the  resources to adequately address flu and lice epidemics in these  facilities.   News reports say children are caring for other children. Five  children have died in Customs and Border Protection custody since late  last year.   The situation is getting worse. Our Nation needs a comprehensive and  continental diplomatic solution that acknowledges the economic and  political conditions pushing Central American and Mexican communities  to the brink. The only option, in desperation, for these people is to  flee north.   We need comprehensive immigration reform that respects all  continental laborers and migrants. President John F. Kennedy had a name  for it. He called it the Alliance for Progress.   Today, this Congress must meet the immediate need to provide  financial support to end the humanitarian neglect confronting these  travel-weary migrants.   This $4.5 billion emergency spending will provide adequate support  for key priorities, including legal assistance, food, water, medical  services, support services for unaccompanied children, alternatives to  detention, and refugee services.    Most importantly, this spending correctly includes  restrictions to hold this administration accountable on how it spends  taxpayer dollars in a capacity that protects the rights and dignity of  desperate people who happen to be migrants.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lowey for working so hard to bring  this bill to the floor, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this  lifesaving supplemental.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  DeGette) having assumed the chair, Ms. Shalala, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3351)  making appropriations for financial services and general government for  the fiscal year ending September 30, 2020, and for other purposes, had  come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
