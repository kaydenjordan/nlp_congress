 Madam President, I understand there are two measures  at the desk due a second reading en bloc.    Madam President, in order to place the measures on the  calendar under provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceedings en bloc.    Madam President, last night, our colleagues Chairman  Shelby and Ranking Member Leahy filed the final text of a bipartisan,  bicameral legislative agreement. For the past couple of weeks, in  conference with their House counterparts, they have worked in good  faith to reach a compromise to address urgent priorities, including  funding for our Nation's border security.   The product of this work is a compromise that no side will view as a  perfect deal. For instance, I am frustrated by House Democrats' cynical  opposition to including commonsense extensions of the Violence Against  Women Act and other important items. Nevertheless, this agreement is  something both sides should view as an important step, and today, I  hope we will vote to advance it.   When the Senate votes on the agreement, we will be voting to avoid a  second partial shutdown and provide the certainty of a fully  functioning Federal Government. We will be voting to deliver another  downpayment on the President's commitment to securing our Nation's  borders and keeping American communities safe. And we will do it free  from the influence of poison pills that sought to derail progress and  stifle compromise.   To be sure, in recent months, we have seen the radical left go out of  its way to try to gum up the works. Even the Speaker of the House threw  her support behind wild assertions that tried-and-true methods of  securing sovereign borders were now immoral. They said there wouldn't  be more than one dollar for border barriers. They said there should be  fewer tools for the men and women who enforce our immigration laws.  Fortunately, none of that nonsense has carried the day.   So here we are, with a solemn deal in front of us. As the Senate  prepares to vote later today, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to  Chairman Shelby, along with Ranking Member Leahy and my colleagues on  the Appropriations Committee. This legislation will mark success for  our bipartisan process by finalizing all the regular appropriations  bills for the fiscal year. Thanks, as well, to Shannon Hines and the  entire Appropriations staff, whose hard work made this agreement and  all of last year's progress possible.   Later today, I hope each of my colleagues will join me in moving  forward with the agreement produced by this hard work, and the  President will sign it into law.
