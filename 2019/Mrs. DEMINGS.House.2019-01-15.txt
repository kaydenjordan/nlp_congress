 Madam Speaker, it is surely a shame that it is  necessary in the year 2019 for the U.S. Congress to denounce white  nationalism in Congress.   As a police officer, I worked white supremacist rallies. The words  alone hurt enough, but as a police officer, I also saw vicious acts of  violence by those inspired by those hateful words.   Words do have consequences, and if you promote hateful, ignorant  beliefs, then you will be held accountable. Certainly, Congress should  lead the way.   This week, the ignorance of white nationalism was defended by one of  my colleagues. Today, as we recognize Dr. King's birthday, I am  reminded that Dr. King called on all Americans to enlist in a crusade  finally to end the race question and make it an ugly relic of a dark  past. But still we know hate crimes are on the rise. We understand why.   Madam Speaker, if we are who we say we are, a great nation, one  nation with liberty and justice for all, then we all must exercise our  power and take a stand so strong that even the white supremacists  cannot ignore it.
