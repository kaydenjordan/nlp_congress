 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Keller) for hosting this Special Order this evening and for leading the  charge on the Congressional Review Act.   President Biden is characterizing his agenda with three simple words:  Build Back Better. More appropriately, it should be build back broke.   Our economy is in shambles, our supply chain strained to the breaking  point, and inflation is out of control, and our friends across the  aisle refuse to recognize that. At the heart of all these lies, lies a  devastating labor shortage.   A few commonsense measures would address these problems to bring an  end to the many crises, but President Biden instead chose to mandate  vaccinations for workers, forcing small businesses to either fire their  workers or face large fines.   Earlier today, OSHA announced that it will suspend enforcement of  Biden's immoral and unconstitutional vaccine mandate after being  blocked by the Fifth Circuit Court. Biden and his puppeteers knew that  this mandate would likely not be held up in court but still went  through with it anyway, proving their allegiance to the radical  socialist mob rather than to the Constitution of these great United  States.   To every American who raised your voice up and stood up to the gross  Federal overreach, this victory is for you. I am proud to stand with my  colleagues in opposition to this government overreach.
