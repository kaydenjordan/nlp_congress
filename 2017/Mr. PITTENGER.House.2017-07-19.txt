 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Monsignor John  McSweeney, priest of Charlotte's St. Matthew Catholic Church, the  largest Catholic parish in America, who retires this week after more  than 40 years of ministry.   He was actually the first priest ordained in what was then the new  Charlotte Diocese back in 1974. Monsignor McSweeney is committed to the  principle of servant leadership and of helping each member of his  parish find their special God-given role in life and in the church.   Despite his very public role, he often reminds folks that Jesus is  the star of St. Matthew, not the priest. Monsignor McSweeney has  another motto: ``You never say no to Jesus.''   And so, still listening to Jesus at age 75, Monsignor McSweeney is  retiring from America's largest Catholic parish to move on to Haiti or  Jamaica to live among the poor and minister to their needs.   May God bless Monsignor McSweeney in this next phase of ministry.                            ____________________
