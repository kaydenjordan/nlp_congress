 Mr. Speaker, we are putting our money  where our mouth is. The dedicated team at Franklin-Vance-Warren  Opportunity, Incorporated is shaping our future by ensuring young  people in northeastern North Carolina are getting off to a good start.   At the Henderson Head Start Center, I attended Ms. Kearney's class  and read the first book to first-time students on the first day of  school. The book was ``First Day Jitters.'' However, there were no  jitters in her classroom.   Federal investments such as Head Start and Early Head Start make a  huge difference. We are preparing young minds for a brighter future, to  live the American Dream.   Many thanks to Abdul Sm Rasheed, the executive director; Naima  Mosley, the Head Start director; Ms. Kearney; and all early childhood  educators for their unwavering commitment. I also thank Sheriff Curtis  Brame for letting the kids hold his badge and letting them know that  they can do anything by putting their minds to it.   Ms. Mosley, indeed, Head Start rocks.                            ____________________
