 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 241.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak as well on the  Working Families Flexibility Act.   Over a period of time, a lot of the rules and regulations that this  body has passed, it becomes apparent they are one-size-fits-all and  lack common sense. I am glad to be a cosponsor of this bill which gives  people the flexibility, if they work more than 40 hours in a week, they  can take the cash if they need the cash. But for some people, either  because of life circumstances or because they are just less  materialistic, they don't want that cash. They would rather spend time  with their family.   I think particularly in today's world where so many people live in  two-parent families in which both people work, a lot of people would  love to spend a day with their children instead of having their  children in daycare. I think it is right that people should have the  freedom to do that. We recognize for government employees we frequently  have comp time in which if they work more than 40 hours a week, they  can come back, spend more time with their family, or maybe just spend  more time on recreation.   It is high time we give that freedom to people in the private sector,  high time to put family first, and we all have to remember that even  though some people always want more money, some people say there are  other things in life that are more important.
