 Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the Minnesota  delegation as we honor the life and mourn the passing of our colleague,  Jim Hagedorn of Blue Earth, Minnesota.   Public service was a defining feature in the life of Representative  Hagedorn. As a young man, he worked here in the House for 7 years as a  legislative assistant with Congressman Arlan Stangeland. He then served  as a legislative and congressional affairs officer for two U.S.  Department of Treasury agencies, the Financial Management Service and  the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.   Since 2019, Congressman Hagedorn represented the cities, towns, and  farms of southern Minnesota's First Congressional District.   On the Small Business and Agriculture Committees, Jim worked to  expand broadband access to rural communities, as well as provide  additional support for farmers and ranchers during the pandemic.   Even as Jim bravely endured the personal challenge of cancer  treatment, he did so with dignity and grace. Jim continued to serve our  country and his constituents.   Despite our policy differences on many issues, Jim and I were united  in the common goal of achieving greater opportunities for future  generations of Minnesotans.   I offer my deepest condolences to Jim's family, his friends, his  staff, and the people of the First Congressional District during this  difficult time.   Minnesota's Congressional district delegation is grateful for  Congressman Hagedorn's service to our country.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer).    Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Minnesota delegation  and on behalf of the great State of Minnesota, I respectfully ask that  we recognize the life of Congressman Jim Hagedorn with a moment of  silence.    Madam Speaker, I offer a privileged resolution and ask  for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 949         Resolved, That the House. has heard with profound sorrow of       the death of the Honorable James L. Hagedorn, a       Representative from the State of Minnesota.        Resolved, That the Clerk communicate these resolutions to       the Senate and transmit a copy thereof to the family of the       deceased.        Resolved, That when the House adjourns today, it adjourn as       a further mark of respect to the memory of the deceased.
