 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Christopher  Friese, a congressional fellow on my staff, be granted floor privileges  for the duration of the debate on the Better Care Reconciliation Act.    Mr. President, I rise, as well, to talk tonight about the  issue of healthcare. I thank my colleague from Connecticut for looking  down the road to when, maybe, we can actually work together on this  issue. We are in conflict this week, and that is not a place any of us  want to be.   We are in conflict because of the elements of this bill. I will make  two basic points in my remarks tonight, one about Medicaid and then one  point about another provision in the bill that I think is particularly  insulting.   A lot of our discussions start with policy and data, and that is  important. That is obviously part of the debate about the bill and what  is in it and what impact it will have on programs and people over a  long period of time, but part of this debate, of course, is about the  people we represent. I know the Presiding Officer understands this, and  I am heartened that he is paying attention to our arguments because  sometimes--I have done it myself--when you preside, sometimes you are  doing something else. So we are grateful for his attention.   I have talked on this floor a couple of times over the last couple of  weeks--even months--and I will not repeat the stories because they have  been told a number of times, but Rowan Simpson is a young man whom I  recently just met. His mom had sent me a letter. Rowan is on the autism  spectrum, and his mom is very worried about his future because of the  potential impact on Medicaid and the benefits he is getting today from  Medicaid.   I just referred the other day--I guess it was Thursday on the floor-- to a letter from a dad about his son Anthony, who has a number of  challenges, one of them being that he is on the autism spectrum. I have  another letter, as well, which I will not go through tonight, but it is  from a mom in Northeastern Pennsylvania, who wrote to me about two of  her children--principally, her son who has Type 1 diabetes and what the  loss of Medicaid coverage will mean for that child, who, in this case,  is just 4 years old.   Everyone in this Chamber in both parties has stories like this to  tell--stories about people who are, because of a disability, totally  dependent upon Medicaid. That is not unique to one State, and, of  course, it is not unique to one party.  [[Page S3773]]    One of the more egregious and objectionable parts of this 140-plus  page bill is the impact it will have on Medicaid--the Medicaid  expansion, which many people now know represents probably on the order  of 11 million people who got healthcare coverage since 2010 and got  that coverage because Medicaid was expanded. But the bill also speaks  to the Medicaid Program itself by the so-called per capita cap, capping  the dollars the Federal Government would provide in the future with  regard to the Federal-State partnership on Medicaid. These are big  stakes when it comes to a program that has been with us for 50 years.   As everyone knows, Medicaid is principally about individuals with  disabilities, and that is obviously those children I mentioned. It is  about folks who need some help getting into a nursing home, senior  citizens. Of course, it is about kids from low-income families who have  no other healthcare, absent Medicaid. In our State, there happen to be  1.1 million kids on Medicaid who are from low-income families. The  disability number in both children and adults is, by one estimate, more  than 722,000 people. These are big stakes, even if it is just involving  one of those individuals or hundreds or thousands. But as I will refer  to later, some of the numbers are, of course, a lot higher than that.  So those stories and those pleas for help from those families obviously  do not just inform us, but they inspire us to keep working, to keep  fighting. I will be fighting against this bill as long as it takes.   It is likely that we will have a vote this week. I am assuming we  will, so we have only hours and a few days to fight and point out what  we believe to be the defects. One of the things that is significant  about this debate is that we have had people not just writing those  stories and telling us their story but also telling us and giving us  ideas about how to conduct the debate and how to fight and how to  oppose it.   I have in my hand--I will describe it first before I offer a consent  request. I have in my hand several pages that list almost 600 names  from people in Pennsylvania who have written to me over the last number  of weeks and months, actually. What they are urging me to do is to  pursue a legislative strategy to protect their healthcare. Why are they  doing that? It is not because they have nothing else to do. They are  worried. These people are really worried. They are worried about those  kids like Rowan and Anthony, whom I just mentioned, and a 4-year-old  with Type 1 diabetes or a whole long list of other disabilities a lot  of kids have. They are worried about their parents, who may not be able  to get the long-term care they need if Medicaid is capped and cut and  decimated. They are worried about their friends and their families.  They are, in a word, as worried as anyone has ever been about the  healthcare of those they love and the healthcare of those they care  about. That is why they have been writing and going to meetings and  making phone calls and engaging in such a robust way, all these weeks  and months.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list of almost 600  names from Pennsylvanians be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Ashley De Padua, Carol Ribner, Lisa Brown, Adam Huard,       Julie Strauss, Amy Reynolds, Dianne Spatafore, Pamela Nolan,       Karin Fox, Claire Witzleben, Wendy Albertson, Laura Rose,       John Mack Jr., Elizabeth Failor, Lisa Bargielski, Peg Welch,       Jason Carnahan, Robert Perry, Morgan Vinokurovi, Melissa       Byrne.

Mr. President, I will make two final points about Medicaid  and then juxtapose Medicaid with another part of the bill. If you look  at the bill--it is about 140, I guess, 142 pages--more than 60 pages  deal with Medicaid. So this is principally a bill about Medicaid. There  are some other issues, obviously, addressed on the exchanges and the  fundamentals of healthcare. But it is mostly about Medicaid and tax  cuts, unfortunately; and that is particularly objectionable to me that  you have a small group of very wealthy people who are going to make out  in ways we can't even imagine, like a big bonanza for the superrich.    Now, let me just talk about the Medicaid part of it first, and then I  will refer to a chart. I am holding in my hand the Congressional Budget  Office report from today, which came out. It, of course, is a document  produced by the Congressional Budget Office as well as the Joint  Committee on Taxation so it is a joint effort.   On the CBO--so-called CBO Congressional Budget Office report,  recently--a couple weeks ago now--on page 17 of that document, there  was an assessment made of the number of people who would lose Medicaid  as a result of the House bill, and that number was 14 million Americans  would lose Medicaid over the decade up until 2026.   Well, unfortunately, as of 4 p.m. or something this afternoon--I  guess about 4 p.m., 4:30--we got the Congressional Budget Office  assessment of the Senate bill, the Senate bill that was unveiled last  week. Not on page 17 of this report but actually on page 16, here is  what the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on  Taxation says about enrollment in Medicaid. I am quoting from the  bottom of page 16:         Enrollment in Medicaid would be lower throughout the coming       decade, with 15 million fewer Medicaid enrollees by 2026 than       projected under current law in CBO's March 2016 baseline.    Then, they refer to a figure in the report.   So the House bill CBO assessment says 14 million will lose Medicaid  coverage. The Senate bill, analyzed by CBO, which is supposed to be a  more moderate bill, a better bill in the eyes of some Republican  Members of the House and the Senate, that was supposed to be better,  but here is what we know now: 15 million people will lose Medicaid.  That alone should cause any Senator to be very concerned about the  impact of this legislation. That alone should, I hope, require some  people to use an old expression: Examine your conscience about what  will happen if you vote for this legislation.   Let's say someone says: Do you know what? I can put that into  context, and I think actually that will not happen or I have another  explanation or whatever justification or rationale you use for voting  for a bill that will result in 15 million people losing Medicaid  coverage. People are very vulnerable. Let's just say you can analyze  that a different way and come to a different conclusion. We will see  how people deal with that number this week when they go home and when  they have to talk about this legislation over time.   Here is where it gets a lot worse. This is a chart that is rather  simple. Even though it has a lot of data on it, it is rather simple.  Here is what it says at the top. First of all, this isn't my chart; it  is the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities' chart. You can go to  cbpp.org to see it.   This is based upon the House bill, but I just told you that the  Medicaid enrollment number is 1 million higher--or that the number  losing Medicaid is 1 million higher under the Senate bill, and the tax  cuts that are in the Senate bill are almost identical. You can just go  down and count them. The House and Senate bill are virtually identical  on tax cuts.   Here is what the headline is: Tax cuts for the top 400 roughly equal  to Federal spending cuts from ending Medicaid expansion.   Now, remember, I said before that Medicaid expansion is one problem I  see. The per capita cap is another. This chart just deals with one of  the Medicaid problems--Medicaid expansion--so ending Medicaid expansion  in Nevada, West Virginia, Arkansas, and Alaska, just four States,  right? Alaska, they project, will lose $2 billion worth of Medicaid  over the decade, Arkansas would lose $7 billion, West Virginia would  lose $12 billion, and Nevada would lose $12 billion. That adds up to  $33 billion Federal Medicaid cuts from ending Medicaid expansion. So  $33 billion dollars just for States. By the way, these are not really  high-population States. There is no California, New York, Texas or big  States like that. So $33 billion lost in Medicaid in just those four  States.   What does this orange bar graph show? The same number, $33 billion  tax cut for the 400 highest income households in the country. It is the  same number. So 400 households get a tax cut of $33 billion, not in  some other bill down the road, not in some other year, not in a budget  bill or a tax bill. They get this massive tax cut in what is called a  healthcare bill. At the same time, it is equivalent to the total  Medicaid lost in just four States.   It gets worse if you add more States. Guess what. If you add up about  30 States in a different chart, it is about the same as all the tax  cuts together, but here we are just talking about four States and 400  families.   I hope I am not offending anyone if they are in those top 400  households who are making either billions or, by one estimate, the  average might be $300 million. I know it has been difficult to make  ends meet. You have been struggling and trying to pay the mortgage and  the light bill when you are one of the top 400 richest households in  the country.   But this chart, when you juxtapose this chart--and especially the  orange part, the tax cut for 400 families, the giveaway to families who  don't need it. Frankly, they don't even want this tax cut. I haven't  found one person who came up to me in the last couple of years and  said: You know what, I wish my taxes didn't go up. I wish those  [[Page S3775]]  taxes didn't go up while you were trying to help people on Medicaid.  Not a single person said that.   Most people who will get this tax cut would rather that we make sure  we take care of those children I mentioned with the disability or those  families who need the protection of Medicaid.   When you put this chart next to the policy and those 60-plus pages of  the decimation of Medicaid, there are a lot of words we could use that  we are not allowed to use on this floor, but one of the words we should  use is ``obscene.'' That is an obscenity. When you match these cuts for  400 families next to the cuts to Medicaid, that is obscene, obnoxious,  and bad policy.   If there was ever a reason to take this 142-page bill and throw it in  the trash, throw it in a garbage pail as fast as we can, it would be  this chart because that is not what the American people are asking for.  They actually think some people in the Senate are actually working on a  healthcare bill. That is what they believe. A lot of people don't know  about this yet, but they are going to know. They are going to know by  the end of the week, at least, if not sooner, that the 400 richest  households in the country are getting that much money--$33 billion.  Maybe in the Senate bill it is only $32 billion or $31 billion, so we  will stand corrected if it goes down, but that is really an  abomination. That is an insult to the American people. People should be  ashamed this is part of that bill.   I get it. We can have a debate about Medicaid. I get that, but when  you are taking Medicaid dollars and transferring to wealthy people, no  one should support that kind of a policy, but that is what we have.  That is what we are up against.   If there was ever a reason to fight to the ends of the Earth against  a piece of legislation, it is this. We are going to continue to fight  this. We are going to continue to point out this basic inequity, this  insult for the rest of this week.   We hope folks on both sides of the aisle will not only be listening,  but we hope our Republican friends will take another look at this bill  and understand how objectionable this is to so many American families.  All of that worry I talked about before is made worse, is aggravated by  this kind of result when it comes to tax cuts.   We can do all that as a great nation. We can make sure wealthy folks  who need a break once in a while--they have gotten a lot of them in the  last 25 years--that they can get a fair tax code. We could also make  sure kids with disabilities, seniors, and kids in rural areas and big  cities and small towns can get the healthcare they need from Medicaid.  We are a great country. We can do that. We can have a growing economy  and still support a critically important program like Medicaid.   I yield the floor.
