 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to urge my colleagues to  support amendment No. 53 to H.R. 4665 that puts an end to international  organizations circumventing our immigration laws.   The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration is an  anchor that ties down our Nation's right to determine our own  immigration policies and handcuffs our government from acting in its  own best interest. The United Nations should not be making immigration  laws for our country.   President Trump pulled us out of this compact; President Biden, I  believe, wrongfully put us back in. What this amendment does is it  restricts any funding that will go to compliance with this.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I will quote Ambassador Nikki Haley,  who said:         While we will continue to engage on a number of fronts at       the United Nations, in this case, we simply cannot in good       faith support a process that could undermine the sovereign       right of the United States to enforce our immigration laws.    We don't need to outsource our lawmaking to the United Nations. One  of the compact issues that I have is that it strongly encourages  migrants who do not have permission to stay in the country of  destination, they are able to return to their country preferably on a  voluntary basis.   The United Nations should not be making immigration law for the  United States. If we are admitting--which I am happy to hear my  colleague admit--that we do have a crisis, the last thing we are going  to admit on either side is that it is, in fact, orderly, which is what  this compact seeks to achieve in an international body.   Mr. Chair, I support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I urge adoption, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment ends the United  Nations International Organization for Migration taxpayer-funded slush  funds, commonly referred to as the Refugee Travel Loan Program. While  this may be a noble idea, a lot of Americans don't realize that what  this money does is it first flows through the nongovernmental  organizations that then, cheerfully, take a cut of that, 25 percent.   Mr. Chair, 25 percent of all of these moneys go through NGOs and they  keep 25 percent. It is turned into a loan that is obviously never paid  back. These numbers of refugees are continuing to be encouraged, and  the caps continue to be encouraged to be raised by these  nongovernmental organizations that are making money off of this  program.   Mr. Chair, I would say to anyone who is for this, I hope they will  join me in reforming this program, but until then, I don't think it is  wise to spend American taxpayer dollars on something that is just  enriching these NGOs on the backs of the American taxpayer.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, it is true that this is issued as a  loan, but  [[Page H4784]]  less than 1 percent of these have been paid back. These aren't real  loans; these are giveaways of taxpayer dollars to refugees.   I don't have a problem supporting legitimate refugees, but what  really bothers me is that these nongovernment organizations are taking  a 25 percent cut. So the refugees are not even getting the total amount  of this loan, but the enriched nongovernment organizations are.   That is why you hear from groups like Lutheran Family Services,  Jewish Family Services, and Catholic Charities that say: We are happy  to help with this refugee problem. We are happy to go down to the  border. We are happy to help facilitate this loan program because we  know that we are not going to be on the hook for any of this money, it  is the American taxpayer. In fact, we are going to get a 25 percent cut  of whatever fake loan we give out.   Mr. Chair, it is really un-American to force the American taxpayer to  fund this ridiculous program. The fact that we have charitable  organizations profiting off of it and encouraging more and more of it  is offensive to me, as well.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1345     Mr. Chairman, I urge passage, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
