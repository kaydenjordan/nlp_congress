 Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 66, which  would establish the Route 66 Centennial Commission.   The historic Route 66, The Main Street of America, travels through  Galena, Riverton, and Baxter Springs, Kansas in my district.   While the 13 miles of Route 66 in Kansas may be the shortest stretch,  it certainly has its fair share of history and beauty.   From inspiring the animated movie character ``Tow Mater'' in Cars, to  being the very definition of `the open road'.   Route 66 is a staple of hometown America--and there is no better  representation of hometown America than in these three Southeast Kansas  communities.   Route 66 is not only an economic driver, it is part of the identity  of the community.   I am thrilled to see Congress is taking proactive steps towards the  revitalization and preservation of Route 66 and I urge my colleagues to  join me in support of this legislation.
