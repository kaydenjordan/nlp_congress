 Mr. Speaker, we had another week go by, and I didn't  see the Vice President in charge of the Mexican border policy for this  administration down there, so I felt I should go down and look around  in the Yuma sector and report back to her or anybody in the majority  party who wants to hear.   These are the things that I don't think we have seen in the papers. I  could talk for hours.   One thing, a large number of the people crossing the border in the  Yuma sector are throwing away their IDs on the ground. And if you want,  you can just stand there along the paths and see all the IDs that are  just lying there.   You have to ask yourself, why, if I am an immigrant, am I throwing  away my ID before I check in with Border Patrol? I must be hiding  something. It means that they can't do a background check if I was in  the United States in the past, or, for that matter, there is going to  be no record of when such and such a person left Colombia and comes  into the United States. We should require an ID to come here. We should  no longer let people throw them out.   Secondly, I, in the past, am under the impression that people can  test positive for COVID, check into a hotel and just leave and come  into the country. I now know they do not require tests.   These are two more things I learned at the border. I invite the Vice  President to go down there.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I urge the American people not to take  their eyes off the ball. I honestly sometimes believe the reason the  majority party is putting people like Steve Bannon in the headlines, or  mandatory vaccines, as horrible as they are, or driving up the cost of  gas to over $3 per gallon, it is to cause the American public to avert  their eyes from the most long-term dangerous policy that the Biden  administration is implementing, and that is what is going on, on the  border.   I was down on the border last Thursday in the Yuma sector. So the  American public understands, there are nine sectors along the border,  and every time I go down there, I find more things that should scare  the American people to death.   First of all, we have just the sheer number of people who are  crossing the border. A year ago in July, for all nine sectors, an  estimated 8,000 people were crossing the border. We are now up to over  100,000 people a month crossing the border.   As far as the type of people coming across the border, I saw  something in the Yuma sector I hadn't seen before, and that is dozens  of identifications scattered along the ground where people crossed from  Mexico into Arizona. Why are people throwing away their identification  prior to checking in at the Border Patrol? There is only one obvious  reason. They don't want the United States to know who they are.   These people are paying the drug cartels to come here. If you are  from Mexico, you are paying $3,000 or $4,000 a person. If you are from  Central America, you are paying $6,000 to $8,000 a person. If you are  from Brazil, you are paying over $10,000 a person.   The drug cartels are recruiting people by putting on Central American  TV or Brazilian TV ads urging people to come here. There are some  Americans who are taking out ads telling people it is not all it is  cracked up to be to turn yourself over to the drug cartels.   But right now, clearly, many people are crossing the border. These  are not people, by the way, coming across in desperation. They are  people with very top-of-the-line shoes or top-of-the-line purses, well- done hair, well-done nails. People have to realize that people are not  always coming here out of even a little bit of desperation. They are  coming here because it has been advertised  [[Page H5713]]  they will make more money coming here.   As far as families, in July, in all nine sectors, there were about  15,000 unaccompanied children coming here. You go down there and see  children in what can only be described as pens, being held on mats as  they wait for the United States to transport them wherever they want.  They write on their clothes which address they should be delivered to,  and we turn the children over to nonprofit organizations that will  transfer these children to New York, to Denver, wherever they want to  go.   It drives the Border Patrol up the wall because, of course, if any  American took a 5-year-old child and dropped them off at the airport  and said, ``Please deliver this child to Oregon,'' or Maryland or  wherever, social services would be after them.   But the United States, due to neglect, has pushed a policy in which  people south of the border are encouraged to turn their children over  to the Border Patrol and transfer them wherever they want.   Of course, as we have more and more children come here, the Border  Patrol cannot patrol the border because they have to spend all their  time processing the little children. The more Border Patrol is not  patrolling the border, the more people are just walking in here,  without any vetting at all.   Last year in the Yuma sector, they would be processing maybe 25  people a day. This year it can be up to 700 people a day. And it is not  a difficult thing.   The way they treat each other is kind of a sign that maybe they might  not make the greatest people to have around America. They needed help  recently because of fights between the Haitians and the Colombians. Is  that a sign of the type of people that we are letting into our country?   Other things that you learn down there: In the past, when I would go  down to the border, I was under the impression that if people had any  symptoms, they were tested for COVID. Now, we don't want another  100,000 people a month here under any circumstances. But right now, I  was told that we like to test them, but of course, you can't require  people to be tested, which means we are letting people in this country  who may well have COVID.    Now, I don't know what to make of that. I guess what I make of it is  when the Biden administration requires mandatory vaccines for people,  it is really not that important. They are just doing it to avert  people's eyes because if it were that important, they would be  requiring at least tests for people coming over the border. But they  don't even require tests. We will just let them come here.   Other activities of the Biden administration clearly are acting as  magnets to bring more people here. One of the reasons why the people on  the Mexican side of the border, the Mexican military, does not seem to  care as much now as they did a year ago is because why should they risk  their lives taking on the drug cartels when the American Government, by  all of their actions, indicate that they don't care whether we enforce  the border?   Two examples. We have, of course, as well advertised free medical  care for people coming here, and there are Border Patrol agents who  believe people just come to the United States for the free, superior  medical care.   In the reconciliation bill that is being passed here, people who come  here illegally are getting free college. Talk about a magnet to come to  the United States. Of course, it shows contempt for the American middle  class that we are seeing more and more.   If you are a member of the American middle class and want to go to  college, you take out those student loans, go $30,000 in debt, go  $40,000 in debt, go $50,000 in debt. But if you are somebody showing up  here illegally, you get free college. Talk about advertising that our  administration does not even remotely care whether our immigration laws  are being obeyed or not.   The other thing that we have moving through here, again, on the  reconciliation package is we believe about 10 million more people  coming here, who we did not appropriately, vet are going to be eligible  for amnesty and allowed to become American citizens, which is a further  magnet, bringing more people here.   While there are a lot of things filling up the newspapers today-- well, people don't read newspapers, but a lot of things filling up the  TV screen or the computer screen--I want the American people to contact  their legislators and pay attention to what is going on at the border.   There are people right now who permanently want to change America,  and they are going to get away with it unless there is more of an  uproar here saying: ``Get that immigration stuff out of the  reconciliation package. Finally hire some more Border Patrol agents to  see what is going on down there. And please, please, please go back,  Biden administration, to the Mexican Government and renegotiate deals  where we keep people south of the border.''   By the way, while I am talking about things that indicate there is a  complete lack of caring on the southern border on the part of the Biden  administration, when was the last time we saw Vice President Kamala  Harris at the border? I tell you, if you go down to the border there  are all sorts of Congressmen poking around, seeing what is going on  with the most important issue facing America today. Where exactly is  Kamala Harris, as she just brazenly ignores this crisis?   Please, America, wake up, and defend our southern border.
