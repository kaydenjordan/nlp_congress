 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this resolution  because the American people know that the biggest threat to our modern  democratic society and free market economy is not some socialist  bogeyman, it is Republican leaders in this Chamber, people who want to  call every federally funded program that Americans depend on socialism  just to scare people and position themselves to cut and gut the  benefits that people count on.  [[Page H639]]    Go back and look at the decades' worth of transcripts and see what  Republicans call socialism to scare people--Social Security, Medicare,  Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act. They even call free public school  education socialism to scare people.   This vote is a sham. We have heard about Cuba a ton. My mother came  here from Cuba in the late 1960s with my grandmother and my aunt. I  won't let their story be used to gut the benefits that our people have  earned and deserve. This vote has nothing to do with socialism and  everything to do with gutting the programs that millions of Americans  have paid into and have earned.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today because while we wasted our time  on ridiculous resolutions, there are real and present attacks on  freedom and democracy happening in my home State of Florida at the  hands of our Governor, Ron DeSantis.   This week, our Governor launched a full-scale, fascist attack on a  small and very important institution of higher learning, the New  College of Florida.   In his quest to stoke culture war after culture war, Governor  DeSantis stacked the board of trustees with ultraconservative lapdogs,  who immediately fired the New College president and are now vowing a  hostile takeover that will cause harm to the thousands of young, queer,  and people of color who formerly considered New College a safe haven.   I know this school, and I love this school.   Governor DeSantis is waging a war on education.   We have to be clear: This isn't freedom. The people of Florida and  the students of Florida will not let this happen without a fight.                            ____________________
