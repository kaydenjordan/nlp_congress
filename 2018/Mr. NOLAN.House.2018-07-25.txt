 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this critically  important bipartisan reauthorization of the Career and Technical  Education Act.   I want to especially commend Chairwoman Foxx; Ranking Member Scott;  and, of course, the real hard workers on this deal, Mr. Krishnamoorthi  and Mr. Thompson; and all the original cosponsors, staff, and people  who support this legislation.   Time and again, when I visit with owners and managers of  manufacturing facilities in my northern Minnesota district, I am told  two things. The first is that the employees they have hired who  participated in the Career and Technical Education Act are among the  very best that they have in their employment. The second point that  they make is that they need more CTE-trained employees. All up and down  the line, from healthcare, to construction, information technology,  aviation, transportation, you name it, the list goes on, and the jobs  are waiting.   This bill adds important new provisions to expand and update CTE, so  that they can be filled. It gives States more flexibility to focus on  the jobs and careers in high demand in their regions. Employers and  communities get the tools that they need to develop stronger  partnerships and to engage students and grow our local economies. And  students get the tools that they need to compete and succeed in 21st  century jobs and the economy.   That is what this is all about, Mr. Speaker. It is about more good- paying jobs. It is about great opportunities for students to learn and  develop valuable skills, to develop more dynamic growth for an economy  in need of the best, most-skilled workers that America can provide.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this critical and important  legislation.
