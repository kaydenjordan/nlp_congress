 Mr. Speaker, good morning, and listen, America.   One of the Affordable Care Act's biggest successes was increasing  mental health services for all the people through mental health parity  protections and Medicaid expansion.   The GOP's pay-more-for-less bill cuts taxes on the wealthy at the  expense of those who can least afford to pay for their health coverage,  like low-income families.   One in five of Medicaid's 70 million beneficiaries have a mental  health or a substance abuse disorder, and reports show services are  needed especially for children. The bill would hurt those people by  eliminating Medicaid expansion and gutting mental health services for  this group, including the nearly 60,000 now covered in my district.   I strongly oppose this repeal effort and urge our Republican  colleagues to work with us to strengthen the Affordable Care Act so  more Americans can have access to lifesaving care.   Please, please, do that for us.                            ____________________
