 Madam Speaker, it has been nearly 100 years since women  fought for and won the right to vote. Yet, we still do not have equal  rights and protection under the United States Constitution.   There are too many examples in our everyday lives where women still  do not get equal pay for equal work and where we still face  discrimination simply for being women.   In 1923, the Equal Rights Amendment was introduced in Congress to  prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex and was reintroduced every  session until it finally passed in 1972.   However, with an arbitrary deadline in 1982, by that time, only 35  States out of the required 38 had ratified the amendment. In the past 2  years, we have inched forward with successful votes in Nevada and  Illinois, and now we are just one State away from finally passing the  Equal Rights Amendment.   This is not about politics. It is about equality. It is about  humanity. It is long overdue that we pass the Equal Rights Amendment  and include equality between men and women in the United States  Constitution                            ____________________
