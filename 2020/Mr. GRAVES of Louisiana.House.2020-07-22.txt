 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking  member for yielding.   ``Quick, there is a global pandemic. Let's spend billions of dollars  repairing fences, putting up new signs, and fixing toilets at our  wildlife refuges, parks, and forests,'' said no one ever. Ever.    I have been sitting here listening to this debate over the last  several minutes, and I have no idea what planet people are on right  now.   There is a global pandemic right now. What this legislation does is  it takes everything else and puts it on the back burner. That is right.  Unemployment assistance goes behind this; job opportunities go behind  this; improving our schools and getting our kids actually educated go  behind this; medical care for our seniors goes behind this because this  is mandatory spending.   Mr. Speaker, I have heard Members sit here and say that we have a $20  billion maintenance backlog. Do you know why that is? Because we failed  to appropriate the money because we have determined it is not a  priority in the appropriations process.   Why are we now stepping in and circumventing that whole process  again, Mr. Speaker, in the middle of a pandemic to determine that this  is the greatest priority?   Mr. Speaker, let me give you an analogy of what this bill really  does. This is like someone going over to their neighbor's house, taking  their credit card, and going out there and using that credit card to  get a new address sign in their front yard and maybe to get a new  coating of paint on their house. Meanwhile, that person who took the  credit card has multiple cars and has an expansive real estate holding  and never thought once about their own financial situation but instead  took the credit card of their neighbor who is maybe up to their neck in  medical bills because their spouse is on their deathbed. That is what  this bill does.                                time  1315    I have heard people say: ``Well, oh, this is not taxpayers' money.''   Whose money is this? What dream world are you living in? This  absolutely is funds that are taxpayer funds.   ``Oh, but it comes from energy revenues.''   Where do those go? They go into the general treasury. This isn't  excess money. This isn't some money tree.   Mr. Speaker, let me tell you about one of the most offensive things  about this bill that my friend Cedric Richmond, Congressman Richmond,  talked about. And he tried to address this in committee by proposing a  bipartisan amendment with Congresswoman Sewell, with Congressman Bennie  Thompson, with Congressman Scalise, with myself, and others, a  bipartisan amendment to fix this.   Virtually all of the money that this bill is spending comes from  energy production off the coast of Louisiana. This bill, as many have  said, this goes on in perpetuity. In 5 years, we are spending $1  billion a year; in 10 years, $1 billion a year; in 50 years, $1 billion  a year; in 100 years, $1 billion a year.   Mr. Speaker, do you realize that today 28 percent of this country is  owned by the Federal Government--28 percent?   The sensible thing to do is to look at those assets, determine which  of, for example, the nearly 75,000 different National Park's units and  assets still make sense today. You just heard my friend talk about how  40 percent of these funds historically have been used for projects that  don't advance the mission of the very agency they are supposed to be  advancing.   This is a tone-deaf piece of legislation. It is mandatory spending.  It is putting this as a higher priority than everything else, including  that we are in a global pandemic. We have record unemployment.   Whose idea was it to do this? This is absolutely crazy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to this legislation. I urge common  sense, and I urge that we sit down and actually address some of the  priorities.    Mr. Speaker, I want to introduce another  dose of reality, something you have not heard many folks talk about  today.   Where is this money coming from? How are we paying for this  initially--what is it?--$1.9 or $2.9 billion a year in mandatory  spending?   This is coming from offshore energy revenues. That is where the  majority of these moneys are coming from, from oil and gas production.  I want to be clear: from oil and gas production.   Now, the majority at the same time and in the same breath is taking  step after step to decimate or eliminate the domestic energy industry,  therefore not making us get oil and gas from the United States but  getting it from places like Russia, as we have seen over and over again  when these drastic policies have been put forth.   Now, Mr. Speaker, the other thing is, any time you have energy  revenues like this produced on Federal land under the Mineral Leasing  Act, 50 percent of the money goes to those States that host that  production, and they can use it for whatever they want. They can use it  for whatever they want to use it for.   In this case, the Gulf States, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama,  Texas, we get about 4 percent right now.   So, Mr. Speaker, I have a question. I have a question for my friends  on the majority. Can they tell me what they are going to say to the  residents of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida next  time we have a huge hurricane come through because you have refused,  under the bipartisan amendment that the Congressional Black Caucus and  others advocated, you have refused to allow for a larger percentage of  money to be invested back in the resilience of this ecosystem, the  resilience of these communities?   Tell me what you are going to say to them whenever we have another  Hurricane Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike, Harvey, Irma, Maria, Michael,  Florence. Tell me what you are going to say to them because you are  taking their money, and you are spending it in other places, and you  are saying this is for the environment, these environmental groups out  there advocating for this, when it is a greater environmental  investment to make it in the Gulf.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record statements from the U.S. Farm  Bureau Association and the Cattlemen's Association in opposition to  this, from the American Energy Alliance in opposition to this, as well  as the CRS report that analyzes from whence this money comes, whence it  is going, and how much we probably won't have in the future.                                                      June 5, 2020.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators: We the undersigned western state Farm Bureau       organizations write to express our concerns and areas of       opposition to the S. 3422, the Great American Outdoors Act       (GAOA). While we recognize the significant benefits that the       GAOA would  [[Page H3655]]       provide in addressing the extensive maintenance backlog for       federally-managed lands, we also write to express our       collective concerns with funding further expansion of federal       land ownership in the west.        Farm Bureau members are significantly and directly impacted       by federal land ownership, land-use policies and decisions.       Throughout the West, our members hold public lands grazing       permits, own property adjacent to federal lands and engage in       public and private land forestry. For many ranchers, access       to public lands grazing is economically and ecologically       essential to their operation and provides access to land that       may not otherwise be available to new or beginning farmers       and ranchers.        Legislation or regulation that could be used to curtail       viable multiple use access to these public resources is a       threat to America's farming and ranching families. Historical       experience illustrates, in many cases, that expansion of       public land ownership over time leads to new policies that       further limit multiple uses of land such as livestock grazing       or create additional restrictions on access and rangeland       improvements. Further, additional federal land acquisition       does not adequately consider the reduction in economic       activity and the loss of jobs in resource-dependent       communities. For these reasons, Farm Bureau believes that it       is essential for agricultural stakeholders to be represented       on any sort of planning and/or advisory committees formed for       federal land expansion especially in those areas where       private or state land is proposed for purchase or exchange.        American farmers and ranchers have always demonstrated       their fortitude and resilience in adapting to the ever-      changing landscape--both political and ecological. While the       resources made available through federally managed lands       provide opportunities for ranchers to add value to their       businesses, availability of private land is essential for       successful business and commerce. The federal government       already owns over 640 million acres, which is approximately       28% of the 2.27 billion acres of land in the U.S.        Since enactment of the LWCF in 1965, Congress has       appropriated $18.9 billion (not adjusted for inflation), of       which $11.4 billion was for federal land acquisition. Over 5       million acres of private land has been purchased by USDA and       DOI agencies.        The Federal government already owns more land than it can       effectively maintain and manage. In the west, the federal       government owns roughly every other acre of land and many       counties have more than 75% of their land in federal       ownership. Further federal and ownership erodes the available       tax-base and limits the ability of local governments to       effectively provide critical government services.        The second title of the GAOA establishes the Land and Water       Conservation Fund as a trust fund with permanent       authorization and without annual appropriations oversight.       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the price tag       for the first year of this legislation could be upwards of       $20 billion. In this midst of the current pandemic and       related economic crisis, we are concerned with the additional       financial burden this legislation would create.        We believe, at this time, that funds allocated by the Land       and Water Conservation Act (LWCA) would be better utilized to       manage existing federal lands and request Congress amend the       GAOA to allow for LWCA funds to instead be allocated to       individual state foresters for their use in fire suppression,       fire management and conservation efforts instead of utilizing       funds to acquire additional private property. We request that       you consider the following amendment requests:        1. Sunset in five years. This would allow the Congress to       evaluate the program and decide whether to reauthorize,       modify, or eliminate it. A five-year sunset would conform the       LWCF title of the bill with the $49.5 billion maintenance       title.        2. Limit land acquisition to states with less than the       collective average of those western states with federal       owned/administered lands.        3. Require that all federal and acquisitions be subject to       approval of the relevant state legislature, Governor, and       county commissions.        4. Require notice of any potential land acquisition be       given at least 90 days before title can be transferred to the       state legislature, Governor, and county commissioners. Notice       should include the annual loss of property tax revenues that       will result; or if the land is already held by a tax-exempt       owner, such as a land trust, the notice should include the       tax revenues lost if the property were subject to property       taxes.        5. Require that priority be given to the maintenance       backlog, forgoing any acquisition requests in those instances       when revenues are limited.        Additionally, our organizations would welcome the       opportunity for inclusion of additional maintenance and       enhancement projects that would benefit critical natural       resources to the West. We ask that you consider including the       provisions of S. 2044, the Water Supply Infrastructure       Rehabilitation and Utilization Act. This amendment would       create an aging infrastructure account within the Bureau of       Reclamation (BOR) to provide loans to local water managers to       perform extraordinary maintenance on the federal BOR       infrastructure they manage. Initially, $40 million per year       over five years ($2 billion total) would be provided to this       account from the Reclamation Fund. No taxpayer funds would be       used to fund the account and water users would be required to       repay the loans received to repair and replace water       facilities with interest. The repaid funds would be available       to BOR to fund additional extraordinary maintenance projects,       essentially creating a revolving fund.        The GAOA provides deferred maintenance for every federal       asset agency within the Department of Interior except BOR.       Yet, BOR is facing significant issues with deferred and       maintenance needs at federal water supply facilities. 80% of       BOR's facilities are more than 50 years old and are in need       of major upgrades or replacement costs beyond regular       maintenance. Since water managers do not own the       infrastructure, they are unable to bond against it and       therefore have limited access to other sources of capital for       major repair projects. Creating this account within BOR would       allow water managers to perform repairs, repay cost over time       and ultimately ensure that our aging federal water       infrastructure remains viable to serve the billions of       dollars of agricultural and other economic activity that       depends on it.        Our organizations are happy to further discuss the GAOA,       our recommendations and the opportunity for inclusion of       additional maintenance projects. We thank you in advance for       your consideration and look forward to continuing this       important conversation.            Sincerely,        American Farm Bureau Federation, Alaska Farm Bureau       Federation, Arizona Farm Bureau Federation, California Farm       Bureau Federation, Colorado Farm Bureau Federation, Idaho       Farm Bureau Federation, Montana Farm Bureau Federation,       Nevada Farm Bureau Federation, New Mexico Farm and Livestock       Bureau, Oregon Farm Bureau Federation, Washington Farm Bureau       Federation, Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation.                                   ____              [From the American Energy Alliance, July 22, 2020]                          Key Vote No on H.R. 1957         The American Energy Alliance urges all members to vote NO       on H.R. 1957 as amended by the Senate with the text of the       Great American Outdoors Act. The federal government already       owns far more land than it can adequately manage, which is       part of the reason for the large maintenance backlog this       bill tries to address. However, the Land and Water       Conservation Fund is simply a vehicle for buying up even more       land for the federal government to mismanage.        By buying up land, the federal government hems in and       impoverishes local rural communities by removing taxable land       and limiting space for economic activity. Land procured       through the LWCF that is later placed off limits to       development further harms the local communities as well as       harming the larger economy. While the LWCF itself is       questionable policy, at least the current structure of the       fund allows for congressional input into the land acquisition       process through appropriations. Making LWCF funding permanent       removes this last Congressional check on federal land       acquisition. Permanent funding of the LWCF should be opposed.        The AEA urges all members to support free markets and       affordable energy by voting NO on H.R. 1957 as amended with       the Great American Outdoors Act. AEA will include this vote       in its American Energy Scorecard.--Thomas Pyle, President,       American Energy Alliance.                                   ____                        [From CRS Reports & Analysis]    Effect of COVID-19 on Federal Land Revenues, July 13, 2020 (R46448)       Effect of COVID-19 on Energy and Mineral Operations and Receipts         The COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying recession have       significantly affected energy and mineral prices, production,       and consumption. Many observers expect energy consumption       will remain below 2019 levels through at least 2021 . . .       These expectations stem from reported and ongoing reduced       demand for liquid fuels for the transportation sector and       reduced demand for coal and natural gas associated with the       reduced demand for electricity and industrial activity.        Royalties are the largest contributor to federal energy and       mineral revenues. Royalty rates are set by statute,       regulation, or for specific leases, but the rates are rarely       altered once a lease has been issued. The revenues from       royalties reflect the product of the royalty rate and the       market value of the commodity produced. The pandemic and       accompanying recession have resulted in reduced demand for       oil, gas, and coal, which has resulted in lower prices and       lower production for these commodities in recent months,       relative to 2019.        For May 2020, ONRR reported onshore oil and gas royalty       collections of $170 million, a decline of 53% from May 2019.       ONRR reported offshore oil and gas royalty collections of       $100 million, a decline of 84% from royalty collections for       the same month in 2019. The royalty collections for May       reflect production and sales in April. ONRR reports new       monthly data on an ongoing basis.        To the extent that royalties and other revenues are reduced       due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and recession,       disbursements to states and some federal programs would       decline accordingly. The severity of these impacts on program       funding and state budgets depends on the portion of total       revenue coming from energy and mineral disbursements and on       other factors. Some programs (e.g., the LWCF) receive       disbursements up to a specified limit; in such cases,  [[Page H3656]]       royalties could fall but remain sufficient to fund such       programs. Reductions in energy and mineral revenues also       could affect the funds remaining in the U.S. Treasury as       miscellaneous receipts.
