 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a grieving  but hopeful heart in the wake of an unimaginable tragedy in Surfside,  Florida.   As we gather, our world-renowned Miami Dade search and rescue teams  are joined by teams from as far away as Israel and Mexico to search for  potential survivors of Champlain Towers South in Surfside.   Since that unprecedented collapse, first responders, medical  personnel, engineers, grief counselors, and caseworkers have  painstakingly worked nonstop to assist in the search and rescue,  providing support to the families and to begin an investigation.   For those still trapped, we hold out hope for the search to discover  survivors. For all those who lost loved ones, we send our deepest  condolences and pledge support and solidarity.   So many in our community fled nations where they faced danger. That  makes this tragedy all the more painful. But we are resilient. We will  be there every step of the way for the families of those missing in the  rubble. But we know we cannot do this alone.   I thank the Biden administration for the speedy delivery of Federal  resources, and Mayors Daniella Levine Cava and Charles Burkett for  their steadfast leadership in this truly unprecedented crisis.   And our deepest thanks for the remarkable, relentless first  responders who are still on that pile, searching around the clock in  the hope of finding even one survivor.   Madam Speaker, the agony that these families are going through is  beyond comprehension. So on behalf of the missing, those who perished,  and their families, I ask that the House please rise and pause for a  moment of silence in memory and in honor of those who have been  struggling through this Surfside tragedy and crisis.
