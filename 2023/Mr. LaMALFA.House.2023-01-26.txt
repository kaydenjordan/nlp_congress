 Mr. Speaker, last week, President Biden decided to  second-guess law enforcement once again.   Last Monday, he asked why they, meaning the police, should ``always  shoot with deadly force.'' In the past, he has also told police  officers to aim for the legs while criminals are charging at them.  These comments show a complete lack of knowledge of policing and self- defense.   The fact is, criminals will sometimes violently resist arrest. In  those instances, it is important for police officers to be able to  defend themselves or others around them.   Any time a firearm is discharged, that is considered deadly force. Is  the President suggesting cops never use their firearms, even in clear  cases of self-defense or protecting others?   To sit on the sidelines and blame law enforcement, not criminals, for  the outcomes of these deadly interactions encourages violence against  police officers, excuses criminal behavior, and is very bad for  recruiting new police officers.   The President should be standing with our law enforcement officers,  not siding with or aiding and abetting criminals.
