 Madam President, I am so glad to have the chance to be  here today to recognize Senator Johnny Isakson. He is a dedicated  public servant to the people of Georgia and is a dear friend of mine  here in the Senate. I am pretty sure every single person here in the  U.S. Senate building would say the same.   I have had the good fortune to have been office neighbors with  Senator Isakson for several years now, and like any good neighbor,  Senator Isakson has made it very clear that his door is always open  whenever I need someone to help work out a problem, to swap stories, or  to just share a laugh. Over the years, in working together and in  walking together to the Senate floor, we have managed to take a lot of  steps to help the families and the veterans back in our States and  across the country.   I remember back when Senator Alexander and I were working to replace  No Child Left Behind, and I kept telling him that early childhood  education just had to be a part of this. After I pushed and pushed and  pushed, Senator Alexander finally said to me: OK. Go talk with Johnny.  If you two can work something out, I will accept it in the committee.   I knew right then and there that we were in business because I knew  Senator Isakson was someone who really cared about early childhood  education and who also knew how to work with people across the aisle.  He understands not everyone is going to have the same ideas, but he  listens to other people. He respects their views, and he works so hard  to find common ground so as to pass something that can actually help  our families, and that is exactly what happened there. When the Every  Student Succeeds Act was signed into law, it included a strong focus on  early childhood education, thanks to the efforts of Johnny Isakson, and  I so appreciate that.   It is also exactly what happened when I worked with Senator Isakson  to pass support for military caregivers. Throughout that process, every  time there was something that tried to derail it, Senator Isakson was  right there, working with me to get things back on track, because he  understood it was not about politics; it was about people. It was about  the spouses and the family members who stepped up to make sure our  servicemembers had the support they needed no matter what.   That is something that has been clear on every issue Senator Isakson  has worked on. He has always known the people behind the words of  legislation. He has always understood how personal the work is that we  do here for our families back home.   That has possibly never been clearer than it was last year when we  worked  [[Page S6808]]  on legislation in the HELP Committee to respond to the opioid epidemic.  Senator Isakson spoke up throughout that process about the loss of his  own grandson, a victim of the opioid crisis. He shared his family's  story in the hope it would help other families who struggle with the  disease of addiction so that they would seek and find help.   I have no doubt that, because of your work, they did.   As usual, the bill that we passed was stronger thanks to Senator  Isakson's efforts and thanks to the perspective he brought that always  kept families top of mind.   Now, of course, Senator Isakson hasn't just brought an important  perspective to the Senate but a distinctive voice. A few years ago, we  worked together to update our country's workforce training programs.  The bill that we passed represented years--and I mean years--of  bipartisan effort and was an important step forward for workers in our  country.   I remember heading back to our offices after the bill passed. I said  how excited I was to finally get this done, and Senator Isakson said:         Me, too. I was grinning like a mule eating Breyers.    Well, we don't have charming phrases like that in the State of  Washington, so I am certainly going to miss those. Yet colorful sayings  aren't the only reason Senator Isakson's words have always been so  notable.   The real reason is, when Johnny Isakson gives you his word, you know  he is going to keep it. Some people will say something to you just to  get you out of the way or it is said without their really meaning it.  Senator Isakson never did that. When he said, ``I am going to get this  done,'' you knew it would get done. Just as he kept his word to me so  many times, I think it is safe to say, as he leaves the Senate, that he  kept his word to the people of Georgia.   His No. 1 priority has never been to get the most coverage on Sunday  talk shows or to start political fights. Instead, his legacy will be  that when he came into these halls every day, he came in with the  people of Georgia in his head and in his heart and that he did the  absolute best he could do, each day, to make their lives better.   I am so grateful I have been able to work with him throughout our  time together here in the Senate, and I know so many families are  grateful, as well, for the tremendous work he has accomplished. I am  going to miss having a friend like Johnny Isakson across the aisle and  down the hall from me.   Johnny, as you head home to Dianne and your family and the State that  you love so much and the State that you have done so much for, I hope,  when you think back on all of the work you have done, you will still  grin like a mule eating Breyers. Thank you so much.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to turn to the nomination that is  pending before the Senate and that we will be voting on as soon as I  finish my remarks.   I have come to the floor many times to speak in opposition to  President Trump's ideologically driven, deeply partisan judicial  nominees and to express my frustration that under Republican  leadership, the Senate is rubberstamping one lifetime judicial  nomination after another. The Republican leaders have been willing to  rubberstamp these nominees whose qualifications are in doubt. A record  number have been deemed unqualified by the American Bar Association,  whose impartiality is virtually nonexistent and who are, without a  doubt, chosen for their commitment to upholding President Trump's  agenda rather than to upholding our Nation's laws.   These nominees have sided with shady for-profit colleges rather than  with student loan borrowers--just like the President's Department of  Education. President Trump's nominees have followed his footsteps on  healthcare, ruling and speaking against expanding affordable healthcare  to more families. They have allowed major corporations to skirt rules  that are intended to help address the urgent threat of the climate  crisis.   Perhaps most consistently, President Trump's judicial nominees have  adhered to rigid, backward, deeply harmful ideology when it comes to  reproductive healthcare. One called Roe v. Wade ``radical abortion  rights.'' Another pushed pseudoscience and claimed that birth control  can lead to suicide.   The vast majority of women and men in our country would agree that  these are not positions you would want a supposedly impartial judge to  espouse. Unfortunately, what I have just laid out pales in comparison  to what we know of the judicial nominee we are considering today, Sarah  Pitlyk.   Ms. Pitlyk, whom the American Bar Association rated as  ``unqualified,'' has actively worked to erode women's access to birth  control and abortion. She even defended legislation that would have  allowed landlords to have evicted their tenants and employers to have  fired their employees simply because they had used birth control or had  gotten pregnant before they had gotten married.   These views are already wildly invasive and disqualifying.  Unfortunately, there is more.   Ms. Pitlyk has also not only expressed her personal bias against  assisted reproductive technology, or ART, but she has actually authored  briefs that have argued that surrogacy and ART have ``grave effects on  society.''   I am very proud to have personally worked to expand access to in  vitro fertilization, or IVF, especially for our military families who  struggle with infertility, and I firmly believe all families who face  this painful challenge should have our strong support.   My good friend the junior Senator from Illinois, who has spoken  powerfully about her struggles with fertility and how IVF gave her the  opportunity to realize her dream of motherhood, wrote in a letter to  our colleagues: ``As a mother who struggled with infertility for years  and required IVF to start my family, I would be one of the many  Americans who could never enter Ms. Pitlyk's courtroom with any  reasonable expectation that my case would be adjudicated in a fair and  impartial manner.''   Given Ms. Pitlyk's record of supporting cruel policies that would  punish women for accessing basic healthcare like birth control, her  support for banning women from exercising their right to abortion, as  well as her personal bias and professional actions against starting a  family via assisted reproductive technology, I believe a vote in favor  of Ms. Pitlyk's nomination would be indefensible.   That is why I ask my colleagues on the Republican side to stop and  really consider this vote. If confirmed, Ms. Pitlyk's tenure on the  courts will last for decades--well beyond President Trump's last day in  the White House. That would mean, for years and years, decisions would  be made that we can only expect would harm women and families, restrict  women's access to reproductive healthcare, and even potentially  jeopardize their ability to become parents. In other words, a vote for  Ms. Pitlyk now will keep hurting people long after the President's  name-calling on Twitter doesn't drive headlines anymore.   I urge all of my colleagues to do the right thing for women and  families today and for years to come and join me in opposing this  nomination on the floor.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
