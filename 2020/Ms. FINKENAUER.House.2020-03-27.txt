 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the great  State of Iowa where literally, just moments ago, before I got up here  to speak, I found out we lost another two Iowans to coronavirus, now up  to three, all in my congressional district.   Today, we are grieving losses all over the country and the globe  where, tragically, necessary caution came too late.   The package we are considering today is not perfect. It will not  bring back folks who we lost, but it will give much-needed relief to  our hospital systems and workers on the front lines and to our working  families and small businesses across the country.   God bless the United States of America.
