 Madam Speaker, the $1.2 trillion  infrastructure bill signed into law yesterday reveals the power of this  moment and the importance of momentum.   Madam Speaker, 50 years ago, the Buffalo River was declared  biologically dead and ecologically destroyed. Through the work of the  Buffalo Niagara Waterkeeper and their partners, we made a plan and made  progress passing the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Now with new  infrastructure funding, new life for the Buffalo River is closer than  ever.   Today, I am calling on the Environmental Protection Agency for a full  restoration of the Buffalo River and for a date-certain action plan to  delist the river as an area of concern.   This project restores our natural environment, and it makes more  viable other projects like The Riverline and the DL&W terminal. It also  leverages a settlement reached this week to provide river access to the  Kaisertown neighborhood and new public access along Buffalo's City Ship  Canal.   The power of this law will lead us to a logical conclusion,  connecting our community to resources long denied and to improve our  life quality now and into the future.                            ____________________
