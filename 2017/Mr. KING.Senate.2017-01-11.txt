 Mr. President, I call this the Protect Workers in Rural  America amendment. One of the lesser known provisions of the Affordable  Care Act is that it doesn't allow insurance companies to discriminate  against people because of their occupations.   Before the Affordable Care Act, if you were a logger or a farmer, a  fisherman, a miner, you could get exorbitant rates decided by some  bureaucrat at an insurance company somewhere, and this is wrong.   So what I am trying to do is prohibit discrimination by occupation.  We are trying to save an important part of this law. My distinguished  chairman said this isn't germane. I don't see how it cannot be germane  since the stated purpose of this bill is to begin the process of  repealing the Affordable Care Act.   I ask my colleagues to vote with me. This is protecting workers in  rural America.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive section 305(b) of that act for  purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam Clerk, how am I recorded?    My conscience compels me to vote no.
