 Madam Speaker, this month, Penn State celebrates its 25th  anniversary. On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania's 12th  Congressional District, I congratulate them on their rich history of  success.   The crew team at Penn State started with humble beginnings in the  winter of 1994. While they had no equipment, the team possessed a  passion for the sport and a will to do whatever was necessary to make  the team successful.   In an example we can all be proud of, Penn State crew's first  Schoenbrod was borrowed from Bucknell University, another great  institution of higher education in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional  District.   Later, through hard work at fundraising by selling concessions at  football games, cleaning Beaver Stadium, and selling crew apparel, the  team was finally able to purchase its own equipment in the fall of  1995. From there, the program has never looked back.   Penn State crew men's and women's teams have had a proud record of  achievement that should make them very proud: sweeping podiums and  inspiring a new generation of crew participants from experienced rowers  to novices.   Again, Madam Speaker, on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania's 12th  Congressional District, I congratulate Penn State crew on celebrating  their 25th anniversary.                            ____________________
