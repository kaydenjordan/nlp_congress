 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Neal), the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee for yielding.   I thank the gentleman from Texas for joining in this effort to ensure  that America speaks with a strong and certain voice.   Madam Speaker, yesterday, we heard from President Zelenskyy, an  historic address that moved us all. He spoke in an hour of peril for  democracy in his country and at a turning point for democracy around  the world.   We were, and remain, awed by the courage mirrored by that individual  who leads Ukraine, and of the people he leads who, in light of an  overwhelming force, said no, we will not yield. We will stand, and we  will fight, and we will speak out for our country.   Contrary to the premise of the war criminal who leads Russia saying  that they would welcome the Russian troops with open arms. That was a  lie, a lie to the Russian people, a lie to the Russian conscripts, and  a lie to the world.   Vladimir Putin's criminal and unprovoked invasion of the sovereign  nation of Ukraine has only grown more brutal, Madam Speaker, through  the days and weeks. We have seen his forces target civilian areas, bomb  hospitals, and disappear Ukrainian elected officials in areas they  occupy.   This House is being asked today whether to repeal Russia's permanent,  normal trade relations status. The question ought to be: Is Russia  behaving like a normal, law-abiding nation? And of course, the  resounding answer of the world has been no.   Indeed, there is nothing normal about its behavior or about Putin's  choices. He has violated every norm that has been in place since the  end of the Second World War. He is testing the resolve of the  democratic free world. And thankfully, we are meeting that test with  unity, with resolve, and with strength.   The revocation of Russia's normal trade status with the United  States, as well as that of its ally, Belarus, is just the latest tool,  Madam Speaker, being employed to isolate Russia economically and  prevent the replenishment of its military assets being depleted in the  invasion of Ukraine.   Putin clearly should have envisioned the pain that his invasion would  be bringing down on his own country. That is a shame, because it is  clear that a large segment of the Russian people do not want this war  and, in fact, thousands of them are in jail because they have publicly  made that clear.   They don't want to see their children being sent off to kill, maim,  and terrorize the people of a friendly neighbor that caused them no  threat; whose citizens maintain close people-to-people relations with  the Russian people; and they do not want to lose access to the global  marketplaces in which many Russian entrepreneurs and innovators have  been participating and finding opportunities.   But no, the murderer of Moscow determined that he wanted to see the  Russian empire restored, not because he was threatened, not because  Russia was threatened, but because it would serve his ego and concept  of empire.                                time  1445    As Russia continues to grow more and more isolated, as the vise  tightens around its media, as the last few flickers of freedom for its  people are extinguished, its people need only look to the Kremlin for  answers.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' Vote ``yes'' for  the heroic people of Ukraine. Vote ``yes'' for a leader that has shown  us courage and commitment to freedom and to democracy. Vote ``yes'' to  tell Vladimir Putin that norms still matter, and we will not stand by  as he seeks to break them.   No, normal relations are not warranted.   Vote ``yes.'' Vote for democracy. Vote for freedom. Vote for a  courageous people. Vote for a free Ukraine.    Madam Speaker, I think that Members now know that  yesterday we lost a wonderful, decent, extraordinary former Member of  this body. Madam Speaker, as you know, he was from your State. His name  was Vic Fazio. Some of you served with him. Most of you did not. He  retired in 1998 from a very successful career.   Many of us in this House, who served with him and who remember him  fondly, are grieving the loss of Vic Fazio. He was, until my dear  friend Ben Cardin came to the Congress, my best friend. They were two  of my best friends. Vic and I were very, very close. Many others in the  Congress of the United States would say the same thing, who served with  him, that they were close to him.   Vic Fazio had an extraordinarily successful life. He was 79 years of  age.   He was a leader and was a cardinal in the Appropriations Committee  from his first year on the Appropriations Committee. He and an  extraordinary Republican, who died just 8 months ago, who we remembered  on this floor, another dear friend of mine, Jerry Lewis, also from  California, co-chaired the Legislative Appropriations Subcommittee of  the Appropriations Committee. They did so in a way that enhanced the  sense of importance of this institution and of the collegiality that  was possible in this institution. We said that when Jerry Lewis died.  It is true when his partner now of that era has passed away.   It is an era that we ought to remember and hopefully replicate. Vic  Fazio was a ``Member's Member.'' He was an  [[Page H3811]]  institutionalist. He cared about each and every one of us, irrespective  of the letter next to our name. He cared about process. He cared about  substance. He cared about the integrity of Members. He cared about  their well-being and how they were treated as Members.   In fact, it was Vic Fazio in 1989 who led the effort to reform the  pay and benefits of Members. In that process, at that point in time,  Members could make about $25,000 to $30,000 in what was called  honoraria. It was a payment from private sector interests to Members  for giving a speech.   Vic, and the colleagues with whom he worked, worked together to  eliminate honoraria and to make sure, however, that Members could live  decently in this town, an expensive town in which to live, with a  salary that was appropriate. All of you who get your paychecks can  thank Vic Fazio that they are substantially above what they otherwise  would have been, but for his and other reformers' actions.   Vic Fazio lost his wife, Judy, and I lost my wife, Judy. Our wives  knew one another. I lost mine 25 years ago, and he lost his some years  ago. The sadness of his life is that he lost a daughter very early in  life, and he never got over that. It was a deep, deep scar in his  heart.   The good news is that after the death of Judy, he married a woman  whose name is Kathy. I don't know whether Kathy is watching today, but  if she is, we send her our love and our sympathy and our thanks for the  life of Vic Fazio and the contribution he made to his country, to his  State, to our Nation, and to this institution.   To give us an example of wisdom, of acceptance of others, of lifting  others up, irrespective of that small letter next to their name,  because he knew that all of us were Americans, chosen by our neighbors,  which is the only way you can get here, to serve them, to represent  their views in this body, and to make weighty decisions on their behalf  that will have consequences for them and, as we do today, consequences  for all the world.   For 20 years, Vic Fazio was the voice of Sacramento and Yolo County  in the Congress. One of Vic's lasting legacies was the designation of  3,700 acres of protected wetlands in Yolo County. Perhaps, Madam  Speaker, we can name that territory after Vic Fazio.   He was effective because he reached across the aisle and worked  closely with Republicans and, as I mentioned, Jerry Lewis.   When the legislative appropriation bill came to the floor, we were  all proud, because it was not a partisan bill. It was a bill for the  institution and for the people.   So we remember a man of intellect, of integrity, and a warm and  genial nature who was proud of his service, proud of the Congress, and  proud of his colleagues.   Madam Speaker, I would ask all of us to rise for a moment of silence  to remember a great, great American and great Member of this House, Vic  Fazio.
