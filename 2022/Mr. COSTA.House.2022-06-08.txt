 Madam Speaker, gun violence, as we know, is plaguing our  Nation. In 2022, this year, there have already been 200 mass shootings  in the United States. Think about that. It is absolutely horrific.   We ask ourselves, when is enough enough?   Our constituents across the country ask us, how many more innocent  people must die before any reasonable, commonsense gun reform  legislation can pass and add more protection for the American public?   Let's pass the Protecting Our Kids Act, which raises the purchasing  age for semiautomatic weapons from 18 to 21, a commonsense idea. Let's  also deal with the subject of ghost gun purchases and background  checks. Again, commonsense ideas, and cracks down on gun trafficking  and straw purchases.   If the combination of the Protecting Our Kids Act is something that  you might find objectionable in some instance, we have individual  pieces of legislation, resources for victims of gun violence,  bipartisan background checks, assault weapons ban, legislation that  would also go further to provide protection in condemning the horrific  shootings in Atlanta, Georgia, and dealing with hate, bigotry, and  violence against Asian-American and Pacific-Islander communities.   We also have legislation that would designate June 4th National Gun  Violence Awareness Day. There is legislation that deals with disarming  of hate, and to try to provide extreme risk protection for Federal  firearms sales to include those who are subject to extreme risk  protection that we know red-flag legislation would help protect us  against.   So, there are a lot of things we can do. Will we totally eliminate  the threats to the public? Of course not.   But there are commonsense ideas we can do to improve and increase  safety for our schools, for our churches, and for people who are just  going to shop for groceries one afternoon. These are things we can do,  and we should do.   As chair of the Congressional Crime Survivors and Justice Caucus, I  am advocating for resources for survivors of gun violence to cope with  their trauma, whether it be in Sacramento or Fresno or anywhere else  around this country.   I support the Second Amendment for responsible gun ownership. Let  that be clear. But America deserves better, and I call on all House  Members to join me in this effort. Let's put partisanship aside and  take action to address the gun epidemic once and for all.    Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I rise today also to celebrate Dia de  Portugal, which is a significant holiday for Portuguese people all over  the world.   My grandparents came to the United States from the Azore Islands in  the late 19th century and the turn of the 20th century, 1897 to 1904.  Illiterate, non-English speaking, like immigrants past and immigrants  present, coming to America to have a better life for themselves. But  they never, ever left their pride of their home country, Portugal, or  their sense of culture, which lives in me today.   Portugal is one of America's longest and strongest allies, as it was  the first to recognize the United States as an independent Nation after  the Revolutionary War.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the AMIGOS Act, introduced  by our colleague and Congressman   David Cicilline. It would create  more American jobs and increase investment in the United States by  strengthening our bonds with Portugal. As the co-chair of the  Portuguese Caucus, I think it is important that we continue to build on  this relationship and the trade that already exists today.   I urge the Senate to pass this bipartisan legislation and, again, we  will continue to work with other colleagues of ours who are part of our  Portuguese-American Caucus to continue to advocate for mutual  interests, not only for Portugal but for the United States and the  Portuguese-American community.   ``Happy Portugal Day.'' ``Feliz Dia de Portugal.''   Let us celebrate and let us remember that America is a stronger  country because of our welcoming of immigrants past and present, and  this is a part of that recognition.                            ____________________
