Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the issue of immigration is one that is  front and center in the minds of most Americans, as it should be.   For the last 2\1/2\ years, our country has been roiling with  immigration controversy. This new President, now 2\1/2\ years into his  term, came to office and immediately instituted a travel ban on a  majority of Muslim countries. It was controversial.   In the city of Chicago, people showed up spontaneously at the  airport, lawyers, to counsel travelers to try to find some volunteer  effort that might respond to their worry and concern about the travel  ban imposed by President Trump.   The case went to court. The court stayed this decision and, in a  later adjudication, allowed it to go forward.   It was the first of many actions taken by President Trump on the  issue of immigration--most of them very controversial.   I remember the repeal of DACA in September of 2017. This is a program  I had worked on for years. It started with the DREAM Act, which I  introduced with my fellow U.S. Senator Barack Obama as cosponsor. We  tried to pass it here in the Senate but were stopped time and again by  the rules of the Senate and the filibuster.   Regardless of that, time passed and President Obama became President,  and I appealed to him, with the assistance of Senator Lugar, a  Republican Senator of Indiana, asking if he could find some way as  President to provide relief to these young people brought to the United  States as children, who wanted a chance to earn their way to legal  status in America.   President Obama came up with a program called DACA, and that program  said that if you are one of those children, you could come forward, pay  a substantial filing fee, go through a criminal background check, and  if we established that you are no threat to this country, that you are  moving forward with your education and had plans for a job and a  career, we would allow you to stay legally in the United States and not  be deported for 2 years at a time, renewable--check in and make sure  that your status hasn't changed.   In the end, 790,000--790,000--young people across America took  advantage of DACA. Their lives were changed overnight. With DACA, there  was no longer a fear of a knock on a door. They could become students  and, as students, become teachers.   They can learn skills to be nurses, engineers, entrepreneurs, even  doctors. It was a liberation for these 790,000 given the chance,  finally, to be part of America and its future.   As I have said so many times on the floor, and Senator Menendez was  the first to ever say it, and I thought it was such an apt description  of these  [[Page S4548]]  young people: They had spent their entire lives pledging allegiance to  that flag every morning, believing it was their flag. They learned, at  some point, they were not legally here in America. President Obama gave  them a chance--790,000.   In September of 2017, President Donald Trump ended the DACA Program.  He challenged Congress: Pass a law. Don't rely on an Executive order;  pass a law. Well, we tried. We tried, on a bipartisan basis in the  Senate, and President Trump rejected our effort. It was unfortunate,  but it meant that these people--these 790,000 and hundreds of thousands  of others who could have been eligible--were stopped in their tracks.  Luckily--luckily--the courts came to their rescue and said for these  people, despite President Trump's decision, the 790,000 should be  protected from deportation. No new ones could apply, but it gave them  temporary relief, which could end any day, any week, or any month.  That, in my mind, was the second major move by President Trump to roil  up this immigration situation in America, to get tough on 790,000 young  men and women who simply wanted a chance to live in this country.   He then terminated temporary protected status. That was a category of  immigration given to people who were in dire circumstances--victims of  terrible extreme weather events or political and human disasters in  their country--who were allowed to come here and live in the United  States in a protected status, hundreds of thousands of them from all  over the world. This President, Donald Trump, said: The end of it. We  are going to put an end to it. It is over. That was the third strike as  far as I was concerned, but it wasn't the end, by far.   Last June 2018, with a great deal of pride and with biblical quotes,  Attorney General Jeff Sessions came forward and announced a zero- tolerance policy: Anyone presenting himself at the border would be  considered suspect criminal, and if they had in their custody a young  child, they would be separated. In the end, at least--at least--2,880  infants, toddlers, and children were separated from their parents. It  was a dramatic move. It was an inhumane move, but it was done to create  what they call a deterrence to discourage people from coming to our  border. Within days, the public reaction against zero tolerance grew to  a point where even this President, who does not have ``sorry'' in his  vocabulary, came forward and said they were going to end that policy of  zero tolerance.   What about the children, though, the ones who actually were  separated? It took a Federal judge in Southern California to come  forward and say there had to be an accounting of the children and their  parents and a reuniting. It went on for weeks and months. Still, to  this day, there are children adrift in America. Their families can't be  found because zero tolerance--this inhumane policy--was such an abject  failure. Even ``ending it'' didn't end the struggle that many of these  young people are still going through to this day. That was the fourth  thing this President did by way of getting tough on immigration policy.   Then he announced several weeks ago in one of his infamous tweets  that he was going to initiate a policy of mass arrests and mass  deportations. There are some 11 million--that is the best estimate-- undocumented people in this country, and the President said millions  would be deported. We saw it in its earliest stages around the city of  Chicago.   Betty Rendon, a grandmother who had been in the United States for  more than 10 years, was deported. How dangerous was Betty Rendon to  this country? Not at all. In fact, she was a seminary student at a  Lutheran seminary near Chicago. She had deep family roots, children and  grandchildren in the community who were American citizens, but that was  not enough. ICE, the agency of enforcement of Department of Homeland  Security, issued deportation orders, and she was forced to leave this  country.   I have asked those in charge at the Department of Homeland Security:  What threat was this woman to America? After being here 10 years and  living a life that showed she was no threat to anyone, why was she a  priority to deport from this country? They couldn't answer.   Now we have an unprecedented humanitarian crisis at our border. I  thought long and hard about the statement I am about to make and the  photo which I am about to display. Even though it has been on the front  page of major newspapers like the New York Times, it is such a  heartbreaking photo that I at least warn in advance anyone following  this speech that if you would be troubled by the images in this photo,  please look away or turn away from what I am about to show you, but I  believe it has to be shown to the American people. It is a photo of a  shocking and horrifying image of Oscar Alberto Martinez Ramirez and his  23-month-old daughter Valeria. They died in their effort to try to  cross from Mexico into the United States. This is the photo which was  in the newspapers. It is a shocking portrayal of the desperation this  family faced.    We are told by his wife that they tried to come through the ordinary  port of entry, the usual place to present yourself to seek asylum in  the United States--this mother, father, and child--and they were told  that the ordinary port of entry was closed to them. So they attempted  to cross the Rio Grande River.   From what we were told, this father took his little daughter, less  than 2 years old, and swam across the river. He put her on the bank and  then went back to help his wife come across. His daughter panicked and  jumped in the river behind him. He tried to rescue her. They both  drowned.   This is an illustration of the crisis in real terms, a crisis we face  at this border that should never be taking place.   Valeria, this 23-month-old girl, according to her mother, loved to  dance, play with her stuffed animals, and brush the hair of her madre  and padre. Her father Oscar had sold his motorcycle and borrowed money  to flee from El Salvador to come to the United States. He and his wife,  Tania Vanessa Avalos, were simply looking for safety and opportunity  for their family. Vanessa's mother said: ``They wanted a better future  for their girl.'' They planned to cross into the United States and seek  asylum and try to find a safe place in the future.   That is the reality of what we are discussing on the floor of the  Senate this evening and have been for the last several days.  Unfortunately, President Trump responded to this tragedy with a  political statement. He tweeted: ``The Democrats should change the  Loopholes and Asylum Laws so lives will be saved at our Southern  Border.''   I might remind the President that the same laws he now deals with in  this border crisis were exactly the laws President Obama was faced with  when he was President. Something different has happened. It isn't just  the laws of this country; it is the way we are administering the laws  that currently exist.   I sincerely believe we are better than this situation depicted in  that photograph and what we have heard over and over. I believe America  can have a secure border and respect our international obligations to  provide safe haven to those fleeing persecution, as we have done as  Democrats and Republicans for decades before this administration.   Yesterday I met with Mark Morgan. Last month, President Trump named  him as Acting Director of U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement, ICE.  Mr. Morgan, a former marine and former FBI agent, had been asked to  carry out the mass arrests that President Trump talked about in his  tweet several weeks ago and the mass deportations of millions of  immigrants whom the President had threatened.   Shortly before I met with Mr. Morgan, he was named to a different  position, Acting Director of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. As of  yesterday, he moved from being in charge of interior enforcement within  the United States to be in charge of solving the humanitarian crisis we  now face at our border.   If that sounds like a rash move and hard to explain, it is not the  only one. In the 2\1/2\ years that President Trump has been President,  we have had four different people leading the Department of Homeland  Security--four--in 2\1/2\ years, and it is not the fault of the Senate  or Congress for holding up nominations. They just change that often.  Within the Department of Homeland Security, in every major department,  we have had repeated turnovers  [[Page S4549]]  and changeovers in the leaders there. Even those today who are  nominally in charge are in an acting capacity. They can't bring them  through the regular order of vetting and background checks to be given  these responsible positions. So as of yesterday, Mr. Morgan is in  charge of this crisis at the border.   There is a gaping leadership vacuum in the Trump administration's  Department of Homeland Security. To have four different heads of the  Department in 2\1/2\ years, to have every position of responsibility  for immigration or border security held by a temporary appointee is  unacceptable, and the White House has not submitted names to Congress  for permanent nominations to these positions.   The Trump administration can shuffle the deck chairs, but we know the  obvious: President Trump's immigration and border security policies are  failing. Their failures are found not only in the detention of children  and families in inhumane circumstances but also this tragic photograph  of a desperate couple turned away at the border who tried their best to  find another way to present themselves in the United States.   We have a responsibility in Congress, Democrats and Republicans, to  deal with this crisis that has been created by this administration.   In February, after the President finally agreed to end the longest  government shutdown in the history of the United States, Congress  passed a bipartisan omnibus appropriations bill that included $414  million--in February, $414 million--for humanitarian assistance at the  border. I have asked what happened to this money. The explanations are  hard to follow. Some said: Well, more than half of this humanitarian  assistance has been invested in a building which will be ready for  occupancy in about a year and a half.   Here we have kids without diapers at the border, questionable food  sources, filthy clothes, separation of children from families, and they  are setting out to build a building that might be open in a year and a  half. It would seem to me that those who were in medical practice and  triage cases would certainly start with the immediate humanitarian  challenge before they start the long-term responsibility of building a  building. More needs to be done at our border.   In April, I visited El Paso, TX. What I saw in the Border Patrol's  overcrowded facilities was heartbreaking. I want to add here, as I do  every time I bring this up, that I believe the men and women--the  professional men and women at the border, the ones I met and spoke to-- are caring people. They are genuinely concerned by the humanitarian  crisis they see unfolding before them every single day. Some  undoubtedly have done improper things and mistreated these detainees,  but the ones I spoke to understood, as human beings, the need for us to  do more as a country.   Last month, I led 24 Senators in calling on the International  Committee of the Red Cross and the inspector general of the Department  of Homeland Security to investigate these Border Patrol facilities,  including the ones I visited in El Paso. The circumstances there were  unacceptable by any normal American standard. To think that we were  packing these people into detention cells far beyond the capacity-- ``capacity 35'' written over the door. I counted 150 standing shoulder  to shoulder in that room with one toilet. It is just unacceptable and  impossible to explain that this is happening in America.    For me to call on the international Red Cross to look at this  circumstance is something I never thought I would do. I have done that  before but only in foreign countries, asking that some of the horrible  conditions in the detention of prisoners be investigated by the  International Red Cross. I never thought I would be asking the same of  the Red Cross, to look in America.   Earlier this month, the inspector general of the Department of  Homeland Security released a report detailing the inhumane and  dangerous overcrowding of migrants at the El Paso port of entry, which  I had visited. The office found the overcrowding was ``an immediate  risk to the health detainees and DHS employees.''   Earlier today, the Senate passed legislation with funding to  alleviate some overcrowding at the CPB facilities and to provide food  supplies and medical care to migrants. This bill we have passed also  includes critical funding for the Office of Refugee Resettlement to  care for migrant children.   The House of Representatives passed their own version of the bill  last night. The House legislation, which I also support, includes  critical oversight measures, particularly when it comes to these  children. Now it is time for us to reach an agreement--the House and  the Senate, Democrats and Republicans--and to do it in a timely  fashion.   I am willing to work with my colleagues to find a bipartisan answer,  as I did on the first version of this, which passed in the Senate. What  is happening at our border is unacceptable. The President has to come  to realize that just getting tough is not the answer; it takes more.   We need to commit ourselves to international assistance in these  three countries that are the sources of these people: El Salvador,  Honduras, and Guatemala. Overwhelmingly, those are the origins of these  migrants who come to the United States.   We have to realize, as well, that people are coming here in desperate  circumstances, as this photograph I showed on the floor depicts. Many  times they are prepared to risk their lives and even lose their lives  as they try to make it to the United States in desperation. We have to  find a way, an orderly way, to accept those who truly need our  protection and need to be brought to a place of safety. And we have to  have a timely process so that the determination of eligibility is not 1  year or 2 years in the future. It is time for us to work together on a  bipartisan basis to do that.   Mr. President, I see another Senator, my colleague from Oklahoma, on  the floor. I hope he can give me 10 minutes.   Thank you. I appreciate that.                                     Iran    Mr. President, although I may not often say it, I want to make it  clear. I think President Trump made the right decision the other day in  deciding not to start a war with Iran. He must accept responsibility  for some of the challenges we now face.   I think the decision to walk away from the agreement that prohibited  Iran from developing nuclear weapons was shortsighted. By every report  that we have received, this agreement--international agreement--with  international inspectors was being followed by the Iranians. Yet the  President decided to walk away from it. His attempt to isolate Iran  from our allies, to seek regime change, and to declare economic war on  Iran, unfortunately, have all led to this moment in history where a  confrontation seems imminent.   Many around the President here in Washington and abroad have been  anxious for a conflict with Iran. Many of the same people were anxious  for a conflict with Iraq. I remember that. I remember it well because I  was one of 23 Senators who voted against the invasion of Iraq. They are  still there, engaged in a war some 17 years later. Thousands of  American lives have been lost, and thousands more have been injured. We  are spending trillions of dollars in taxpayers' money in a war without  end in Iraq.   One of the great tragedies of the Iraq war, one of the few its  architects have ever admitted, is that the Iraq war actually ended up  empowering Iran. Today, the Iraqi Government is actually something of  an Iranian client state. Yet the same unrepentant voices are again  beating the drums for regime change and another war in the Middle East.   Do the American people want a third war in the Middle East at this  moment in our history? I don't think so.   Some have even had the audacity to argue the 2001 authorization for  use of military force approved by this Congress to respond to those who  attacked us on 9/11 somehow gives this President authority and  permission to invade Iran. I don't agree with that at all.   I cannot imagine anyone here who took that vote 18 years ago thought  they were voting to start a war with Iran that would still be going on  18 years later. I find that impossible to believe.   The Constitution is clear. Article I, section 8 says that the power  to declare war is the explicit power of the U.S. Congress, and it  should be.   No one should ever send our sons and daughters into war without the  consent  [[Page S4550]]  of the American people through their elected representatives. Our  Founding Fathers were wise in making sure this awesome power did not  rest with a King-like or Queen-like figure but with the people's  elected representatives.   I have made this same argument in the House and in the Senate during  my career, regardless of who sat in the White House, a Republican or a  Democrat.   Recently, I was pleased to join with Senator Udall and others in  legislation reaffirming no war with Iran without the consent of  Congress. This bill is also now an amendment to the National Defense  Authorization Act. I sincerely hope we will have a timely vote to make  sure the President understands that he cannot authorize the invasion or  military force in Iran without the approval and permission of Congress.   Some of the eerie, familiar statements and distortions used to sell  the Iraq war are reappearing now. Vice President Cheney repeatedly  warned us in those days that Saddam Hussein was actively pursuing  nuclear weapons. He even alleged there was ``no doubt'' that they were  amassing those weapons to use against the United States.   Former Pentagon adviser Richard Perle argued that Iraqis could  finance the postwar rebuilding from their own oil wealth, and he had  ``no doubt that they will.''   President George W. Bush, who claimed war was actually his last  choice, provocatively tried to link al-Qaida with Saddam Hussein--a  dubious claim echoed by his then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld,  and one some are even trying to brazenly use today.   Secretary Rumsfeld even tried to claim war in Iraq would last ``Five  days or five weeks or five months, but it certainly isn't going to last  any longer than that.'' That is what our Secretary of Defense said.   Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and Vice President Cheney  said we would be welcomed in Iraq as liberators. Wolfowitz argued that  ``hundreds of thousands of American troops is way off the mark.''   Five days or 5 weeks, welcomed by the Iraqis? Well, the war started,  and it has never ended. There are 150,000 American soldiers deployed in  Iraq. The war continues into its second decade. Incidentally, no  weapons of mass destruction were ever found, no nuclear weapons, and we  certainly weren't greeted as liberators. Iraqi oil did not pay the $2  trillion that American taxpayers were forced to pay for that war in  Iraq.   More than 4,500 Americans have been killed and 32,000 wounded,  including my brave and amazing colleague in the Senate, Senator Tammy  Duckworth.   How do some of the current occupants of the White House driving Iran  policy feel about that Iraq war disaster? Well, National Security  Advisor John Bolton said in 2015: ``I still think the decision to  overthrow Saddam was correct.'' He made that statement 1 month after  writing a New York Times op-ed piece entitled: ``To Stop Iran's Bomb,  Bomb Iran.''   Sadly, what I find most stunning about the administration's march to  war in Iran is that its actions have, in fact, contributed to the  current mess and Iran's threat to restart its nuclear program.   President Trump has been pursuing a policy impossible to follow:  calling for a regime change, trying to flatter and meet with the  Iranian President Rouhani, trying to negotiate a better deal,  threatening Iran militarily, tightening sanctions. Who knows what the  policy is going to be from day to day.   The President impulsively withdrew from the nuclear agreement without  first designing a credible way to get a better agreement. He went on to  designate Iran's military as a terrorist organization, even against the  advice of our military. And he tried to starve Iran of the agreed  benefits it was to receive from the original deal.   Let me be clear. There is no doubt that Iran is responsible for  dangerous destabilizing actions in that region and beyond. Its proxies  attack our servicemembers in Iraq and threaten our allies in the  region. But why not push back against Iran without withdrawing from the  nuclear agreement? Why give them the pretext for belligerence and  undermine our credibility with the global powers party to our own  nuclear deal?   The tragic end result of this dangerous incoherence is that our  allies are united against us, and Iran may we start nuclear activities,  which had been frozen for the last 4 years.   This Congress, already a rubberstamp for too many of President  Trump's instincts, must not do so in a march to another war in the  Middle East as well.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--        (1) the safety of the food supply of the United States is       vital to the public health, to public confidence in the food       supply, and to the success of the food sector of the Nation's       economy;        (2) lapses in the protection of the food supply and loss of       public confidence in food safety are damaging to consumers       and the food industry, and place a burden on interstate       commerce;        (3) the safety and security of the food supply requires an       integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne       illness, a thorough and broad-based approach to basic and       applied research, and intensive, effective, and efficient       management of the Nation's food safety program;        (4) the task of preserving the safety of the food supply of       the United States faces tremendous pressures with regard to--        (A) emerging pathogens and other contaminants and the       ability to detect all forms of contamination;        (B) an aging and immune-compromised population, with a       growing number of people at high risk for foodborne       illnesses, including infants and children;        (C) a concern regarding food fraud for economic gain,       especially with mislabeling and intentionally misleading       claims;        (D) an increasing volume of imported food, without adequate       monitoring and inspection; and        (E) maintenance of rigorous inspection of the domestic food       processing and food service industries;        (5) Federal food safety standard setting, inspection,       enforcement, and research efforts should be based on the best       available science and public health considerations and food       safety resources should be systematically deployed in ways       that most effectively prevent foodborne illness;        (6) the Federal food safety system is fragmented, with at       least 15 Federal agencies sharing responsibility for food       safety, and operates under laws that do not reflect current       conditions in the food system or current scientific knowledge       about the cause and prevention of foodborne illness;        (7) the fragmented Federal food safety system and outdated       laws preclude an integrated, systemwide approach to       preventing foodborne illness, to the effective and efficient       operation of the Nation's food safety program, and to the       most beneficial deployment of food safety resources;        (8) the National Academy of Sciences recommended in the       report ``Ensuring Safe Food from Production to Consumption''       that Congress establish by statute a unified and central       framework for managing Federal food safety programs, and       recommended modifying Federal statutes so that inspection,       enforcement, and research efforts are based on scientifically       supportable assessments of risks to public health; and        (9) the lack of a single focal point for food safety       leadership in the United States undercuts the ability of the       United States to exert food safety leadership       internationally, which is detrimental to the public health       and the international trade interests of the United States.        (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--        (1) to establish a single agency to be known as the ``Food       Safety Administration'' to--        (A) regulate food safety and related labeling to strengthen       the protection of the public health;        (B) ensure that food facilities fulfill their       responsibility to produce food in a manner that protects the       public health of all people in the United States;        (C) lead an integrated, systemwide approach to food safety       and to make more effective and efficient use of resources to       prevent foodborne illness;        (D) provide a single focal point for food safety       leadership, both nationally and internationally; and        (E) provide an integrated food safety research capability,       utilizing internally generated, scientifically and       statistically valid studies or other food safety initiatives,       in cooperation with academic institutions, food safety       nonprofit organizations, and other scientific entities of the       Federal and State governments, to achieve the continuous       improvement of research on foodborne illness and       contaminants;        (2) to transfer to the Food Safety Administration the food       safety, labeling, inspection, and enforcement functions that,       as of the day before the date of enactment of this Act, are       performed by other Federal agencies; and        (3) to modernize and strengthen the Federal food safety       laws to achieve more effective application and efficient       management of the laws for the protection and improvement of       public health.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--        (1) the safety of the food supply of the United States is       vital to the public health, to public confidence in the food       supply, and to the success of the food sector of the Nation's       economy;        (2) lapses in the protection of the food supply and loss of       public confidence in food safety are damaging to consumers       and the food industry, and place a burden on interstate       commerce;        (3) the safety and security of the food supply requires an       integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne       illness, a thorough and broad-based approach to basic and       applied research, and intensive, effective, and efficient       management of the Nation's food safety program;        (4) the task of preserving the safety of the food supply of       the United States faces tremendous pressures with regard to--        (A) emerging pathogens and other contaminants and the       ability to detect all forms of contamination;        (B) an aging and immune-compromised population, with a       growing number of people at high risk for foodborne       illnesses, including infants and children;        (C) a concern regarding food fraud for economic gain,       especially with mislabeling and intentionally misleading       claims;        (D) an increasing volume of imported food, without adequate       monitoring and inspection; and        (E) maintenance of rigorous inspection of the domestic food       processing and food service industries;        (5) Federal food safety standard setting, inspection,       enforcement, and research efforts should be based on the best       available science and public health considerations and food       safety resources should be systematically deployed in ways       that most effectively prevent foodborne illness;        (6) the Federal food safety system is fragmented, with at       least 15 Federal agencies sharing responsibility for food       safety, and operates under laws that do not reflect current       conditions in the food system or current scientific knowledge       about the cause and prevention of foodborne illness;        (7) the fragmented Federal food safety system and outdated       laws preclude an integrated, systemwide approach to       preventing foodborne illness, to the effective and efficient       operation of the Nation's food safety program, and to the       most beneficial deployment of food safety resources;        (8) the National Academy of Sciences recommended in the       report ``Ensuring Safe Food from Production to Consumption''       that Congress establish by statute a unified and central       framework for managing Federal food safety programs, and       recommended modifying Federal statutes so that inspection,       enforcement, and research efforts are based on scientifically       supportable assessments of risks to public health; and        (9) the lack of a single focal point for food safety       leadership in the United States undercuts the ability of the       United States to exert food safety leadership       internationally, which is detrimental to the public health       and the international trade interests of the United States.        (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--        (1) to establish a single agency to be known as the ``Food       Safety Administration'' to--        (A) regulate food safety and related labeling to strengthen       the protection of the public health;        (B) ensure that food facilities fulfill their       responsibility to produce food in a manner that protects the       public health of all people in the United States;        (C) lead an integrated, systemwide approach to food safety       and to make more effective and efficient use of resources to       prevent foodborne illness;        (D) provide a single focal point for food safety       leadership, both nationally and internationally; and        (E) provide an integrated food safety research capability,       utilizing internally generated, scientifically and       statistically valid studies or other food safety initiatives,       in cooperation with academic institutions, food safety       nonprofit organizations, and other scientific entities of the       Federal and State governments, to achieve the continuous       improvement of research on foodborne illness and       contaminants;        (2) to transfer to the Food Safety Administration the food       safety, labeling, inspection, and enforcement functions that,       as of the day before the date of enactment of this Act, are       performed by other Federal agencies; and        (3) to modernize and strengthen the Federal food safety       laws to achieve more effective application and efficient       management of the laws for the protection and improvement of       public health.

(a) Voluntary Procedures.--If the Administrator determines       that there is a reasonable probability that an article of       food (other than infant formula) is adulterated or misbranded       and the use of or exposure to such article will cause serious       adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals,       the Administrator shall provide to the owner, operator, or       agent in charge of the facility that created, caused, or was       otherwise responsible for that article of food an opportunity       to cease distribution and recall that article of food in a       manner and within a time period determined by the       Administrator.        (b) Prehearing Order To Cease Distribution and Give       Notice.--        (1) In general.--If the owner, operator, or agent in charge       of a facility refuses to, or does not voluntarily, cease       distribution or recall an article of food in the manner and       within the time period determined by the Administrator under       subsection (a), the Administrator may by order require, as       the Administrator determines to be necessary--        (A) that owner, operator, or agent--        (i) to immediately cease distribution of that article of       food; and        (ii) as applicable, to immediately notify all persons       manufacturing, processing, packing, transporting,       distributing, receiving, holding, or importing and selling       that article of food; and        (B) any person to which that article of food has been       distributed, transported, or sold, to immediately cease       distribution of that article of food.        (2) Required additional information.--        (A) In general.--If an article of food covered by a recall       order issued under paragraph (1) has been distributed to a       warehouse-based, third-party logistics provider without       providing such provider sufficient information to know or       reasonably determine the precise identity of the article of       food covered by a recall order that is in its possession, the       notice provided by the owner, operator, or agent of a       facility under paragraph (1)(A)(ii) shall include such       information as is necessary for the warehouse-based, third-      party logistics provider to identify the article of food.        (B) Rules of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph shall       be construed--        (i) to exempt a warehouse-based, third-party logistics       provider from the requirements of food safety law; or        (ii) to exempt a warehouse-based, third-party logistics       provider from being the subject of a mandatory recall order.        (3) Determination to limit areas affected.--If the       Administrator requires an owner, operator, or agent in charge       of the facility to cease distribution under paragraph       (1)(A)(i) of an article of food identified under subsection       (a), the Administrator may limit the size of the geographic       area and the markets affected by such cessation if such       limitation would not compromise the public health.        (c) Hearing on Order.--The Administrator shall provide the       owner, operator, or agent in charge of the facility subject       to an order under subsection (b) with an opportunity for an       informal hearing, to be held as soon as possible, but not       later than 2 days after the issuance of the order, on the       actions required by the order and on why the article that is       the subject of the order should not be recalled.        (d) Post-Hearing Recall Order and Modification of Order.--        (1) Amendment of order.--If, after providing opportunity       for an informal hearing under subsection (c), the       Administrator determines that removal of the applicable       article of food from commerce is necessary, the Administrator       shall, as appropriate--        (A) amend the order to require recall of such article or       other appropriate action;        (B) specify a timetable in which the recall shall occur;        (C) require periodic reports to the Administrator       describing the progress of the recall; and        (D) provide notice to consumers to whom such article was,       or may have been, distributed.

(e) Rule Regarding Alcoholic Beverages.--The Administrator       shall not initiate a mandatory recall or take any other       action under this section with respect to any alcohol       beverage until the Administrator has provided the       Administrator of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau       with a reasonable opportunity to cease distribution and       recall the alcohol beverage under the authority of the       Administrator of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade       Bureau.

(2) Requirements.--To reduce the potential for       miscommunication during recalls or regarding investigations       of a foodborne illness outbreak associated with a food that       is subject to a recall, each incident command operation or       similar operation under paragraph (1) shall use regular staff       and resources of the Administration to--        (A) ensure timely and coordinated communication within the       Administration, including enhanced communication and       coordination between different agencies and organizations       within the Administration;        (B) ensure timely and coordinated communication from the       Administration, including public statements, throughout the       duration of the investigation and related foodborne illness       outbreak;        (C) identify a single point of contact within the       Administration for public inquiries regarding any actions by       the Administrator related to a recall;        (D) coordinate with Federal, State, local, and Tribal       authorities, as appropriate, that have responsibilities       related to the recall of a food or a foodborne illness       outbreak associated with a food that is subject to the       recall, including notification of the Secretary of       Agriculture and the Secretary of Education in the event such       recalled food is a commodity intended for use in a child       nutrition program (as defined in section 25(b) of the Richard       B.
