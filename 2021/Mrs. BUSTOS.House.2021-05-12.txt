 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Demings for putting  this together. We are grateful to her.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize National Police Week. I stand here  today with my heart full of gratitude, gratitude for the brave police  officers who saved our lives, who saved the lives of the staff who were  here on January 6, who saved our Nation from suffering further harm at  the hands of those who would see our democracy destroyed.   It was January 6, and many of us stood on this floor. I was with many  of the people here today that afternoon when the armed mob broke into  our Nation's Capitol and threatened us, targeted us, hunted us.   The moment they reached that door right there, the one just a few  rows back, and began to shatter the glass on that door, there was just  a handful of police officers who bravely stood in their way.   It was in that moment that my thoughts were as a mother, as a  daughter, as a citizen. Thoughts of legislation and budgets and  parliamentary rules were not on my mind.                                time  1730    What I wanted to do that day, and those of us who were on the floor  that day, we just wanted to live. But it was our Capitol Police  officers who stood up, stepped up, and fought back that mob. They  protected all of us that day. They put their lives on the line. One  even made the ultimate sacrifice to keep us and to keep our democracy  safe.   It wasn't until after those terrifying moments, when we reached a  secure room, that I saw a text from my husband, who is the sheriff of  Rock Island County, where we live and have lived for 30-plus years. He  reminded me that the Capitol Police were there to protect us, and to  listen to them. He could not have been more right.   Shortly after that day, after we returned to the Chamber where our  lives had been in jeopardy, I shared my experiences. Here is what I  wrote: ``I feel sure that the Capitol Police saved countless lives. I  don't think that America yet fully comprehends just how close we came  to seeing Members of the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate kidnapped, held  hostage, or perhaps even murdered. That mob had lethal intent.''   But it is because of our Capitol Police, because they risked their  lives, because Brian Sicknick gave his life, that I could walk through  that door and stand here on this floor today and speak to you. I speak  with gratitude.   Earlier this year, I was proud to vote to pass a bill awarding the  Capitol Police a Congressional Gold Medal. It is my hope that the  Senate will pass this legislation soon. But, today, I am so proud to be  able to stand here to recognize National Police Week, a week to say  thank you and to recognize those who have made the ultimate sacrifice  in the line of duty.   This year, 394 names were added to the National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial. Thank you to those 394 officers. Thank you to the  nine Illinois police officers whose lives were part of that list. And  as the wife of a sheriff, let me say that 394 is too many, and 9 is too  many.   Thank you to my husband of--35 years?   I am sorry; I think that is right, Gerry, if you are watching.   Thank you to my husband. He has been in law enforcement for 38 years.  I do know that number. Thank you for his service to our community and  his career in law enforcement.   Thank you to the men and women in law enforcement who sacrifice and  serve and protect others every single day.
