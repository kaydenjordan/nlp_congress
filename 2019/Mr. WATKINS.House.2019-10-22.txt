 Madam Speaker, today, I was in these official closed- door impeachment investigations. I use the word ``official'' loosely  since the grounds upon which the Democrats are acting are shaky, at  best.   Access is being limited. I am a member of one of these committees  that is allowed to be in there, but as I look around and see no more  than perhaps a dozen or so Republicans, I think to myself that the  entire country should see what the Democrats are up to, the entire  world should.   Soon that will happen because although I don't know what I am even  allowed to share, because I don't understand these official  formalities, I do know that I will tell the world everything that I  can, and the truth will come out with time.   It is not what is best for our constituency. We ought to be passing  the USMCA. We ought to be ensuring our borders are safe. We ought to be  fighting against surprise billing and exorbitant healthcare costs.                            ____________________
