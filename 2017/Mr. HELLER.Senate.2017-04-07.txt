 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Robert  Hoo, the founder of Nevadans for the Common Good, an organization  dedicated to community and making the great State of Nevada a better  place through public service. Robert was born and raised in China and  moved to New York with his family after the Communist revolution. For  the last 5 years, Robert has lived in Las Vegas and committed himself  to the goals of his impressive organization.   Nevadans for the Common Good trains everyday citizens for public  service, such as running for political office or becoming active on an  issue. The organization is run by 40 generous institutions and is a  collection of religious congregations, civic associations, professional  organizations, schools, fraternities, sororities, and other community- based groups.   Robert understands the importance of a good and honest government  that truly works for the people. Having experienced the impact of  communism on his family in China, he only further appreciated American  ideals, and these values fuel the work he does to this day.   Robert Hoo has taken public and community service very seriously.  Before he moved to Nevada, Robert worked for a nonprofit organization  in Connecticut and also for an organization that targeted neighborhood  blight in East Brooklyn. The people of Nevada are very fortunate that  Robert's journey took him to our State.   Lastly, Robert's dedication to finding common ground is truly  admirable. In today's political environment, too often we focus on what  divides us. Robert, on the other hand, chooses to focus on what unites  us at the grassroots level and is committed to helping people solve  real problems for others and themselves. The world needs more public  servants that have Robert's dedication to helping others and making a  difference.   I am both humbled and honored to acknowledge Robert Hoo for his  outstanding work. His organization is making a difference for so many  people who want to better our great State through public service. As  the senior Senator from the great State of Nevada, I am proud to call  Robert a Nevadan and applaud the work he has done and will continue to  do for years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Bobi  Pike-Oates of Las Vegas for her service to our country and to the great  State of Nevada. Bobi Pike-Oates served in the U.S. Air Force for 23  years, retiring with the rank of senior master sergeant. Now, even in  retirement, she remains active in various groups and dedicated to  helping veterans and the community.   Bobi Pike-Oates traveled the world during her time in the Air Force,  serving in Hungary for Operation Joint Endeavor and in Turkey for  Operation Provide Comfort. Being so far from home was, of course, very  difficult, and we cannot adequately repay Bobi for the sacrifices she  made in order to serve our country.   Throughout her time in the Air Force, Bobi earned awards and received  recognition for going above and beyond in her service. During her time  at Nevada's own Nellis Air Force Base, Bobi received the Senior  Noncommissioned Officer of the Year, as well as the Resource Advisor of  the Year Air Warfare Center.   Even though she is now retired from the Air Force, Bobi Pike-Oates's  commitment to serving her country remains just as strong. Currently,  Bobi serves on various boards, commissions, and associations that help  our veterans. Bobi is a board member for the Women Veterans of Nevada,  a life member of the Air Forces Association, a charter member of the  Women in Military Service for America, Air Force Sergeants Association,  American Legion, life member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and a  life member of the Disabled American Veterans. She also serves on the  State of Nevada Women Veterans Advisory Committee. Through these  various organizations, Bobi continues to make Nevada proud.   I am both humbled and honored to acknowledge Bobi Pike-Oates for her  service to our country. Her sacrifices and continued commitment to  helping those who served makes me proud, and it is an honor to call her  a fellow Nevadan. As Nevada's senior Senator, I look forward to seeing  her continue to inspire others and work to help fellow veterans who,  like her, make it possible for us to live in the freest nation on  Earth.                            ____________________
