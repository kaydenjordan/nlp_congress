 Madam President, I ask that the Senate observe a moment  of silence in honor of Senator Dianne Feinstein.   (Moment of silence.)   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.    Madam President--the first woman President pro tempore  of the U.S. Senate--earlier this morning, we lost a giant in the  Senate.   Senator Dianne Feinstein was one of the most amazing people whoever  graced the Senate, whoever graced the country. She had so many amazing,  wonderful qualities wrapped up in one incredible human being. She was  smart. She was strong. She was brave. She was compassionate.   But maybe the trait that stood out most of all was her amazing  integrity. Her integrity was a diamond. Her integrity shone like a  beacon across the Senate and across the country for all to see and,  hopefully, emulate.   Dianne Feinstein would typically say, when you asked her how was she  voting on something: Let me study this issue before taking a position.  Let me go home and read on it. And when she came back, if she believed  the cause or the vote was right and vital to any issue she cared about,  she not only voted for it, there was no stopping her in getting it  done.   She would take on any force, any special interest, any opponent with  relentless integrity and would wear those opponents down until she  succeeded. Again, her integrity just shown through them. And she won  and she won and she won and each time made the country a better place.   I saw this up close when she passed the assault weapons ban, a  passion of hers after what happened to her in California. The NRA was a  relentless, often mean-spirited and chauvinistic foe. They oozed  vitriol against her. But they didn't scare her. They didn't stop her.  And they failed against her. Like most of her opponents, they failed  against her. Her perseverance, her strength, and most of all her  integrity shown through.   I was privileged to carry the bill in the House after she had passed  it in the Senate. She guided me every step of the way, and her strength  and her integrity strengthened all of us who were fighting that uphill  fight.   As we went through that bill, it became clear to me, Dianne Feinstein  is not like the others. She is in a class of her own.   Of course, it wasn't just the assault weapons ban she fought her. Her  accomplishments also included championing the Violence Against Women  Act, protecting oversight authority during the investigation into U.S.  torture, fighting for climate justice, fighting for marriage equality,  fighting for reproductive justice--the list goes on and on.   As chair of the Intelligence Committee, Dianne fought for what was  right. Even if it was hard and difficult and took months and years to  dig in and find out what actually went wrong, she never stopped.   She took on the CIA and inserted Congress's oversight authority  during the investigation into the United States' use of torture.   Through all of her accomplishments--this one and all the others--she  always displayed quintessential grace and strength. None of these  ``sons of guns'' against her ever rattled her.   I remember a few years back, when a particularly nasty Senator tried  to put  [[Page S4800]]  Senator Feinstein down in a condescending--many would say--chauvinistic  way. She reacted not defensively but with strength and poise and  integrity. And within 3 minutes, she put this colleague in his place.  By the end of it, everyone in the room, on both sides of the aisle, was  smiling. That was Dianne to a tee--powerful, prepared, unflappable.   She had to be. Whenever she did something, she was often the first to  do it. She was elected as the first woman president of the San  Francisco Board of Supervisors, the first woman to serve as mayor of  San Francisco, the first woman to serve as U.S. Senator for California,  the first woman to chair both the Senate Rules and Intelligence  Committees, the first woman member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  The list goes on and on and on and on.    Our Nation will be forever thankful to Senator Feinstein for the  accomplishments she fought for.   I, too, am personally indebted to Dianne, not just as a colleague-- which, of course, I am in so many ways as a colleague--but as a friend  and as a father of two daughters.   Dianne's work extended far beyond the U.S. Senate floor, as she gave  a voice, a platform, and a leader to women throughout the country for  decades.   Dianne didn't just push down doors that were closed for women, she  held them open for generations of women after her to follow her.   She gave a voice, a platform, and a model for women across the  country who aspire to roles in leadership in public service who want to  leave their own mark on the world, who want to make this country a  better place for others.   Today, there are 25 women serving in this Chamber, and every one of  them will admit they stand on Dianne's shoulders.   So Dianne's impact extended far beyond the Senate floor and far  beyond politics itself.   Today, we grieve. We look at that desk, and we know what we have  lost. But we also give thanks--thanks to someone so rarefied, so brave,  so graceful a presence that someone like that served in this Chamber  for so many years.   In closing, let me just say this: The sign of a leader is someone who  dedicates the whole of their spirit for a cause greater than  themselves; the sign of a hero is someone who fights for others, who  endures for others no matter the cost, no matter the odds; and the sign  of a friend is someone who stands by your side to fight the good fight  on good days and on the bad.   Dianne Feinstein was all of this and more, a friend, a hero for so  many, a leader who changed the nature of the Senate and who changed the  fabric of the Nation--America--for the better.   As the Nation mourns this tremendous loss, we are comforted in  knowing how many mountains Dianne moved, how many lives she impacted,  how many glass ceilings she shattered along the way. America--America-- is a better place because of Senator Dianne Feinstein.   Today, I join with my colleagues in mourning our beloved friend and  colleague.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, before I yield to the President pro  tempore, I would like to acknowledge Dianne's daughter Katherine with  Speaker Pelosi in the Gallery.    I always wave with friendship and affection to my  friend, the Senator from Louisiana.   I was going to speak for a few minutes; is that OK?    Mr. President, I am going to speak on two topics; first,  what is happening in my hometown of New York and then, second, what is  going on over there in the House of Representatives.   As we speak, my hometown of New York is experiencing some of the most  frightening rainfall and flooding we have seen since Hurricane Sandy.  About a month's worth of rain has inundated Brooklyn in just a matter  of  [[Page S4815]]  hours, and some parts of the city have experienced up to 5 inches of  rain. Flash floods remain in effect from Manhattan to Queens to  Brooklyn.   And we are not through the danger yet. Another powerful storm is  expected over the next day, and the situation remains dangerous.   I will continue closely monitoring the otherworldly flooding we are  seeing in New York.   A little while ago, I spoke to the Governor to tell her that I will  do everything on the Federal level to get New York the help it needs.   Earlier today, I sent a letter to FEMA and a few minutes ago spoke to  the FEMA Administrator, telling her New York needs help.   FEMA has promised me two things; one, to deal with the immediate  effects of the flood, any equipment and other types of resources they  need; and, second, later, to provide resources New Yorkers will need to  rebuild and recover.   And here in the Senate, I will work to secure any Federal assistance  possible to fund relief efforts and aid those who need to rebuild from  the flood damage.   Again, I cannot stress enough that we are not through these storms  just yet. Everyone please follow emergency guidance and stay safe.                            Continuing Resolution    Mr. President, now on the CR and the shutdown, we stand now at the  precipice of an unnecessary, reckless, and entirely Republican- manufactured shutdown.   In less than 48 hours, funding that pays the salaries of our troops  for border enforcement, for TSA operations, nutrition programs, food  inspections, all--all--will come to a halt.   As I have said for months, Congress has only one option to avoid a  shutdown, bipartisanship. We needed bipartisanship yesterday. We need  it today. We will need it tomorrow. It was true yesterday, today, and  tomorrow.   But in the House, sadly, unlike the Senate, we have not seen  bipartisanship. We have only seen chaos. We have only seen paralysis.   A few hours ago, Speaker McCarthy held a vote on a truly radical CR  proposal everyone knew never stood a chance of passing the Senate.   And now, the House Republicans' CR has failed to even pass the House  by an unexpectedly large and decisive margin, 34 votes--much more than  most expected.   The Speaker has spent weeks catering to the hard right, and now he  finds himself in the exact same position he has been in since the  beginning: no plan forward, no closer to passing something that avoids  a shutdown.   The Speaker needs to abandon his doomed mission of trying to please  MAGA extremists, and, instead, he needs to work across the aisle to  keep the government open.   Things seem to be getting worse for the Speaker rather than better,  and it is time for him to try bipartisanship.   Here in the Senate, bipartisanship is precisely what we are pursuing  by working on our CR.   Just yesterday, I am proud to say, 76 Senators voted in favor of  proceeding to the CR.   I salute not only Chairman Murray, but Ranking Member Collins, and  Leader McConnell, and the so many others on the other side of the aisle  who joined us in moving forward.   We will continue working on the CR over the course of today and see  if we can find some agreement to pass it quickly.   I note that these 76 Senators are voting in favor of proceeding to  the CR even as we work through debates about the final content of the  bill. That is what bipartisanship means--not that we agree on  everything but that disagreements do not paralyze the process.   When the Senate finishes its work, it is imperative the House move on  the Senate-passed, bipartisan CR. It will be our last chance to  ensuring that a shutdown is avoided. Any more time the Speaker spends  trying to cobble together hard-right wish lists that can't even pass  the House would be a grievous mistake.   So to Speaker McCarthy, let me be clear. If you don't want our troops  to go without pay, work in a bipartisan way. If you don't want to see  border funding endangered, work in a bipartisan way. If you don't want  to see seniors lose access to Meals on Wheels or cuts to nutrition for  women, infants, and children or holds on small business loans, work in  a bipartisan way.   At the end of the day, these MAGA extremists who are the ones  responsible for bringing us to the brink fundamentally do not care  about funding the government. Some of them are actually gleeful about a  shutdown. Coddling the hard right is as futile as trying to nail Jell-O  to a wall, and the harder the Speaker tries, the bigger mess he makes.  And that mess is going to hurt the American people the most.   I hope the Speaker snaps out of the vice grip he has put himself in  and stops succumbing to the 30 or so extremists who are running the  show in the House.   Mr. Speaker, time has almost run out.   I yield the floor.
