 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  hosting this Special Order.   Madam Speaker, this week, President Biden visited Philadelphia and  attempted to spin a narrative fully detached from the reality Americans  face every day. Speaking to a group of labor unions, the President  professed to be advancing a pro-worker agenda. He proclaimed, ``We are  changing people's lives.''   Well, he is right, only not for the better. Inflation is at a 40-year  high, costing Pennsylvania families an additional $517 more per month.   Gas prices are above $5 a gallon, forcing families to spend $2,800  more at the pump than last year.   Pennsylvanians are smart, hardworking people. They know that they are  not better off today than they were just 18 short months ago.   While the President continues to blame Republicans in Congress for  the economic disaster he has created, the fact remains that Democrats  control the House, the Senate, and the White House. If the President  truly cared about stopping skyrocketing inflation, he would stop  calling for more out-of-control spending, stop shutting down American  energy production, and stop blaming others for his failures.   It is time that he has faith in the American people and gets out of  the way.  [[Page H5599]]
