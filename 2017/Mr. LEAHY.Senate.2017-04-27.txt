 Mr. President, the Vermont Small Business Development  Center, VtSBDC, is joining SBDC's across the country in celebrating its  25th anniversary as a crucial resource for entrepreneurs. These centers  provide services to facilitate the creation, sustainability, and growth  of viable businesses. In Vermont, it is no secret that we take  particular pride in our local businesses. Our entrepreneurs and their  businesses are at the heart of our vibrant communities, and they are  the roots of a thriving economy.   Over the past 25 years, VtSBDC has helped countless businesses  capitalize on their potential. From glassblowers to forestry and  sugarmakers to restaurants, VtSBDC has delivered thousands of hours of  professional business counseling and training that is focused on  strategic planning, business development, financial planning, and cash  flow management. After the devastation of Tropical Storm Irene, VtSBDC  reached out with State and Federal partners to offer small business  owners the assistance and support necessary to undergo full recovery  efforts. I am regularly reminded of VtSBDC's worth to entrepreneurs  through client testimonials, regularly highlighting that, without the  assistance of VtSBDC staff, their business would not have been able to  reach the next levels. In addition to working with individuals to  achieve their dreams, VtSBDC has also supported business incubators, or  coworking spaces, where fledgling businesses and industries find their  footing alongside other new businessowners.   Founded as a pilot program run by the Small Business Administration  in 1977, national small business development centers have a long  history proving public-private partnerships and,  [[Page S2601]]  when done right, are a successful tool in expanding local pilot  programs that benefit communities and States across our Nation. Small  business owners always face many obstacles, but the professionals at  VtSBDC provide invaluable resources, support, and advice to help  overcome these challenges.   I want to congratulate the Vermont Small Business Development Center  on their 25th anniversary and thank their dedicated staff for their  commitment, energy, and time working to make sure that Vermont's small  businesses remain strongly grounded and growing in Vermont.                            ____________________     Mr. President, over the past few years, the national  headlines have been dominated by stories about the high cost of  pharmaceuticals. We have seen jaw-dropping examples, such as the  unconscionable price increase overnight by Turing Pharmaceuticals of  their drug for patients with HIV, from $13.50 to $750 per pill.   Pharmaceutical companies should be compensated for their important  work developing lifesaving treatments. But when companies engage in  predatory practices at the expense of consumers, we must act. That is  why today I am reintroducing the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to  Equivalent Samples, or CREATES, Act, bipartisan legislation to end  inappropriate delay tactics that are used by some brand-name drug  manufacturers to block competition from more affordable generic drugs.  I am glad to be joined by Senators Grassley, Klobuchar, Lee, and  Feinstein, and several other Senators of both parties in introducing  this bill today.   The first delay tactic addressed by the CREATES Act involves the  withholding of drug samples that generic manufacturers need to gain  regulatory approval. Federal law requires generic competitors to prove  that their low-cost alternative is as equally safe and effective as the  brand-name drug with which they wish to compete. Unfortunately, some  brand-name companies are preventing generic manufacturers from  obtaining the samples they need to make the necessary comparison. This  simple delay tactic uses regulatory safeguards as a weapon to block  competition. The FDA has reported receiving more than 100 inquiries  from generic product developers who were unable to access samples of a  brand-name drug to compare their generic product.   The second delay tactic addressed by the CREATES Act involves the  development of shared safety protocols. For some high-risk drugs,  Federal law requires a generic drug manufacturer to join the brand-name  drug manufacturer in a single, shared safety protocol for distribution  of the drug. Despite this requirement, some brand-name companies are  refusing to negotiate shared safety protocols with potential generic  competitors, again undermining those competitors' ability to gain FDA  approval for their generic versions of such drugs.   The revised version of the CREATES Act also allows the FDA more  discretion to approve alternative safety protocols, rather than require  parties to develop shared safety protocols. Any safety protocol  approved by the FDA must meet the rigorous statutory standards already  in place.   These exclusionary practices thwart competition and deny consumers  the benefit of lower drug prices. I share the concerns of Vermonters  and Americans across the country that many prescription drugs are  simply too expensive. When brand companies can artificially raise the  price of drugs by using predatory practices, patients suffer. Illnesses  get worse. Families, government programs, and other payers in the  healthcare system ultimately bear those added, unnecessary costs.   This legislation is not a silver bullet to address all of the complex  problems driving the high costs of medications. In addition to the  delayed entry of generic drugs, I am troubled by the rising cost of  treatments for opioid overdoses, which remain expensive for local law  enforcement agencies, even though there are generic competitors. In  Vermont, many patients are grappling with the extremely high cost of a  new drug for hepatitis C that will likely have years of market  exclusivity before generic alternatives can be made. Last year we  learned the price of EpiPen had increased by almost 500 percent since  2009, now costing roughly $600 for a two-pack. The sharp increase in  price combined with the relatively short shelf life of the product--1  year to 18 months--has put this lifesaving drug out of reach for many.   Think for a moment about the impact of price hikes on the family of a  patient facing a life-threatening illness. Across the country,  hardworking Americans feel like the system is rigged against them by  corporations that are looking to make a profit at any price. With  examples like Turing and Mylan, it is no wonder they feel that way.   The CREATES Act is one piece of the puzzle, addressing  anticompetitive behavior that delays the creation of affordable generic  drugs. Drug affordability is a bipartisan issue that affects each and  every American. These reforms will make a difference. I hope other  Senators will join us in supporting these bipartisan reforms.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DAINES (for himself, Ms. Heitkamp, Mr. Barrasso, and Mr.          Tester):   S. 975.
