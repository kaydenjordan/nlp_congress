 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to enforce the final rule entitled ``Oil and Natural       Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and       Modified Sources'' published by the Environmental Protection       Agency in the Federal Register on June 3, 2016 (81 Fed. Reg.       35824).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma.    Madam Chair, this amendment would prohibit funds from  enforcing the Obama administration's EPA methane rule.   This rule is currently facing litigation and uncertainty, and  Congress must act to block this job-killing regulation estimated to  cost the U.S. economy $530 million annually.   Methane emissions from oil and natural gas have significantly  declined in recent decades without multiple, overlapping Federal  regulations, and this is no exception.   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, the gentleman's amendment would block the  EPA from regulating methane emissions from sources in the oil and gas  sector.   Late last night, we had a discussion about whether or not methane  from flare-ups should be captured and saved as energy and used as  energy. Although this amendment is different, I think it begs the  question as to why we aren't making sure that we are capturing every  ounce of energy that is produced in this country and reusing it.   But back to the gentleman's amendment today.   Methane, I want to point out, is a primary component of natural gas.  It is a potent greenhouse gas, with global warming potential more than  25 times greater than carbon dioxide.   In 2013, nearly one-third of methane emissions in the United States  came from oil and gas production, producing transmission and  distribution. There is no doubt at all that methane contributes to the  increased levels of greenhouse gas concentrations, which contribute to  the long-lasting changes in our climate, such as rising global  temperatures, sea level change, in weather and precipitation patterns,  and changes in the ecosystem's habits and species diversity.   But more important, I think public health is at risk, including more  heat waves and drought. That means worsening smog, increasing intensity  of extreme weather like we are seeing again this weekend, increasing  the range of ticks and mosquitos, which can spread disease, such as  Lyme, West Nile virus, and Zika.   Madam Chair, I would just ask the majority to stop this assault on  the environment and let us work together not only to capture all the  energy possible, but work together to reduce the climate change that  our planet and the United States, this weekend, is experiencing.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar), my colleague.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar), my colleague.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Madam Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), my chairman.    Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, once again, I would like to point out that  the rule will prevent the waste of an estimated 65 billion cubic feet  of natural gas a year and save the taxpayers $330 million annually, and  that is energy that could be put to work here in the United States.   The public health risks, including more heat waves and drought, as I  talked about, the climate change, the health and welfare of our current  and future generations must be taken into account. We must take action;  we must do something about this.   This is a step backwards to adopt this amendment, so I urge my  colleagues to oppose this amendment and to work to protect our planet.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma  will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 74 Offered by Mr. Mullin    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 74  printed in House Report 115-297.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to prepare, propose, or promulgate any regulation or       guidance that references or relies on the analysis contained       in--        (1) ``Technical Support Document: Social Cost of Carbon for       Regulatory Impact Analysis Under Executive Order 12866'',       published by the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of       Carbon, United States Government, in February 2010;        (2) ``Technical Support Document: Technical Update of the       Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Under       Executive Order 12866'', published by the Interagency Working       Group on Social Cost of Carbon, United States Government, in       May 2013 and revised in November 2013;        (3) ``Revised Draft Guidance for Federal Departments and       Agencies on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the       Effects of Climate Change in NEPA Reviews'', published by the       Council on Environmental Quality on December 24, 2014 (79       Fed. Reg. 77802);        (4) ``Technical Support Document: Technical Update of the       Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Under       Executive Order 12866'', published by the Interagency Working       Group on Social Cost of Carbon, United States Government, in       July 2015;        (5) ``Addendum to the Technical Support Document on Social       Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Under Executive       Order 12866: Application of the Methodology to Estimate the       Social Cost of Methane and the Social Cost of Nitrous       Oxide'', published by the Interagency Working Group on Social       Cost of Greenhouse Gases, United States Government, in August       2016; or        (6) ``Technical Support Document: Technical Update of the       Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis Under       Executive Order 12866'', published by the Interagency Working       Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, United States       Government, in August 2016.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma.    Madam Chair, my amendment would prohibit the  implementation of the Obama administration's social cost of carbon,  SCC, rule.   Congress and the American people have repeatedly rejected cap-and- trade proposals. The Obama administration continuously used social cost  of carbon models, which can easily be manipulated, in order to attempt  to justify new job-killing regulations.   The House has made a clear, strong record of opposition to the social  cost of carbon, voting at least 11 times to block, defund, or oppose  the proposal.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, this amendment is a harmful rider. It has  no place on an appropriation bill. This is a big policy discussion that  we are talking about that impacts every man, woman, and child here in  the United States, and, I might add, I believe, around the world, the  amendment that would prohibit the EPA from considering the social cost  of carbon as part of its rulemaking.   The social cost of carbon is an estimate of economic damages  associated with small increases of carbon dioxide in emissions in a  given year, and it does represent the best scientific information  available for incorporating the impacts of carbon pollution into  regulatory analysis.   Weakening or eliminating the use of the social cost of carbon as a  tool for Federal agencies would ignore the sobering costs of health,  environment, and economic impacts of extreme weather, rising  temperatures, intensifying smog, and other impacts.   Madam Chair, last night we had many amendments reducing the ability  of the EPA to take into account the public health. I believe we have a  responsibility to make sure that we are not only the watchdogs and  stewards for making sure that our public lands are used in appropriate  and effective ways, but we also have a responsibility to use science to  make sure that we are doing our due diligence to protect the health of  the American people.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time until closing.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Calvert), my chairman.    Madam Chair, I would urge a ``yes'' vote on this  amendment.  [[Page H7205]]    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, once again, I know that the gentleman who  brought the amendment would like to have an active debate and like to  see some movement on this issue, but by doing it on an appropriations  rule this way, where we don't have a full transparent discussion, we  don't have the scientific community coming in, the health community,  and the industry that he would like to see testify, we find ourselves  doing these stopgap riders on appropriations bills that only work for  the year of the appropriation. It is a way in which we are not using  our power as legislators effectively to have change. So these riders  are best done in the policy committee, not on the appropriations bill.   In closing, I would like to just clearly say that I support science  and I believe we should not abandon science while trying to tackle  climate change, and, therefore, I strongly oppose the gentleman's  amendment and would encourage a ``no'' vote.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma  will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 75 Offered by Mr. Polis    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 75  printed in House Report 115-297.
