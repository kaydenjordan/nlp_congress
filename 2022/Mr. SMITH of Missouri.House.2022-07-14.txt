 Mr. Speaker, as families are forced to make  tough financial decisions every day because of sky-high inflation,  Washington Democrats are fueling the economic crisis by spending  hundreds of billions of dollars to advance their radical agenda.   But that is just the spending they are trying to pass through  Congress. President Biden is using executive actions to secretly put  his radical agenda in place, footing taxpayers with a $532 billion bill  without any input of Congress.   He spent $85 billion to continue a pandemic-era student loan payment  moratorium benefiting higher-income earners. He put $11 billion down  the drain by eliminating strengthened work requirements to SNAP for  able-bodied adults without dependents.   Instead of spending half a trillion dollars on things like reducing  work incentives and giving handouts to the wealthy, President Biden  needs to get serious about solving the significant challenges facing  our Nation.                            ____________________
