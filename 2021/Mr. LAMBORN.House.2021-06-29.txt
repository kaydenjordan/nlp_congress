 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to protect the sanctity of  human life, especially the lives of the unborn.   The Hyde amendment has saved nearly 2\1/2\ million lives since its  first inclusion in an appropriation bill in 1976.   This historically bipartisan amendment which prohibits the use of  taxpayer dollars paying for abortion is supported by a majority of  Americans.   H.R. 18, of which I am an original cosponsor, codifies the Hyde  amendment and applies it to all government funding, cementing the  protections for the most vulnerable Americans. This bill is called the  No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and I ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
