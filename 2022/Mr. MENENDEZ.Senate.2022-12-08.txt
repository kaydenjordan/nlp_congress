 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.      Hon. Robert Menendez,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Pursuant to the reporting requirements       of Section 36(b)(5)(A) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA),       as amended, we are forwarding Transmittal No. 0U-22. This       notification relates to enhancements or upgrades from the       level of sensitivity of technology or capability described in       the Section 36(b)(l) AECA certification 22-49 ofJuly 21,       2022.            Sincerely,                                                   James A. Hursch,                                                          Director.        Enclosures.                            Transmittal No. 0U-22       Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensitivity of Technology           or Capability (Sec. 36(b)(5)(A), AECA)        (i) Purchaser: Government of Australia.        (ii) Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 22-49; Date: July       21, 2022; Military Department: Air Force.        (iii) Description: On July 21, 2022, Congress was notified       by Congressional certification transmittal number 22-49, of       the possible sale, under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export       Control Act, of eighty (80) Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff       Missiles--Extended Range (JASSM-ER) (AGM-158B with telemetry       kits and/or AGM-158B-2 configurations). Also included were       missile containers and support equipment; JASSM training       missiles; weapon system support; spare parts, consumables,       accessories, and repair/return support; integration and test       support and equipment; personnel training; software delivery       and support; classified and unclassified publications and       technical documentation; transportation; U.S. Government and       contractor engineering, technical and logistics support       services, studies and surveys; and other related elements of       logistical and program support. The estimated total cost was       $235 million. Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $157       million of this total.  [[Page S7065]]         This transmittal reports the addition of the following MDE       items: one (1) AGM-158 Instrumented Test Vehicle (ITV); two       (2) JASSM AGM-158 Separation Test Vehicles (STV); two (2)       JASSM Jettison Test Vehicles (JTV); and two (2) JASSM AGM-158       Mass Simulation Vehicles (MSV). Also included are non-MDE       KGV-135A embedded encryption modules; munition telemetry       kits; and additional classified test equipment. The estimated       total value of the additional items is $26 million. The total       estimated MDE value will increase by $17 million to $174       million, resulting in an estimated total case value of $261       million.        (iv) Significance: The proposed sale will support       Australia's capability to test advanced, long-range strike       systems for employment from its Royal Australian Air Force       (RAAF) air platforms including, but not limited to, the F/A-      18F Super Hornet and F-35A Lightning II.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of the United       States. Australia is one of our most important allies in the       Western Pacific. The strategic location of this political and       economic power contributes significantly to ensuring peace       and economic stability in the region. It is vital to the U.S.       national interest to assist our ally in developing and       maintaining a strong and ready self-defense capability.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology:        The AGM-158 Instrumented Test Vehicle (ITV) is a flight       certification vehicle equipped with an intelligent Test       Instrumentation Kit (iTIK). The ITV collects airworthiness       data to ensure safe separation of the munition from the       aircraft.        The JASSM AGM-158 Separation Test Vehicle (STV), equipped       with an intelligent Test Instrumentation Kit (iTIK), collects       separation data during airworthiness/flight certification.        The JASSM Jettison Test Vehicle (JTV) is used during the       airworthiness data collection process to ensure safe jettison       of the munition from the aircraft. It provides pilot captive-      carry training with recording capability for post-release       data analysis.        The JASSM AGM-158 Mass Simulation Vehicle (MSV) is a test       missile used in support of missile load training and pilot       captive-carry training.        The KGV-135A is a high-speed, general purpose encryptor/      decryptor module used for wide-band data encryption.        The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        (vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: December 7, 2022.                            ____________________
