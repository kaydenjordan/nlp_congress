 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Engel for allowing me  this opportunity.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 37, in which  Congress will finally reclaim its constitutional authority over the  power to declare war and will finally address the terrible suffering  happening in Yemen.   For 4 years, we have aided the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen, which has  contributed to the gravest humanitarian crisis in the world, a man-made  crisis that we could help alleviate, rather than contribute to. This is  4 years too long.   The Trump administration has cozied up to the Saudis, ignoring the  harm they cause in Yemen and their egregious violations of human  rights. The President has expressed his personal affirmation for the  Saudi Kingdom on several occasions, saying, ``They give us a lot of  business,'' and, ``They've been a great ally to me.''   Trump and those opposed to this resolution have argued that our ties  to Saudi Arabia are too precious and that our cooperation on  counterterrorism and countering Iran would be jeopardized by this  resolution. But in December, when discussing an earlier version of this  resolution, Senator Lindsey Graham wrote the following: ``The fear that  the Saudis will stop cooperating with the U.S. on terrorism or Iran  isn't rational. Those threats pose as much of a danger to the Saudis as  they do to America. Demanding better from allies isn't downgrading the  relationship; it's a sign that Americans take our principles seriously  and won't be taken advantage of by anyone, friend or foe.''   Mr. Chairman, I urge Congress to reassert its constitutional  authority to work to end the suffering of millions and to pass this war  powers resolution. This is what it is.
