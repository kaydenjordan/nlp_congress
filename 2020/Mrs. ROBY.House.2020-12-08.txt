 Mr. Speaker, I would like to include in the Record a  letter from the Judicial Conference of the United States voicing their  opposition and concerns to H.R. 8235, the Open Courts Act of 2020.                                              Judicial Conference of                                               the United States,                                   Washington, DC, December 7, 2020.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Leader: I write on behalf of the Judicial       Conference of the United States, the policy-making body of       the federal Judiciary, to express our continued strong       opposition to H.R. 8235, the Open Courts Act of 2020       (``OCA''), which is scheduled for floor action on Tuesday,       December 8, 2020. This legislation--which will take years to       implement--rushes forward without appropriate and necessary       assurances and provisions regarding the budget for such an       enormous undertaking. The bill as drafted will have       devastating budgetary and operational impact on the Judiciary       and our ability to serve the public.        We very much appreciate that you, along with House       Judiciary Courts Subcommittee Chairman Hank Johnson,       intervened last week after my helpful conversation with       Chairman Johnson to prompt more dialogue between the       branches. The many hours of staff conversations, through the       weekend, that followed your encouragement led to some       significant textual changes to the bill. We are grateful for       those efforts which addressed some of our concerns with the       previous version of the bill. Very serious concerns remain,       however, and further dialogue is much needed.        The fact is that our preliminary estimates for the cost of       this bill is orders of magnitude higher than the bill's       proponents have presumed--currently we are $2 billion apart--      and CBO's hurried and preliminary estimates of the cost of       developing and implementing a new electronic filing and       public access system, in our view, vastly underestimates the       cost of the bill. Critically, some of the bill's revenue       streams are also untested, difficult to administer and/or       impossible to estimate reliably in advance.        If our cost estimates are correct--or even marginally       closer to correct than the bill's proponents'--there is no       scenario in which the revenue generated by the bill could be       sufficient to cover those costs. This will force the       Judiciary to slash funding for staff and other critical       operations. Moreover, the Judiciary's backbone case       management system, and therefore the Judiciary itself, could       grind to a halt. In anticipation of a funding shortfall, the       bill now provides for an emergency pause in the transition to       the new system required by the bill. This might be preferable       to the forced accommodation of significant unbudgeted costs,       but such a pause in the middle of a massive transition of       systems would result in its own substantial disruptions.        Better information on the costs of this bill and the       revenues it would generate is needed to ensure that the       Judiciary and public users of this system avoid devastating       consequences. We believe we will have a much clearer picture       of cost projections in early Spring 2021, at the conclusion       of the first phase of a study for a replacement case       management system to be performed by GSA.        The Judiciary has other major concerns with the bill,       including issues of technological feasibility, security, and       governance, but the threat of devastating budget consequences       for the Third Branch simply cannot be overemphasized.        The Judiciary is committed to working collaboratively with       the next Congress to improve our systems for filing, storing,       managing, and making available to the public all relevant       court records. We recognize and share Congress' bipartisan       interest in a modern, effective, fair and successfully funded       system. The current version of the Open Courts Act, however,       is not the way to accomplish those goals. We look forward to       working through these shared goals with you in the future.            Sincerely,                                                     James C. Duff,                                                         Secretary.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), my friend, for yielding.   Thank you so much, Leader Hoyer, I just appreciate your friendship  all these years. I really do appreciate the time you have given me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise before you and my colleagues here today to speak  for my final time on the House floor.   Mr. Speaker, 17 years ago, my husband, Riley, and I prayerfully  decided I would put my name on the ballot for the first time. Never  could we have imagined that that original decision to run for the  Montgomery City Council would lead us to serve five terms in the U.S.  House of Representatives.   We are so grateful that God allowed us to serve our country in this  way, and we give all honor and glory to Him. I count it a great  privilege to have served the people of Alabama's Second Congressional  District over the past decade, and I cannot adequately express how  deeply thankful I am for the confidence my constituents have placed in  me over the years.   Each of you sitting here before me knows the responsibility that  comes along with being a Member of Congress. Yes, we are required to  vote and to be the conscience of those we represent, but serving our  constituents back home truly changes lives in our communities for the  better.   As I look back on the wonderful things Team Roby was able to  accomplish, along with the help of my colleagues in the Alabama  delegation, I realized that our most significant duty is to help those  who need us. Whether it is requesting assistance with the VA or another  Federal agency, assisting with cleanup following a large-scale weather  event, voicing an opinion, or booking tours of the U.S. Capitol, my  doors have always remained open to each person I represent.   I am thankful for the unique opportunities given to me by those who  came before me, especially the chance to serve on several impactful  committees, including Committee on Appropriations, Committee on the  Judiciary, Committee on Agriculture, Committee on Armed Services,  Committee on Education and the Workforce, and the Select Committee on  Benghazi. Much  [[Page H7027]]  work has been done in each of these revered committees to impact the  lives of my constituents, and for that, I am forever grateful.   I have been asked many times over the past few months what will I  miss the most upon my departure, and my answer has remained the same-- the relationships.   The genuine friendships formed with my colleagues, my constituents,  and so many others over the years, and interacting with these  individuals on a daily basis is what I will truly miss the most. For  many, this past year was and continues to be very challenging. We have  all experienced plenty of unfamiliar hardships. Not only has the global  health pandemic taken center stage, but America is marked by intense  division and polarization. Every time you turn on the television, you  see a depiction of disunity amongst the American people. I imagine many  Americans struggle to believe that friendship can actually exist within  the Halls of Congress.   It is incumbent upon us, Members of Congress, to join forces and work  together to get things done for the good of the American people. When  we reach across the aisle and work with the other side to arrive at a  compromise for the benefit of those we serve, we are truly at our best.  I believe the American people are starving to see bipartisanship in  action, especially during this time of much suffering and uncertainty.  People want to know their leaders are working together for the common  good and not just shouting each other down.   My greatest hope and prayer moving forward is that all Members of  Congress--new and old--regardless of party identification, beliefs, or  opinions, will come together and work toward a common goal to deliver  real results for the American people. I have faith in this institution,  and I have faith in each of you.   Now, I want to especially thank the people of the Second District. It  is your faith and trust in me as your representative that helped me  every step of the way. I am honored to have been given this incredibly  unique opportunity, and I thank you for letting me be your voice in  Congress.   Together, we have been able to deliver some incredible results for  our military, veterans, agricultural community, and the unborn. While  we made much progress together, the fight is not finished.   I want to thank my Congressional colleagues for your kindness and  friendship throughout the years. Not too far into my time in Congress,  I woke up realizing that the people I served with had become some of my  very best friends. I am confident these relationships will continue,  and I will certainly miss our time spent together having conversations  about our families and encouraging one another.   I want to thank my incredible staff, all former and present Members  of Team Roby, for your hard work on behalf of the people of Alabama and  our country. I know all Members say this, but I truly believe I have  the greatest staff in the world. I would never be able to execute this  job without the dedication and support of my staff. They have worked  tirelessly to serve the people of the Second District. We have a  special saying on our team: ``Once Team Roby, always Team Roby.''   And lastly, I thank my husband, Riley, and our two children, Margaret  and George, my parents, the Robys, and our entire village for  supporting our decision to serve our country. Your steadfast love and  constant support have carried us through the easy and the hard times,  and I love each of you dearly.   On behalf of Riley, Margaret, George, and myself, we sincerely thank  all of you who made our service to our country in the great State of  Alabama possible and those who offered their services along the way.   Thank you, and for the very last time, I yield back.
