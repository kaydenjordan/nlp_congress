 Thank you, Mr. President.   I would like to acknowledge that the Senator from Pennsylvania has  made a number of good points on the subject of Russia and the way we  need to go with Russia.   People have asked me about what I think about Mr. Putin and whether  he is trustworthy, and I tell them no. The way that I know he is  misleading the public on the issues of meddling is because his lips are  moving. He is not just telling the truth. Any time he talks about it,  it just flies in the face of Federal investigations, oversight  hearings, and classified briefings we have been involved in. I think it  is an example of where Members of Congress have really come together on  an issue.    Mr. President, I have 7 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
