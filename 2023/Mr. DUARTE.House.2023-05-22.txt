 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Nicole Moradzadeh  of Merced for her outstanding submission to the congressional art  contest.   A junior at El Capitan High School, Nicole's artwork titled, ``Give  Thanks,'' highlights the hardworking families who are the foundation of  California's Central Valley.   Nicole has beautifully expressed a unique perspective through her  captivating work. The piece resonates deeply, inspiring appreciation  for our working families. It serves as a reminder of the power of art  to transcend boundaries and unite us all.   I chose this piece because it pays such excellent homage to the  hardworking families that come to the Central Valley today to pursue  the American Dream as so many generations have before from all over the  world.   I am here in recognition of Nicole to express my commitment to make  sure that the American Dream stays alive today for future generations  as it has for all of those generations that have come before.                            ____________________
