 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a great leader from  the Charlotte-Mecklenburg community: Mother Sarah Mingo Stevenson.   After a lifetime devoted to public service in her community, to her  church, and, most importantly, family, Sarah Stevenson left us at the  grand age of 97 on September 26, 2023.   A Charlotte civil rights pioneer, she played a huge role in the  creation of an influential forum for political and social dialogue in  the city. The Tuesday Morning Breakfast Forum continues to this day and  is a required stop for candidates running for office in Charlotte and  statewide.   As the first Black woman to serve on the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board  of Education, from 1980 to 1988, she carried on her work of activism  from the seventies when she effected the desegregation of public  schools in the district.  [[Page H5860]]    Her courageous leadership and encouragement of small businesses,  women, and civil groups over the years have been part of her undying  legacy. She will be sorely missed.   I look forward to witnessing the many ways her legacy will continue  to impact lives to make Charlotte and North Carolina a more just and  fair place.   Sarah Stevenson earned the respect of men, women, and little  children, and she made the world much better than she found it.   Rest in peace, Ms. Stevenson.                            ____________________
