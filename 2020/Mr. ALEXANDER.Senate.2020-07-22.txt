 Mr. President, before the Senator from Colorado leaves  the floor, I offer to him my congratulations for his inspired  leadership of the Great American Outdoors Act.   This is something that good people on both sides of the aisle have  worked on, literally, for as much as a half a century. Now, people are  used to politicians who exaggerate, but that is no exaggeration,  because I have been around along enough to know and to understand  that--first, with the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which was first  enacted by Congress in 1964. I was the chairman of President Reagan's  Commission on American Outdoors and reiterated support for that in  1986. Senator Gardner, Senator Daines, Senator Portman, Senator Warner,  Senator Heinrich, Senator Manchin, Senator Cantwell, and a whole parade  of Senators on both sides of the aisle have worked very hard to make  this happen.   And it would not have happened without President Trump's leadership,  either. We would not have been able to spend the money the way that it  is spent--energy exploration money for conservation purposes--unless  the President's Office of Management and Budget had approved that.   So it is usually never true that an important piece of legislation is  passed by a single Senator. It is usually a parade of Senators. But  Senator Gardner has been leading the parade, and I congratulate him for  that and salute him on behalf of all of us who want to see our national  parks--the 419 different places we have, from the Great Smokies to the  Rocky Mountains, to Yellowstone, to Pearl Harbor, to the National  Mall--protected, as well as our national forests, our national wildlife  refuges, as well as the permanent funding for the Land and Water  Conservation Fund.   So I wanted to have an opportunity to say that before he left the  floor.   And I see my friend Senator Portman from Ohio here, who really, along  with Senator Warner of Virginia, began the work on the other part of  the bill--the bill that would take money from energy exploration and  reduce the national park backlog by half over 5 years. That had the  support, combined with the Land and Water Conservation Fund, of more  than 800 different outdoor recreation, conservation, and environmental  groups, as well as the President.   People will say: Well, that was easy to do with all that support.   It wasn't easy to do. If it had been easy to do, it would have  happened 20 or 30 years ago. So it took support from the Senator from  North Dakota and leadership from the Senator from Ohio and Senator  Warner from Virginia, especially.   I came to the floor also to talk about something else, but I see the  Senator from Ohio so I think I will yield the floor and then speak on  the other subject after he has a chance to speak, if he would like to.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his  courtesy, as well as his leadership. I will not be long.   (The remarks of Mr. Alexander pertaining to the introduction of S.  4284 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced  Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today, Senator Tim Scott of South  Carolina and I have introduced the School Choice Now Act, which does  two things: It protects students who have been attending private  schools from the heartbreaking loss of scholarships, and it gives  families more options for their children's education at a time that  school is more important than ever.   I have been working to find ways to help parents pursue the education  that best meets their child's needs for a long time, since 1979, when I  began to be the Governor of Tennessee.   In 1986, we Governors got together in something called Time for  Results. I was chairman of the National Governors Association. The vice  chairman was the Arkansas Governor, Bill Clinton, and we devoted the  Governors' attention for an entire year to one subject--education.   There were six points. One of those points way back then was to find  ways to give parents more choices of schools for their children.   Then, later on, in 1992, when President George H.W. Bush was in  office and I was Education Secretary, I helped the President develop  something we called the GI Bill for Kids, which was Federal funds for a  $1,000 scholarship to work with cities and States, like Milwaukee in  Wisconsin, that were trying to give low-income families more choices of  good schools for their children.   Then, my last act as Education Secretary was to notice what they call  start-from-scratch schools in Minnesota, created by the Democratic- Farmer-Labor Party. There were about a dozen of them, as I remember,  and I wrote every school district in the country and asked them to  start one of these start-from-scratch schools, which were the  forerunners of today's public charter schools. Today, we have 7,500  public charter schools.   Then, in 2004, I tried something I called the Pell Grant for Kids, a  $500 scholarship that would follow every middle- and low-income child  in America to an accredited program of their choosing.   Some people said: Wait a minute. You can't call the Pell grant a  voucher.   I said: That is precisely what the Pell grant is. The Pell grant is a  voucher that a college student can take to any accredited college-- public, private, or religious. Why can't we do that for elementary and  secondary schools?   In 2005, we had a hurricane named Katrina, creating devastation on  the gulf coast, and Senator Ted Kennedy and I and Senator Landrieu and  others worked together to provide 1.2 billion Federal dollars in one- time emergency assistance for the 2005-2006 school year so students  enrolled in public or nonpublic schools--children who were displaced by  the hurricane--could enroll in public or private schools while their  families recovered. They got scholarships of up to $6,000.   And, more recently, I suggested a Scholarship for Kids Act. I said:  Why don't we give a State like Tennessee, Ohio, or North Dakota, the  opportunity to take most of the Federal dollars and turn them into  scholarships for the lowest income students in their State? That  scholarship would amount to $2,100 if we just took the existing money  we had and spent it that way.   So that is the strategy that we followed in this country for many,  many years, ever since 1944, with the GI bill for veterans.   We all remember what that was. The veterans came home and a grateful  nation gave them a scholarship and said: Take it anywhere you want, to  any college or accredited school. Take it to Notre Dame, take it to  Yeshiva, take it to a historically Black college, take it to Ohio  State, take it to Tennessee, take it to the Presbyterian school.   And they have done that, and the GI bill may be one of the most  certainly successful pieces of legislation ever enacted.   Last year, there were over $28 billion in Federal Pell grants and  more than $91 billion in Federal loans that followed students to public  and private colleges of their choice.   Now, the Federal Government also provides vouchers to help pay for  childcare. The Child Care and Development Block Grant was negotiated by  John Sununu when he was Chief of Staff for H.W. Bush in 1990, and what  that does is basically give money to States, and States then give  vouchers, just like Pell grants for college, but they give them to  working moms, and they can go pick the childcare center that is best  for their child.   The Federal Government, in 2019, provided $8.7 billion and States  another $1.2 to provide vouchers to 1.3 million children.   So I think you can see where I am going with this. It is that the  idea of giving parents choices of schools is not a new idea. We have  done it in colleges since 1944. We do it with childcare. We do it in  community colleges. Why not do it for elementary and secondary  education? Why not give low-income families more of the same choices of  good schools that wealthy families have?   Now, during COVID-19, children in all K-12 schools have been affected  by the disease. There are 100,000 public schools across our country  serving 50 million students. That are another 35,000 private schools  serving 5 million students. Many of those schools, public and private,  are choosing not to reopen in person this fall.   Many schools are failing to provide high-quality distance learning.  The students who will suffer the most from this are the low-income  children--the children from families where both parents work away from  home every day or where the only parent works away from home every day,  children with no internet, families who can't afford to put a child in  a private school if the public school is not open.   These are the parents who have the greatest need and the children who  have the greatest need. We should address that need as we think about  how to deal with COVID-19.   Just as more families need more options, there are fewer scholarships  available to help them choose private schools because there has been  less charitable giving as a result of the pandemic.   So for low-income students attending private schools on a  scholarship, that can mean a heartbreaking end to their time at school  and a transfer to a new school that may not meet their needs at all.   That is why Senator Scott and I and others of us recommend that  Congress first provide sufficient funding for all of our schools-- 100,000 public schools and 35,000 private--so they can safely open this  fall with as many students physically present as possible.   I have suggested that the cost of this to the taxpayers could be as  much as $70 billion. The House of Representatives has appropriated $58  billion.  [[Page S4427]]    If Congress were to agree on the higher number, $70 billion, that  would be about $1,200 for every one of the 55 million public and  private school students in the country   The School Choice Now Act that Senator Scott and I are offering is  about the 5.7 million of those 55 million children who attend the  35,000 nonpublic, private, or religious schools. It provides  scholarships to students to have the opportunity to return to the  private school they attended before the pandemic and gives other  students a new opportunity to attend private school by doing two  things: One, providing one-time emergency funding for scholarship- granting organizations. These are nonprofits that do the important work  of helping students attend private schools in each State. These  scholarship-granting organizations will use this one-time funding to  provide families with direct educational assistance, including private  school tuition as well as homeschooling expenses.   No. 2, this act would provide permanent dollar-for-dollar Federal tax  credits for contributions to those scholarship-granting organizations.  What this means is that any American taxpayer who makes a charitable  donation to one of these nonprofits that provide scholarships to  students will receive a credit on their Federal taxes equal to the  amount the taxpayer donated. The same goes for private companies that  make donations to these organizations.   The School Choice Now Act is not a Federal mandate. States are free  to create their own tax credit scholarship programs that work for the  unique needs of students in their States. States that don't want to  support scholarships to private schools are not required to accept  these funds. They can be returned to the Secretary, and the funds will  be redistributed to States that want the funds.   This bill is about one of the great principles of what it means to be  an American: the principle of equal opportunity. For me, equal  opportunity means creating an environment in which the largest number  of people can begin at the starting line. When everyone is at the  starting line in America, anything is possible. Giving children more  opportunity to attend a better school is the real answer to inequality  in America                            ____________________
