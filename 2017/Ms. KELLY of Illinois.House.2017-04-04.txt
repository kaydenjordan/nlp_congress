 Mr. Speaker, it pains me to come to this  Chamber this morning to say that nothing was done as our democracy came  under attack.   We know Russia intervened in our Presidential election. This was not  done in the interest of the people, by the people, or for the people of  America. It was done to make America a vehicle for Russian interests.   You know that, in 2016, President Trump said he hoped Russia would  hack our former Secretary of State's emails. You know General Michael  Flynn was forced to resign due to his  [[Page H2639]]  unreported contact with Russian agents, who he also had business ties  to.   Yesterday, you learned that the President had a contractor meet with  Russian officials on his behalf to have a back channel to the Kremlin.   Where is the transparency from the White House? How is it that Meals  on Wheels is the enemy, but you turn a blind eye to an attack on  democracy by Vladimir Putin?   Russian spies have long attacked American businesses. Now they are  attacking our freedom. You must investigate the Russian grip on our  government. We must investigate swiftly and seriously.   Mr. Speaker, this is on your watch.    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 214.                             personal explanation
