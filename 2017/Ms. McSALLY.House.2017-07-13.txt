 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition. As the only Air  Force Academy graduate in Congress, we train these cadets to become  officers and leaders and warfighters for our military. We are not  training them to become pro athletes, just like my colleague said here.   And you want to talk about morale?   Having been there, there is nothing worse than watching somebody try  to get out of their commitment to go play pro sports, for the rest of  the cadets that are there ready to lead America into battle.   I strongly support the underlying bill. We are at a time of military  crisis and readiness crisis right now. We do not release people to go  fly for the airlines or go start their own business or go be an  entrepreneur or go to a high-tech company and then just say: Oh, just  pay it back.   There are so many people that are trying to get into these academies  so they can wear the uniform and lead America into battle.   So this is about warfighting, not about becoming a linebacker. So  let's please--I am urging my colleagues to vote down this amendment and  to support the underlying bill.
