 Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from California said, nobody  in uniform wants civilian casualties. We work very diligently to make  sure that there are not civilian casualties, but this almost assumes  that we don't, that we actually don't care about civilian casualties  when it couldn't be further from the truth.   Mr. Speaker, what this does is add more bureaucracy and takes the  focus off of what servicemembers need to do in very difficult  circumstances, when oftentimes the difference between life and death,  between the servicemember's own life and those of his or her troops who  are following him into combat, it is a moment to make a decision.   Mr. Speaker, at that moment, when lives are on the line, when  American lives are on the line, in the face of our enemies, in the face  of terrorists, what the gentleman from California would have those  servicemembers do is take that moment to figure out if the decision  they are making is optimal or not. Or in the case where I watched  servicemembers who pulled the trigger, come back, and the first thing  they had to do was go to the JAG and explain why they returned fire.   Mr. Speaker, those moments cost American lives. That is what this  amendment is going to do, and that is why I adamantly oppose it. I ask  my colleagues to oppose it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for the  opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, I think what is most important about this is it has  already been said that we are not signatories to this treaty. With all  due respect to the gentleman regarding the House didn't follow the  Senate, we should do our own thing, I agree with that. But the Senate  is the one that ratifies treaties, not the House.   But the bigger issue is that requiring rogue nations who are criminal  actors who don't honor their commitments--like North Korea, like  Russia, and like China--to not do something on a piece of paper is not  going to stop them. They don't honor anything that they sign anyhow,  and we would be fools to think that they would. All this does, Mr.  Speaker, among other things, all it does is tie America's hands behind  its back.   Yes, we do certify currently. But we don't know what the future  holds, and we don't know what technology is going to be, and we should  not tie America's national defense and national security behind her  back for the sake of people and countries that refuse to honor the  commitments that they sign. And we certainly shouldn't encumber  hardworking, tax-paying citizens and their money to some international  organization who does not have the best interests of the United  States--the sovereignty of the United States--in mind, some global  organization that somehow is going to tell us that because North Korea  signed a  [[Page H6275]]  treaty, because Russia signed a treaty, and because China signed a  treaty that they are not going to violate it.   Mr. Speaker, when they violate it, it might be too late. We don't  have time or the luxury of hoping that they will do the right thing.   We absolutely must reject this amendment, and I urge our colleagues  to vote ``no.''    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The  SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 8,  the yeas and nays are ordered.   Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question  are postponed. The Chair understands that amendment Nos. 53 and 65 will  not be offered.              Amendment No. 79 Offered by Mr. Levin of Michigan     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, there are a lot of issues with this  amendment, not the least of which is that my colleague is the  subcommittee chairman on the committee of jurisdiction for this  amendment, yet we are not taking it up in that committee because I  suppose we don't want the debate.   While we are talking about national security in the National Defense  Authorization Act, this amendment adds to the already excessive  bureaucracy at the State Department, not at the Pentagon.   It has nothing to do with national security. This is about political  ideology and using the National Defense Authorization Act for more  bureaucracy, a climate change officer at embassies, consulates,  diplomatic missions, et cetera.   It is alleged to provide expertise on climate change in the State  Department, and it stipulates that this must be done in an equitable,  inclusive, and just manner.   Do you know what is not equitable or just? Sending State Department  officials around the globe to tell other countries trying to emerge in  their world, in their economies, by adopting ineffective, destabilizing  green energy just so that John Kerry can fly around in his private jet  and rub elbows with billionaires in Davos.   It is certainly not equitable or just to tell other countries they  must transition to electrical systems built on the horrific, forced  slave labor and child labor facilitated by the Communist Party of  China. That doesn't seem equitable, doesn't seem just, doesn't seem  fair.   This amendment also contains the sense of Congress that would affirm  climate change as one of the core tenets of foreign policy priorities.   Madam Speaker, we are talking about the National Defense  Authorization Act. This is not the State and Foreign Ops  reauthorization. This doesn't belong here. This has nothing to do with  this.   Everybody here knows, or should know, that we face enormous  challenges around the globe for a national security policy. But if we  want to talk about State and Foreign Ops, we can talk about Sri Lanka.   They have an ESG score of like 99 or something like that. They just  overthrew their government because they  [[Page H6451]]  can't eat because of these policies, these policies imposed on them by  the United States of America in the accolades of this Green New Deal  garbage.   Ghana is the same thing, moving up in the world, electrifying their  country so everybody could afford electricity in a Third World country.  Now it is dark at night in their homes because there is no electricity  because of this kind of stuff.   This doesn't belong here, Madam Speaker. Actually, it doesn't belong  anywhere, but it certainly doesn't belong as an amendment to this bill.  I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no.''    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would just offer this to my colleague, my friend. I have served in  uniform, and I know what the existential threats are.                                time  0000    Madam Speaker, I know, having served long in both the enlisted ranks  and the officer ranks, the troubles that national security pose to this  Nation.   While you might find woke officers and enlisted members infiltrate  the Pentagon to destroy the military with this tripe, I am not one of  them. I am not going to fall for it. Neither should anybody here.   We need to focus. Our military, our national defense, needs to focus  on real enemies, enemies like China, Iran, terrorism, and potentially  Russia, but not in a proxy war in Ukraine. These are real enemies.   Climate change can be handled by other agencies and should be handled  by other agencies. DOD and men and women in uniform need to focus on  defending our country from our enemies, not this, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment, as has been stated,  establishes an office of climate resilience in the White House and a  climate resilience equity advisory board, including outside  stakeholders, to develop a national climate resilience action plan.   What does ``outside stakeholders'' mean? I mean, to me, what I hear  is people who do what a lot of people do in Washington. They grift.  They are making money. They are making policy that makes their friends  money. That is what that means. The stakeholders should be the American  people, outside stakeholders developing a national climate resilience  action plan.   Now, quite honestly, this is, again, the National Defense  Authorization Act. How this amendment made it to the floor under this  bill is, quite honestly, beyond comprehension. It is just another level  of Federal bureaucracy in the name of climate that does nothing to  improve the readiness of our military or support the warfighter.   That is what we should be discussing this evening. That is what the  underlying bill is about, the National Defense Authorization Act. This  has nothing to do, again, with supporting the warfighter, nothing to do  with increasing readiness.   I remember filling out officer evaluation reports with all kinds of  requirements. I had a paragraph I had to fill out on every officer, all  kinds of requirements that I had to put a statement in about this or  that. It left me about one sentence to talk about their warfighting  capability, each officer, about one sentence left in all the space of  the requirements that I had to complete that had absolutely nothing to  do with the servicemember's ability to do their job in combat. So, here  we are going to add some more because we don't have enough of that.   The folks responsible for developing a nationwide resiliency plan  would be those with emergency management experience if they were going  to do it, but that is not required. Again, we have outside  stakeholders.   I mean, it doesn't even belong in this bill, but even if it did, it  doesn't get anything right here because we are not going to protect  anybody. This is just another bureaucracy for activists on the left to  impose these things on United States citizens.   I mean, we have real problems. It would be great if we had a task  force in the White House, since apparently the President can't handle  it, to deal with the record inflation that we have.   It would be great if we had somebody in the White House, maybe a task  force, to deal with fuel prices. I mean, we have our national leaders  traveling all around the globe, thousands of miles away, to try to get  other countries to pump more oil, refine more oil. We won't do it in  the United States of America.   It would be great to have that task force. Maybe that would help  national security so we wouldn't have to go fight these foreign wars.  But I guess we are going to do this social justice climate  fearmongering.                                time  0010    It just creates another activist entity within the Federal Government  and fails to protect folks from disasters or actually protect the  taxpayers. It will actually undermine resiliency efforts by focusing on  socialist ideas that are failing. They are failing in this country  right now.   What we are seeing happening in our economy is the result of these  types of things. We don't let the market work. We don't want the  market. We are going to impose our will on the American people and say,  ``You are not going to drive that kind of car, you are not going to use  that kind of fuel, you are not going to buy that kind of electricity.  We know better than you do. We are Washington, D.C.''   Most of us have no experience in these industries that we are forcing  on the American people. It undermines America's prosperity and promotes  technologies that enrich our enemies, like China, rather than  supporting the military, which is what this bill is supposed to be  about.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment reauthorizes the Delaware  River Basin Conservation Program for 10 years and increases the Federal  cost-share for the projects.   Now, it is the same kind of theme here at the end of the evening. I  guess it is late. Looks like it is about quarter after 2. Nobody is  supposed to notice that we are talking about the National Defense  Authorization Act, but this is about the Delaware River Basin  Conservation Program.   I am sure it is important to my good friend and colleague. We served  together in the statehouse. But he knows and I know the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee shares jurisdiction over this legislation  with our colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee, not on the  House Armed Services Committee. This doesn't belong here.   As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I can  tell you that this bill has not been considered. This amendment hasn't  been considered in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.  Neither side has taken a look at it, so we don't know the pros and  cons.   But we know this: This has nothing to do with protecting the  residents of Pennsylvania or the Delaware Bay or the Delaware River  from invasion from the Chinese or from the Russians or some kind of  amphibious force.   My good friend even talked about the trails, the environment, and the  conservation around the area, which is all a great discussion. But we  are here to talk about the National Defense Authorization Act. This is  not to pass nondefense-related amendments, and it is completely  inappropriate, completely unrelated to national defense. It actually  undermines our national security by providing resources to the Delaware  River Basin Commission that should go to the Pentagon.   As long as we are talking about it, let's be clear here. Unelected  bureaucrats at the DRBC have usurped the authority of the Pennsylvania  legislature, which my colleague on the other side of the aisle and I  served in, and have deprived Pennsylvanians of their property rights by  instituting a ban on hydraulic fracturing.   Maybe there is a national security nexus because preventing the  responsible development of Pennsylvania's wealth of natural gas has  enriched the Putin regime. It has funded its aggression in Ukraine and  continued European dependence on Russian gas. That is what it has done.   This bill absolutely has no place in the National Defense  Authorization Act. While most of America might be sleeping at 2:15 in  the morning, I am not. I am here in opposition to this because it  doesn't belong here. It belongs in another committee, in another  discussion where we can get into the details of what this would do,  what this reauthorization would do.   We are not going to be duped by adding this to the National Defense  Authorization Act and continuing the egregious overreach of the  unelected activists at the DRBC.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I sure appreciate my good friend and colleague. It is  always about people, to my good colleague.   But on this particular evening, and on this bill, it is about  national defense. It is about national security. It is not about this.  This does not belong here.   We could have a conversation, and we should have a conversation about  this, but not here, not now, not tonight, and not on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.                                time  0220     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
