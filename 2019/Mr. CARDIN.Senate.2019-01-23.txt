 Madam President, it is day 33 of this dangerous and  unnecessary government shutdown.   Let me share with my colleagues that this morning, I stopped by an  IBEW office that was set up by the Maryland Food Bank. We are very  proud to have the Maryland Food Bank in Maryland. It provides the  necessary food for hungry Marylanders who go through tough times and  can't get enough food for their families. I don't think we ever thought  it would have to set up a special location for Federal workers and for  those who are impacted because of a Federal shutdown, but it is exactly  what it did today. I am very proud of those at the Maryland Food Bank.  I thank them for their services to the people of our State. They have  now been able to provide basic food to patriotic Federal workers who  are not getting their paychecks.   This will be the second pay period this week for which Federal  workers' pay stubs will read ``zero'' for the work they will have done.  Of the over 800,000 Federal workers, 30 percent are veterans. They are  patriotic Americans who show up every day to do work--to keep us safe,  to deal with our national security, to deal with our food safety. The  list goes on and on and on. They are showing up today and working on  the 33rd day. They are being asked to carry out their work with their  having no prospects of getting paid in the near future. These are  patriotic Americans.   The number is more than 800,000. We also have contract workers who  get contracts from the government. Many of these contractors employ  low-wage workers to do basic work for the government. These workers are  not getting paid.   We have small businesses that depend upon contracts that are not  being fulfilled right now because of the government shutdown. They are  laying off workers.   Then we have the general impact on our economy. It is projected that  we are going to lose all of our economic growth, which will slow down  and create more unemployment in America.   All of that is happening because of this shutdown. It is in our  national security interest to end this dangerous shutdown. The FBI is  on shutdown, meaning many of its workers are not even being brought in,  and those who are being brought in are having a difficult time doing  their jobs. On Thursday, the FBI Agents Association released a petition  that describes the shutdown as a matter of national security. It urges  leaders in Washington to reopen the government.   ``On Friday, January 11, 2019, FBI Agents will not be paid due to the  partial government shutdown, but we will continue our work protecting  our nation,'' the petition reads. ``We urge our elected representatives  to fund the Department of Justice . . . and the FBI because financial  security is a matter of national security.''   My colleagues, these are people who go to work every day to keep us  safe, and we are asking them to do that without their having a full  complement of supporting workers and to do it without being paid.   Recently, I met with our airport security people--the TSA and  others--who are charged with keeping our airports safe. They are  responsible for air traffic safety. They asked me how they can do their  work when they are distracted. How are they going to pay their bills?  They also don't have the full complement of support staff necessary.  That is what it is at risk.   We know security is being compromised in our Federal Prison System.  On Friday, prison guard Brian Shoemaker was patrolling the halls of Lee  penitentiary in Southwestern Virginia when an inmate tried to squeeze  past him into a restricted area. Seconds after Shoemaker told the  prisoner to turn around, the inmate lunged at him and punched him in  his shoulder. Mr. Shoemaker did not sustain a major injury, but it did  not escape him that he was working without a paycheck at one of the  most dangerous Federal jobs in America during this partial government  shutdown. Fears for his and other prison staff members' safety are  escalating as 16-hour shifts become routine and as a growing number of  guards call in sick in protest and work side jobs to pay their bills.   ``I don't think we should be subjected to that kind of thing and not  receive a paycheck,'' said Shoemaker, age 48, a 17-year veteran of Lee  penitentiary. ``I'm walking in here and doing my job every day, and  it's very dangerous.''   Mr. Shoemaker is one of 36,000 Federal prison workers who is deemed  to be an essential employee by the U.S. Government, which means he is  expected to report for work during the shutdown even though he will not  get paid until the government reopens. He has worked 33 days without  pay.   Even though these employees are supposed to work, union officials at  10 prisons, including Lee, who were reached by the Washington Post, say  the number of employees who are not showing up for work has at least  doubled since the shutdown began. This cannot continue.   As a result, those who are showing up are routinely working double  shifts, correctional officers and other prison staff members say.  Secretaries, janitors, and teachers are filling in for absent officers.  There is at least one prison--Hazelton Federal Correctional Complex in  West Virginia--at which the number of assaults on officers has  increased since the shutdown, according to a union official there.   ``There has been a rise in people calling in sick and taking leave  during the shutdown,'' said Richard Heldreth, the local union president  at the Hazelton prison. ``The staff who are showing up are dealing with  this violence, long hours and extra overtime with the uncertainty of  when we will be compensated.''   The list goes on.   I had a chance to meet with some of our Coast Guard workers this  morning. The Coast Guard is in a partial shutdown. Here is one of the  critical national security Agencies of this Nation that is not working  at its full strength. We have heard the President talk about border  security. He has compromised border security by not allowing Homeland  Security to be fully operational--to have all of its capacity--and its  workers to be paid to do their work.   Research is being very badly hurt as a result of this shutdown. A  coalition of more than 40 patient and healthcare provider groups is  warning about the effects of the government shutdown on the FDA. This  marks the first time advocacy organizations have weighed in on the more  than month-long lapse in appropriations.   ``We fear that this continued shutdown not only puts the current  health and safety of Americans' safety at risk, but has begun to put  future scientific discovery and innovation in jeopardy,'' the group  wrote in a letter to President Donald Trump and senior congressional  leadership. The effort, spearheaded by Friends of Cancer Research, has  drawn in the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Society of  Clinical Oncology, Research!America, and the National Organization for  Rare Disorders.   The shutdown is keeping the FDA from reviewing new drug and medical  device applications and from conducting certain inspections of food and  medical product facilities. It has also slowed the hiring and  onboarding of new staff at an Agency that is already grappling with  hundreds of vacancies. Some FDA research and policy development has  also come to a halt.   The FDA regulates products and industries that comprise about one- quarter of the U.S. economy. The FDA ensures a safe food supply;  protects patients from contaminated and unsafe medical products; and  approves new lifesaving treatments, the group wrote.   The list goes on.   Diplomatic missions around the world are being compromised. I had a  chance to talk to one of our Ambassadors in a key country of great  interest to the United States. He confided in  [[Page S495]]  me that without a full complement of staff, his mission is being  compromised, and our national security is being put at risk.   Let's take a look at the faces of the people who are impacted by this  shutdown. I already mentioned the fact that just a few hours ago, I was  at the Maryland Food Bank location at which I saw very proud, patriotic  government workers stand in line to get bags so they could pick up food  because they didn't have the money to pay for food for their families.  That is what is at stake.    I have received letters from Federal workers who are concerned about  whether they will be able to continue their dental and vision health  protection because those payments are not automatically made when we  are in shutdown. The workers are supposed to make those payments  directly. How many workers are going to be able to or will even know  that they need to make the payments? They may see the loss of critical  coverage.   I know it is affecting people's credit scores. We know credit  agencies are not very tolerant with late payments. Yet government  workers are going to have to slow down in paying their bills because  they will not have money. Most workers live paycheck to paycheck in  paying their bills. Now their credit scores are going to be affected,  and that is going to affect the cost of credit. It may affect such  things as their security clearances, which will affect their  employment.   I have heard from several Federal workers. I heard from one who said:  I have this dilemma. I live 90 miles away from where I work as a  Federal worker. I am expected to be there every day. I don't have the  money to pay for gasoline for my car. Yet I am expected to pay for that  without getting a paycheck. By the way, I don't have the money to pay  for the childcare for my children. How am I expected to show up for  work and do essential work when I don't have the money to take care of  my needs so I can get transportation to my job and take care of my  family's needs with safe childcare?   This is the face of the people who have been impacted by this partial  government shutdown. Her circumstances are really shocking.   One might be surprised to learn that many Federal workers are  expected to use their own personal credit cards to pay for government  expenses. If they travel on behalf of the government, they use their  own credit cards to pay for those expenses. I am told it averages  somewhere around $600 a month. At the end of the month, they have to,  of course, pay their credit card bills, but they have their  reimbursements from the Federal Government for these legitimate  expenses. In a government shutdown, there is no Agency that can  reimburse them for that money. The credit card companies are going to  demand that they pay. These are government expenses, not theirs. What  do they do? This is where we are today with the tragedies.   There was an ad in the paper that really got to me. It was written by  a government worker who said she was looking for a job.   She writes:         I'm currently furloughed due to the government shutdown and       am available for baby-sitting during the workday. I have       plenty of childcare experience from raising my two children,       ages 3 and 5, so I know how hard it can be to find last-      minute weekday childcare. Alternatively, I'm also happy to       provide science tutoring for any high school or college       students. I have a Ph.D. in cellular and molecular medicine       and can help with biology, genetics, microbiology,       biochemistry, cell bio, or research methods. Please message       me if interested, and I would be happy to provide you with       additional information. Thanks.    Here is a Federal worker whom we want to keep in Federal service. She  needs money to pay her bills and is willing to be a babysitter but has  scientific training. We know she could be gobbled up in the private  sector for a lot more money than she is making as a government  employee, and we are going to lose her. We are going to lose a lot of  talented workers who ask: How much longer can I put up with this? How  much longer can I work without pay? The critical missions that she is  performing on behalf of America will be compromised and lost. This is  what is at risk. This is what we are risking.   I haven't even gone into all of the different Agencies or the work  that is important to Americans. HUD's being closed means FHA loans are  not being processed and that you can't go forward with your closing on  a home. I know several senior housing projects are being put on hold,  which jeopardizes quality, affordable housing for our seniors. The IRS  season is beginning, but it doesn't have its full complement. People  want their refunds, but they are going to be delayed. The list goes on  and on and on.   This is President Trump's shutdown. Many of us, on both sides of the  aisle--Democrats and Republicans--understand border security issues. In  the fiscal year 2019 appropriations, our appropriators did their work.  The distinguished ranking member, Senator Leahy, is on the floor. He  worked very closely with Senator Shelby on every single appropriations  bill in a bipartisan manner. We did our work in the U.S. Senate.   Seven of the appropriations bills have not yet been completed through  no fault of the work of our appropriators. Four of them passed the  Senate by a vote of 92 to 6. Why don't we just pick them up and pass  them? We have tried. I have asked unanimous consent. Because we don't  want to offend the President, the Republican leaders have refused to  allow us to consider them. Two others passed the Appropriations  Committee by votes of 31 to 0 and 30 to 1.    With regard to Homeland Security, on border security the committee  did its work on the fiscal year 2019 budget. They came up with a game  plan on border security. We did our work on time, in a bipartisan  manner. We know how to deal with border security issues. We have the  expertise to work to make sure that we spend our money in the most  appropriate way to defend our border and to protect Americans.   So what should we do? First, we should open the government. There is  no excuse for the government to be closed. We are a coequal branch of  government. We need to act as a coequal branch of government. It is our  responsibility. We will have that chance tomorrow.   There will be a vote on the floor of the Senate to pass a short-term  continuing resolution. This is identical to what we acted on by  unanimous consent before the President changed his mind.   Let's remove the hostage-taking of the American public. Let's have a  short period of time to prove that we can use the legislative process  here, as we have in the past, to work on border security issues and  pass a bipartisan border security bill, but not under the tactics the  President of the United States is currently using. We can act that way  on behalf of the American people.   This is a dangerous shutdown. We have seen the results, and we know  people's lives have been compromised and our national security has been  affected. We need to take the leadership.   I hope my colleagues will join me tomorrow in voting for the  continuing resolution so we can open the government and use our  legislative process to deal with the border security issues and to deal  with what is important to the American people.   With that, I yield the floor.
