 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 491 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 491         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 3494) to authorize appropriations for fiscal       year 2020 for intelligence and intelligence-related       activities of the United States Government, the Community       Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency       Retirement and Disability System, and for other purposes. The       first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and amendments       specified in this section and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. In lieu       of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by       the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence now printed in       the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 116-22,       modified by the amendment printed in part A of the report of       the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be       considered as adopted in the House and in the Committee of       the Whole. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as the       original bill for the purpose of further amendment under the       five-minute rule and shall be considered as read. All points       of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are       waived. No further amendment to the bill, as amended, shall       be in order except those printed in part B of the report of       the Committee on Rules. Each such further amendment may be       offered only in the order printed in the report, may be       offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be       considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified       in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall       not be subject to a demand for division of the question in       the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of       order against such further amendments are waived. At the       conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill, as amended, to the       House with such further amendments as may have been adopted.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill, as amended, and on any further amendment thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.

Sec. 3.  (a) A joint resolution described in section 4       shall be privileged if called up by the chair of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs or a designee on the day after       the calendar day on which the Majority Leader or a designee       announces an intention that the House consider the joint       resolution. The joint resolution shall be considered as read.       All points of order against the joint resolution and against       its consideration are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the joint resolution to its passage       without intervening motion except: (1) 20 minutes of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs or their       respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit (or       commit, as the case may be). A motion to reconsider the vote       on passage of the joint resolution shall not be in order.         (b) On demand of the chair of the Committee on Foreign       Affairs or a designee, debate pursuant to subsection (a)(1)       shall be one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign       Affairs or their respective designees.        Sec. 4.  A joint resolution referred to in section 3 is a       Senate joint resolution, or a House joint resolution reported       by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, prohibiting any of the       following under section 36 of the Arms Export Control Act (22       U.S.C. 2776):        (1) a proposed sale pursuant to subsection (b);        (2) a proposed export pursuant to subsection (c); or        (3) an approval pursuant to subsection (d).        Sec. 5.  Sections 36(b)(3), 36(c)(3)(B), and 36(d)(5)(B) of       the Arms Export Control Act shall not apply in the House       during the remainder of the One Hundred Sixteenth Congress.        Sec. 6.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order without intervention of any point of order to consider       in the House the resolution (H. Res. 489) condemning       President Trump's racist comments directed at Members of       Congress. The resolution shall be considered as read. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 491, providing for consideration of  H.R. 3494, authorizing intelligence community programs for fiscal years  2019 and 2020 and retroactively authorizing fiscal year 2018  appropriations under a structured rule.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking minority member of the Permanent Select  Committee on  [[Page H5836]]  Intelligence. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment from  Chairman Schiff that makes technical and conforming changes and adds  additional language that authorizes the CIA to expand death benefits to  cover officers killed abroad. The rule makes in order 31 amendments and  provides one motion to recommit.   Additionally, the rule provides for consideration of House Report  116-125 and its accompanying resolution recommending that the House  find Attorney General Barr and Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of  Congress for refusing to comply with congressional subpoenas under a  closed rule.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and  Reform.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 489 under a closed  rule.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the  Judiciary.   Finally, included in this rule is a process for consideration of  committee-reported or Senate-passed joint resolutions disapproving of  certain transactions under section 36 of the Arms Export Control Act.  This process allows for the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee to  call up such a joint resolution 1 day after it is noticed by the  majority leader and provides 20 minutes or an hour of debate and a  motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, the Intelligence Authorization Act, H.R. 3494,  authorizes programs at 16 intelligence community agencies and offices,  including the Director of National Intelligence, the CIA, the  Department of Defense, the DIA, the National Security Agency, and the  FBI.   This authorization prioritizes the intelligence community's  collection and analytic capabilities against hard-target countries such  as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.   This bill will help us better understand and counter Russian  interference in our elections. It requires reports to Congress on the  intentions and the designs of Russian political leadership with respect  to potential military action against NATO members and on the most  significant Russian influence campaigns taking place around the world.   This bill also creates a Climate Security Advisory Council to ensure  that the intelligence community prioritizes the threat of climate  change. Specifically, the bill requires analysts to incorporate climate  change into intelligence analysis and encourages collaboration with  executive branch departments focused on climate policy.   Finally, this legislation takes care of our intelligence community  workers by providing 12 weeks of paid parental leave for all employees,  in addition to the 12 weeks of unpaid leave Federal employees are  allowed to take under the Family and Medical Leave Act.   Mr. Speaker, on contempt, the Constitution of the United States  requires us to conduct a Census every 10 years, an actual enumeration  of the American people, everyone who is present in the country.   Secretary Wilbur Ross engaged in a process in order to add a  citizenship question to the Census for the first time in 70 years.   This was struck down by multiple Federal courts because of the  blatant violation of essentially every principle of the Administrative  Procedure Act. They did not conduct notice and comment; they did not  assemble substantial evidence; and they did not provide a reasoned  justification for why they wanted to do this completely outside of the  process that had been set up under the Census Act that had been running  for several years.   On June 27, the Supreme Court found that the Commerce Department's  argument for including the citizenship question in the 2020 Census was  ``contrived,'' according to Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote:  ``Several points, taken together, reveal a significant mismatch between  the Secretary's decision and the rationale he provided.''   Democrats on the Oversight and Reform Committee have been raising  questions about Secretary Ross' proffered justification for several  years now. We started asking questions back in 2017. Secretary Ross had  testified that the Department of Justice letter that he received was  the basis for changing the policy and imposing a citizenship question  on the Census. He said that this change was solely motivated by the  Department of Justice's request.   In fact, overwhelming evidence has surfaced completely contradicting  this account. We know from multiple different sources now that this was  a political effort designed to promote the electoral plans of the GOP.   The gerrymandering mastermind of the Republican Party, Thomas  Hofeller, was the one who first raised this question several years ago.  It was talked about during the Trump campaign. It was talked about  within days of the inauguration. We have substantial evidence  suggesting that Wilbur Ross, as Secretary of Commerce, was shopping  around for a justification for doing this when the motivations were  nakedly political.    The Oversight and Reform Committee began its investigation into the  administration's decision to add the citizenship question on March 27,  2018. Yet, the majority of the committee has been stonewalled at every  turn by the Departments of Justice and Commerce, which have refused to  turn over key documents requested by the Oversight and Reform  Committee, even after the committee, its members and staff, have worked  diligently to resolve the impasse by narrowing the scope of the request  to a very small subset of documents.   We know exactly the documents we need. Yet, still, we get nothing but  defiance, obstruction, and stonewalling from this administration.   Democrats requested documents from the Department of Commerce on  April 4, 2018. None of the requested documents were submitted.   On January 8, 2019, Chairman Cummings renewed the request, and the  Commerce Department responded by providing thousands of pages of  documents, most of which were already publicly available or completely  irrelevant, nonresponsive, or heavily redacted.   On February 12, 2019, Chairman Cummings renewed the request for  documents again, this time identifying a specific memo and note from  the Department of Commerce to the DOJ. The DOJ did not provide the  requested documents but, rather, produced several other documents that  were heavily redacted and off point, and so on and so forth.   Mr. Speaker, this is intolerable. The Congress of the United States  has a constitutional duty to conduct a fair Census.   Six former Census Bureau Directors wrote a letter denouncing the  imposition of this citizenship question and telling Wilbur Ross that  this would lead to a far less accurate account. The chief scientist of  the Census Bureau testified that this was going to overlook and  undercount as many as 6 million Hispanic Americans. We know that  potentially millions of other Americans too would not be counted.   The purpose of adding the citizenship question was not to get a more  accurate count. It was to get a far more inaccurate account. All the  Census experts agree with that.   We have an act, the Census Act, which was violated and ignored. We  have the Administrative Procedure Act, which was violated and ignored.  Now we have issued a series of subpoena requests to the Departments of  Commerce and Justice in order to get the information about what really  took place, and again, we are being defied, ignored, and essentially  belittled by the executive branch of government.   Mr. Speaker, I want to close my remarks on this with this point. The  Constitution begins with the beautiful phrase: ``We, the people . . .  in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure  domestic tranquility,'' and so on, do create this Constitution in this  country.   The very next sentence says that all the legislative powers are  vested in us. In other words, the powers of the people flow right  through the preamble of the Constitution into Article I.   The Supreme Court has repeatedly said, along with other Federal  courts, that integral and essential to the lawmaking function is the  factfinding function of Congress.   James Madison said, ``Those who mean to be their own governors must  arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.''  [[Page H5837]]    The people armed us with that power by creating the legislative  function in Congress. But we can't legislate and we can't govern if we  can't get the information that we need, which is why the Supreme Court  has repeatedly emphasized our power is broad and it is expansive.   Our friends across the aisle, they know that. They know that from  their Benghazi hearings that went on for years and cost tens of  millions of dollars. They know that from the inquiry into Hillary  Clinton's emails, and so on.   Congress has the power to get the information that it wants.   Mr. Speaker, the Census is serious business. It goes right to the  heart of who we are as ``we, the people.''   Every 10 years, the Founders told us we have to go back and count  everybody up in order to conduct the reapportionment process and decide  how many Members of Congress are granted to each State, and, then,  hundreds of billions of dollars follow in the wake of the Census. So,  we have to make sure that every person is counted.   What we had was this rearguard, sneak ambush attack on the Census.  They got caught doing it. The courts blew the whistle. The Supreme  Court blew the whistle. But we want to know precisely what happened to  make sure it doesn't happen again, to make sure that there has been no  damage, and to make sure we can go forward with a real Census.   If you act with contempt of the Congress, if you act with contempt  for the Congress, if you act with contempt for the American people, we  will find you in contempt of Congress and the American people. We are  given no choice.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, on the resolution condemning the President's  recent remarks, the President of the United States told four Americans  who are Members of Congress to ``go back'' to the countries they came  from. Three of them, Representatives Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib,  and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are native-born Americans, and one of  them, Representative Ilhan Omar, was born abroad.   Mr. Speaker, this is an affront, not just of four American citizens  who are Members of Congress. It is an affront to 22 million naturalized  American citizens who were born in another country and made the journey  to America and made the journey to becoming full-blown, equal, and free  American citizens, 22 million American citizens.                                time  1245    Indeed, if you think about it, it is an affront to the hundreds of  millions of Americans who understand and love how American democracy  and citizenship work. We are not a nation defined by race and blood as  the neo-Nazis and Klansman chanted in Charlottesville as they marched  down the street terrorizing the people of Charlottesville. We are  defined by our Constitution, which belongs to all of us, and we are  defined by the patriotism and by the service of our people.   Is there something wrong with being a naturalized citizen under our  Constitution, Mr. Speaker? No, there is not. This is something to be  honored and celebrated.   All Americans are equal in the eyes of the law. This is the meaning  of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. We have no kings  here. We have no queens here. We have no titles of nobility. We have no  monarchy. We have no taints of blood. We have no hereditary offenses.  We have no racial caste system. We have no slaves, and we have no slave  masters.   It is true that there are those in our history who have wanted  America to be defined as a White man's compact, and that is, indeed,  precisely what the Supreme Court found it was in the infamous Dred  Scott decision in 1857.   President Lincoln, a great and glorious Republican President,  rejected the Dred Scott decision from the beginning as the product of a  racist ideology and a racist political conspiracy, and it took a Civil  War, the blood and the sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of Americans,  to defend the Union and to guarantee the passage of the 13th, 14th, and  15th Amendments to overthrow and destroy the Dred Scott decision and  the poisonous idea that America is a White man's compact. It is not.   All persons born in the United States are citizens of the United  States, we said, in the 14th Amendment, which guaranteed equal  protection of the law to all persons who are here. All of us are equal,  whether you are a naturalized citizen who was born in Ireland, as our  colleague Congressman Sean Casten was; or in Ecuador, as our colleague  Debbie Mucarsel-Powell was; or in Mexico, as our colleague Chuy Garcia  was; or in France, as our good friend and colleague Mark Meadows was;  or Thailand, as our colleague Tammy Duckworth was; or in Guatemala, as  our colleague Norma Torres was; or in Taiwan, as our colleague Ted Lieu  was; or in Canada, as our colleague Ted Cruz was; or in Poland, as our  colleague and author of this resolution,   Tom Malinowski, was.   If these Americans and many more like them--we have 29 foreign-born  Members of Congress. If these Americans and many more like them don't  belong in Congress, tell it to the millions of people who elected them,  and tell it to the Founders of our country who specifically said that  you can run for the House of Representatives if you are a naturalized  citizen if you have been naturalized for 7 years, or you can run for  the Senate of the United States if you are a naturalized citizen if you  have been naturalized for 9 years.   Mr. Speaker, to tell naturalized American citizens to go back to the  countries they came from is nativist and antithetical to everything  that America stands for. It is the opposite of what we believe about  the values of the country.   To tell native-born American citizens who are people of color to go  back to the country they came from is antithetical to everything we  stand for, and it will be up to the House of Representatives today to  determine whether or not that is a racist statement.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall) for his  very thoughtful and moving remarks, which are very appealing to me,  especially since I am a law professor first and only a politician  thereafter.   And, you know, we all have to deal with the political party system as  it exists in the America of today, but I like to think of the  Presidents who kept a kind of dual mind about it. They knew that they  had to be part of it in order to operate, as all of us do, but also to  try to think about the broader whole.   You know, Jefferson in his first inaugural address in 1800 said that  we are all Republicans, we are all Federalists. And he also said:         If I could only go to heaven with a political party, I       would prefer not to go.    George Washington said to us:         We have to keep in mind that the word party comes from the       French word partie, a part, and when we govern, we should try       to keep in mind the whole.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for at least the one cheer of a  potential three hip hip hoorays you might have given us on the  Intelligence Authorization Act.   We do think that the contempt citation is necessary precisely for the  reason you suggest: to uphold the institutional integrity of Congress.   We have gotten together in the past across party lines to demand that  the executive branch gives us the information we need, and we believe  that we are completely on that course.   Finally, as to the resolution about the remarks telling U.S. citizens  to go back to the country they came from; it is hard for me not to see  something that could be more unifying than that; that it is an  essential value that I know every Member of this body holds, that we  do not make a distinction in the legal or political rights or  entitlements or responsibilities of natural-born citizens and  naturalized citizens, and that it is utterly offensive to our system of  government to tell people to go back to where they came from just  because you have a political disagreement with them. It is wrong.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), the chair of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, before I go into my time, may I make a  parliamentary inquiry?    Mr. Speaker, do we take it to be against the rules of the  House to describe statements made by the President as racist as a  violation of House rules?    Mr. Speaker, launching into my time, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend  her remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, on the question of holding the Attorney General and  Secretary of Commerce in contempt for refusing to turn over repeatedly  requested documents and witnesses, our good friends now confuse two  legal questions with a policy question.   The legal question is: Did they violate the law in imposing the  citizenship question on the Census? Yes, they did violate the law. They  violated the Census Act. They violated the Administrative Procedure  Act. They violated pretty much every administrative principle we have  in this country. Chief Justice John Roberts said it, someone who is  beloved to my colleagues over there.                                time  1330    But the other legal question is: Can the executive branch decide  willy-nilly that they are going to stop cooperating with congressional  subpoenas and requests for documents? No, they can't, and I hope that  that would be a unifying dictum for everybody in this body that we  stand up for the right of the people's Representatives to obtain the  information that we need.  [[Page H5843]]    Now, my dear friend from Georgia made the point that he wished that  we could proceed in a more bipartisan fashion. I have actually been  very cheered by the number of our GOP colleagues who have denounced the  President's remarks over the weekend and this week.   For example, we get a statement from--I am not making it up. I know  that they are out there. Here we go. Mr. Fred Upton: ``Frankly, I'm  appalled by the President's tweets. There's no excuse. The President's  tweets were flat-out wrong and uncalled for.''   Pete Olson: ``The tweet President Trump posted over the weekend about  fellow Members of Congress are not reflective of the values'' of my  district. ``I urge our President immediately disavow his comments.''   Senator Murkowski: ``There's no excuse for the President's spiteful  comments--they were absolutely unacceptable and this needs to stop.''   John Kasich: ``What @realDonaldTrump said about Democrat women in  Congress is deplorable and beneath the dignity of the office. We all,  including Republicans, need to speak out against these kind of comments  that do nothing more than divide us and create deep animosity. . . .''   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am sorry. Does the gentleman mind  repeating?    Mr. Speaker, I am sure the gentleman was not,  unfortunately, just because of the press of time.    The vast majority of Members on both sides were not  consulted in the manner----    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the  previous question.   I will just take a second to say to my friend that there have been  hundreds of conversations that have been taking place here, but, of  course, the gentleman knows that the committee system works in such a  way that legislation is put in and not everybody is consulted. The  legislation he has praised so effusively today in the Intelligence  Committee, none of us outside of the Intelligence Committee were  consulted about it.   So I think we have got a consensus here rejecting and repudiating the  tenor and the meaning of the President's remarks, and I hope that this  process of dialogue which has been so wonderful today with the  gentleman from Georgia leads to an outcome where all of us will vote  for the previous question   The text of the material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 491         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 7. That immediately upon adoption of this resolution,       the House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House       on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3765) to amend title 13, United States Code, to require that       any questionnaire used for a decennial census of population       contains a question regarding citizenship, and for other       purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Oversight and Reform. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       When the committee rises and reports the bill back to the       House with a recommendation that the bill do pass, the       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 8. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3765.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
