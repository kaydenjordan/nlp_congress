 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the National Defense  Authorization Act. I commend the outstanding leadership of Chairman  Smith and Ranking Member   Mike Rogers for delivering strong,  bipartisan legislation that provides for our common defense.   While I am personally grateful that this bill includes dozens of my  provisions, I am most proud of the fact that the bill sends a clear  bipartisan message that we must keep our national defense spending  level with inflation and reject the temptation to cut defense when our  allies and enemies are questioning American leadership. As the White  House's own strategic guidance states, America must confront global  challenges from a position of strength, not weakness.   I am also proud that this bill includes multiple provisions ensuring  oversight and accountability for the recent debacle in Afghanistan. As  we stand here today, this crisis is ongoing, with hundreds of U.S.  citizens and residents, including my constituents from Nebraska, who  are still trapped in Afghanistan. Oversight of the way the botched  withdrawal was handled is not and should not be a partisan issue, and I  am proud that the House has not backed away from its responsibilities.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this bill.
