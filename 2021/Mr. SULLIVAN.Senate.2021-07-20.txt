 Reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I first  want to begin by complimenting my friend and colleague Senator  Gillibrand of New York, who has been working diligently--and we all  know it--for 10 years, a decade, on this issue, particularly the issue  of sexual assault and the related crimes in our military. There is  nobody who has been more focused on it, and I applaud her for her  relentless efforts--relentless. And I have a lot of respect for her.   She has been coming to the floor every night here for the last 3 or 4  weeks and trying to move her bill. I am going to talk about her bill a  little bit more and why I and others, in a bipartisan way--the chairman  of the Armed Services, the ranking member of the Armed Services, and  others--have been coming to the floor to object.   But I also want to say that I care deeply--deeply--about this issue  for two very important reasons. No. 1, the issue of sexual assault,  domestic violence, is an enormous problem in America but is a huge  problem in my State, the great State of Alaska. And since my time as  attorney general and now my time as a U.S. Senator, I have been very  focused on these issues. And I think, again, Senator Gillibrand has  done an outstanding job, not just on the military ones but on a whole  broad-based number of these kinds of bills that focus on the issues of  domestic violence and sexual assault. And I have been proud to work  with her on a number of them--my bills, her bills--some of which have  become law   So as Alaska's Senator, I have been 100-percent focused on this issue  for American society, certainly for Alaska, which is a big, big problem  that continues to impact millions of Americans and tens of thousands of  my constituents. So we need to do something about it. I agree, not just  for the military but for the country. And I am committed to continuing  the work; for example, my ``Choose Respect'' series of bills that we  have here in the U.S. Senate that I am working on with Senator  Gillibrand.   The other reason I care about this issue--and there is no monopoly,  by the way, on people who care about the troops--is that I have a 28- year career in the U.S. Marine Corps and still serving. I have been a  commander, and I care deeply about every single member in the military,  the challenges of sexual assault that we have, which are very real,  which, again, Senator Gillibrand has done such a good job to highlight  and to have good order and discipline in our military, which is part of  the UCMJ, which is one of the reasons why this issue has taken so long  and has been a challenge.   Now, the issue that Senator Gillibrand is talking about right now, we  will be debating in the full committee in the Armed Services starting  tomorrow. Actually, we are starting today, as she mentioned, in the  Personnel Subcommittee today. This, again, a lot of the credit--most of  the credit--I give to Senator Gillibrand on this issue.   We will have a fulsome debate, probably all day, on this issue  tomorrow. And if her bill, which is often understood as removing these  issues of sexual assault and violent crimes relating to sexual crimes,  was the bill that will be passed tomorrow, I will be supportive,  removing that out of the chain of command. That is what many, many  Senators--and I have had discussions with them--believe that the  primary focus of her legislation is and has been. She has convinced now  the Secretary of Defense and the President of the United States and the  members of the Joint Chiefs. And if that is what the bill was, she  would have very, very broad-based support. And I applaud her for that.  That victory would be hers more than anyone's. In terms of legislation,  of course, I think it will help our troops. Will it ultimately solve  this problem, which is a problem in our country and in our military, a  huge problem? I think it will help.   My view, as someone who understands the military well, is that it is  not going to be solved until we have leaders who take this issue very  seriously. That is what we need more than anything, and I think our  leadership in the military is starting to do this, but more needs to  happen.   So that would be what most of us think has been the focus of her  legislation for 10 years and what would be the result likely to come  out of committee as early as tomorrow, carving out these issues, not  creating pink courts but creating a professional class of prosecutors  and defense attorneys who know these issues, which are often  challenging. Senator Gillibrand knows this. ``He said, she said'' kinds  of accusations often are at the heart of these horrible crimes. And to  have that for men and women--so there is no pink court there, by the  way--to have that class of cases removed from the chain of command for  all of the reasons she and others have been arguing, if that is the  result tomorrow, I think it is going to get strong bipartisan support  and support from the administration.   Unfortunately, that is not where the bill is. As she is now  indicating, this bill would remove all crimes, all felonies--1 year in  jail, anything; a bar fight, anything. In terms of the commander's  ability to have good order and discipline, all of that under this  legislation would be covered--1-year felony. And in many people's  view--in my view, certainly--and in the chairman of the committee's  view, and the ranking member's view, and many others, this is a hugely  broad reworking of the UCMJ, probably one of the most dramatic  reworkings of the Uniform Code of Military Justice ever.   Now, why are Senator Gillibrand and others making the argument? What  she has been doing--she didn't come down here today, but I have been  reading her speeches. She has been essentially saying we need this  broad carve-out for every crime, every felony in the chain of command  because of racial problems in the military.   This is a new argument. She and I have talked about it. This is a  dramatic argument. This is essentially saying what she said in a recent  speech: It is ``necessary''--1 year more--``because the current  military justice system is simply not delivering justice, especially  not to servicemembers of color.'' This is a big claim.   What Senator Gillibrand has been doing with her previous  legislation--8 to 10 years of data to back it up on the sexual assault  issues. Again, I applaud her on that. She has been dogged. She has  gotten data. She has searched for data herself. But this new argument  basing this whole broad-based revamping of the whole UCMJ based on the  fact that she is now claiming the military justice system of the United  States cannot serve minority members has not been backed up by data-- has not been backed up by data.   She cites three studies, recent studies. Again, this is a new  argument. A lot of my colleagues say: Whoa. I didn't sign up for that  bill thinking it was based on some kind of broad-based systemic racism  in the military. But that is the new argument. We need to get that  right before we claim that every member of the military, every  commander, is somehow a racist. Even the studies that she has now  focused on are saying that disparity is not proof of racial  discrimination.   The U.S. Air Force--one of the studies that she has talked about  says:         While the presence of disparity alone is not evidence of       racism, discrimination, or disparate treatment, it presents a       concern that requires more in-depth analysis.    I fully agree with that.   Last year, when we were debating the NDAA, there was an issue that  came to my attention about how we had very senior military members,  four-star generals, who were not making the rank. We have a Service  Chief right now, General Brown, who is the first African-American  Service Secretary, Indian Services. When I talked to him, that was  disturbing to me. I put forward legislation saying: Why is that? What  is going on with our military? Let's figure that out.  [[Page S4986]]    What I am saying to Senator Gillibrand is and what the Air Force is  saying is, if this is a problem, let's figure that out.   The GAO study that she cites says this:         These findings show an association for disparities at       particular stages of the military justice process, but are       inconclusive regarding other stages. However, GAO's findings       of racial disparities, taken alone, do not establish whether       unlawful discrimination has occurred, as that is a legal       determination that would involve other corroborating       information and supporting statistics.    Again, is there a challenging disparity right now that Senator  Gillibrand has been highlighting? I believe so. Is it proof that the  UCMJ is somehow systemically racist and needs this broad-based change?  That is what she has been arguing on the Senate floor.   Unlike her other argument on sexual assault and the crimes that we  have seen over the years where there is 8 to 10 years of data that we  have all been looking at--again, a lot to her credit--this is something  that needs much, much more data before we make broad-based claims. For  example, some of those who are supporting her bill sent out this  supporting blog post that they said was supporting the legislation, the  broad-based legislation. This was from the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil  Liberties Law Review. This has been put out by staff to support her  broad-based legislation. It says:         Almost all military disciplinary action occurs at the       discretion of military officers, and with over 75% of the       officer corps [being] white, systemic bias is not just a       function of military justice, it's a foregone conclusion.    That is a pretty broad statement. That is a pretty broad statement.  Where is the data to back that up? In essence, because you are a White  commander, you are not going to give justice to minorities? I find that  offensive as a commander who has commanded all kinds of Alaska Natives,  African Americans, Hispanics, Whites.   So we can't base this broad-based legislation--all felonies--on this  relatively new claim that does not have data supporting it that somehow  we need to revamp the entire UCMJ because White commanders are racist.  I don't think we should do it.   I want to work with Senator Gillibrand on these and other issues  tomorrow. It will be an important debate. I am hopeful that the years  of her hard work and data on this issue are going to result in a carve- out for sexual assault and related crimes of violence that will be  bipartisan. It will be supported by the Secretary of Defense, the  Service Secretaries. Again, I think Senator Gillibrand will deserve an  enormous amount of credit for her determination over a decade to make  that happen. But with regard to the broader legislation that she has  asked for unanimous consent on, for the reasons I just discussed, I  object.    Madam President, I just want to again compliment my  colleague from New York, who has worked this issue hard. It is an  emotional issue. I think we all have good intentions on this issue. We  all want to get to the right answer for men and women in the military  as it relates to these crimes and still have a force. As she said, it  is the best military fighting force in the world.   I think we are going to have a good debate on this tomorrow, and I am  certainly committed to continuing to work with Senator Gillibrand on  these issues as they relate to the military and as they relate to the  civilian world. They are enormously important, and I take them very  seriously.   Again, I want to applaud her for her passion, her focus, her  commitment. We wouldn't be this far in this debate at all if it weren't  for her, and I have a lot of respect for that.   I yield the floor.
