 Mr. Speaker, the left's woke agenda is putting the  retirement savings of many Americans at risk.   The Biden administration's proposed rule would require retirement  plan managers to consider environmental, social, and governance factors  when making investment decisions for workers and retirees. These  factors can include a company's carbon footprint, hiring practices, and  whether it is unionized.   ESG factors are subjective and arbitrary, making them a perfect  weapon for the left. Forcing ESG standards on retirement accounts is a  clear violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which  requires fiduciaries to put the financial interests of plan  participants first.   ESG requirements pressure investors to subject retirement savings to  low-yield investments. This is irresponsible. We should be doing all  that we can to safeguard the savings of retirees instead of putting  them at risk to satisfy the woke mob.                            ____________________
