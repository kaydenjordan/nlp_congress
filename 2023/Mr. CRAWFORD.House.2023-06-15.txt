 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a leader in  the American steel industry. Eileen Bradner, the senior director and  counsel at Nucor, has worked for one of my district's most prominent  employers since 2009. Her hard work advocating for the steel industry  here in Washington helped grow jobs in Arkansas' First District and at  Nucor facilities across the United States.   Before leading Nucor's Washington office, Eileen represented American  manufacturers on international trade policy, litigation, and  legislative matters for 21 years. Her legislative work included 8 years  with Senator John Glenn, where she worked on foreign trade and  antidumping policies.   Eileen dedicated her career to protecting American jobs and  manufacturing, representing small and large companies alike. I am proud  to call Eileen a friend. She will be dearly missed as she embarks on a  well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
