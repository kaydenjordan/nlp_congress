 Madam Speaker, clinicians need to take the  lead on healthcare. Lawyers and bean counters were used to write the  Affordable Care Act, and look what it got us.  [[Page H3687]]    As a doctor, former owner of a healthcare company, and cancer  survivor, I believe it is time we allow clinicians to write and form  the healthcare laws that will help our Nation, and to base it on a free  market solution. That is why I am introducing a bill to innovate  Medicaid, a plan that will put the patient in charge of their care with  more choice and less cost.   My plan would allow for free market competition and improve care. But  above all, for Medicaid, it would not raise taxes and, potentially,  could even lead to lower costs, without raising costs for Medicaid  patients.   We need less government involvement, not more, to fix our broken  healthcare system.                            ____________________
