 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the nomination of  Betsy DeVos, of my home State of Michigan, to be the next Secretary of  Education.   She shares our belief that all children should have the opportunity  to learn in a world-class environment and that they, along with their  parents, should be able to choose the schools that are best for them.  In Michigan, she has improved learning opportunities for students from  low-income backgrounds all across the State. She knows that local  control plays a key role in an educator's ability to tailor lesson  plans that best provide the education for our students.   For decades, Betsy DeVos has worked tirelessly on education issues,  and she has been a champion for parents and students. As a parent of  six children who have attended public schools, I am confident that she  will do an outstanding job as our next Secretary of Education.                            ____________________
