 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Air  Force Captain Ryan Phaneuf, who died last week serving his country in  Afghanistan.   His sacrifice is a solemn reminder that, after nearly 20 years of  conflict, brave Americans regularly volunteer to take tremendous risks  in order to keep us all safe. We are grateful for the service of our  men and women in uniform.   Ryan grew up dreaming of flying. His commitment to service began at a  young age. While at Alvirne High School in Hudson, New Hampshire, he  joined the Junior ROTC program and was considered a leader by his  peers.   After graduating from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, he signed  up for the United States Air Force. Ryan served his country with  distinction and was a decorated pilot.   By flying communications missions, Ryan risked his own life to  facilitate effective battlefield communication in Afghanistan which, in  turn, helped keep servicemembers on the ground safe.    Tragically, Ryan's plane crashed in the snowy mountains of  Afghanistan on January 27. Our thoughts and prayers are with his  parents, Nancy and Donald, and his loving wife, Megan, during this  tragic time.   We will never forget Ryan's commitment to protecting our country and  our men and women in uniform. By the grace of God, we pray that the boy  who dreamed of flying will forever rest peacefully.                 Honoring the Life and Service of Katie Thyne     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  Officer Katie Thyne, a Newport News police officer who died while  serving her community on January 23, 2020.   Katie spent her formative years in New Hampshire and attended Alvirne  High School in Hudson, New Hampshire. Her commitment to service began  early. While at Alvirne, Katie participated in the Junior ROTC program,  where she gained a reputation for hard work and kindness.   After high school, Katie enlisted in the Navy, serving her country  with distinction and receiving commendation for her good conduct. Upon  completing her service in the Navy, she continued to serve and joined  the Newport News, Virginia police force.   Tragically, on January 23, Katie was killed in the line of duty. Her  sacrifice is a reminder of the tremendous risks police officers take  every day when they put on their uniform and go to work keeping our  communities safe. Because of the service and sacrifice of members of  law enforcement, all our communities are better for it.   Katie was irreplaceable, and she is dearly missed. She will always be  remembered for her kind heart, her radiant and constant smile, and her  love of family and friends.   We will keep Katie, and her family, and the Hudson community in our  thoughts and prayers.                            ____________________
