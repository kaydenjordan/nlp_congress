 Mr. Speaker, last Congress, and again on May  17, 2023, I introduced Articles of Impeachment against Secretary  Alejandro Mayorkas.   We have been waiting for regular order for 6 months, and the  committee of jurisdiction and Congress have failed to act. My Articles  of Impeachment sit collecting dust with the others while Americans die  every single day.   The American people support impeachment. Members of Congress support  impeachment. Even our esteemed majority whip,   Tom Emmer, has endorsed  this impeachment resolution.   Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has aided and abetted the complete  invasion of our country by deliberately flooding our Nation with drugs,  terrorists, and illegals from over 160 countries. How many more will he  allow to invade our country?   Rather than adhering to an oath he took to defend and secure our  country and uphold the Constitution, Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas has  engaged in a pattern of conduct that is incompatible with the laws of  the United States. Since assuming office, he has allowed approximately  10 million illegal border crossers to invade our country, 1.8 million  of whom are known got-aways and have evaded U.S. authorities.   Because of his open border policies, he has allowed more than 280  people on terrorist watch lists to be caught while attempting to cross  the border between ports of entry, as well as approximately 73,000  special interest aliens, who are aliens from a nation that promotes  terrorist activity, harbors terrorists, or poses a security threat to  the United States.   These numbers do not even account for the approximately 1.8 million  known got-aways who are roaming the interior of our country. How many  of them are terrorists?   Just last fiscal year alone, the CBP arrested almost 18,000  individuals with criminal convictions and over 110 MS-13 gang members.  How many of the 1.8 million got-aways are gang members?   Just last week, two constituents of mine were killed in a human  smuggling pursuit caused by Secretary Mayorkas' open-border policies.  Jose and Isabel Lerma's family will never get to see them again.   His policies allow for approximately 300 Americans to die every  single day from fentanyl poisoning. How many more days will this  continue?   His open border policies have allowed unaccompanied children to be  exploited, and now, 85,000 of them are completely missing. Tens of  thousands of illegal children have been forced into slave labor.  Thousands of others are being recycled by predatory illegal border  crossers, who use these children to become fake family units so they  can receive expedited release into the interior of our country.   Secretary Mayorkas has violated the law by directing DHS to mass  parole illegal aliens into the U.S. when Federal law specifically  prohibits this, and he has been providing bus tickets, plane tickets,  and hotel rooms at the expense of the American taxpayers for these  illegal aliens.   He has violated the Secure Fence Act of 2006 by not maintaining  operational control of the border as required by law. He has violated  the Guarantee Clause as set forth in Article IV, Section 4 of the  Constitution, which requires the Federal Government to protect States  against invasion. The Guarantee Clause clearly dictates that the  Federal Government has a constitutional duty and obligation to protect  each of the States from invasion.   As Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, he has violated  his oath to uphold this constitutional duty by allowing the invasion of  approximately 10 million illegal aliens across our borders. He has  encouraged asylum fraud, abused the credible fear standard, and  exercised mass catch and release policies.   Article II of the Constitution requires that the executive branch,  which includes the Secretary of Homeland Security, ensures the laws  passed by Congress and signed into law by the President are faithfully  executed. Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, in his inability to enforce the  law, has engaged in a pattern of conduct that is incompatible with his  duties as a civil officer of the United States.   Alejandro Mayorkas thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from  office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor,  trust, or profit under the United States.   While some of my colleagues have argued that we need to proceed  through regular order to pursue impeachment proceedings, the committee  of jurisdiction and Congress have failed to act on the overwhelming  evidence to impeach Secretary Mayorkas.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my legislation to  impeach Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The American people are ready.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the  privileges of the House and offer the resolution previously noticed.
