 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment,  which would prohibit funds to implement the final EPA rule titled:  ``Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases  Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act.''   Mr. Chair, on December 7, 2009, this rule was signed by the EPA  Administrator, and it found that six greenhouse gases endanger both the  public health and the public welfare of humans, specifically emissions  from motor vehicles.   Since this rule has been implemented, we have seen some of the most  radical and asinine decisions and regulations come from the executive  branch. This includes strict regulations on car emissions and the Big  Government attempt to dismantle the gas-powered vehicle. It includes  power plant regulations that have shut down coal plants, killing  thousands of jobs along the way. It includes the use of taxpayer  dollars to bribe people into buying electric vehicles and solar panels  with someone else's money. It includes the Paris climate accord, a  terrible deal that sold America's sovereignty to international  bureaucrats in exchange for energy poverty here at home, all while  China and India get to continue increasing their emissions for decades.   What have the American people gotten from these policies? Nothing.   These policies cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and the American  people are left scratching their heads, looking for what their benefit  is.   The worst part is that these policies do more harm than good because  the radical environmentalists have gotten their way in the past decade,  and the American people are left dealing with the fallout.   In California, we have seen brownouts and blackouts as a result of  the closure of coal plants. We have seen skyrocketing prices at the  pumps because this administration won't expand drilling or fracking in  United States territory.   In Texas, during Winter Storm Uri, we saw a horrible blackout 2 years  ago because of its dependency on unreliable sources of energy. To think  that, in the 21st century, Americans would have to face these  challenges and, in the case of Texas, that Americans would freeze to  death--over 150 people froze to death--is unacceptable. It is all  because we want to prevent the use of energy that creates carbon  emissions.   News flash: We depend as a nation on coal, natural gas, and oil.  Without it, we are a poor nation.   The benefits of using our resources outweigh the potential cost of  emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.   The regulation that this amendment defunds is the root of the  environmental insanity we have been dealing with for the past decade.  It is time to show the American people that we have their backs and  that we are done appeasing the radical environmentalists.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle argue that greenhouse gases are an endangerment that we need to  eliminate. This is a one-sided view that completely ignores the  enormous benefits that fossil fuels have had while only focusing on the  rise in temperatures.   Their climate hysteria assumes that any warming is caused by these  gases and that it is a catastrophe. That is simply not accurate and  ignores the destruction that is caused by their agenda.   Just ask the hundreds of people, many of whom lost their lives in  Texas during Winter Storm Uri. Just ask the energy-poor nations around  the world that have a much lower standard of living than us.   The endangerment rule, which my amendment defunds, is based on a  narrow, one-sided view that refuses to look at the ramifications of  banning fossil fuels.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment,  which would prohibit funds to Executive Order No. 14507, ``Catalyzing  Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability.''                                time  1815    This executive order is another example of how this administration is  more than willing to waste the taxpayers' time and energy in furthering  a radical climate agenda. It manipulates the Federal Government that  they must achieve a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035  and net zero emissions no later than 2050.   The text of the order declares that the Federal Government will lead  by example and cut out carbon emissions.   However, is this administration really leading by example?   Has John Kerry stopped using private jets?   Has Pete Buttigieg?   Of course not. This hypocrisy is exactly why I filed this amendment.   The amendment defunds an executive order that wastes taxpayer dollars  and continues our country down a path of dangerous energy policies.  Unfortunately, this administration knows this is the result of the  order, and they are more than willing to place these burdens on the  American people. They are willing to waste money in reconfiguring  buildings and buying fleets of new electric vehicles all on the backs  of our taxpayers. They are also in favor of new regulations that will  suppress our energy industries.   Nonetheless, do you know what, Mr. Chairman?   They will be fine because they don't have to feel the repercussions  of their policies. It will be everyday Americans who will see their  utility bills go up. It will be our constituents who are left unable to  pay their bills or afford gas. It will be the average person who is  experiencing blackouts because we have shifted towards unreliable  sources of electricity instead of reliable baseload energy sources.   Again, those who drafted this executive order won't have to feel the  pain. They only care about furthering a radical agenda that is  impossible to achieve.   The attempt to reach a 100 percent carbon-free America can only  happen after our reliable energy sectors are dismantled and our way of  life is destroyed. The energy sector that they want to dismantle is  what made America a rich and prosperous nation. Coal, natural gas, and  nuclear energy are the answers to the future which demands more  electricity than we can ever fathom today, not the types of reforms  that the other side calls for.   We only need to look at California or winter storm Uri in Texas as  examples of why traditional energy sources are so vital. This executive  order only hurts the American people and pushes us down a road that  leads to a weaker, poorer, and less prosperous country.   Mr. Chairman, I call on my colleagues to pass this amendment and  defund this executive order, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, instead of focusing on a misguided  climate policy, we should instead focus on sources of energy that help  our society grow and flourish. Energy sources such as wind and solar  claim to be sustainable, but they are often backed up with the more  reliable sources of energy such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear.   Wind and solar also use vast amounts of raw materials and land and  have their own environmental issues. The cost of using these energy  sources and abandoning fossil fuels is simply misguided. Fossil fuels  help humans flourish, and we should protect these fuels by defunding  this executive order.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
