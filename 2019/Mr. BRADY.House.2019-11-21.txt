 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of two  important events in November: Pulmonary Hypertension Awareness Month  and National Adoption Month.   Pulmonary hypertension was first brought to my attention by my dear  friend Jack Stibbs, whose daughter, Emily, had PH. Because of her early  diagnosis and his terrific leadership, Emily has been able to lead a  relatively normal life and recently graduated from college and married.  However, not all patients are as fortunate as she.   That is why the work of the Pulmonary Hypertension Association is so  important. Their efforts to increase awareness and research across  Federal agencies are making a huge difference in lives across the  Nation. I am proud to represent the PHA Lone Star Chapter in The  Woodlands, Texas.   November is also National Adoption Month. This is a cause I hold  close to my heart because it is thanks to the miracle of adoption that  I have my incredible family today.   During this month, we recognize and thank the adoptive parents,  dedicated professionals, and the faith-based organizations that work  tirelessly to provide our Nation's children with love and support.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in raising awareness  and saying thanks to these two great causes.                            ____________________
