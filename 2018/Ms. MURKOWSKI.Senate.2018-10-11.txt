 Mr. President, many Alaskans have contributed  enormously to the development of the Territory of Alaska through  Statehood and beyond with their special life skills, talents, courage,  and insights into the world around them. Among that distinguished group  was a very special man, Roy H. Madsen of Kodiak, AK. Roy Madsen was  known for so many things. Among them, he was the first Alaska Native to  serve as a judge of the Alaska Superior Court. On the eve of the Alaska  Federation of Natives convention, I proudly honor his remarkable life  that spanned 94 years from March 15, 1923 to December 26, 2017.   Roy was born in the village of Kanatak, located just across Shelikoff  Straits from the Kodiak archipelago near the Valley of Ten Thousand  Smokes and Mount Katmai in the Katmai National Monument on the Alaskan  Peninsula, an area which, in 1980, was expanded and renamed the Katmai  National Park and Preserve.   Roy was one of eight children. His father, Charles Madsen, was a  Danish immigrant who established a trading post at Kanatak. His mother,  Alaska Native Mary (Metrokin) was a homemaker. The Madsens returned to  his mother's hometown of Kodiak where, when Roy was only 4 years old,  she passed. Roy and his siblings were raised in Kodiak by their dad and  their stepmother, Alexandra Churnoff Madsen. Roy's love for his  heritage and for the island remained centerpieces throughout his life.  A member of the Sun'aq Tribe of Kodiak, he lived there for most of his  life.   Blessed with his mother's rich, Alaska Native Sugpiaq-Koniagmiut- Alutiiq-Russian subsistence culture and fortified by his father's  immigrant mindset of courage and ambition, Roy lived his life setting  goals and pursuing them, most often with success.   After graduating from Kodiak High School in a class of six, he  entered Oregon State University in 1941. In 1943, he left college and  enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served as a gunner and navigator on  Patrol Torpedo Boat PT 190, the ``Jack of Diamonds'' in the South  Pacific during World War II. While serving in the Navy in the  Philippines and New Guinea, Roy's unit was awarded campaign medals and  two battle stars.   It was after WWII that Roy and his first wife Katharine (Walters) and  family moved back to Kodiak in 1946. To support his growing family, he  spent a couple of summers fishing in Bristol Bay on a Columbia River  double ender by sail and became a registered Alaska bear guide, working  with his father Captain Charles Madsen, guiding clients on Kodiak brown  bear hunts.   The Madsens then moved to Oregon, where Roy finished his bachelor's  degree and entered Northwestern College of Law, today the Lewis & Clark  Law School, where he received his juris doctor degree in 1953. He  served as assistant district attorney and practiced law in Oregon  before, in 1961, returning with his family to Kodiak. Over the years,  the Madsen clan grew to include seven children: Elizabeth, Mary Jane,  Charles, Charlotte, Jacqueline, Guy--deceased--stepdaughter Shannon, 13  grandchildren, and 4 great-grand children.   Roy Madsen immersed himself in Kodiak's thriving civic and cultural  life. In the 1960s, he established a law firm, was the Kodiak city  attorney, and the Kodiak Island Borough attorney. During this period,  his commitment to his heritage grew and became legendary. He helped  establish the Kodiak Area Native Association KANA, serving as its first  vice president. His niece, Rita Stevens, wife of State Senator Gary  Stevens, later furthered the work Roy had begun by helping to lead KANA  for nearly two decades.   As an attorney and Alaska Native, he contributed his knowledge and  experience to efforts within Alaska to achieve a settlement through the  Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of Alaska Native aboriginal  land claims that resulted from work by many across the State in the  enactment of Public Law 93-203 in 1971. He then helped to establish  Koniag, Inc., one of the regional Alaska Native Corporations authorized  by ANCSA.   It was in 1975 that Roy began service as a Superior Court judge. He  served in the State's Third Judicial District, an area of approximately  67,000 square miles, and sat in Kodiak. He served as a judge on that  court through 1990.   Judge Madsen continued to serve his beloved island through the  decades. After his retirement from the bench, he enjoyed participating  in Alaska court system's Colors of Justice Program, promoting  acceptance of diversity and encouraging minorities to consider pursuing  law as a career. He helped found, was chair of the first advisory  board, and was a professor at the Kodiak Community College teaching  constitutional, criminal, and business law. After his retirement from  the bench, he was appointed to the Alaska State Commission for Human  Rights and to the Alaska Supreme Court Committee on Fairness and Access  to the Courts.   Roy was counsel for writing the articles of incorporation for and an  original board member of St. Herman's Orthodox Theological Seminary, a  board member of the Kodiak Baptist Missions Treatment Center for  Troubled Youths, and a member of the advisory board of St. Innocent's  Orthodox Academy for Troubled Youths. He also served on the  [[Page S6813]]  Alaska Rural Systemic Initiative committee which focused on  incorporating ``Native Ways of Learning'' into mainstream education  delivery in Alaska. That initiative added a great deal to the  recognition and usage of this form of wisdom of the Elders and Native  culture in learning delivery in the State.   A mesmerizing storyteller, with deep and broad knowledge as an elder,  Roy was a sought after and frequently featured speaker at any number of  local events. Among his many honors was Saint Herman's Cross, bestowed  upon him by Bishop Gregory Afonsky. In more recent years, Kodiak's  courthouse was rededicated as the Roy H. Madsen Justice Center.   Not long before his passing, Roy was named Conservation Elder of the  Year by the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge for his long dedication to  the refuge's Kodiak brown bear program. In recognition of his lifetime  of achievement, the University of Alaska honored him with a doctorate  of humanities. The documentary, ``Magnetic North,'' capturing how his  life contributed to the history, spirit, and character of Alaska,  premiered in Kodiak and aired on Alaska Public Television during 2017  shortly before his passing.   Roy was equally comfortable in his robes dispensing justice from the  court bench as he was in a flannel shirt and worn corduroys at the helm  of his skiff, shuttling family to a cabin on Woody Island or helping  ferry pilgrims for the annual St. Herman's Pilgrimage to Monk's Lagoon  or simply picking wild berries and mushrooms in the woods.   He was in his element with an audience, be it 2 or 200 hundred,  sharing his stories of nature and human nature. His deep bass voice  could fill a room, and his easy smile and laughter were contagious. Roy  was manly enough to shed tears of joy or sorrow without embarrassment,  to render steady advice, and to dispense his love, help, and friendship  to all in need.   When asked for some words of advice, Roy once answered: ``For a good  quality of life, I believe it is important to have several things: a  positive mind, good family relationships, goals you hope to achieve and  to be adaptable. Be open to new relationships, never feel too old to  learn and always be yourself. Recognize that you are unique. There is  only one you.''   He held his most satisfying accomplishments as: ``Extending justice  and judicial services to rural Alaska--exposing rural Alaskans to  Alaska's judicial system and making them feel included by traveling to  them and delivering services in their own communities.''   Linda, his wife of 36 years prior to his passing, perhaps said it  best: Roy had ``the soul of a poet, the vitality of a fisherman and  hunter, measured reason and mental retentiveness of a judge, courage  and vision of one committed to making life better for others, and the  heart and humanity of a loyal friend.''   This is but a brief overview of the life of Roy Madsen who lived such  a productive and principled life and who, by his deeds and who he was,  represented the apex of what frontier Alaska and America can produce.   It is with the greatest respect that I share with my Senate  colleagues and with the American people this short biographical sketch  of the life of Roy Madsen, a wonderful Alaskan who served his country  in war and peace and his fellow citizens in so many exemplary ways. We  all are enriched to know about this great man whose life will be  remembered and, hopefully, emulated as a ``north star'' for those who  were fortunate to know him and those who will learn about his  remarkable life.                            ____________________
