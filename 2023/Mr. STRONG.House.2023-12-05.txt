 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in honor of Lieutenant General  Dan Karbler, commanding general of Army Space and Missile Defense  Command and the Joint Functional Component Command for Integrated  Missile Defense, on his upcoming retirement.   When he took command at Redstone Arsenal, General Karbler shared a  vision of a people-first team, providing unmatched expertise to support  joint warfighting readiness across all domains. This vision has not  only been achieved but set an example for what excellence looks like,  with SMDC and JFCC IMD being named the best place to work in the  Department of Defense for 2 years in a row.   Known for his candor, thoughtfulness, and humility, his legacy will  live on much longer than his 36 years in Active-Duty service to the  United States Army.   Mr. Speaker, I speak for many as I thank General Karbler and his  wife, Leah; his dad, Tim; and his children, Lauren and Tim, for years  of extraordinary service.   Mr. Speaker, I wish General Karbler a happy and restful retirement.                            ____________________
