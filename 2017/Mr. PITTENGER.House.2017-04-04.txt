 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his exceptional  leadership on this very important legislation.   In 2012, 7-year-old Jamal Stevens was in his bed when a tornado tore  through the house, tossing him onto the embankment along Interstate  485, hundreds of feet from his room.   The warning from the National Weather Service came 10 minutes later,  [[Page H2666]]  after the tornado had already touched down. This is because my hometown  of Charlotte relies on radar nearly 100 miles away, meaning that the  National Weather Service is using weak or inaccurate readings when  issuing crucial safety warnings for Charlotteans.   In 2013, the current system provided a tornado warning, but for  citizens in an entirely wrong neighborhood. More recently, a tornado in  December of 2015 struck neighboring Union County with no warning from  the National Weather Service.   Fortunately, our region has not suffered any fatalities due to the  inadequate coverage, but we shouldn't wait for tragedy to act.   The Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act requires the  Commerce Department to identify weak coverage areas and identify  solutions to the problem by improving existing government radars or  incorporating non-Federal radars into the National Weather Service's  operations.   Americans across the country rely on the National Weather Service to  detect and provide warning for severe weather such as thunderstorms and  tornadoes. But Charlotte is currently the largest metropolitan area  without an adequate radar coverage. Addressing this shortcoming is an  important step for public safety.   With that in mind, I do urge my colleagues to support H.R. 353. I  thank the chairman so much for his support on this critical  legislation.
