 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Brady) for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today and oppose the Democrat's latest  socialist spending spree.   Today, the Federal Government presides over nearly $30 trillion in  debt and $100 trillion of unfunded liabilities in Medicare, Social  Security, and Medicaid.   These catastrophic debts are growing increasingly unsustainable. And  now the Democrats are using the debt ceiling as a blackmail to enable  passage of an unaffordable so-called human infrastructure bill. I still  don't quite understand what that means, but maybe they will enlighten  us during the debate.   The Democrats, themselves, can't honestly tell us how much this bill  would cost. First, they said it was $3.5 trillion, then the amount was  raised to over $4 trillion. And both figures, obviously, underestimate  the true cost by trillions of dollars.   Then with an amazing message discipline, Democrats in the House,  Senate, and White House, along with their media cheerleaders, suddenly  began claiming, in unison, that the bill won't cost anything at all.   They previously argued that ``tax the rich'' would pay for  everything. But now, they have apparently conjured a true economic  miracle:   No one will have to pay for the astronomical cost of this bill. It is  Congress' first self-financing, multi-trillion-dollar spending plan. It  is amazing that no Member of Congress ever figured this out before.   Now that the Democrats are full of their new socialist colleagues,  you have finally achieved the Marxist dream of abolishing money.   The bill itself is the mother of all socialist spending programs. It  is as if the Democrats are rejecting all fiscal restraint and decided  that they had one shot to turn America into a socialist welfare state.   Madam Speaker, I reject that transformation and the spending gimmicks  needed to enact it. I urge all Members to vote against this scheme and  vote down the increase in the debt limit.
