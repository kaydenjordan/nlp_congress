 Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Chair, I support this amendment which would increase the sexual  assault services program authorization from $40 million to $60 million.   This program assists States, Tribes, and territories to provide  intervention, advocacy support, and related assistance to victims of  sexual assault.   Experts in the field have indicated that this program is underfunded  for the depth and the breadth of the work it covers, despite the  remarks of the gentleman from Virginia.   It is underfunded. We need more money here. I support the amendment  of the gentlewoman.   Now, the gentleman from Virginia says there is no offset. That is  true. We do not need an offset.   Of course, we could take it away from President Trump's personal part  of the tax, of the $1.8 trillion tax break that the Republicans voted  for for the rich.   But the fact is we don't need an offset. Under the rules, the  appropriations bill has to deal with that. This simply makes funds  available, and for a very worthy purpose.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise in support of the gentlewoman's amendment. Representative  Torres Small's amendment makes it clear that nothing in this bill  impacts or changes any obligations or requirements to comply with our  immigration laws.   This amendment alleviates any potential concern or confusion about  the intent of this legislation. It makes clear that the bill does not  change any immigration law, nor does it affect any of the immigration  obligations and requirements under current law. It is that simple, and  I urge all of my colleagues to support it.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I move that the committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  Torres Small of New Mexico) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Watson  Coleman, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state  of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 1585) to reauthorize the Violence Against  Women Act of 1994, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution  thereon.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that in the  engrossment of H.R. 1585, the Clerk be authorized to correct section  numbers, punctuation, spelling, and cross-references and to make such  other technical and conforming changes as may be necessary to reflect  the actions of the House, including the changes now at the desk.
