 Madam Speaker, this week, I visited the Customs and  Border Protection facilities where 8-year-old Felipe Gomez Alonso was  held shortly before he fell sick and tragically died on Christmas Eve.  This was just 3 weeks after 7-year-old Jakelyn Caal died in custody  nearby.   I went to Alamogordo because I wanted to hear directly from CBP  agents why these two children died and what changes are being made to  ensure that not one more child dies while in United States custody.   CBP agents told us that they needed more personnel, more  technological support, better coordination between agencies, and  improvements to facilities to accommodate the higher percentage of  children and families seeking asylum.   One checkpoint I visited didn't have a shower for migrants. They were  transported an hour each way every 2 days for a shower. The other  facility didn't even have potable water.   The Border Patrol agents were also understandably frustrated that  their online database did not synchronize with DHS systems, creating  even more confusion when migrants were being moved or processed. Not  once did the agents mention building a wall.   What I confirmed was that this President purposefully created this  humanitarian crisis at the border for political reasons by taking the  following actions:   Trump cut the Central American Minors refugee program, which had  allowed migrants from Central America to apply for humanitarian relief  while in their home countries instead of traveling to our border,  forcing them to make a dangerous journey with their children to escape  life-threatening violence in their countries.   He then separated families at the border, taking toddlers from the  arms of parents and losing track of people's children in the process, a  stain on the history of our great Nation.   And he blocked asylum-seekers from their legal right to present  themselves for screenings through metering at the ports or denying all  asylum claims, creating huge backlogs at the legal ports of entry with  squalid conditions and pushing more migrants to attempt to cross the  border between ports of entry out of desperation.   This is a real humanitarian crisis that is unfolding because of the  President's obsession with an ineffective wall that Mexico was  supposedly going to pay for rather than listening to the actual needs  of our CBP officers.    The President continues to repeat the lie, as he did last night  again, that America faces a crisis in the number of border crossings  from Mexico. Surprisingly, there was not one migrant housed at the two  CBP facilities I visited this week.   The reality is that overall border crossings are on the decline.  There has been an 80 percent reduction in the number of border  crossings since the year 2000.   Trump created and welcomed this shutdown, telling the public that he  is proud to shut down the government and that he ``will take the mantle  of shutting it down.'' The President should, instead, join Congress and  immediately sign bipartisan legislation that previously passed both the  House and the Senate to reopen the government.   More than 800,000 Federal workers aren't sure of when their next  paycheck is coming, airport security and safety is suffering, and the  affordable housing programs for our homeless veterans are quickly  running out of funding on the central coast that I represent and across  the Nation. I urge the President to do the right thing so that we can  get to work for the American people.   Mr. President, open our government up.                            ____________________
