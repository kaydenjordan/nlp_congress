 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a great  man and a great patriot from Redding, California, in my district. His  commitment to his fellow veterans is certainly unparalleled. Major John  Cleckner, Sr. passed away on May 11, but he leaves behind a tremendous  legacy of service.   During a 22-year military career that began in 1957 in the 82nd  Airborne Division and later the U.S. Army Special Forces, John received  far too many awards and honors to list in this time. During his time as  a veteran of the Vietnam war, he was wounded multiple times and  received three Purple Hearts and two Bronze Stars.   In 1969, he was assigned to the 5th Special Forces Group. Upon  arriving, he initiated a massive rebuilding of their camp's defenses  and intelligence gathering when he heard of increased activity by North  Vietnamese units in the area. Not long afterward, a North Vietnamese  heavy weapons regiment laid siege to their camp for 5 months, but,  thanks to John's efforts, the camp held.   After receiving his third Purple Heart, John was medically retired in  1979.   As impressive as his military service record is, it might even pale  in comparison to his 35 years of dedicated  [[Page H4018]]  service to his fellow veterans, both in northern California and across  the United States. Much like his military career, his accomplishments  as an advocate for veterans are too numerous to properly list in this  format.   He has worked closely with me and my office and others previous to me  over the years as an adviser on all things veterans related and as a  tireless partner and champion of programs and legislation that can make  a real impact to help our veterans thrive.   He was a leader in every sense of the word. John was instrumental in  getting a new VA clinic in Redding, whose groundbreaking will be very  soon, and started the quest for a veterans' cemetery in Shasta County,  both of which have now come to fruition, thanks to his relentless  efforts.   John even collaborated with country music legend Merle Haggard, who  is a Redding resident, to coordinate a national fishing tournament for  combat-disabled veterans to have a chance to get out and relax and  enjoy the outdoors with people who they can relate to. For him, it was  all part of making the lives of veterans better in any way that he  could.   When John discovered that many veterans struggled to obtain legal  help, he went back to college at the age of 62 to get a degree that  would allow him to serve as a legal assistant to in-need veterans at no  charge to the veteran. That is amazing service. That is the kind of  person John Cleckner was.   For his impressive track record, both on the battlefield and in  civilian life, the Special Operations Center of Excellence at the U.S.  Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School inducted John  into the Distinguished Members of Special Operations Regiment in 2010.                                time  1045    I know this: Major John Cleckner was an American hero, on and off the  battlefield. He devoted his life to his country, and when he could no  longer serve his country, he devoted himself to improving the lives of  his fellow veterans.   I have seen it firsthand. I consider myself fortunate to have known  him as a friend, and I am grateful for the things he helped us--in my  office and others--do to accomplish things for veterans in northern  California.   John was tough, even a little scary, especially if he thought you  weren't being true to what you were saying you would do. But if you  were, you wouldn't have a stronger ally than Major John Cleckner in  what we pursue to help our veterans, to help our Nation be strong, to  be true.   His commitment has only strengthened my own resolve to further some  of the initiatives he started and we have helped with and to never stop  fighting for our veterans who deserve it.   I thank John for his service, his sacrifice, his dedication. We will  miss him in northern California but will ensure his legacy lives on  through our efforts--all of us--to help our veterans, to help our  Nation remain strong.   God bless Major John Cleckner, his faithful wife, Doris, his amazing  family, and all that he has ever had touch with during his life of  service to his nation and to his brothers.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Roe and Chairman  Takano for including my legislation, H.R. 1126, within H.R. 1947. It is  greatly appreciated. This is an oversight that was pointed out by  northern California veterans to me a while back, the choice of being  able to have a family member, a spouse, inscribed on a grave marker,  simply the difference being that it is in a Federal cemetery or one  that is private. That is really the bottom line on this.   This bill changes that oversight so that the choice can be at any  recognized cemetery. That is simply what we are after: to have our  veterans who have served us honorably know that, when they are at their  final resting place, that this oversight cannot happen for their family  member that they held so dear to share that gravestone with them.   So, whether it is a private cemetery or a VA, or whatever other type  you might have as your choice, veterans need to have this choice as  well.   Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Roe and Chairman Takano for  including this so we can take care of this oversight quickly and have  our veterans have the choices that they feel they deserve and, indeed,  do deserve. I appreciate it.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a great  woman and a doctor who is from my district in northern California, who  earned an incredible honor over the weekend.   Dr. Debbie Lupeika has been named as the 2019 National Clinician of  the year by the Association of Clinicians for the Underserved.   She teaches residents at Mercy Medical Center in Redding, California,  and Shasta Community Health Center, which serves mostly underserved or  uninsured patients.   Dr. Lupeika has helped treat many families that were displaced from  their homes in Shasta County by the Carr fire last year--everyone from  children to adults.   In rural communities like ours, it is even more important to have  great doctors who truly care about their patients and their craft when  also faced with these rural issues that are so difficult for retaining  doctors in rural areas. Dr. Debbie Lupeika fully embodies that in every  way.   Madam Speaker, I thank her for her commitment to improving healthcare  in our rural communities, and I congratulate her on receiving this  prestigious award.                            ____________________
