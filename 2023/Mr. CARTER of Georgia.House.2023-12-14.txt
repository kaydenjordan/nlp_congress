 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring recognition  to the city of Savannah, Georgia, as it was named among the best places  to retire by Southern Living.   This travel publication considered numerous factors such as cost of  living, home values, hospitality, accessibility, and others. Savannah  was even nicknamed the ``Hostess City of the South.''   The city was highlighted for its arts and culture, as well as its  historic charm. Being an important asset to the city, the Savannah  College of Art and Design fills nearly 70 buildings downtown and hosts  an annual sidewalk arts festival named ``Chalk of the Town.''   However, there is much more beyond this incredible culture. The city  dates back all the way to 1733, which shines through the carefully  preserved historic buildings, roads, and homes.   Savannah offers trolley rides through picturesque squares, as well as  dozens of historic cemeteries. The city holds the key to the most  excellent quality of life.   The city is my home. It is where I have lived all my life, and I am  so very proud of the city of Savannah.                            ____________________
