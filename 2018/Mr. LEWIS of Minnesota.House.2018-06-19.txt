 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I am here today to bring good  news. Good news that often in this 24/7 media cycle goes unnoticed,  unremarked.                                time  2015    It is the good news of legislation that works. It is the good news  that creates a growing and rising tide of economic prosperity for all  families, including, most importantly, the children of families who  rely on their parents' income in a growing economy.   I am here tonight to talk about the unheralded success of something  called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Rarely has one piece of legislation  been so successful so quickly, and rarely have so many, at least on one  side of the aisle, predicted its success with so much accuracy.   We are now, according to a number of analysts, including the Atlanta  Federal Reserve, set to grow at over 4 percent the next quarter.  Consider that over the last decade, if not longer, we have barely been  able to scratch the surface at 2 percent GDP growth.   Now, after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, after more investment in  America, after more repatriation of profits coming home to invest,  after labor and capital coming together because our Tax Code now  incentivizes labor and capital to come together, we are seeing wages  going up.   We are seeing more capital investment. We are seeing bigger  paychecks. We are seeing economic growth over 4 percent. We are seeing  utility companies offer rebates under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act because  they have to pass through the savings they got from tax reform to  customers.   It is remarkable how so many of our friends in the fourth estate seem  to have forgotten all the warnings about tax reform and tax relief. Oh,  I remember it well, Mr. Speaker. Last fall, last winter: This is going  to be crumbs. It is going to be Armageddon. It is going to be a  disaster if we pass the greatest tax reform in over 3 decades.   Now, some of us on the other side of the aisle, the Republican side  of the aisle, said: ``Wait a minute.'' Secretary of the Treasury Andrew  Mellon under Calvin Coolidge in the 1920s first embarked on increasing  the return for labor for capital investment, for economic growth. What  happened in the Roaring Twenties? It led to a balanced budget. Then, of  course, in the 1960s--and this is what my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle seem to forget--old-school Democrats like John F. Kennedy  went to The Economic Club of New York in 1962 and said:         What this economy needs in 1962 to break out of the       doldrums is a tax cut.    JFK said in that famous speech: ``Our practical choice is not between  a tax-cut deficit and a budgetary surplus. It is between two kinds of  deficits: a  [[Page H5279]]  chronic deficit of inertia, as the unwanted result of inadequate  revenues and a restricted economy, or a temporary deficit of  transition, resulting from a tax cut designed to boost the economy,  increase tax revenues, and achieve, I believe--and I believe this can  be done--a budget surplus. The first type of deficit,'' Kennedy warned,  ``is the sign of waste and weakness. The second reflects an investment  in the future.''   Well, Mr. Speaker, if there ever was an investment in the future, it  is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. So JFK got his tax cut enacted after his  tragic death, and what happened in the 1960s? We had lower rates, but  we had more revenue. Now, how is that possible?   Our critics of our tax reform say: Oh, you can't cut rates and have  more revenue.   It is amazing how many people know so little about modern business.  If you are sitting in your local hardware store, if you have unwanted  inventory, what is the first thing you do to move product? You lower  the price. Why? Because you lower the price to sell more goods and  services, albeit at a lower price, but a volume increase for more  revenue.   It happened during the 1978 capital gains tax cut, the Steiger  amendment, when we cut capital gains rates and, actually, revenue went  up. Every single time we have cut tax rates in the modern era, the  ``revenue loss'' has been nowhere near the predictions.   So in the 1960s, what happened? We had lower rates, and we had a  balanced budget by 1969. Higher revenues grew.   Fast forward to the 1980s. We had the doldrums of the Carter-malaise  era when we were told that the era of prosperity was over. We had to  put on our cardigan sweaters, button them up, and turn down the  thermostat because the good times were not coming back. Get used to it.   Ronald Reagan comes on board. He is pushed by the supply side  movement of 1970s and 1980s, and the Kemp-Roth tax cut. And he enacts  in 1981--in those days, a Democratic Congress when Democrats realized  that economic growth was actually a good thing and you want to  celebrate it, they enact Kemp-Roth, bringing the top rate down from 70  to 50 percent.   Now, there was a delay in 1982, you might recall, but then the tax  cuts finally kicked in, in 1983. By 1984, it was morning in America  again.   Revenues when Ronald Reagan took office were about $580 billion. By  the time the 1980s were over, Federal revenues were almost $1 trillion.  How could it be? How could it be that you cut tax rates and you almost  double revenue?   This is an amazing phenomenon that our critics of tax reform just  won't heed. They won't understand. They don't want to see it. They  don't want to hear it. But it is ironic. What is the first thing that  folks who say they want to reduce teenage smoking advocate? Mr.  Speaker, they advocate raising the taxes on cigarettes. Why? Because  when you raise taxes on something, you get less of it. You get less  activity.   Why is it that if you buy a bond, a 30-year bond or a bond in the  open market that is taxable, you demand a higher interest rate, but if  you buy a tax-exempt bond you will take a lower rate? Because people do  not work for pretax income. They work for after-tax income. And when  you lower the marginal tax rates and you increase after-tax income,  more people work. More people invest.   It happened in the 1920s. It happened in the 1960s. It happened in  the 1980s. And guess what? It is happening right now.   We have a 4.8 percent growth, 4.5 percent growth. Who knows, it may  just be 4 percent growth, but considering that we have been at 1.9  percent growth for so long, this is the miracle that keeps on giving  and yet won't be acknowledged.    Mr. Speaker, I will tell you why it won't be acknowledged by the  other side, because not one of them voted for it. Imagine, a tax bill  that doubles the childcare tax credit; a tax bill that lowers the tax  rates for mom-and-pop pass-through businesses by letting them deduct  the first 20 percent of income; a tax bill that says you don't have to  itemize any more to get a bigger deduction, and we are going to double  your standard deduction; a tax bill that puts America's corporations in  line with the rest of the world, not penalizing America's corporations  compared to the rest of the world.   Now we have foreign profits coming back. We have more mom-and-pop  businesses expanding. And we have a rising tide of economic growth, a  rising tide that lifts all boats.   I thought that is what this body was here to do. We are not here to  pick out groups, pick out winners and losers, to have some sort of  industrial policy where a command-and-control central government  decides who wins and who doesn't. You only gain if you are a political  entrepreneur.   The folks out in the real world, businesses and capitalists, they  invest for an economic return. But government all too often invests for  a political return. We have seen that form of crony capitalism, and it  gave us 1.9 percent economic growth. Now, instead of carve-outs and  loopholes, instead of favoring some States that like to tax their  citizens over States that don't, we have lower rates, broader but lower  rates for everyone, and loopholes for fewer, which means economic  growth is going to be determined by an economic return.   I don't know how else to describe this. It is an amazing success  story in the 115th Congress. Yet you would never know it listening to  the other side, listening to our friends in the fourth estate. It is  the story they don't want you to know.   But I am here to give you good news. The economic growth that is  occurring will keep occurring because people now have confidence. The  green shoots are back. The animal spirits are back. People are excited  to be in America. They feel good about their country. They feel this is  a place where they can fly as high as their wings can take them without  being hindered by the strong arm of the state.   That is what the American Dream is about. That is what the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act is about. And that is what believing in America is about.   I am proud to have played a part in it, however small, and I am proud  of Congress for passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
