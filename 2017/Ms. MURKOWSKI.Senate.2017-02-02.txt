 Thank you, Mr. President.   I come to the floor this morning to speak on the resolution of  disapproval that is before us, but I want to make just a few comments  following my colleague, the minority whip.   I am pleased to hear him say that he does look forward to the  opportunity for a hearing on Judge Gorsuch and the opportunity for a  vote. I think we recognize that we have in front of us an individual  who has truly a stellar legal reputation, who has committed himself to  the law in a remarkable way. When he was before this Senate for  confirmation leading up to the Tenth Circuit, he enjoyed very strong  support. I would like to think that on yet further review of this very  strong individual, our colleagues will do the due diligence that is  necessary as we perform our constitutional role of advise and consent.   There is so much that I will respond to at a later time when I go  into more detail about my support for Judge Gorsuch and why I think he  is exactly the type of individual we want to see named to the Supreme  Court, but the comment has been made, not only by my colleague from  Illinois but from others, that somehow or other Judge Gorsuch is for  Big Business and not the little guy. It seems that the criticism is  based on this viewpoint that courts should not defer to Federal agency  interpretations of their own rules, and certainly Big Business is a  frequent challenger of government overreach. But, as the Presiding  Officer and I both know, so are ordinary Americans--people like John  Sturgeon, an Alaskan who took on the Federal Government, took on the  agencies, and took on the Park Service because he was told he could not  use a hovercraft in an area where he had operated one for decades. John  Sturgeon, with the help of a few friends, who did everything from  garage sales to fund his litigation, and with just the generosity out  of their own pockets, took all the way to the Supreme Court the  question of whether or not the Park Service's regulation had exceeded  their legal authority.    I happen to believe very strongly that Judge Gorsuch is clearly on  the right track here when he questions the deference that courts give  to our government agencies. I think most Alaskans would probably agree  with us on this point--that when we are talking about the scales of  justice, they should not be tipped in favor of our Federal agencies.   Again, I am pleased to hear that the minority whip agrees that a  filibuster is not appropriate, is not the way to proceed with this fine  nominee. I look forward to learning more about Judge Gorsuch but also  to be able to share more of my observations at a later point in time.   Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues in support of H.J. Res.  38 to disapprove and nullify the Department of Interior's so-called  stream protection rule. I wish to begin my comments by thanking  Majority Leader McConnell and Senator Capito of West Virginia for  sponsoring the Senate version of this resolution. I also wish to note  that I am proud to be listed with the Presiding Officer as a cosponsor  on this bipartisan measure with 28 colleagues in support.   Now, by name alone, the stream protection rule may sound pretty  innocent, pretty well intentioned, but as we have heard and as we will  hear throughout this debate, the reality is really different. This  regulation will have severe economic impacts. It will cost us jobs. It  will cost us revenues as well as affordable energy all across our  country.   By way of background, the rule revises longstanding regulations for  coal  [[Page S614]]  mining under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, something  around here we simply call SMCRA. Now this rule was finalized in  December of 2016, and it took effect 2 weeks ago, making more than 400  changes to existing regulations.   Now, 400 is just a number that shows the scope of the changes that  the Obama administration has made, but it hardly does justice to the  sweeping substance of the changes or the deliberately opaque process  that the Obama administration followed to make them.   SMCRA is supposed to be an example of cooperative federalism, and  many States have approved programs that allow them to regulate coal  mining within their own borders. But beyond that, the law explicitly  directs the Federal Government to work with States to engage with them  whenever any changes are made. So it requires a high level of  cooperation and collaboration.   Contrary to the collaborative mood intended by SMCRA, the Obama  administration chose to draft the stream protection rule behind closed  doors. It ignored the input and recommendations that were provided by  States and other stakeholders. It subverted the law, basically, to meet  its own policy objectives, which was to keep the coal in the ground.  Ultimately, that is what they wanted to do, and it finalized a rule  that will shut down coal mining in several regions in our country,  including possibly in Alaska, if it is allowed to stand.   Now, the Obama administration claimed that this rule would cost only  $81 million a year and that it did not qualify as what is considered  ``economically significant'' as a rule, as a result of that. We will  likely hear that number touted by some of the opponents of this  resolution and probably some who will claim that we are exaggerating  the impact. But I don't think we should forget how the Obama  administration determined that the rule was insignificant in the first  place.   In January of 2011, the Associated Press obtained documents showing  that this rule was projected to eliminate 7,000 direct jobs across the  country. So instead of going back and fixing the rule to avoid these  potential job losses, what happened? The Department of Interior fired  the independent contractor that had made the projection. So,  effectively, we have a situation where the Department essentially cooks  the books instead of fixing the rule. It then took steps to rebrand the  rule, changing the name from the ``stream buffer zone rule'' to the  ``stream protection rule'' making the rule sound rather innocuous.   So what the American people should know is that there is a real  discrepancy between the economic impacts the Obama administration  estimated and what other sources project will happen if the rule is  left in place. The projection is that up to 30 percent of the direct  jobs in coal mining will be lost, and domestic coal production will  fall 29 to 65 percent, with anywhere from $15 billion to $29 billion in  lost annual coal resource value and $3.3 billion to $6.5 billion in  lost State and Federal revenue.   So with estimates like this, it is no wonder that this rule has drawn  such strong bipartisan opposition from Alaska all the way to  Appalachia. If you are doubting the statistics--if you are saying,  well, I am hearing certain things on one side and others on another-- you need to talk to people out there. We did that. Instead of just  taking what the Obama administration said, we went out and we asked  people.   Last March, I held a field hearing of the Energy and Natural  Resources Committee, and we held the field hearing up in Fairbanks, AK.  Among our witnesses was a woman by the name of Lorali Simon. The  occupant of the Chair knows her well. She works for Usibelli Coal Mine,  an initially family-owned and operated coal mine--which has been very  successful--and provides coal and power to the residents of the  Interior, and has been for a long time. Ms. Simon spoke about how coal  resources contribute significantly to our State by providing jobs and a  reliable energy source.    She explained that coal is the cheapest source of energy in Interior  Alaska for everything from the local community to our military bases  there and how usability has helped to create business for others like  our Alaska railroad. She also highlighted the broader picture about how  coal strengthens our national and energy security. So those are all  good things, in my book.   But Lorali also testified about the stream protection rule. She said  that, if the rule was finalized as it was proposed--which it has been-- it will likely kill all coal development in Alaska. She also noted that  Congress passed SMCRA, but during the Obama administration, she said:  ``We were seeing unelected federal employees violate legislative  intent, which will kill America's coal industry.''   Now, Lorali Simon is not alone in her criticisms or her opposition to  this rule. Our Governor in Alaska, an Independent by the name of  Governor Bill Walker, recently noted that it was one of the worst of  many different actions the Obama administration took to limit resource  development in our State of Alaska.   The attorneys general of 14 different States wrote:         The rule would have a disastrous effect on coal miners,       their families, workers in affected industries, and their       communities. It would also impose very significant costs on       American consumers of electricity, while undermining our       Nation's energy supply.    That is pretty tough--not only a disastrous effect on the coal miners  but the cost on American consumers of electricity, undermining our  Nation's energy supply.   The Interstate Mining Compact Commission described this rule as a  ``burdensome and unlawful rule that usurps states' authority as primary  regulators of coal mining as intended by Congress under SMCRA'' while  also seeking to impose ``an unwarranted top-down, one-size-fits-all  approach that does not take into account important regional and  ecological differences.''   Then, finally, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce noted that the rule  ``exceeds the Department's authority, will cause significant economic  harm and job losses, and interferes with longstanding and successful  state efforts to protect water quality.''   It is very clear to me that this rule simply cannot stand. We have an  opportunity here to make sure that is the case. So if you are concerned  about families paying more for their heating and their electricity  bills, you should support this resolution. If you are worried about job  losses due to access restrictions and rising energy costs, you should  support this resolution. And, if you care about States' rights, which  so many of us do, or overregulation by the Federal Government, which we  clearly do, you should support this resolution.   I have noted to a couple of people today that this is a pretty good  day to be debating a disapproval resolution under the Congressional  Review Act. It is Groundhog Day, and it is exactly what the last 8  years have felt like for anyone who has paid attention to the  regulations that were just churned out by the Obama administration. The  SPR rule is a perfect place to start as we sort through the major  burdens that the last administration imposed through its relentless  regulatory actions.   So, again, I wish to thank Leader McConnell and Senator Capito for  sponsoring and leading this legislation, and know that I intend to vote  for it. I urge my colleagues to do the same.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
