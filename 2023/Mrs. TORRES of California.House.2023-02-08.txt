 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer amendment  No. 5 to H.R. 185.   The decision to change COVID-19 vaccine requirements for global  travelers into the United States should not be made by Members of  Congress but instead by public health experts.   Colleagues, if we must continue with this reckless bill that puts  politics over science by replacing guidance from our public health  experts with harmful ideology at the expense of our communities, our  hospitals, and our health, then I would ask for your support for my  amendment.   Knowing that other countries have different health standards, have  little access to vaccines for COVID, why would you risk the number of  hospital beds that are currently available for yourselves, your  families, your community that you represent, why would you risk that to  allow visitors who are traveling into the United States to not show the  bare minimum of having had a vaccine?   My amendment would require that the Secretary of Health and Human  Services certify that the end of the COVID-19 vaccination requirement  for foreign air travelers will not result in an increase in U.S.  hospitalizations due to this deadly virus.   We do not want to threaten the progress that we have made in our  fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and push hospitals, healthcare  providers, and public health resources past their breaking points  again.   COVID-19 is still a public health threat, with new variants of  concern having emerged globally and entering the U.S. every single day.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to please, if you must move forward  with this bill, vote in support of this commonsense amendment to  protect our constituents, our hospitals, and our healthcare system.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1515
