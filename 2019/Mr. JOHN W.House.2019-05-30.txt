 ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to  object.    ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I am standing in a House  chamber that is virtually empty. Nearly all of my 431 colleagues are  absent as the Speaker of the House seeks to pass a $19 billion spending  bill.   Our Nation is $22 trillion in debt. Trying to pass nearly $20 billion  in new spending while the majority of Congress is not even in  Washington reflects another act of irresponsible big government.   This is absolutely, without a doubt, wrong. It is no surprise that  public confidence in Congress is at historic lows.    Every single Member could board a plane today, and this issue could  be voted on in the next 12 hours.   We are each accountable to the American people, who entrusted us with  their votes and sent us here to work on their behalf. I am accountable  to the people of Tennessee, and I can say with confidence: Tennesseans  deserve better than what is being attempted here today.   I never expected, when I came to Washington, that I would be asked to  stay home while $19 billion is spent without my vote.   I urge the Speaker of the House, who is also not here today, to  return to her  [[Page H4178]]  post and call Congress back to Washington to do the people's work, and  I object.
