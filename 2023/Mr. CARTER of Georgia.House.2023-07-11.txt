 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Mary Bullock Demere, a friend to many in Savannah, Georgia.   A grandmother to 17 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren, Mary  loved to spend time with her family and was known as the ultimate  hostess, always entertaining those dearest to her.   You could find Mary gardening, sailing with her husband, or dancing  the jitterbug in her free time, and her loving compassion extended not  just to her friends and family but also to animals. In fact, Mary would  tell you that she could even speak to bears.   Her generous and kind spirit led her to become an avid donor to  numerous charities, and Mary also dedicated her time and energy to  organizations in Savannah like the Savannah Junior League and Savannah  Garden Club.   I send my thoughts and prayers to Mary's family and thank God for  having brought such a beacon of light and joy into this world.                            ____________________
