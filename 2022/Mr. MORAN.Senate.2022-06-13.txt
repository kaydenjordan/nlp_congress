 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, as you know, the Senate is currently  considering the Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act. This bipartisan  legislation is the most comprehensive toxic exposure bill ever  considered for veterans.   My colleagues deserve a fair consideration of common sense and  reasonable amendments to improve this bill for our veterans. The House  of Representatives had six votes and adopted 27 amendments. Part of the  agreement between the chairman, Chairman Tester, and I was that  amendments would be considered for this legislation; and, specifically,  I have pushed for two amendments to be considered.   Given the magnitude and size of this legislation, there needs to be a  bipartisan process, and given the magnitude of the bipartisan support  of this legislation, there needs to be a bipartisan process on the  Senate floor; and I would ask the leadership of the Senate to make  certain that is the case.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
