 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, over the weekend, President Trump  launched a series of insults at Democratic congresswomen, suggesting  they ``go back'' to the countries they came from, despite the fact that  three of the four were born in the United States and that citizenship  in America, by birth or naturalization, is inherently equal and has  been for centuries.   These lawmakers are women of color. Telling them to ``go back'' to  their countries is one of the oldest and crudest tropes to malign  nonwhite Americans. The President's comments drip with racism.   We don't know why the President woke up on Saturday and made these  comments--perhaps to distract from his administration's barbaric  immigration policy, which rips children away from their parents, even  little children; perhaps to distract from the humanitarian crisis he  has exacerbated at our border and perhaps to detract from his planned  but not really executed deportation raids, which many in his own  bureaucracy do not want to carry out and feel are difficult to carry  out in a fair way because they can't be done fairly. Perhaps it is even  to distract from his administration's attempt to dismantle our  healthcare system through the courts. Maybe the President just feels  comfortable stoking racial divisions in this country. Maybe that is his  milieu. After all, this is part of a pattern of behavior that began  with the birther treatment of President Obama and his characterization  of Mexicans in his announcement speech, continued with his attack on an  American-born judge of Mexican descent, his proposed Muslim ban, his  response to Charlottesville, and includes comments about Caribbean and  African nations that cannot be repeated here on the floor of the  Senate.    Whatever the reason, whatever the motivation, the President's  comments demand condemnation from all corners of the political  spectrum--all corners. It has become frightfully common for many of my  Republican colleagues to let these moments sail by without saying even  a word.   Republican leadership especially rarely criticizes the President  directly, even in a situation like this that so clearly merits it. I am  left to wonder if the silence of many Republicans in the wake of  President Trump's xenophobic tweets is out of embarrassment or  agreement--embarrassment or agreement. Both are inexcusable.   Some of my Republican colleagues are hoping that the President  realizes the error of his ways and disavows or deletes his tweets from  yesterday. But the President just walked out of the White House a few  hours ago and doubled down on his racist comments.   My Republican friends, he is not backing off. Where are you when  something this serious, this bigoted, this un-American, happens? If you  are saying to yourselves ``Well, he got us our big tax cut; well, he's  taking regulations off big corporations; well, he pulled out of the  Paris Accords, so we have to go along with this racism,'' you are  making a deal with the devil. It is so wrong, so wrong.   The President of the United States is supposed to bring this country  together. It is clear this President will not, doesn't want to, and  revels in dividing us. No American President has done this. No American  President has resorted to open and bold-faced bigotry so often. His  goal--President Trump's goal--sadly is not to unite but to divide. That  is how he has climbed the ladder politically, and it is just awful.   It is incumbent on all of us, Democrat and Republican, to call him  out when he does this and remind the President and the country what  America truly stands for. Anything short of that is insufficient and is  un-American.   It could be argued that Republicans who fail to do so because of  shame, because they are afraid of offending the President's supporters,  because they are afraid of the President, or worse, because they agree  with the President--those who fail to condemn the President are fellow  travelers on the President's racist road, whatever their motivation.   Speaker Pelosi has said that the House will introduce a resolution  denouncing the President's comments. Our intention is to do the same in  the Senate. We will see how many Republicans will sign on.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, last Friday, in an  overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, I am happy to say that the House  reauthorized the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund and made it virtually  permanent.   I want to thank all of my colleagues in the House. Above all, I want  to commend the first responders for their advocacy and support of this  legislation. The first responders are the heroes of this story. They  are the Washingtons and the Madisons and the Monroes of the 21st  century, the great Americans--each in their own modest way. Not only  did they rush to the towers on that fateful day, risking their lives to  save others, but then, when the illnesses started coming upon them,  even though many of them were sick, they came to Washington and fought  tirelessly for their brothers and sisters who might get sick in the  future. Zadroga and Feal, Pfeiffer and Alvarez--these are the names of  American heroes. They represent the greatness of America. We should  honor them now by passing the House bill to reauthorize the Victim  Compensation Fund as soon as possible--no more delays, no strings  attached, no waiting for some other must-pass vehicle to attach it to.  The bill passed the House with such overwhelmingly bipartisan support  that it deserves a clean vote in the Senate.   I say to my friend, Republican Leader McConnell: If it is good enough  for Leader McCarthy and Whip Scalise, who voted for it, surely it is  good enough for the Republican leader in the Senate.   Only 12 voted against it. So many very conservative Republicans--many  tea party Republicans--voted for the bill in the House. That bill is  the bill that should be brought to the floor, brought here quickly. It  will pass overwhelmingly and could be on the President's desk,  certainly in the next week.   If Leader McConnell would put this bill on the floor this week, it  would pass this week. It would go to the President's desk this week. It  would be signed into law this week, and we could put this issue to rest  this week, once and for all.   We can't put the illnesses to rest. Those first responders, many of  whom have gotten ill, too many of whom have passed away, and many more  of whom have these illnesses in their bodies but they don't even know  it yet--they could then do their job of helping heal their fellow first  responders and helping heal themselves and looking after their  families. They wouldn't have to keep coming here.   We need to move this bill quickly. I urge Leader McConnell, once  again, to put the bill on the floor, honor those brave first responders  who are no different from our soldiers and our Armed Forces who rushed  to danger and risked their lives for us and our freedom. Put it on the  floor, and we can get this done. We can get it done this week.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
