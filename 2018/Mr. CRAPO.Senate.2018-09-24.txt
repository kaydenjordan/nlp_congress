 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize National POW/MIA  Day and honor the servicemembers who have not yet made it home. We can  never give up in bringing them home and getting answers for their loved  ones who await their return.   I commend those who work during this national recognition each  September and throughout the year to raise awareness about the  continued need to return our missing servicemembers. This includes  members of the POW*MIA Awareness Rally Corp. of Pocatello, ID, who hold  rallies and other events to keep a spotlight on the immense service of  our Nation's veterans.   Also, thank you to those who are working hard to bring all of our  servicemembers home. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, which is  the organization primarily responsible for coordinating and conducting  research and recovery efforts for POW and MIA soldiers, reports that  more  [[Page S6273]]  than 82,000 Americans remain missing from World War II, the Korean war,  the Vietnam war, the Cold War, the Gulf wars, and other conflicts. This  includes 355 remaining POW and MIA veterans from Idaho. So far this  month, the agency has reported accounting for 18 missing  servicemembers, most of whom were lost in the attack on Pearl Harbor.  This work of identifying and returning our servicemembers is no doubt  painstaking, but imperative. Until we account for all our missing and  bring each of these Americans home, wounds remain unhealed.   I pray that all of the families and friends of missing servicemembers  experience the long-awaited return of their loved ones. May all those  who serve our Nation feel how grateful we are for their security of the  blessings of our liberty. Let's bring them all home.                            ____________________
