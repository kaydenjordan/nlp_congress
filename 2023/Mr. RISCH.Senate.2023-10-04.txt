 Madam President, I rise today to acknowledge  MaryBeth Clare for her significant contributions to the Mountain Home  Air Force Base and Idaho's blind community through the AbilityOne  Program.   The AbilityOne Program, a partnership with the National Industries  for the Blind--NIB--and a network of agencies, give individuals who are  blind an opportunity for employment. Employment creates a sense of  purpose through hard work and independence. Every individual should  have the opportunity to feel this sense of fulfillment, regardless of a  disability.   MaryBeth Clare has been a familiar face at the AbilityOne Base Supply  Center at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Mountain Home, ID, for more  than 3 years. She does not let her loss of vision hinder her creativity  or innovation on the sales floor. MaryBeth has made notable efforts to  feature AbilityOne products in the store, increasing sales  significantly during her time on the base. MaryBeth's hard work has led  her to be named a NIB Winner of the 2023 Peter J. Salmon Direct Labor  Employee of the Year Award. This honor is well earned.   I commend MaryBeth for her hard work and service at the Mountain Home  Air Force Base. You make Idaho proud.                            ____________________
