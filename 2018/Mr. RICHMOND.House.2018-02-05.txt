 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for  yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, let me take a moment to congratulate the city of  Philadelphia, the great people of Pennsylvania, on winning the Super  Bowl last night. And I will just say, as we talk about economic  justice, one of the reasons why Philadelphia or the Eagles were able to  win the Super Bowl was not just because of their outstanding player  Malcolm Jenkins, which they all got from the New Orleans Saints, but  part of the reason why is because the rules are the same for everybody.  When the rules are the same for everybody, then you get rewarded for  your hard work, your dedication, your sacrifice, and all of those  things. Last night was the reward of the Eagles' hard work, dedication,  and sacrifice.    The problem with what we face in this country is that the rules are  not the same for everybody, which is why it takes an African American  to have a high school diploma and some college education to earn what a  White dropout makes. And, look, it is what it is. It is the rules we  find ourselves. But in a great nation such as this, you correct it so  that the playing field is even and that the rules are the same.   Some people are born on third base. They hit a single and think they  hit a home run and earned all of their success. So often in minority  communities, we go to the plate already with two strikes, and we are  expected to hit that same home run or that same single.   Well, this morning, as I prepared to say good-bye to my 3-year-old-- little Cedric--and drop him off at daycare and go to the airport so  that I could fly up here and do the people's work, I noticed that the  CBC was getting criticized for not standing when the President said  that African-American unemployment was at an all-time low. I am grown.  I accept what I do. To my colleague from Pennsylvania: No, I didn't  stand.   But for anyone who is listening--and I hope that the White House is-- why don't you just call me and ask me why I didn't stand?   Because I will tell you, and I don't care if it hurts some feelings,  ruffles some feathers, or send people in a little tizzy.   I didn't stand because we haven't done enough. I didn't stand because  Black unemployment has been going down since 2011 at a steady rate. The  decline this past year is less than the decline in other years.   But if I stood and applauded, it would make someone think that I was  happy. It would make someone think that he was doing a good job.   I also didn't stand because I just didn't believe the words that I  was hearing.   I also didn't stand because I could hear the words of my grandmother  in the back of my head saying: ``Baby, he means you no good.''   But part of the other reasons why I didn't stand was because, in a  country as great as this, I was sitting there that night--and I am a  Southern boy--and I was thinking about how cold it was outside while we  were in here listening to the State of the Union; and when the weather  gets really cold and it is snowing or it is raining and cold, I try to  bundle up so I can hurry up and get in my car, and then hurry up and  get in the office, and then hurry up and get in the house so that I  don't have to be exposed to the elements long.   Do you know what I realized?   That there are people in this great country who go to bed and wake up  [[Page H771]]  outside. We can't consider ourselves a great nation if that is true.   The other thing I realized is that there are mothers who go to work  every day and they bust their tails to provide for their kids, and at  the end of the week, they still don't have enough to make ends meet.  But she is working for a corporation whose profits are at an all-time  high, while her wages are at an all-time low. She is making the  corporation a profit, but she can't pay for the basic needs for her  family. You can't be a great country when that happens.   So what does she do?   Not to mention that she has to work two jobs to earn what a White  male makes. So she is working two jobs to make what a White male makes.  Then we criticize her for not educating her children. Well, she can't  help with homework. She is working her second job.   But in this country, we have to be better than that. So to stand and  give a State of the Union and just look at the unemployment rate really  means you are looking at it like a 3-year-old.   Part of our job as the CBC--the Congressional Black Caucus--is to  educate, which is why we did prepare this document.   And, look, White House, if it is too long, if it is too complicated,  if the words are too big, call me. I will send you the cliff notes  version. Lord knows I used them once or twice in school.   But I will tell you: If you want to know our solutions, it is on page  17. If you want to hear us talk about economic justice and how to  improve the economy, it is on page 31. If you want to know how to  improve education and the workforce and healthcare, those are pages 40,  43, and 49.   If you want to talk about rural America--because, as the CBC, I want  to make this crystal clear to the country: Yes, we are the  Congressional Black Caucus, but we work for the entire country. So when  we start talking about solutions, we are talking about solutions for  rural America, like investing in infrastructure, broadband, and all  those things, so rural people, both Black or White or any other race,  can succeed.   But what most of the country doesn't know is, yes, we have 48 members  of the Congressional Black Caucus; we represent 78 million people, but  only 17 million of those are African Americans. So we fight for the  entire country. So when we marched in the civil rights movement, and  when the CBC fought for a civil rights bill, and a voting rights bill,  they weren't just fighting for African Americans. First of all, they  were fighting to redeem this country's soul because it was so lost. We  find ourselves at a similar place in history where we are fighting to  redeem this country. We are here to help you save you from yourself  because in this country, with the wealth that we have, we should not  have the poverty.                                time  2015    I want to be clear about another thing. I applaud the fact that  people make a lot of money. Look, I think it is absolutely phenomenal.   There is a guy in California right now building a 100,000-square-foot  house for $500 million. God bless him, and God bless this country that  he is able to make that much money.   But you can't tell me that, in the same country where he is able to  do that, we can't take care of a hungry 3-year-old or a hungry 4-year- old or help that mother who is working two jobs to make ends meet. And  because she is getting subsidized rent, we have the nerve to call her  lazy?   No one in this body works two jobs. First of all, we are prohibited.  But we don't work two jobs, and there are too many families all across  this country where people are working two and three jobs.   You hear me talk about civil rights often, and you hear me talk about  Dr. King often--not only because he was one of the greatest leaders  ever in this country; not only because he went to Morehouse College,  the greatest institution in this country; but because his words had  meaning and, more importantly, his actions and his deeds were those  that changed this country.   So let's think, as April 4 we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of  his assassination in Memphis at the Lorraine Motel. What people don't  realize about Dr. King, he was down there fighting for sanitation  workers. He was fighting for people who woke up every day, got on the  back of a truck. We call them ``hoppers.'' They would hop on and hop  off the truck, put your trash in it, worked very hard, but they didn't  work with decent wages, decent work conditions, or anything else.   He was down there not fighting for chronic voters, not pandering to a  base, not trying to appeal to what is popular; he was down there  fighting for garbage men and garbage women so that they could work with  dignity and respect. That is what the CBC embodies.   So I am so glad that tonight the gentleman is leading this Special  Order Hour on economic justice. I know I went all over the place, but I  want people to understand.   First of all, I am not apologetic for not standing. Make me. Make me  stand. And I am not talking about in a physical sense. That is too  easy. All these sergeant-at-arms around here and all the security that  the President has, yeah, they can make me stand, but make me want to  stand.   See, that is what makes this country great. Anybody, any little  infant in this country can criticize. There are a whole bunch of people  who criticize. Oh, they won't stand for the Pledge of Allegiance or the  Star-Spangled Banner. What makes this country great is that they don't  have to if they want to protest.   But this country is so great, we should make people want to stand. We  should make those players feel not that they are sons of Bs, but that  they are contributing members of society and that we cherish every  community; that we are going to actually talk about police misconduct,  not just from the White House where we get--you are in the White House.  You get to beat up on the FBI, the CIA. You get to beat up on all law  enforcement, and nobody says a word. But if one little football player  says that police relations in my community are so bad that, no, I am  not going to talk about the FBI publicly, I am not going to criticize  them, I am just going to, in a very reverent way, take a knee to show  that I am not happy with police community relations in my community,  all of a sudden they are despicable people. But you can stand and sit  in the White House and tweet about the FBI, CIA, and everyone else, and  all of a sudden it is acceptable.   So, look, the rules should be the same for everybody. The solutions  we have in this book, like investing in the minority business  development agencies, those would make a real difference in the lives  of African Americans achieving better. But what did this budget do?  Propose to cut them out completely.   So we just have to be very cognizant of where we are, what we are  doing, and know that you have to have a plan. Economic injustice will  not cure itself because it wasn't created overnight.   I know I am probably way over the heads of all the people in the  White House, but we learn in physics that, if a ball is rolling  downhill, the only way you stop it from rolling downhill is to apply  equal or greater force in the opposite direction.   So if we know that discrimination and racism and injustice has been  involved in our economic system since the slaves built this hallowed  building, then we know that that discrimination and that inequality has  been rolling down the hill for centuries. So if it has been rolling  down the hill for centuries, then we need an equal or greater force to  meet it.   That is what this document is. It is saying, ``Mr. President,  implement these policies.'' That will be the equal or greater force to  meet that. All of a sudden, we have an equal playing field and we have  a chance to make this a more perfect Union, what we all strive for, so  that little Black boys and little Black girls can be judged by their  character, not by the color of their skin. That is what we strive for.  Too often, too many politicians forget it because they are pandering to  chronic voters and to a base.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, from  Philadelphia, who has on his green tie celebrating his Super Bowl  victory.    Mr. Speaker, I tell the gentleman from Pennsylvania,  how you describe the state of our Union depends on what ZIP Code you  live in in this country these days. There are ZIP Codes where the state  of our Union is great, where people are overjoyed that the stock market  was over 25,000, that they are bustling because of the economic  recovery that was started under President Obama. They are doing very  well, and they did very well as we ended the Great Recession.   But there are too many people in other ZIP Codes who still find  themselves without raises in the last 10 years, but the cost of gas,  the cost of milk, the cost of electricity, all those costs are going  up. All of your expenses are going up, but your salary is staying the  same. That does not make for a balanced balance sheet. That makes for a  deficit, which is why we talked about and challenged the tax cut that  we just did.   We just spent $1.4 trillion. Bernie Sanders' free college plan was  only $800 billion. We could have done his free college plan and still  had $600 billion left over to do infrastructure or something else,  because the best way out of poverty and the best way to do these things  is through investing in education.   So the state of our Union is divided, is fractured; for vulnerable  people, it is scary. They are anxious. For too many people, they are  angry.   We have pitched this whole idea in this country that if you are poor  and you are White, the only reason you are poor is because minorities  keep cutting the line and keep taking what should be yours. And to  perpetuate that doesn't help poor White people or poor Black people  because, at the end of the day, they are both poor, and we need to  realize that that is not what this country is about, and we need to  uplift both.   That is why I would say the state of our Union is in paralysis, and  we are paralyzed in a broke state. But it is our job, the Members of  this House, all 435, to figure out ways to come together to fix it. We  know we have very specific ideas. We know that they have very specific  ideas. They won the majority, and elections have consequences.   But if you want to talk to me in good faith about finding a solution,  then be open to hearing what you don't want to hear. I am open to not  getting everything I want because I know that we didn't win the House.   But this institution has to be better than that. I hope we can come  together at some point and realize that spending money on American  families is actually an investment that gives you a return, and it is  not just wasteful spending.    Well, first of all, I think they should take some  comfort and glean some hope from the fact that we are sitting here in  the House of Representatives talking about economic justice on this  Monday night because we are concerned about it and because we are  offering solutions to it.   Hopefully, some in the majority, maybe in the House, maybe in the  Senate, maybe in the White House, will extend a hand to say we are  interested in hearing your ideas; we will read your proposals; let's  see if we can find some middle ground.   This is not just about African Americans. This is about American  people. There are too many people in this country who are busting their  tails but can't make ends meet, and that, we have to take as a reality.    Corporations, the profits are at an all-time high; wages are at an  all-time low. We ought to have a better balance than that. I think that  they should take comfort in the fact that we are dedicated to working  on it, and I think that there is some sense of corporate responsibility  that will also level the playing field.    Not yet. Not yet is the short answer.   Let me say this, Representative Evans, as I close. You mentioned that  where we are from it is all about the Benjamins, which means the Ben  Franklins, the money dedicated to the resources.   Far too often--and I challenge a lot of the norms and customs and  sayings in our community that I think are harmful. One of the sayings  we used to hear a lot was, ``if it doesn't make dollars, it doesn't  makes sense,'' which means that, if it makes money, it makes sense.                                time  2030    But the true saying should be: if it only makes dollars, then it  doesn't make sense.   There has to be something else to it besides just corporations making  as much as they possibly can. There still has to be some sort of  community obligation that goes along with it to make the communities  you are in a little bit better, whether it is the schools; whether it  is the housing; whether it is the streets, the roads, the bridges, all  of those things.   So when you start talking about our infrastructure, the question  becomes: Are corporations paying their fair share? They benefit from  our labor, they benefit from our consumers, they benefit from a whole  bunch of things. But if it is only about the dollars for them, then  this country has lost its soul, which is why we are having this  conversation, because we have to save it from itself.   And it is not the first time this country has lost its soul. During  slavery, during Jim Crow, during segregation, there were many people  who woke up every day, went to church, prayed to the Lord, and then at  the end of the day went right back to perpetuate Jim  [[Page H773]]  Crow, segregation, slavery, racism, and all of those things. But it  takes brave people to stand up and call it for what it is.   If you don't diagnosis the problem, you will never find a cure for  it. So even in this House, we have people who claim to be the Christian  right or the religious right who will say and espouse very hateful and  racist things, all in the guise of religion.   But it is our duty as the CBC, and me as the chair, to remind people,  one, that we are better than that, and, two, we have done an awful lot  of despicable things in this country and blamed it on religion or  blamed it on the Lord and don't blame religion or the Lord for wicked  men. It is our obligation to make sure that we call it when we see it  and we continue to fight for the least of these. Because the least of  these can't afford lobbyists. They can't run commercials on TV  congratulating people. They can't run commercials on TV opposing  candidates. All they can do is continue to bust their tails every day  to try to put a roof over their head, food on their table, and all of  those things.
