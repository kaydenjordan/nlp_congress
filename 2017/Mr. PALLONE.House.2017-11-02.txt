 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member of the  Rules Committee.   I just want to express the tremendous frustration that I have and  that Democrats have in general with the way the Republican leadership  has handled the CHIP bill, IPAB, and community health centers, the  legislation we are considering today and tomorrow.   First of all, I need to point out that it was over a year ago when I  asked  [[Page H8407]]  leadership of our committee to try to come up with bipartisan  legislation with regard to community health centers and SCHIP, the  children's initiative, and all they wanted to do from January until  September--9 months--was repeal the Affordable Care Act.                                time  1330    That is all they were interested in. They didn't want to hear  anything about CHIP or community health centers, just repeal the  Affordable Care Act.   My colleagues on the other side suggested that somehow, because of  CHIP, they are very concerned about kids. Well, the fact of the matter  is, if you repeal the Affordable Care Act, children--everyone--and  community health centers would suffer such damage because they would  lose their health insurance or the underpinnings of the community  health centers, which have been financed with the Affordable Care Act,  that any suggestion that somehow because you are concerned now about  CHIP or community health centers is belied by the fact that you spent  the last 9 months, through September, trying to repeal the Affordable  Care Act. If you really cared about these things, then you would not  have sought that repeal.   Once that repeal seemed to be over in September, then the Republicans  on the committee and the leadership were willing to talk about CHIP and  community health centers. But mind you, the authorization for those two  programs ended September 30. So it was literally too late.   Now my colleagues on the other side say: Oh, well, we are bringing  this bill up today because we really care about kids and community  health centers.   Exactly the opposite. If you did care, in the sense that you wanted  to get legislation passed, then you wouldn't bring this bill up today.  We all know that if the bill is not bipartisan, which it is not, it  will never pass the Senate. What is going to happen is these bills will  pass on a partisan vote on Friday and, as a consequence, they will go  to the Senate and there will be no action and we will have to deal with  this at the end of the year as part of some larger omnibus spending  bill or whatever we do at the end of the year.   So anyone who tells you that the Republicans, in trying to pass a  partisan bill, are actually moving forward on CHIP or on community  health centers, that is simply not true.   Now, what are we facing here with these three bills? And I include  IPAB, CHIP, and community health centers. What we are really facing is  another effort on the part of the Republican leadership to repeal or  sabotage the Affordable Care Act.   All these things are part, in some fashion, of either pay-fors or  authorization of the Affordable Care Act. The fact of the matter is, we  are now seeing what I would call piecemeal repeal.   You couldn't repeal it outright, so you do a piecemeal repeal. You  repeal IPAB. You basically use funding from the Prevention Fund and you  gut that so you can pay for the CHIP funding. You change the grace  period so something like half a million people lose their health  insurance. Meanwhile, the President of the United States is out there  every day issuing executive orders to get rid of cost-sharing subsidies  to cut back on the outreach program.   If you look at all this, it is nothing more than a piecemeal repeal  of the Affordable Care Act. It is sabotaging the Affordable Care Act.   This has not changed. The first 9 months to September, outright  repeal. Now, between now and the end of the year, piecemeal repeal.  Every day, a different bill.   The real inconsistency, which is the best I can say about what is  going on, is to say that we have to come up with offsets to pay for the  Children's Health Initiative Program and the community health centers,  but we don't have to do it for IPAB. $17.5 million is what it is going  to cost, according to the CBO, to repeal IPAB. If you use that money,  it would almost pay for the CHIP and the community health centers bill  that will be considered the next day.   So, again, we have this total inconsistency suggesting that somehow  we care about one thing. What is really go on is robbing Peter to pay  Paul. The way that you pay for the community health centers and the  CHIP bill, basically, sabotaging the Affordable Care Act, is you  shorten the grace period from 90 days to 30 days, when people, if they  don't pay their premium, will lose their health insurance. We know that  maybe almost 688,000 people, according to the CBO, will lose their  health insurance.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Foxx). The time of the gentleman has  expired.    Then you have the Prevention Fund, which is used for  children's lead poisoning programs, children's vaccines, and for the  opioid program that the Republicans say they care so much about. These  are going to go away in order to pay for CHIP and community health  centers.   What is going on here is unbelievable. I just say to my colleagues:  look at what is actually happening. We had a Democratic substitute and  the Rules Committee wouldn't even let us consider it.   So it is not just the underlying issue of what is actually happening  here in terms of the substance of the bills. It is also the process  that is being used. That is why I am glad I am talking during the Rules  Committee time.   We had a Democratic substitute that would have had a great piece of  legislation that paid for the community health centers, paid for CHIP,  without sacrificing other healthcare programs that help kids and other  Americans. They wouldn't even let us consider it here today.   So I say to my colleagues: basically, vote ``no'' on the rule. Turn  down this rule and let us have another opportunity to actually do  something that is important and that is meaningful.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 849, the IPAB repeal.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans have spent the last 9 months trying to  repeal the Affordable Care Act and they have failed, but instead of  working with Democrats to improve the ACA, they will stop at nothing to  repeal the law piece by piece.   The Republicans' partisan bill to reauthorize CHIP, community health  centers, and other public health extenders is paid for on the back of  Medicaid recipients, Medicare, low- and middle-income families with the  Affordable Care Act health coverage, and the Prevention Fund, but yet  they will not bother to pay for the $17.5 billion it will cost to  repeal IPAB.   IPAB was enacted as a backstop to the other cost-saving and quality- improvement efforts in the ACA, such as accountable care organizations,  patient-centered care models like Medical Homes, programs that pay for  quality, not quantity and value-based purchasing.   Because of the Affordable Care Act and these programs, Medicare  spending growth has slowed and Medicare solvency has been extended.   According to the CMS actuary, IPAB will not be triggered until 2021,  so the  [[Page H8418]]  timing of today's repeal is premature and politically motivated.   IPAB repeal would increase the deficit by $17.5 billion. This is  fiscally irresponsible of Republicans, especially as they prepare to  announce a tax package that will saddle our country with $1.5 trillion  of debt in order to give tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations.   IPAB repeal is not about helping seniors. Don't let the Republicans  kid you. Contrary to what the Republicans say, IPAB is prohibited from  sending recommendations to Congress that would harm seniors by  increasing their out-of-pocket costs or cutting their benefits. In  fact, it is the Republican ACA repeal efforts that would cut nearly a  trillion dollars from Medicaid and Medicare, harming seniors and other  vulnerable Americans, which would have truly led to the rationing of  healthcare.    So for all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R.  849, the IPAB repeal.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch), a member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Vermont.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Vermont.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 5\1/2\  minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Kentucky has 8\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I can't help but put what is happening today in terms of  the Republicans putting up this bill on the IPAB and what is happening  tomorrow with the Republicans putting up a CHIP and community health  centers bill but point out that collectively what they are trying to do  is what they were not able to do in the first 9 months of this session  when they sought very hard and pushed very hard to repeal the  Affordable Care Act.   What is going on here today and tomorrow with the IPAB and community  health centers and CHIP is essentially an effort to repeal the  Affordable Care Act piece by piece, in my opinion.   What do we do?   We see the IPAB, which is part of the Affordable Care Act. We see the  pay-fors for community health centers and the CHIP tomorrow, taking  away money from the Prevention Fund from the Affordable Care Act,  limiting the grace period when people will lose their insurance that  they have under the Affordable Care Act.   This goes along also with what is happening with the President as  well. The President has, in the last month or so, said that he is not  going to pay the cost-sharing subsidies. He has cut back on the  outreach so that people don't know what is in the Affordable Care Act.  He has cut back on the period when people can sign up and get their  insurance in half.   What we are seeing, in my opinion, is the Republicans sabotaging the  Affordable Care Act. They couldn't repeal it, so now they are doing  whatever they can to sabotage it. It is really ironic or inconsistent,  however you want to put it. On the one hand they are insisting that  when it comes to kids and community health centers, which is a group of  people you would think they would be most concerned about, they insist  on paying for it by taking money from other healthcare programs. We are  asked to take money from the Prevention Fund, which pays for vaccines  for children, which pays for the children's lead poisoning program,  which is a major part of our opiate prevention program. This is the  money that comes from the Prevention Fund. Basically, they are taking  that money and using it to pay for the community health centers and the  Children's Health Initiative, which means that that money is lost. That  money is lost for those other purposes.   With regard to the grace period, they are saying, well, if you fail  to pay your insurance, it used to be 90 days before you lost it. Now it  would be 30 days before you lost it, which means that you end up with  about 500,000 or 600,000 people who have insurance now under the  Affordable Care Act that would lose it, according to the CBO.   Yet, at the same time, with the IPAB repeal, which we are considering  now, which costs $17.5 billion, and which, as my colleague from Vermont  said, is a mechanism to try to save costs, they are saying: Well, we  don't have to pay for that. We can just repeal it. We will forego those  additional costs, which become part of the deficit.   Mr. Speaker, for all these reasons, the bottom line is, what the  Republicans are doing is not fair. It is not fair to the kids. It is  not fair to the people who are going to lose their health insurance.   I will say as the last thing that this is going nowhere. One of the  reasons why Democrats have been urging the Republicans with regard to  the CHIP and community health centers to work with us on a bipartisan  basis is because we know if this bill passes today on a partisan vote,  because we can't support it for the reasons I explained, then that  means that it is going to go to the Senate and it is going to die  because there is no reason to believe that the Senate is going to take  up this partisan bill.   I think it is just a huge mistake on the part of Republicans.  Basically, what they are signaling today is that they don't really care  about this. They wanted to stick around until the end of year, which  means the community health centers and CHIP just basically wither on  the vine for lack of funds. That is not fair. It is not fair to the  kids. It is not fair to those who use community health centers.   Mr. Speaker, for all these reasons, I would urge a ``no'' vote on the  bill today, the IPAB repeal; and I will also ask for a ``no'' vote  tomorrow on the CHIP and the community health centers legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
