 Mr. Speaker, more than 3,000 soldiers with the Army's  1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, are headed home  to Fort Riley in my district this month after a 9-month deployment in  South Korea.   Also known as the ``Devil Brigade,'' these soldiers have been  stationed in South Korea since October of last year. During their  deployment, these American soldiers have trained closely with their  South Korean partners, deterring North Korean hostility and providing  security in the Korean Peninsula. This service is invaluable.   These soldiers and families sacrificed greatly during their  deployment. As the Devil Brigade begins to journey back home to Fort  Riley, may I be the first to thank them for their service and say  ``Welcome Home.''
