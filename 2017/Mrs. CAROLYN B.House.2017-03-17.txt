 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I join with  millions around the globe to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. The United  States of America would not be the country we are today without the  enormous contributions of millions of Irish immigrants and their  descendants.   From serving in every war our country has ever faced and leading our  country at every level of government, Irish Americans have done it all.  Today, more than 33 million Irish Americans claim Irish ancestry.   Tragically, our country didn't always welcome the Irish. During the  late 19th and 20th centuries, Irish arriving on our shores were met  with contempt, disdain, and with signs that read, ``Irish need not  apply.'' But they persisted, and our country is all the better for it.   So, today, St. Patrick's Day, I thank you and say thank you to all  the Irish men and women who helped shape the great country we are  today.   Thank you, and happy St. Patrick's Day.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York (for herself,               Mrs. Dingell, Ms. Jenkins of Kansas, and Mr. Beyer):        H.R. 1611.
