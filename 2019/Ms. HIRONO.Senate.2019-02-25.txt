 Mr. President, I would like to first thank Senator Murray  for her steadfast leadership in the fight to protect women's healthcare  and for arranging this time for us to speak this afternoon.   The legislation we are debating today is just the latest salvo in the  far-right wing assault on a woman's constitutionally protected right to  an abortion.   With all due respect to my colleague from Nebraska who introduced  this legislation, this bill is a solution in search of a problem.  Contrary to what the proponents of this bill argue, it is and has  always been a crime to harm or kill newborn babies. People guilty of  this crime can already be charged and prosecuted to the full extent of  the law.   Let's be clear. The Senate isn't debating this legislation today  because there is an epidemic of infanticide in this country. There is  not one. There isn't one. I can hardly say it because it is really not  happening; therefore, this bill is a solution in search of a problem.  Instead, we are indulging the majority's use of a false premise to  inflame the public, shame women, and intimidate healthcare providers.   When you strip away the ultraconservative rhetoric, you are left with  a very simple argument from supporters of this legislation--that the  moral judgment of rightwing politicians in Washington, DC, should  supersede a medical professional's judgment and a woman's decision.  Conservative politicians should not be telling doctors how they should  care for their patients. Instead, women, in consultation with their  families and doctors, are in the best position to determine their best  course of care.   In talking to healthcare providers in Hawaii, I have heard how this  legislation and other bills like it in States across the country could  force them to provide care that is unnecessary or even harmful to  patients. The Hawaii Section of the College of Obstetricians and  Gynecologists made this point persuasively in testimony recently  submitted to our State legislature's house committee on health earlier  this month. In opposing similar so-called born-alive abortion  legislation heard in Hawaii's State Legislature--which didn't make it  out of committee, by the way--the group of doctors wrote:         We are physicians who provide compassionate, evidence-based       care. By criminalizing healthcare providers, this law may       actually reduce the number of healthcare providers (not just       the surgeons, but anesthesiologists, nurses, midwives, office       staff) willing to provide this care. But again, that is the       actual intent of this bill. Reducing access to safe abortion       care would threaten the health of women in Hawaii.        We are the physicians who care for patients when they find       out their very wanted, very loved baby has severe fetal       anomalies. Families sometimes choose to end the pregnancy and       provide their baby with palliative care rather than subject       their baby to any suffering or futile efforts at       resuscitation. These families face very difficult decisions       about what their values are and what is best for their       family; decisions that none of us has a right to make for       them or judge them for. What they need in these moments is       compassion and medically accurate information from healthcare       providers free of judgment or politics.    I couldn't agree more, and that is why I urge my colleagues to oppose  this legislation.   In just a few minutes, I expect the Senate will defeat this bill  because it will fail to win the required 60 votes. Nevertheless, the  threat to women's reproductive rights is intensifying in States and  courtrooms all across the country. Over the past few years, States have  enacted hundreds--hundreds--of laws that harm women's health and  violate their constitutional right to an abortion.   Mississippi enacted a prohibition on abortion after 15 weeks of  pregnancy.   Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Ohio have passed laws banning  dilation and evacuation--D&E--an abortion procedure used usually during  the second trimester.   Indiana enacted a bevy of new abortion restrictions, including a law  requiring every woman seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound--talk  about invasive--and mandated she wait 18 hours after the ultrasound to  have an abortion.   Louisiana passed legislation requiring abortion providers to have  admitting privileges at local hospitals. This law would result in only  one abortion provider in a State of 4.7 million people.   Advocates have recognized the harm these laws would have on women and  [[Page S1419]]  have filed suits to block their implementation. Several lower courts  have ruled these restrictions unconstitutional, and the cases are  moving steadily through the courts of appeals en route to the Supreme  Court.   The Fifth Circuit, for example, will hear an appeal of a lower  court's decision to block Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban, as well  as an appeal from Texas to allow its ban on D&E procedures to go into  effect.   The Seventh Circuit upheld a lower court ruling striking down parts  of Indiana's mandatory ultrasound and waiting period law. The Indiana  attorney general has requested the Supreme Court to review this case.   The Supreme Court temporarily stopped Louisiana's so-called admitting  privileges law from taking effect on a 5-to-4 vote. This is the law I  talked about before. This law would result in one abortion provider in  a State of 4.7 million people.   The Fifth Circuit will now hear an appeal on the merits of the law,  which is virtually identical to a Texas law the Supreme Court struck  down in 2016--that was only a few short years ago--in the landmark  Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt decision.   The stakes in these court battles and the more than 20 other  abortion-related cases making their way through the Federal court are  incredibly high. Any one of them would provide the opening for the U.S.  Supreme Court to finally fulfill the rightwing goal of overturning Roe  v. Wade.   It is with this central goal in mind that Donald Trump, Majority  Leader McConnell, and complicit Republicans of Congress have been  working to pack our Federal courts with ideologically driven judges  groomed and handpicked by ultraconservative organizations like the  Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation.   Donald Trump has already confirmed 85 judges, including 30 to circuit  courts and 2 to the U.S. Supreme Court. These judges comprise one-tenth  of the Federal judiciary, with many more to come.   In fact, a few weeks ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 42-- 42--judicial nominees out of committee in one markup. Those 42 comprise  an additional 5 percent of the Federal judiciary.   Less than 2 weeks ago, Justice Kavanaugh issued a strong dissent in  the earlier mentioned Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision to block  Louisiana's anti-choice law from taking effect. Using tortured  reasoning, Justice Kavanaugh essentially argued that the Supreme Court  should disregard its own precedent from only 2 years ago--that is the  Whole Women's case I referred to--to allow the Louisiana law to take  effect. His dissent signaled his strong antipathy to a woman's right to  choose, just as his dissent in Garza v. Hargan did when he was on the  DC Circuit. His dissent as a Justice this time demonstrated the  emptiness of his promises to uphold Supreme Court precedent during his  confirmation hearing.   Justice Kavanaugh's promises then to follow precedent is like that of  other Federalist Society-picked Trump nominees now packing our courts,  offering little reassurance that nominees in fact will set aside their  strongly held ideological views to be objective and fair as judges.   Another case likely to make its way through Federal courts in the  months and years ahead is a challenge to the Trump administration's new  gag rule. This rule prohibits doctors and other clinicians  participating in title X family planning programs from referring  patients for, or even speaking about, abortions, even if their patients  request such information.   Nearly 20,000 Hawaii residents receive reproductive healthcare  through title X. That is roughly the population of the city of Kapolei  on Oahu. This attack on title X-funded agencies like Planned Parenthood  is an end-run around Congress after Republicans have tried and failed  dozens of times to end funding for Planned Parenthood.   Planned Parenthood provides healthcare for millions--millions--of  low-income women, men, and young people under title X. Why then do  Republicans persist in trying to cut funding for Planned Parenthood?   The constitutional rights of millions of women across the country are  under serious and sustained attack, but even in these not normal times,  I do see some hope. As State after State passes laws to limit access  for a woman's right to choose, communities like Hawaii's are coming  together to protect such access.   Last week, I joined activists and staff from Planned Parenthood of  the Great Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands as they opened their new  medical center and administrative hub in downtown Honolulu. I was  particularly energized to see how many young people, women and men,  were there and engaged in the fight to protect our right to choice.   I have learned over the years that battles we fought so hard to win  never stay won. It is up to all of us to stay engaged and keep fighting  for our constitutionally protected rights.   I yield the floor.
