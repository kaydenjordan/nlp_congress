 Madam Speaker, I oppose H.R. 6538. Frankly, this bill is  unnecessary. Nothing prevents the States today from creating an alert  system for active shooter incidents. Every State has the capacity to  implement a warning system if they choose to.   In fact, in 2020, the GAO said there are more than 1,400 systems  already in place throughout the country that make this available. We  passed here, just 4 or 5 years ago, the Ashlynne Mike AMBER Alert in  Indian Country Act. That cleared up a lot of holes throughout the  country on these emergency alert systems. This really is duplicative,  and is, quite frankly, not necessary.   Contrary to the belief of many Members of this body, the solution to  every issue is not a Federal program. We should allow States, who have  the ability, to create systems for providing emergency notifications  for their citizens in a manner that is best for them.   What this does is by putting a Federal coordinator over there, it  actually lays in place the infrastructure for a soon-to-be-mandated  system that the States will have to fund, but it will be mandated by  the Federal Government. That is my prognostication here because that is  what always happens.   DOJ can already issue best practices and guidance related to public  safety alerts. So what is this? This is a bill designed to feel good.  This is a visceral bill, an emotional bill. This is not a bill designed  to make us safer, make Americans safer. We already have those  mechanisms and means in place.   We have spent a lot of time going over bills introduced by my  colleagues across the aisle regarding gun violence. Very few of them  are going to provide any kind of help and assistance. There are bills  that we have introduced that will not get a hearing that I believe will  actually provide help and safety for the American people.   This bill, however, by creating this Federal alert system--and it is  not a Federal alert system, but it will evolve into that--is to remind  us always that gun violence exists all around us, and it is to  basically prejudice people against lawful gun owners.   One of the best things you can have, regardless of what my colleagues  across the aisle say, is a trained good guy with a gun.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment attempts to create a problem where none  exists by requiring investigations into law enforcement and the armed  services for alleged rampant white supremacist or white nationalist  sympathies.   Proponents suggest that there are instances in which members of the  armed services have shown sympathies toward white supremacist or white  nationalist groups. However, as these same proponents know all too  well, the various branches of the military have addressed the Democrat- offered examples of extremism.   This amendment denigrates our men and women in the service. It is  Orwellian in nature.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in fact, every member of the military who showed an  interest or actual participation in a white supremacist or white  nationalist group has faced discipline. The relevant branch either  demoted the individual, discharged them, or otherwise disciplined the  sympathizer.   Further, the armed services have taken steps to address these  concerns going all the way back to the 1980s.   At a time when it is difficult to recruit military and law  enforcement, Democrats should not be maligning their integrity by  implying they are overrun with white supremacists and neo-Nazis. In  fact, we have recently lost tens of thousands forced out of military  service due to the vaccine mandate. We are way below in our recruiting  levels.   This type of malignancy, this type of imputation of bad conduct in a  generic form, in a generalized form because that is what this amendment  does, actually will make it harder to recruit.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the defeat of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, when you begin to study in a broad basis, very broad  implications take place. The urging that an analysis be done regarding  white supremacist and neo-Nazi activity in our uniformed services and  Federal law enforcement agencies imputes and implies that it is present  in a widespread fashion. That then denigrates those offices.   If we are going to say we think that they are the best that this  country has to offer, let's treat them like they are the best this  country has to offer. When there have been problems, these services  have addressed it. We don't need this superfluous, denigrating study.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, taking cues from President Biden and Attorney General  Garland, this amendment is just another attempt by Democrats to  shamelessly politicize domestic terrorism.   In a memorandum dated October 4, 2021, Attorney General Garland  directed the FBI and all U.S. Attorneys' Offices to address the  ``disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of  violence'' at school board meetings.   Although the Attorney General's memorandum did not specifically  mention ``domestic terrorism,'' the Justice Department's press release  accompanying the memorandum noted involvement of the National Security  Division.   A whistleblower alerted the Judiciary Committee that the FBI's  Counterterrorism Division has been responsible for implementing the  Attorney General's directive and that the FBI had created a unique  ``threat tag'' to track investigations against parents.   We know from other whistleblowers that the FBI has opened dozens of  investigations into parents as a result of Attorney General Garland's  memorandum, including one into a mother who was merely part of a group  called ``Moms for Liberty.''   The Attorney General's memorandum was the product of a letter from  the National School Board Association to President Biden. That letter  triggered the Attorney General's memorandum which equated parents with  domestic terrorists and urged the Biden administration to use Federal  authorities, including the PATRIOT Act, to target parents who happen to  show up at school boards. That is how loosy-goosey the term ``domestic  terrorism'' is. It is not defined anywhere. It is fluid.   We know from publicly available information that the Biden White  House knew the NSBA would encourage the use of the PATRIOT Act and  never pushed back. Instead, President Biden called up the head of the  NSBA and invited her to the Oval Office. That is just one reason to  oppose this amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I am ready to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   The Justice Department is not alone in abusing domestic terrorism  powers. On February 7, 2022, the DHS issued a National Terrorism  Advisory Bulletin warning that the United States remains in heightened  threat and citing so-called ``mis-, dis-, and mal-information'' as a  source of the increased threat environment.   Does that sound like they have got that nailed down in how it is  defined?   According to DHS, the purpose of allegedly misleading narratives and  conspiracy theories is to increase societal friction and undermine  public trust in governmental institutions. It cited two examples:  ``Online proliferation of false or misleading narratives regarding  unsubstantiated widespread election fraud and COVID-19.'' That used to  be called free speech.   Although DHS has admitted that ``conditions underlying the heightened  threat landscape have not significantly changed over the last year,''  it cited ``the proliferation of false or misleading narratives, which  sow discord or undermine public trust in U.S. Government institutions''  as one factor for why the threat environment remains elevated.   The bulletin itself is further evidence of how the Biden  administration has used existing counterterrorism resources as a tool  to target and silence citizens who disagree with government actions. If  you have a heterodox point of view from the Biden left-stream  orthodoxy, they consider you a domestic terrorist. We should not be  further enabling these actions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on my  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the first thing is, I am baffled that this is even  germane to the National Defense Authorization Act. Really.   I am not saying that the Survivors' Bill of Rights Act isn't good. It  passed unanimously. But this amendment bribes States to enact the  rights afforded in that Survivors' Bill of Rights Act.   When I was the president of the Arizona Senate, we didn't get Federal  dollars when we went back and found a way to fund giving rape kits and  making sure that we went back and started testing all of the old rape  kits so we could start going after the bad guys.   This Survivors' Bill of Rights passed unanimously in 2016, but it is  not a controversial concept, not at all. The concept is that States  should do this. I mean, seriously.   I know you think it is really funny, that is good for you. Laugh  away. But I am telling you right now, this has nothing to do with the  National Defense Authorization Act.   States do this on their own when they have leadership in those  States.  [[Page H6455]]  This isn't something you blow Federal dollars on. This isn't something  you necessarily need to do that for because States will do it, and many  States are doing it. I know my own State is doing it and has been doing  it for 8 years now.                                time  0020    This has nothing to do with military readiness, has nothing to do  with what this bill is supposed to be doing.   Again, I find myself saying: How does this even sit germane to the  underlying bill?   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is my understanding that the Rules Committee waived that issue,  not the parliamentarian, on germaneness. So that is not really a  qualified argument; that is not a legitimate argument.   But if we talk about the substance of this, there are States that  have taken the action that you are wanting to take. Maybe that is where  you should take the fight, instead of wedging it into the National  Defense Authorization Act. The National Defense Authorization Act is  meant to fund the military for readiness to defend this country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I oppose this amendment. It doesn't have  anything to do with the National Defense Authorization Act. I encourage  everyone to vote ``no'' on it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, no one in this body believes that the United  States military should be engaged in carrying out domestic policy on  United States soil. We already have laws that prohibit that.   This amendment, however, would prohibit evidence obtained by the  military in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act from being used in  court or other legal proceedings.   This bill hasn't been to a committee this year. Last year, it was  debated on the floor. This amendment stems from legislation that  Representative Schiff introduced in response to rumors that President  Trump was considering sending in the military to help quell the  violence in Democrat-run cities during the summer of 2020. The military  was never sent in, so this amendment is basically a solution in search  of a problem.  [[Page H6461]]    The implications of this amendment are also unclear. We currently  have a crisis on our southern border, a crisis that Democrats continue  to ignore and is continually getting worse. We literally have about  8,000 to 10,000 people a day being encountered on the border, and then  another 1,000 or more a day who are actually getting into the country  as gotaways.   Some have suggested that the military could be sent down there to  help stop this invasion. The question is, though, what happens if the  situation at the southwest border becomes even more dire and, indeed,  members of the military are sent in to help, and while helping and  providing support, they obtain evidence of trafficking or smuggling,  human trafficking, drug trafficking, et cetera? Will that evidence be  excluded?   This is an issue that needs to go through regular order where the  committees of jurisdiction can hold hearings and fully explore all  possible consequences. That hasn't happened here.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I find it interesting. Nobody on this side  mentioned evidence adduced from unlawful activities should be admitted.  Those are words, as so often happens with my colleague, that are being  imputed.   No. No. I specifically said legal activity. I specifically said if  the military is sent down to the border to help. There was no  imputation that that would be illegal conduct. What I said was that  they obtained evidence of trafficking or smuggling while serving down  on the Southwest border.   Now, if that is legal conduct, and they encountered evidence of  trafficking or smuggling, my query was, should that not be used, should  that not be permitted as evidence, and the reality of it is, it should  be used for evidence.   When we talk about law, for instance, criminal law, if a police  officer engages in criminal conduct to obtain evidence, that evidence  is suppressed, including additional evidence which is considered the  fruit of the poisonous tree.   The question here, and the reason that I said this needs to go back  for regular order, is what do you do when you are involved in legal  conduct, and you happen upon evidence of smuggling or trafficking? That  is the real issue here.    The gentleman has already yielded his time and now wishes  to take my time to explain.   The reality is he knows. This bill, or his amendment needs to go back  for regular order for additional debate to determine all the  consequences so when legal conduct produces or adduces evidence of  smuggling or trafficking.   That is why I oppose this amendment. I urge my colleagues to do the  same, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
