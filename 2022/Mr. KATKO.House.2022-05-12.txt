 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 903, the  Rights for the TSA Workforce Act of 2022.   Let me be clear: I strongly and emphatically support increasing  funding for the frontline TSA workforce. I strongly support funding for  them. They have been severely underpaid for far too long.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, there is a blue-ribbon panel that came out,  that my colleague referenced, that recommended against moving them to  the title 5 workforce. That blue-ribbon panel, to correct the Record,  included the chief human capital officer for the Department of Homeland  Security under former President Obama. One of the top men at the  Department of Homeland Security for President Obama was part of a blue- ribbon panel that recommended against that.  [[Page H4884]]    Even with that recommendation, I am so sick and tired of these  frontline workers not getting their proper pay that I was willing to  move title 5 funding for them. This bill doesn't do that. This bill  goes far beyond that.   Bureaucrats that are sitting in offices nowhere near the front lines,  that are not exposed to COVID on a daily basis, that aren't fishing  live, loaded guns out of handbags, and subject to all kinds of abuse by  the traveling public, are going to get title 5 status, and they get  paid a hell of a lot more.   Why? Why do we need that? That is a question, and that is a problem I  have with this bill.   The men and women protecting America's transportation systems every  day deserve to be compensated fairly for the critical security mission  they fulfill.   Unfortunately, despite robust efforts to improve this legislation in  markup, and limited to the terms I articulated, my fellow committee  members and I on the Republican side were not granted the adoption of a  single proposed amendment.   Among the improvements we suggested were quite simply an amendment to  limit the scope of the bill exclusively to the frontline TSA workforce,  the men and women who really need better pay, rather than already high- paid TSA headquarter personnel.   I am telling you on the record today, if the bill was limited to just  them, I would support it. Why do we have to make it for everyone else?  60,000 people. Why? It makes no sense.   Our proposed amendments also sought to grant increased pay directly  to the front line, without the need for cumbersome and costly  bureaucratic conversion to title 5.   Uncharacteristically, the message from the majority was clear: Take  it or leave it. That is very uncharacteristic, because the chairman and  I enjoy a very good working relationship. For that reason, though, I am  unable to support the legislation in its current form.   With that said, however, I do hope to work in a bipartisan manner to  secure much-needed funding increases for TSA in order to lift pay and  benefits for the frontline screener workforce as well as procure  cutting-edge technologies to address evolving threats to aviation  security.   I am pleased to see dedicated funding for significant screener pay  increases in this year's budget request to Congress. I stand ready to  work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to engage our  colleagues on the House Appropriations Committee in an effort to secure  funding for transportation security officer pay.   I include in the Record a letter to our friends and colleagues on the  Appropriations Committee outlining just that.                                  Congress of the United States,                                       Washington, DC, May 12, 2022.      Hon. Lucille Roybal-Allard,      Chair, Subcommittee on Homeland Security, Committee on           Appropriations, Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Fleischmann,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Homeland Security, Committee           on Appropriations, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Roybal-Allard and Ranking Member Fleischmann:       Thank you for your continued work to support the mission of       the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and protect our       Nation from a litany of evolving threats. As the House       considers H.R. 903, the Rights for the TSA Workforce Act of       2022, I wanted to follow up on my previous letter dated April       28, 2022, related to homeland security funding priorities.        The FY23 President's Budget requests funding for increased       pay for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)       front-line workforce. As I've said many times during my years       in Congress, TSA has not paid these dedicated employees a       salary that is commensurate to the security they're providing       to the traveling public.        Additionally, I have long raised concerns that TSA has not       fully utilized the flexibility that Congress provided in the       Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA, Public Law       107-71). The bipartisan Blue-Ribbon Panel on Human Capital       Service Delivery found that the TSA Administrator currently       has the flexibility under ATSA to pay employees more than he       could if the agency was moved to title 5, U.S. Code. This is       an issue of funding, not authority.        The cost to the taxpayer of funding a major overhaul of       TSA's entire personnel system, converting the agency to the       General Schedule, and hiring hundreds of new employees to       manage and negotiate these changes is far greater than the       cost of simply giving the frontline workforce a well-deserved       pay increase. As it currently stands, H.R. 903 creates a       massive and unfunded mandate that could jeopardize other       homeland security priorities such as border security and       cybersecurity if enacted as written.        I encourage you to consider including funding in the FY23       Homeland Security Appropriations Bill to increase the pay of       the TSA front-line workforce. TSA plays a fundamental role in       protecting the traveling public and facilitating the safe       flow of commerce throughout the country.        Thank you for your time and consideration of this request.            Sincerely,                                                        John Katko,                                                Member of Congress.     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, the vice  ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, Representative  Guest, for his leadership on this issue.   I also thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for  engaging in conversations, even when we disagree on policy. But here I  really feel that the bill in its current form will go over to the  Senate, and it will be dead on arrival. That serves nobody. No one wins  in that, and certainly the frontline workers don't win.   If we could get a more bipartisan bill, with a lot more of us that  want to be on this and want to help the frontline workers, I think we  would have a better product and we could put more pressure on the  Senate to do their job.
