 Madam President, every once in a while, life gives  you a wonderful coincidence. The wonderful coincidence this evening is  that I have had the pleasure of listening to Senator Sanders describe  what happens to a country when billionaires are able to secretly exert  immense political power and drive democracy away from its foundations  and into the service of the billionaires.   The remarks I am here to give are about how they do it--the technique  for infiltration and influence of our democracy by the billionaires.  This is part of my series of ``Scheme'' speeches, which is about how  they have taken over the Supreme Court--captured it--in the same way  that, in the 1800s, big railroads captured the railroad commissions  that were supposed to set their rates. They just had their people set  the rules for them, and it worked great. We are seeing this with the  Supreme Court right now. This is not a conservative Supreme Court. This  is a captive Supreme Court--captive to special interests--and the  technique that they use for getting there is to hide who they are  through an array of front groups.   There are dozens of front groups that were involved in the Court- capture scheme. The Washington Post did a very good review of them  several years ago and calculated, based on information they could get  at the time, that this was a quarter-billion-dollar project--$250  million. Well, the research continued, and folks kept digging. When I  held a hearing about this in my Judiciary court subcommittee, the  number had climbed to $400 million spent on the Court-capture  enterprise. They have kept digging and kept digging, and now it turns  out the number is over $580 million. Over a half a billion dollars was  spent in this effort to capture and control the U.S. Supreme Court.   I don't think you spend over $580 million unless you have a purpose,  and very often, the purpose is to make that much money back and more.  There is a web of front groups that are used to deploy all of that  money, and this is just a part of that web. This is just one sort of  combined creature in that web. So let me take a few minutes and just go  through the different organs and limbs of this creature.    The center of it is a pair of organizations, the 85 Fund and the  Concord Fund. The way that extremely wealthy people play in politics  these days is to put two organizations together that they establish  under the Tax Code. One is called a 501(c)(3), which is named after the  section of the Tax Code under which it is established. The 501(c)(3)  gives you two wonderful things if you are fiddling in politics. One, it  gives us anonymity, wherein you don't have to disclose your donors;  and, two, it gives you a tax deduction. You get to write off the money  that you give to manipulate the American public. But you can't do  something very important with a 501(c)(3): You can't go out and  manipulate public opinion. You can't participate in elections. So, when  you do that, you need to have something else called a 501(c)(4), the  very next provision in the IRS Code. So you take your 501(c)(3), and  you take your 501(c)(4), and you set them both up.   In my view, there is usually no real distinction between the two.  There is a doctrine in law called piercing the corporate veil that  separates separate corporate entities, that allows people who are  trying to pursue usually damages to show that this is a fake corporate  division. You pierce the corporate veil. The 501(c)(3)s and 501(c)(4)s  are a corporate veil that you could probably pierce with a banana. They  have the same locations; they have the same mailing addresses; they  have the same staff; they have the same board members; they have the  same funders. It is essentially the same organization, but it just  operates under two legal structures.   So that is what you have for starters. You have got your twinned  front groups. The 85 Fund is your 501(c)(3), and the Concord Fund is  your 501(c)(4). They are essentially the same creature, but in this  case, this organism has other limbs. So what you can do under Virginia  corporate law is, if you are the 85 Fund or the Concord Fund, you could  file with the corporate registry in the State of Virginia permission to  operate under what is called a fictitious name. You can operate under  your own name, the 85 Fund, or you can file, with permission, a  fictitious name. I am not making that up. That is actually the word in  Virginia law--a ``fictitious name.''   Well, the 85 Fund filed for permission to operate under the  fictitious name of the Judicial Education Project--the 501(c)(3) that  takes in money, and ``tax deductibly,'' to work on the capture of the  Court. On the other side, over here, the Concord Fund, your twinned  501(c)(4), has its own twinned fictitious name. So the Judicial  Education Project has its own little twin in the Judicial Crisis  Network.   Well, what do we know about the Judicial Crisis Network?   We know that it took checks for as much as $15, $17 million from  secret donors. Imagine writing a $15 million check to an organization  like this. It took that money, and it first ran campaigns to attack  Merrick Garland, to round up Republican support for opposing him as a  Supreme Court Justice. Then, when that was successful and they brought  on Judge Gorsuch, in came other big checks. Then, when Gorsuch was on  the Court and it was time for Kavanaugh--other big checks. Then, when  it was time for Amy Coney Barrett--other big checks. We have counted  four checks over $15 million. They could be from four separate  individuals, but it was happening so regularly you would think you  would probably go back to the same source. Somebody spent, probably,  $60 million to control who got on the U.S. Supreme Court.   We don't know what business that $60 million donor had before the  Court, but it is not unusual for cases before the Court to have  outcomes that will shift way more than $60 million. Just the climate  change cases move hundreds of billions of dollars around in protecting  fossil fuels' enormous subsidy. So you have your 85 Fund and Concord  Fund ``pierce the corporate veil with a banana'' pair, and then you  have their fictitious twins, the Judicial Education Project and the  Judicial Crisis Network, with big money flowing in.   But it is not enough just to pack the Court. You also want to make  sure that you are suppressing voters. Voter suppression is a very big  deal, so you set up your Honest Elections Project to do voter  suppression because, in this weird, billionaire-funded parallel  universe, everything has the opposite name of what it is. Over here,  you have, on the 501(c)(4) side, your Honest Elections Project Action  because there you can spend some of the money politically. So you have  got a whole separate set of twins--this time, completely fictitious  twins, fictitious names--no different from the 85 Fund and the Concord  Fund--designed to go out in the world and suppress voting: bring  lawsuits, write challenge letters, argue for new laws.   Then, as we saw in Virginia recently, you can really whip people up  about what is going on in schools--critical race theory. So you set up  your Free to Learn fictitious name with its little twin, Free to Learn  Action, to do the 501(c)(4) political work. So now what you have is a  total of eight organizations that are really the same.    Who does this? Who in real life does this, sets up eight  organizations, six of which are mere fictitious names, to run the same  money from the same donors out in the world to make it look as if  [[Page S3857]]  something real is happening, when, in fact, the whole thing is a phony  front?   And then you have, up at the head of the critter--you have how the  people behind it get themselves paid. So you have advisers who advise  these various entities. You have got the CRC Advisors as the name of  the group. It has its public relations antenna here, and it has its  strategic advice antenna here, and the money flows usually this way so  that the people who run this scheme for the big donors can take their  cut. They get paid here. These are all for-profit. These are all the  not-for-profits that are set up because they allow you to hide who your  donors are.   So that is the rig that was set up, and this is not the entirety of  the front group scheme that was funded by the $580 million. This is  just one coordinated corporate critter that was set up in order to  perform all of these different several functions.   Think back to the Founding Fathers and their desire to set up a  democracy where people made choices about their governments, where  popular democracy would be the way in which society went forward. Do  you think they had in mind something as creepy and complex as this? And  do you think all that effort to build all this scheming, all the  lawyers to file all the papers, to cook up all the funny, fictitious  names to create all of these bogus organizations--what is the point of  all that? Could there be a legitimate point to that? Why all the  shells? Why all the hiding if you are not up to no good?   Well, the bottom line is, they are up to no good. And the ``no good''  is to capture the U.S. Supreme Court and turn it from a proper Court  into a captive political entity that will do what the people who are  behind all this money tell it to do.   And there are many ways they do it, and I will go into those many  ways on other occasions. But on this one occasion, I wanted just to  focus on this multifaced corporate creature that hides its donors, that  does all of this different work through fake, fictitious name  organizations and through which money gets extracted by those who run  it so they can pay themselves for this vast disservice to democracy.
