 Madam President, it is time for a national investment in  building a strong and resilient educator pipeline to ensure that all  schools have the diverse, profession-ready teachers, principals,  librarians, counselors, and other specialized instructional support  personnel they need to support student development and academic  achievement. Today, along with Senators Casey, Lujan, Van Hollen,  Wyden, Stabenow, Merkley, and Heinrich, I am reintroducing the  EDUCATORS for America Act to provide the blueprint for building this  pipeline. I am pleased that Representative Alma Adams is introducing a  companion bill in the other body.   For years, we have seen declines in enrollment in educator  preparation programs. Now in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, schools  are facing pervasive staffing shortages. An Education Week survey found  that 40 percent of school district leaders and principals describe the  shortages as ``severe'' or ``very severe.'' The National Association of  Secondary School Principals reported that nearly 4 out of 10 principals  expect to leave the profession in the next 3 years. We cannot afford to  neglect the educator pipeline any longer.   As we work to replenish the ranks of our educators, we also have the  opportunity to advance diversity in the profession. Multiple studies  have shown that racial diversity can provide significant benefits to  students. However, the gap between the demographic makeup of the  student body and the education profession has been widening. Even  though over 50 percent of students are people of color, a 2022  Department of Education report showed that 80 percent of public-school  teachers identified as White, a figure that has barely changed since  2000.   The EDUCATORS for America Act calls for a $1 billion annual  investment in the educator pipeline, divided evenly between State  capacity building and direct support for educator preparation programs  and partnerships with high-need school districts. It addresses the full  scope of educator workforce development, including early outreach and  career exploration, financial assistance, and wraparound supports for  those pursuing education careers. It supports clinical preparation for  teachers, principals, and other educators, as well as fostering faculty  development, all with a focus on ensuring equity and diversity.   The EDUCATORS for America Act will also reduce financiq] barriers to  pursuing careers in education. The legislation will double the value of  the TEACH-- Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher  Education-- grant to $8,000 per year and provide greater flexibility  for meeting service requirements. It forgives loans for teachers,  principals, and early childhood educators in high need schools after 5  years of service, and it establishes a new monthly credit for all other  educators that will allow them to earn loan forgiveness as they serve  instead of being forced to wait a decade before receiving any benefit.   The EDUCATORS for America Act reflects input from stakeholders across  the field about what is needed to recruit, prepare, and support  educators. To date, more than 50 organizations have endorsed it.   The Nation's outlook for the future is tied to the strength of the  education profession. Our economic prosperity, the health of our  democracy and civic society, and our ability to meet the challenges of  climate change and the information age depend on our students having  access to well-prepared and supported educators who reflect the  diversity of the students they serve.   Today, the profession is in crisis. It is time to act. I urge my  colleagues to cosponsor the EDUCATORS for America Act and work with me  to see that it is enacted into law.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Durbin, Mr.          Booker, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Markey, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Hirono,          Ms. Warren, and Mr. Sanders):   S. 1343. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to alter  the definition of ``conviction'', and for other purposes; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.
