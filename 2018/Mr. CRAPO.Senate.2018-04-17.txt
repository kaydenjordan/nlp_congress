 Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for  Senator Moran and Senator Toomey's resolution using the Congressional  Review Act to disapprove of the CFPB's 2013 auto finance guidance.   It is important that Congress disapprove this guidance because it was  an attempt by the CFPB to make substantive policy changes through  guidance rather than through the rulemaking process governed by the  Administrative Procedure Act. It was also an attempt to regulate auto  dealers who were explicitly exempted from the CFPB's supervision and  regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act.   According to an internal CFPB memo, the CFPB rejected developing a  rule using its statutory authority to regulate unfair, deceptive, and  abusive acts and practices because ``the potentially unfair, deceptive,  or abusive actions are ostensibly those of dealers, over whom we have  no regulatory authority.''   As the Wall Street Journal editorial board noted, ``That didn't stop  former CFPB chief Richard Cordray, who used the back door of auto- financing to regulate dealers.''   Make no mistake--the CFPB's decision to develop guidance instead of a  rule was intentional. At Senator Toomey's request, the Government  Accountability Office evaluated the bulletin to see if it should have  been submitted to Congress as required by the Congressional Review Act.   The GAO concluded:         The Bulletin is a general statement of policy designed to       assist indirect auto lenders to ensure that they are       operating in compliance with ECOA and Regulation B, as       applied to dealer markup and compensation practices. As such,       it is a rule subject to the requirements of the CRA.    Plainly, the CFPB failed to follow the law by failing to submit the  bulletin to Congress. Furthermore, issuing guidance instead of  formulating a rule allowed the CFPB to sidestep important aspects of  the administrative rulemaking process that provide for accountability,  transparency, and thorough evaluation.   Federal agency rules are governed by the Administrative Procedure  Act, which generally requires an agency to publish a notice of a  rulemaking, take comments from the public, and establish an effective  date for a rule. Notice and comment is a vital step in the process  because it gives individuals and businesses subject to rulemakings the  opportunity to provide feedback on the practical effect of a rule's  implementation, and it allows an agency to adjust the rule as necessary  to avoid any undue consumer harm. In contrast, bulletins generally do  not afford the public an opportunity to lend their  [[Page S2201]]  voice to the process and have historically been used by Federal  agencies to simply restate existing law to aid covered companies'  compliance.   The CFPB's indirect auto bulletin represents a departure from typical  Federal agency practice, as reflected in the GAO's conclusion that it  is a rule subject to CRA requirements.   Without the opportunity for public comment and the ability for the  bulletin to be revised to avoid any unintended consequences, auto  dealers' incentive to act as an intermediary has been greatly  diminished. As a result, consumers will be inconvenienced and have  fewer and more expensive financing options when shopping for a vehicle.   Some people opposed to this resolution are concerned about what this  means for regulatory guidance more generally. I would note that almost  all guidance issued by agencies may qualify as a rule under the  Congressional Review Act and must be submitted to Congress for  potential disapproval. The CRA's definition of a rule includes, with  some limited exceptions, ``the whole or a part of an agency statement  of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to  implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.''   Explaining the Congressional Review Act's definition of a rule, the  GAO said: ``This definition is broad, and includes both rules requiring  notice and comment rulemaking and those that do not, such as general  statements of policy.''   This particular bulletin, according to GAO, ``advises the public  prospectively of the manner in which the CFPB proposes to exercise its  discretionary enforcement power and fits squarely within the Supreme  Court's definition of a statement of policy.''   Congress has the power to overturn any agency rule. Under the  Congressional Review Act, Congress has the power to overturn agency  rules using an expedited procedure. There is nothing special about  guidance issued by the agencies that should cause people to be  concerned, especially a rule masquerading as guidance. Article I grants  Congress legislative power, and by disapproving this rule, we are  ensuring that the CFPB cannot issue a rule that is substantially the  same as the one it just tried to issue.   There have also been questions raised regarding the flawed  methodology the CFPB used in its supervisory and enforcement activities  based on this bulletin to allege discriminatory auto loan pricing.   In November 2015, the House Financial Services Committee's majority  staff issued a report exploring the CFPB's approach to enforcing the  ECOA against indirect auto lenders. The report focuses on the  controversial use of disparate impact theory and the CFPB's use of a  flawed statistical methodology, which only takes into account an  individual's last name and ZIP Code in order to determine a probability  for race and ethnicity. This approach is less reliable than other, more  proven methodologies. A November 2014 study estimated that only 24  percent of African Americans and 50 percent of Asians were correctly  identified using this methodology.   In light of such significant concerns, the House introduced  legislation in 2015 to nullify the effect of the bulletin and place  guardrails around the development of any future indirect auto lending  guidance. That bill garnered significant bipartisan support, passing  the House by a vote of 332 to 96, including 88 Democrats.   This resolution has attracted substantial support, as well, including  from 12 different organizations involved with helping consumers buy a  vehicle and an endorsement via a Statement of Administration Policy  from the White House.   For example, the chamber of commerce notes that ``internal documents  [at the CFPB] demonstrate that even [CFPB] Bureau staff found the data  and methodology intended to support the rule `unconvincing.'''   The Independent Community Bankers of America notes that ``since the  issuance of the Bulletin, many community bankers have reported added  difficulty in meeting the varying borrowing needs of their customers  based on confusing and overly-burdensome guidance.''   The National Association of Auto Dealers notes that ``extensive  bipartisan congressional engagement has identified several reasons to  disapprove the CFPB rule/guidance, including a lack of due process,  concerns about the CFPB's failure to adhere to Section 1029 of Dodd- Frank, and the negative impact on consumers and small business  dealers.''   The American Bankers Association said that ``the regulatory and  enforcement uncertainty caused by this Guidance has caused many banks  to exit or to curtail their indirect auto lending, which limits  consumer choice and increases the cost of credit.''   The American Financial Services Association said that ``the guidance  is harmful because it pressures vehicle finance companies to limit  consumers' ability to receive discounted auto loans from dealers.  Furthermore, the guidance threatens to raise credit costs and push  marginally creditworthy consumers out of the vehicle financing market,  and has the potential to harm the vehicle industry and its associated  U.S. jobs.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the five letters I cited  be printed in the Record, as well as a joint letter from the National  Auto Dealers Association, the National RV Dealers Association, the  American International Automobile Dealers, the Auto Alliance, the  National Independent Automobile Dealers Association, the National Auto  Auction Association, the American Financial Services Association, the  Recreational Vehicle Industry Association, and the Motorcycle Industry  Council, all expressing their strong support for S.J. Res. 57.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                  American Financial                                            Services Association,                                     Washington, DC, April 13, 2018.        Dear Senator: The American Financial Services Association       (AFSA) writes to express our strong support for S.J. Res. 57,       which would rescind the Consumer Financial Protection       Bureau's (CFPB) 2013 vehicle finance guidance. The guidance       is harmful to American consumers and businesses, and the CFPB       acted without accountability in its issuance of the guidance.        The guidance is harmful because it pressures vehicle       finance companies to limit consumers' ability to receive       discounted auto loans from dealers. Furthermore, the guidance       threatens to raise credit costs and push marginally       creditworthy consumers out of the vehicle financing market,       and has the potential to harm the vehicle industry and its       associated U.S. jobs.        The Bureau issued the guidance without any public comment,       consultation with CFPB's sister agencies, or transparency.       The CFPB issued the policy, which directed fundamental market       changes, without a transparent rulemaking process to assess       the impact on consumers.        In the 114th Congress, the House overwhelming approved H.R.       1737, the ``Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing Guidance       Act,'' a bill rejecting the vehicle finance guidance similar       to S.J. Res 57. The legislation passed the House by a       bipartisan vote of 332-96, including 88 Democrats.        S.J. Res. 57 is a narrow resolution that preserves fair       lending protections. It does not hinder enforcement of fair       lending laws or regulations, which AFSA and its members       strongly support. In fact, even the House Financial Services       Committee minority report accompanying H.R. 1737 stated that,       ``H.R. 1737 does not alter regulated entities' obligations       under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) or the CFPB's       examination or enforcement activity pursuant to ECOA.''       Proponents of S.J. Res. 57 take fair credit laws very       seriously, and the resolution protects these laws and their       enforcement to safeguard equal opportunity in vehicle       financing.        Please lend your support S.J. Res. 57, both as a cosponsor       and an affirmative vote on the Senate floor. If you need more       information, please contact me.            Sincerely,                                                   Bill Himpler,                                           Executive Vice President,      American Financial Services Association.                                   ____                                                 National Automotive                                             Dealers Association,                                         Tysons, VA, April 13, 2018.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell and Leader Schumer: On behalf of       America's 16,500 franchised new car and truck dealers and the       1.1 million people they employ, I am writing in strong       support of S.J. Res. 57, a joint resolution providing for       Congressional disapproval of the rule by the Consumer       Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) relating to indirect auto       lending. Despite Congress exempting  [[Page S2202]]       most auto dealers from the CFPB's jurisdiction under Section       1029 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer       Protection Act, the CFPB's rule, issued as ``guidance,''       operates to reduce market competition and take away a       consumer's ability to receive a discounted auto loan in the       showroom. Access to affordable credit is essential to       consumers, and the ability of a dealer to discount credit is       often necessary to meet auto buyers' needs.        S.J. Res. 57 is a narrowly-tailored joint resolution that       does not amend or change any fair credit law or regulation or       impair their enforcement. The legislation is a measured       response to the CFPB's attempt to regulate the $1.1 trillion       auto financing market, avoid congressional scrutiny by       issuing ``guidance,'' and impose a new policy without       necessary procedural safeguards.        Congress has considered this issue thoroughly during the       past several years through oversight and legislative action.       The Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee       raised the matter during two CFPB oversight hearings.       Moreover, by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 332-96,       including 88 Democrats, in 2015 the House passed H.R. 1737,       the ``Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing Guidance Act,''       which would have rescinded the CFPB auto finance guidance.        The extensive bipartisan congressional engagement has       identified several reasons to disapprove the CFPB rule/      guidance, including a lack of due process, concerns about the       CFPB's failure to adhere to Section 1029 of Dodd-Frank, and       the negative impact on consumers and small business dealers.       In particular:        The rule/guidance was issued without any prior notice,       opportunity for public comment, or consultation with the       federal agencies Congress authorized to regulate dealers.        Indirect auto lenders were pressured by the rule/guidance       to eliminate a consumer's ability to receive a discount on       auto credit by a dealer, which would have fundamentally       altered the entire auto finance market. This new policy would       have limited market competition, raised credit costs for auto       buyers, and thereby pushed some marginally creditworthy       borrowers out of the credit market. The CFPB admitted to the       Senate that it did not analyze the impact of the rule/      guidance on consumers.        Despite Congress' clear determination in Dodd-Frank to       place regulatory oversight of auto retailers with the Federal       Reserve Board, Federal Trade Commission and Department of       Justice (DOJ), the rule/guidance assumed the CFPB could       unilaterally assert jurisdiction over dealer discounts and       the manner of dealer compensation for auto credit.        The rule/guidance was based on a flawed method for       identifying the background of consumers that relied solely on       a borrower's zip code and last name. A non-partisan study of       the CFPB's policy found a 41 percent error rate for       classifying the background of a significant group of       consumers, and even the CFPB's own review revealed a 20       percent error rate for the same group. (This non-partisan       study was never rebutted by the CFPB.)        The rule/guidance failed to account for legitimate business       factors that can affect finance rates (such as discounting a       rate due to the presence of a competing offer or to       accommodate a consumer's monthly budget constraint) to ensure       that borrowers being compared are similarly situated.        The auto industry takes fair credit laws very seriously and       strongly condemns discrimination. In furtherance of this       commitment, NADA, joined by the other national dealer       associations, developed and continues to promote a voluntary       fair-credit compliance program, based on an effective DOJ       model that preserves consumer discounts on credit for       legitimate business reasons. Unfortunately, the CFPB,       refusing to work with the Federal regulators that have       jurisdiction over dealers, failed to adopt the DOJ-based fair       credit alternative as an appropriate method to mitigate fair       credit risks in indirect auto lending.        Enactment of S.J. Res. 57 is important to keep auto loans       affordable and accessible for consumers. America's franchised       auto dealers urge a ``Yes'' vote on S.J. Res. 57 should it be       considered by the Senate. Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                    Peter K. Welch,                                                 President and CEO. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                    American Bankers Association,                                     Washington, DC, April 17, 2018.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:       On behalf of the members of the American Bankers Association       (ABA), I write to express our support for S. J. Res. 57, a       resolution to disapprove BCFP Bulletin No. 2013-02,       ``Indirect Auto Lending and Compliance with the Equal Credit       Opportunity Act'' (Bulletin).        According to the statements of the Bureau of Consumer       Financial Protection (Bureau) at the time of issue, the       Bulletin was to provide lenders with fair lending compliance       ``guidance'' in situations when lenders permit automobile       dealers flexibility to set automobile loan interest rates. In       practice, however, the Bulletin was applied as far more than       guidance, asserting with regulatory effect, highly       controversial legal theories and methodologies to allege that       banks and finance companies that purchase motor vehicle       installment sales contracts may be liable under the Equal       Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) for purported, but       undemonstrated racial disparities in the interest rates that       the automobile dealers charged consumers.        ABA strongly believes that every automobile customer       deserves to be treated fairly, and that there is no room for       illegal discrimination of any kind in automobile financing.       However, the Bulletin was issued without the opportunity for       public comment on its legal underpinnings, critical review of       its assumption and bases, and its impact on consumer access       to convenient and affordable credit.        The regulatory and enforcement uncertainty caused by this       Guidance has caused many banks to exit or curtail their       indirect auto lending, which limits consumer choice and       increases the cost of credit.        ABA urges the Senate to adopt S.J. Res. 57.            Sincerely,      James C. Ballentine.                                   ____                                                 Chamber of Commerce                                 of the United States of America,                                     Washington, DC, April 17, 2018.        To Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. Chamber of       Commerce urges you to support S.J. Res. 57, a Congressional       Review Act resolution to undo the Bureau of Consumer       Financial Protection's action on indirect auto lending. The       Chamber will consider including votes on, or in relation to,       S.J. Res. 57 in our How They Voted scorecard.        In 2013, the Bureau issued a ``Bulletin'' that imposed new       requirements under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) to       address purported discrimination. The Bulletin established       that indirect lenders--firms that are never face-to-face with       borrowers and only purchase contracts after-the-fact from       auto dealers--could be liable for discrimination.        The Chamber abhors discrimination in all its forms,       including in the financial service and auto lending sectors.        However, the Bureau provided little concrete evidence of       problems that the Bulletin was intended to address. In fact,       internal documents demonstrate that even Bureau staff found       the data and methodology intended to support the rule       ``unconvincing.''        We thank Senator Moran and Senator Toomey for their       leadership to resolve this overreach by the Bureau and for       engaging the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which       determined on December 5, 2017, that the Bulletin is in fact       a ``rule'' for purposes of the Congressional Review Act.        Moreover, we applaud the work of the House Financial       Services Committee, which released three reports on the       topic.        The Chamber believes the Bureau--like all other federal       agencies--should follow the Administrative Procedure Act when       issuing guidance and promulgating regulations. Agency actions       should be based on clear legislative authority, solid data,       and proper public input. That is why the Chamber strongly       supports the Portman-Heitkamp ``Regulatory Accountability       Act,'' which would modernize the rulemaking and guidance       processes for the first time since 1946.        The Chamber urges you to reject the Bureau's Bulletin and       to support S.J. Res. 57.            Sincerely,                                                    Jack Howard,                                              Senior Vice President,      Congressional and Public Affairs.                                   ____                                               Independent Community                                   Bankers of American,                                     Washington, DC, April 17, 2018.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:       On behalf of the nearly 5,700 community banks represented by       ICBA, I write today to urge all members of the Senate to       support S.J. Res. 57, a joint resolution under the       Congressional Review Act (CRA) introduced by Sen. Jerry Moran       (R-Kan.) to overturn the Consumer Financial Protection       Bureau's (CFPB) 2013 auto finance guidance set forth in CFPB       Bulletin 2013-02, titled ``Indirect Auto Lending and       Compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity'' (Bulletin).        S.J. Res. 57 follows the U.S. Government Accountability       Office's (GAO's) determination that the ``guidance'' outlined       in the Bulletin is a ``rule'' subject to CRA. Sen. Pat Toomey       (R-Pa.) requested that GAO determine whether the Bulletin was       subject to CRA. Since the issuance of the Bulletin, many       community bankers have reported added difficulty in meeting       the varying borrowing needs of their customers based on       confusing and overly-burdensome guidance. For this reason,       ICBA supports this effort to overturn this harmful guidance       administered by the CFPB.        ICBA and America's community banks thank you for your       consideration.            Sincerely,                                                    Camden R. Fine,                                                   President & CEO.  [[Page S2203]]                                          ____          NADA, Auto Alliance, American Financial Services             Association, The National RV Dealers Association,             National Independent Automotive Dealers Association,             Recreation Vehicle Industry Association, American             International Automotive Dealers, National Auto Auction             Association, Motorcycle Industry Council.                                                    April 16, 2018.        Dear Senator: We, the undersigned organizations which       represent businesses that make, sell, finance, auction and       service vehicles are writing to express our strong support       for S.J. Res. 57, a joint resolution to disapprove the       Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) 2013 auto       finance guidance. The CFPB guidance pressures indirect auto       lenders to limit a consumer's ability to receive a discounted       auto loan from a dealer, resulting in less competition,       higher financing rates, and loss of credit access for many       vehicle buyers.        Access to affordable credit, including a dealer's ability       to discount credit, is essential to meet the transportation       needs of our customers. Since more than 80 percent of vehicle       purchases are financed, adequate retail credit is vital to       facilitate vehicle sales. The current system benefits       consumers as dealers' access to multiple lending institutions       frequently allows dealers to help consumers, including the       marginally credit worthy who often have limited options,       secure financing at competitive interest rates.        The CFPB auto lending policy, issued through a guidance,       directed fundamental market changes without a transparent       rulemaking process to assess the impact on consumers. This       guidance was issued without any public comment, consultation       with CFPB's sister agencies (including those that Congress       authorized to regulate auto dealers), or transparency.       Indeed, by the CFPB's own admission, the agency did not study       the impact of its guidance on consumers.        This controversial guidance also enabled the agency to       skirt Congress' express prohibition on its exercise of       authority over auto, recreational vehicle, and motorcycle       retailers engaged in indirect lending, (Sec. 1029(a) of Dodd-      Frank). Under the Dodd-Frank law dealers continue to be       regulated by that Federal Reserve Board, Federal Trade       Commission and Department of Justice, as well as rigorous       state laws and regulations.        The auto industry takes fair credit laws extremely       seriously and has proactively promoted a comprehensive       compliance program to enhance fair credit lending. Under the       Department of Justice (DOJ) modeled program, a dealer can       reduce the consumer's APR by documenting one of seven       ``legitimate business reasons'' identified by the DOJ as a       legitimate reason for a dealer to discount credit. Legitimate       business reasons include ``meeting or beating'' a competitive       offer that is available to the customer from another dealer       or lender. Preserving this vigorously competitive market for       vehicle financing lowers the cost of auto credit for       consumers across the board. When Congress created the CFPB,       surely it did not intend the agency to use its power to stop       vehicle retailers from offering consumers discounts.        In a rejection of the auto finance guidance, last Congress       the House overwhelming approved a bill similar to S.J. Res.       57, H.R. 1737, the ``Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing       Guidance Act.'' H.R. 1737, which would have rescinded the       guidance, passed by a bipartisan vote of 332-96, including 88       Democrats (November 18, 2015).        Despite the House's overwhelmingly bipartisan approval of       the legislation and additional bipartisan efforts in the       Senate to seek a resolution on this issue, the CFPB rebuffed       extensive industry efforts to work together to fashion a       solution that would preserve discounted auto loans by dealers       within the parameters of the DOJ-based model. In addition,       the CFPB continued to pressure finance sources to limit a       dealer's ability to discount credit based on a deeply flawed       method for measuring lender compliance with fair lending       laws.        S.J. Res. 57 is narrow and purely a process resolution that       preserves fair lending protections and does not hinder       enforcement of fair lending laws or regulations. In fact,       even the House Financial Services Committee minority report       accompanying H.R. 1737 stated that ``H.R. 1737 does not alter       regulated entities' obligations under the Equal Credit       Opportunity Act (ECOA) or the CFPB's examination or       enforcement activity pursuant to ECOA.'' Proponents of S.J.       Res. 57 take fair credit laws very seriously, and this joint       resolution protects these laws and their enforcement to       safeguard equal opportunity in vehicle financing.        Senators should disapprove the auto finance guidance that       operates to eliminate dealer discounts, threatens to raise       credit costs and push marginally creditworthy consumers out       of the vehicle financing market, and harms the vehicle       industry and its associated U.S. jobs. Vehicle sales play an       important role in the economy, as they constitute almost 20       percent of all retail spending in the U.S. Nationwide the       vehicle industry provides jobs for more than 7 million       workers and their families. It is in the best interest of       consumers, dealers, and vehicle manufacturers to keep vehicle       financing competitive and affordable.        Keeping auto financing competitive and affordable is not       only warranted, it is essential for the vehicle industry and       its customers. That is why similar legislation easily passed       the House, and why the Senate should pass S.J. Res. 57.     Finally, President Trump's Statement of Administration  Policy also endorses this resolution. I am going to read a few  highlights from the statement.         This bulletin limits the ability of auto dealers to offer       auto loans to their customers and was not issued pursuant to       notice-and-comment rulemaking. As a result, the CFPB failed       to allow the public to comment before it made significant       changes to an important sector of the economy. Dodd-Frank       explicitly excludes the regulation of auto dealers from the       CFPB's jurisdiction. Disapproving this bulletin, therefore,       would provide consumers with more options for auto financing       while ensuring that the CFPB abides by congressional limits       on its jurisdiction.    This rule should be disapproved, and any future action on the matter  should go through the appropriate rulemaking process established by  Congress. If this rule stands, banks, credit unions, and finance  companies holding nearly $1.1 trillion in outstanding loans will  needlessly face significant liability, and the ability of auto dealers  to play a valuable role by matching buyers and lenders will be  diminished.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
