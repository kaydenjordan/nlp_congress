 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Congressional Budget  Office's accounting of the $25 billion that will be taken out of  Medicare.                                        Congressional Budget Office,                                                    U.S. Congress                                  Washington, DC, November 13, 2017.      Hon. Steny H. Hoyer,      Democratic Whip, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman: This letter responds to your request for       information about the effects of legislation that would raise       deficits by an estimated $1.5 trillion over the 2018-2027       period, specifically with respect to a sequestration--or       cancellation of budgetary resources--in accordance with the       Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010(PAYGO; Public Law 111-      139).        The PAYGO law requires that new legislation enacted during       a term of Congress does not collectively increase estimated       deficits. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is       required to maintain two so-called PAYGO scorecards to report       the cumulative changes generated by new legislation in       estimated revenues and outlays over the next five years and       ten years. If either scorecard indicates a net increase in       the deficit, OMB is required to order a sequestration to       eliminate the overage. The authority to determine whether a       sequestration is required (and if so, exactly how to make the       necessary cuts in budget authority) rests solely with OMB.        CBO has analyzed the implications of enacting a bill that       would increase deficits by $1.5 trillion over a 10-year       window, without enacting any further legislation to offset       that increase. In accordance with the PAYGO law, OMB would       record the average annual deficit on its PAYGO scorecard,       showing deficit increases of, in the example provided, $150       billion per year. If the bill were enacted before the end of       the calendar year, that amount would be added to the current       balances on the PAYGO scorecard, which for 2018, show a       positive balance of $14 billion. (For years after 2018, the       balances range from a $14 billion credit to a $1 billion       debit.)        Without enacting subsequent legislation to either offset       that deficit increase, waive the recordation of the bill's       impact on the scorecard, or otherwise mitigate or eliminate       the requirements of the PAYGO law, OMB would be required to       issue a sequestration order within 15 days of the end of the       session of Congress to reduce spending in fiscal year 2018 by       the resultant total of $136 billion. However, the PAYGO law       limits reductions to Medicare to four percentage points (or       roughly $25 billion for that year), leaving about $111       billion to be sequestered from the remaining mandatory       accounts. Because the law entirely exempts many large       accounts including low-income programs and social security,       the annual resources available from which OMB must draw is,       in CBO's estimation, only between $85 billion to $90 billion,       significantly less than the amount that would be required to       be sequestered. (For a full list of accounts subject to       automatic reductions, see OMB Report to the Congress on the       Joint Committee Reductions for Fiscal Year 2018, https:// go.usa.gov/xnZ3U.)        Given that the required reduction in spending exceeds the       estimated amount of available resources in each year over the       next 10 years, in the absence of further legislation, OMB       would be unable to implement the full extent of outlay       reductions required by the PAYGO law.  [[Page H10205]]         If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall,                                                          Director.     Mr. Speaker, it is hard to be here today,  as we approach Christmas, and not look at this bill, knowing that we  have honorable Members on the other side, who, this Christmas, will be  sitting with their relatives, their family members, their mothers and  fathers, their brothers and sisters, and knowing that this creates not  just a $2 trillion debt, but the pay-for--the pay-for--out of the  Medicare program: an automatic cut of $25 billion in a plan that was  never debated. It fulfills a grand vision of Grover Norquist and the  ideology that you took a pledge to. But what about the oath of office,  and a pledge to the Constitution, and standing up for the people of  this Nation, and the very elderly at this Christmas, and throughout the  year, who will need our help?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks  to the Chair.
