 Madam President, I rise today to say a few words about the  two human beings who will be providing extraordinarily important  testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee tomorrow, Dr. Christine  Blasey Ford and Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who will testify in that order.   Two human beings--it feels a bit odd in this political setting to  specify their humanity, but we need to. I admit it feels strange to  have to do that, but we in this political culture, in this city, and in  this building, even in this Chamber, seem to sometimes forget that  before this woman and this man are anything else, they are human  beings.   We sometimes seem intent on stripping people of their humanity so  that we might more easily denigrate or defame them or put them through  the grinder that our politics requires. We seem sometimes even to enjoy  it.   For the past 2 weeks we certainly have seen that happen to both of  these human beings, for whatever reason--because we think that we are  right and they are wrong, because we think our ideological struggle is  more important than their humanity, because we are so practiced in  dehumanizing people that we have also dehumanized ourselves.   Whatever else they are or have become to us, whatever grotesque  caricature we have made of them or ourselves, before we are Democrats  or Republicans and before we are even Americans, we are human beings.  As President Kennedy said:         We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's       future. And we are all mortal.    These witnesses who will testify in a very important hearing  tomorrow, these unwitting combatants in an undeclared war--these people  are not props for us to make our political points, nor are they to be  ``demolished like Anita Hill'' as was said on conservative media the  other night, nor is one of them a ``proven sex criminal'' as has been  circulating on the left side of the internet. These are human beings  with families and children--people who love them and people whom they  love and live for--and each is suffering through a very ugly process  that we have created.   I will not review the unseemly process that brought us to this point  because that is for another time, and, in any case, it didn't start  with this particular nomination. But here we are.   There was an earlier case, 27 years ago, from which you might have  thought we would have learned something, but the past couple of weeks  [[Page S6323]]  makes it clear that we haven't learned much at all.   Consequently, there have been cries from both sides of these  proceedings that each of the witnesses has fallen victim to character  assassination. Both of these claims are absolutely correct, so I will  say to these witnesses, these human beings, we owe you both a sincere  apology. An apology is inadequate, of course, but it is a start. We  can't very well undo the damage that has been done. But we can govern  our own behavior as we go through this painful hearing tomorrow and in  the days afterward. We must do that, lest we do any even more damage.   Some of the public comments about these witnesses have been vile. Not  unrelated to those comments, each of these witnesses has reportedly  been subject to death threats, and for that we should be ashamed. The  toxic political culture that we have created has infected everything,  and we have done little to stop it. In fact, we have only indulged it  and fanned the flames, taken partisan advantage at every turn, and  deepened the ugly divisions that exist in our country. These past 2  years, we have tested the limits of how low we can go, and, my  colleagues, I say that winning at all costs is too high a cost. If we  cannot have a human rather than a political response to these  witnesses, if we are heedless to the capacity that we have to do real  and lasting damage, then we shouldn't be here.   When Dr. Ford came forward, I felt strongly that her voice needed to  be heard. That is why I informed Chairman Grassley that the Judiciary  Committee could not and should not proceed to a vote until she had an  opportunity to make her voice heard, until such time that her claims  were fully aired and carefully considered and her credibility gauged.  This is a lifetime appointment. This is said to be a deliberative body.  In the interest of due diligence and fairness, it seemed to me to be  the only thing to do.   Not everybody felt this way. One man, somewhere in the country,  called my office in Arizona and left a message saying that he was tired  of my ``interrupting our President,'' and for the offense of allowing  Dr. Ford to be heard--for this offense, my family and I would be  ``taken out.'' I mention this with reluctance, but only to say that we  have lit a match, my colleagues. The question is, Do we appreciate how  close the powder keg is?   Tomorrow, we will have a hearing. Many Members of this body from both  parties have already made up their minds on the record, in advance of  this hearing. They will presumably hear what they want to hear and  disregard the rest. One is tempted to ask: Why even bother having a  hearing?   I do not know how I will assess the credibility of these witnesses-- these human beings--on the grave matters that will be testified to  because I have not yet heard a word of their testimony and because I am  not psychic. I am not gifted with clairvoyance. Given these  limitations, I will have to listen to the testimony before I make up my  mind about the testimony. What I do know is that I don't believe that  Dr. Ford is part of some vast conspiracy from start to finish to smear  Judge Kavanaugh, as has been alleged by some on the right. I also do  not believe that Judge Kavanaugh is some serial sexual predator, as  some have alleged on the left. I must also say that separate and apart  from this nomination and the facts that pertain to it, I do not believe  that the claim of sexual assault is invalid because a 15-year-old girl  didn't promptly report the assault to authorities, as the President of  the United States said just 2 days ago. How uninformed and uncaring do  we have to be to say things like that, much less believe them? Do we  have any idea what kind of message that sends, especially to young  women? How many times do we have to marginalize and ignore women before  we learn that important lesson?   Now I wish to say a word or two about the human beings, first on the  Judiciary Committee and then in the full Senate, who will have to weigh  the testimony that we will hear tomorrow and then come to some kind of  decision on this nomination. The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to  vote on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination on Friday. I hope that tomorrow's  hearing gives us some guidance on how we are to vote. But those of us  on the Committee have to be prepared for the possibility--indeed, the  likelihood--that there will be no definitive answers to the large  questions before us. In legal terms, the outcome might not be  dispositive.   While we can only vote yes or no, I hope that we in this body will  acknowledge that we don't have all the answers. We are imperfect  humans. We will make imperfect decisions. This monumental decision will  no doubt fit that description. Up or down, yes or no, however this vote  goes, I am confident in saying that it will forever be steeped in  doubt. This doubt is the only thing of which I am confident in this  process.   I say to all of my colleagues, for this process to be a process, we  have to have open minds. We must listen. We must do our best, seek the  truth, in good faith. That is our only duty.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  leader remarks on Thursday, September 27, the Senate proceed to  executive session for the consideration of the following nomination:  Executive Calendar No. 867.

I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at desk, and I  ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place the  bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to my  own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 12 noon,  Thursday, September 27; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that  following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session under  the previous order.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority  leader be authorized to sign duly enrolled bills or joint resolutions  on Thursday, September 27.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:24 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, September 27, 2018, at 12 noon.                            ____________________
