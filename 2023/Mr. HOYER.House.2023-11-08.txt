 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First of all, Mr. Chairman, let me say that I echo the remarks of the  chairman of this committee. The American public, I think, would be  pleased and say: Look, this is how it ought to work.   Mr. Womack and I have great respect for one another. We are great  friends and have been long before we were chair and ranking member on  this subcommittee on the Appropriations Committee. He is a person of  great integrity, great insight, and a great work ethic. He is somebody  who the House can be proud of. He is somebody whom I hold, as he said  of me, as a dear friend.   I also want to echo his comments about the staff. The public doesn't  see the staff for the most part as, frankly, they don't see the  overwhelming majority of Federal employees who are not known to the  general public. There is a tendency to talk about bureaucracy.  Bureaucracy is used as a pejorative term and not as a descriptive term,  and that is unfortunate because the overwhelming--overwhelming-- majority of Federal employees carry out their duties with great  fidelity to their responsibilities and to the American people. So this  bill is not the bill that, for the most part, most people focus on.   Nevertheless, it is one of the most important bills that we consider  because all 11 other appropriation bills are reliant on the collections  made through this bill, and that is why I think it is so critical.   Mr. Chairman, every Member of this House ought to make it their goal  to preserve America's fiscal health.   Sharing that common goal, President Biden, Speaker McCarthy and 149  Republicans, and 165 Democrats--314 people, which is 75 percent  essentially of this House--agreed on a plan of going forward.   The first thing you do on a plan, Mr. Chair, is to decide how much  are we going to spend?   The President had a higher level, and some in this House and the  Senate had a lower level. Speaker McCarthy and President Biden came  together, and they agreed on a spending level. That is what we call, if  we had done it through the regular order, a 302(a) allocation. In other  words, it is what we are going to spend on the discretionary side of  the ledger, which, by the way, is smaller than the mandatory side.   We did that. We adopted that bill, as I said, with over 300 votes.  Unfortunately, a week later that agreement was broken by the Republican  side of the aisle in saying: No, we are not going to do that. We are  not going to follow that agreement. We are going to fund at a much  lesser level.   Now, the problem with that is Republican and Democratic Members of  the Senate pursued under that agreement, and so they are literally  billions of dollars different than we will be when these 12 bills,  assuming we pass these 12 bills, are sent over to the Senate.    There are some in this House who have a theory that, well, that gives  us the opportunity to negotiate for more numbers. The problem with  negotiating for more numbers is that nobody believes they are real.   That is not true. Some do. Some do. Some few in this body believe  this is real and that they are going to somehow leverage these numbers  and force the Senate and the President to do what they want them to do.  The President of the United States and his administration have issued a  veto threat on this bill if it were to be adopted. They are not going  to have to exercise that veto because this bill is not going to be  adopted.   Nevertheless, I will tell you, Mr. Chair, if Mr. Womack and I were  left to our own devices--and he has a different perspective than I do,  and that is what makes this body work--then we would come to an  agreement that we think would pass the Senate and be signed by the  President.   Why?   It is because we would do what in a democracy you have to do, Mr.  Chair. We would come together and compromise, realizing full well that  we  [[Page H5552]]  have a Democratic President, a Democratic-controlled Senate, and a  Republican almost majority. It is an absolute majority. I understand  that politically. Nonetheless, it is not a majority that can always  hold together, and; therefore, it can't always effect the policies that  it knows are reasonable and can be adopted.   Now, I said at the beginning that we ought to preserve America's  fiscal health, and I believe that sincerely. The deal that we made, 67  percent of House Republicans voted for it. That bill that we have  before us does not honor that agreement. As I said, it does not  establish a foundation, really, for negotiation. It does nothing to  avert the shutdown looming just a few days from today.   Crucially, it will increase the deficit over time, and I will explain  why. In fact, this legislation severely undermines the government's  ability to lower the deficit and to uphold the law of the land. It  defunds crucial agencies that enforce laws, regulations, and rules  established to protect the American people, American families, and  America's children.   Those cuts include the FTC, the SEC, the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Election  Assistance Commission, and the FCC. This is essentially saying to  Americans: You are on your own. We are going to reduce oversight.   This bill defends justice, if you will. It dramatically cuts funding  for the Federal public defender program which helps ensure every  American can exercise their constitutional right to an attorney.   Other law enforcement agencies face dire cuts under this legislation.  Among them, Mr. Chair, is the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. We  hear a lot about fentanyl, we hear a lot about money laundering, and we  hear a lot about the drug cartels making a lot of money.   Mr. Chair, we created the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network,  otherwise known as FinCEN, for the specific purpose of following the  money. That is how Willie Sutton, obviously, got caught: tax evasion.  Follow the money. We have undermined that premise in this bill.   We then decrease the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.   Terrorism is one of the great challenges of our time, and what do we  do?   We decrease the agencies that are charged with overseeing that, among  other agencies.   The Office of National Drug Control Policy, now you would think, Mr.  Chair, given the expression that all of us have and concern we have  about fentanyl, drug abuse, and drug deaths in this country, that we  would beef up that office to make sure that we can, in fact, confront  this scourge on our people and our country. No. We cut it.   The emergency planning and security costs in this city, the Capital  City, to which millions of our constituents come, are reduced.   In total, this bill cuts $345 million, or 6.2 percent, below the  enacted for crucial law enforcement agencies. It provides $1.32  billion, or 20.2 percent, less for law enforcement than what President  Biden requested in his Office.   Mr. Chair, in that context, I would ask: Who is defunding the police?   Yet, Republicans have the nerve, frankly--not my chairman--some  Republicans have the nerve to accuse Democrats of trying to defund law  enforcement.   Paring back enforcement has dire consequences for the deficit, as  well, Mr. Chair. This legislation is the latest salvo in some  Republicans' long campaign to defund the Internal Revenue Service. The  number of annual tax returns, Mr. Chair, increased from 140.1 million  in 1979 to 269 million in 2021. That is a 92 percent increase in  workload.   So what is our response?   It is over the years to reduce from 85,000 people in 1979 trying to  handle this extraordinary workload to in 2021 78,661. This is an 8  percent decrease while a 92 percent workload increase occurred. That  means refunds get delayed, returns aren't audited, owed taxes go  uncollected, tax cheats and lawbreakers are not held accountable, and  our debt grows even bigger.   Mr. Chair, if you are a business trying to get the revenue you are  owed, frankly, you don't fire the collection department. If you had bad  debts, you would go after them. This bill does just that. It cuts the  collection department.   Contrary to Republican claims, this issue isn't about raising taxes  on anyone. My friend, the majority leader, opined on this floor that  these agents were going to raise people's taxes. Those agents can't  raise anybody's taxes. The only people who can raise or lower taxes are  the people who sit in this body and across the Hall and the President  of the United States. No agent can do that.                                time  0930    All the agents can do is collect what is owed under the laws that we  passed. Those agents instead ensure that we each pay the share we  legally owe, and they go after the cheats and lawbreakers who don't.   If you are for law and order, that is what you are for. If people  cheat, if people break the law, you hold them accountable. If you are  going to hold them accountable, you need the personnel to do so because  some of them have scads of lawyers and accountants and very complicated  returns of thousands of pages.   Too often, those lawbreakers are Americans with a lot of wealth and  complex tax files. I am not talking about the overwhelming majority of  Americans whose taxes are withheld on a weekly, biweekly, or monthly  basis. I am talking about the select few who use passthroughs, shell  companies, and offshore accounts to shield their vast wealth from  taxation. I don't want them to pay any more than is owed, and I don't  have any beef against anybody who is wealthy. What I have beef against  is people who cheat and cheat their country.   Harvard and Treasury experts found that there is a 12-to-1 return on  investment for IRS enforcement of the top 10 percent of earners. If you  spend $1, you get $12 back. That is a pretty good deal, and it makes a  real difference.   Years of budget and staffing cuts have limited the IRS' ability to  conduct these complex audits because they are extraordinarily time  consuming and complex.   Millionaires were 88 percent less likely to face an audit in fiscal  year 2022 than they were in fiscal year 2010. That is an almost 100  percent reduction, from essentially $9-plus to $1. The result is a  backdoor tax cut, but only for those with the means and guile to  exploit accounting tricks to hide profits, income, and, in the end, tax  obligation. They have a duty to support their country, the national  security, and the healthcare investments we make in Medicare and Social  Security.   This bill includes a 22.2 percent cut below the request for IRS  enforcement. My chairman will correctly observe that the other items he  will point out have been held relatively harmless. It is only the  collection department that was cut.   By the way, a recent article from just last month pointed out that  the IRS now estimates that there is $688 billion in unpaid taxes. Let's  think of what that would do to the deficit over time if you collected  the money that was due, not that you are increasing, but that was due.  That is a disservice to hardworking Americans who patriotically and  conscientiously pay their taxes.   This bill defunds those agencies of government that keep us safe,  with a cut below the enacted of $9.6 million for the Office of National  Drug Control Policy, which I talked about; $24.2 million for FinCEN,  the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network; and $9.2 million for the  Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence that confronts terrorism  everywhere you find it.   It disrupts the agencies that ensure the products we buy and the  markets we invest in aren't overrun with fraud by undermining the  independence of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   By cutting the Consumer Products Safety Commission, it makes it very  hard for consumers, Mr. Chair, to make the determination of: Is this  product safe? Has it been tested? They rely on us to make sure that,  yes, it has been tested and that, yes, it is safe so it won't hurt or  kill their children.   They are cutting the SEC by $149 million, which disrupts the markets  if people don't trust them. You didn't have an overseer in 1920. Now,  you have an overseer, and people have much more trust because of that  overseer.  [[Page H5553]]    It hampers the agencies that make those who try to get one over on  the rest of us think twice and that hold these people accountable with  a cut of $7 million to the FEC, $53 million to the Federal Trade  Commission, and $8 million to the Federal Communications Commission,  which, by the way, in part is responsible for making sure we don't get  all those junk calls all the time that annoy the living daylights out  of all of us.   These are just some of the cuts. If Republicans want to be the party  of fiscal responsibility, if they want to be the party of law  enforcement, they need to shelve this bill.   They know this legislation will never become law. They have loaded it  with partisan poison pills, which I have not spoken of but that I am  sure will be spoken of during the course of this, such as undermining a  woman's right to choose.   I am sure that everybody saw what happened in Ohio yesterday. Ohio,  for the most part, has been a red State, but it overwhelmingly said a  woman's right to choose needs to be protected. They believed in that so  much that they are going to put it in the Ohio Constitution.   This bill has been loaded with partisan poison pills designed to  varnish American history. We don't want to talk about slavery. We don't  want to make anybody feel bad about what their country did to people  because of the color of their skin or their sexual orientation. This  bill undermines diversity, equity, and inclusion and exacerbates the  climate crisis.   Mr. Chair, we will talk about a lot of this bill for the next few  hours. I hope it is a few hours, not more than that. I think the chair  and I will try to achieve that objective.   We ought to stop this nonsense. We are going to have a lot of  amendments to reduce salaries to $1. That is not a serious Congress. It  is not a serious Rules Committee to have 55 amendments reducing  salaries to $1.   The only ones that have been approved have been approved by a voice  vote. Every other one has been defeated, yet we keep dealing with these  silly amendments while we undermine America's ability to collect the  revenues it needs to protect the American people, play our role  throughout the international community, and make America a safer and  greater country.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the distinguished former chair and current  ranking member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First, let me say I am sympathetic to the issue that the  appropriations committee needs to conduct oversight, but I will tell  everybody in this Chamber and those who are watching, this matter was a  subject of very serious debate and resolution, and the resolution was  we wanted to keep this agency independent and free of any political  pressure.   It was adopted on that basis by the House and the Senate and signed  by the President of the United States. It is now the subject of a  Supreme Court hearing.   This is authorizing in the extreme an appropriation bill which, but  for the waiver that was issued by the Rules Committee, a point of order  would be applicable and would not be considered.   I suggest that this is an authorizing matter. It is a matter that the  Financial Services Committee needs to be seized of and report the  gentleman's legislation out to the floor and that ought to be  considered in the regular order.   This is not the regular order for a major authorizing change, which  was very controversial at the time it was raised, and it was passed to  make sure that consumers are, in fact, protected and insulated from  political pressure.   Therefore, at such time, I will support an amendment to take this  from the bill.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Levin), my  friend.    Mr. Chairman, may I ask the chair if he has any more  speakers?    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Number one on this issue--it is pending before the Supreme Court. The  Supreme Court can decide whether it is constitutional or not. We can't  decide whether something is constitutional or not. Ultimately the  Supreme Court decides that.   We pass laws, and we certainly hope and expect them to be  constitutional. I would, again, reiterate my opposition to the  gentleman's amendment on this bill.   Mr. Chairman, in closing, let me say this bill underfunds the most  important aspect of the Federal Government, and that is collecting the  revenues to run it in a balanced way. It undermines that effort. I urge  opposition to the bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1015     Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).    Mr. Chairman, I support the gentleman's amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment, of course, is an add and  subtract and will have no fiscal impact, and the policies do bear  problems on this side of the aisle as to the implications they may  have.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I recognize my friend and thank him once again  for his courtesy on the floor. I reluctantly oppose his amendment.   The United States Postal Service is a service. Every one of us knows  that there are some of the facilities that serve rural areas, in  particular, that on a cost basis would not be there if it were not a  service and we did not deem the rural areas needing service. Therefore,  it is across the enterprise itself that we are looking at their  finances.   Therefore, to put the United States Post Office to the pretty  extensive analytical chore of determining each post office,  particularly in rural areas--now, I represent some rural and some  suburban, but I think this would be a burden and add paperwork without  giving us a result.   When I say not giving us a result, Mr. Chair, let us say that post  office A, B, and C were making a profit and D, E, and F, if you look at  the unit, that is the single post office, were not making a profit, but  nevertheless that neighborhood needs to be served. It is the overall  profit or loss of the postal department providing the service to all  Americans that I think is the criteria that we ought to be looking at.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this is a continuation of the majority party's  contention that there are these thousands of agents that are going to  be at your door armed to the teeth and ready to intimidate you.                                time  1045    That is not true. It is a good political scenario, but it is again  the demonizing of people who are trying to catch tax cheats, tax  dodgers, criminals, drug dealers, and others; many of whom are very  dangerous people and who are very heavily armed themselves.   This is a defund the police argument that the Republicans are making.  Why?   Because they want to somehow intimidate.   Frankly, I don't care much about getting this information. I think  this information is certainly worthwhile having. It is not worthwhile  in terms of its intent to continue ad nauseam and contend something  that is not true.   Most of the agents that are going to be hired and have been hired are  accountants, tax attorneys, and investigators to go through these  voluminous tax returns that are filed by corporations and individuals.   We could have included this in the report language. This is an add-in  and then add-out language. It has no fiscal impact. It is unnecessary.   Here we are some 10 days from the close-down of government. We are  spending time on a number of these amendments, some of which votes have  been asked for, while we twiddle our thumbs until February 17, without  having resolved that issue.   I think it is unfortunate that we continue to misrepresent to the  American public that we are trying to make sure that people who do not  pay their taxes do not put a greater burden on patriotic Americans-- small, medium, and large--who do pay their taxes, and to somehow give  this misnomer or mischaracterization or misinformation that somehow, as  they have said over and over again, these armed 87,000 agents-- absolutely untrue--are going to be at somebody's door trying to collect  their taxes.   We are trying to collect taxes from some pretty bad people. The  agents we asked to do that work are doing it for their country and  putting themselves in harm's way.   Some assertion that somehow the IRS has become an army of agents  showing up at doors with machine guns is absolutely wrong. I hear it  all the time.   Apparently, it makes good politics. Apparently, some don't believe  that people ought to pay their fair share of taxes, that drug dealers  who try to hide their money ought to not have somebody come to their  door or come to their place of illegal business and say: You are a  lawbreaker. You are a criminal. You owe us and the American people  money, legally. You are doing it illegally and avoiding your taxes.   I hope that this aspersion that somehow the IRS has become this armed  army that is assaulting the American people is retracted by those who,  for political purposes, continue to spew this argument. It is not fair  to those people we ask to conduct the law enforcement business of  America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I can assure my friend, I understood the  proximity of the date being this month on November 17.    Mr. Chair, if I said February, I thank the gentleman for  correcting me.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?  [[Page H5587]]         Mr. Chairman, I adopt not only his premise that we have  language in the bill that was fully debated in committee that will  achieve the knowledge that we need.   In addition, I would reiterate, we need to respect law enforcement-- whether it is called IRS agents--because people are breaking the law.  For whatever reasons, people who are tax cheats or drug dealers  laundering money or some ilk like that, any dangerous group of people,  particularly when they have got criminal gains, are not paying any  taxes, although, it is clearly owed.   It is unfortunate that we continue to, A, defund those folks and  limit them. I think the chairman is absolutely right in his objection  to this. It demeans the officers who are risking their lives to do the  duty that we have given them and they have a sworn responsibility to  do.   If they were called the Rolling Heights Police Department, and you  said we are going to cap their weapons and do this, I think people on  your side of the aisle, with all due respect, would be standing up and  saying they are defunding the Rolling Hills Police Department. Isn't  that awful?   Because they are called IRS agents who enforce the law, they confront  crimes, that somehow they are lesser law enforcement officers and are  at lesser risk, I think that is not the case.   Mr. Chairman, I join the chairman in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I have a credit card in my pocket. It is a  piece of plastic, and I am sure that 150 years ago or 100 years ago  somebody said: Well, that plastic is not money.   Nonetheless, very frankly, most of us no longer carry significant  sums of money because we use our credit cards.   Now, I am not an expert on this. This is an authorizing issue. The  authorizers on the Financial Services Committee and the experts who  deal with this should be deciding whether we ought to even look at it,  and that is what this amendment would preclude, looking at an option.   Now, I am sure it is much more complicated than my simple analogy of  a credit card, but I guarantee you, Mr. Chairman, if people 100 years  ago were told that you can spend this plastic, they would have said:  Are you crazy?   Now, I don't know whether or not Treasury or the Federal Reserve will  see something that makes it more efficient and effective to transfer  money from one place to another, which is what we do with a credit  card. We transfer from our bank not by going to the bank and doing a  withdrawal slip, we do it by giving somebody plastic, and they then put  it in the system and the system puts my money from my account into the  seller's account.   Now, I don't know that that is so simplistic as to be inaccurate, but  I do say, Mr. Chairman, that it is putting your head in the sand in a  very technological age in which we live in which things may be made  more effective, more accurate, and more user-friendly. I don't know the  answer to that.   Nevertheless, I certainly don't believe that we ought to say: Don't  look at the options.   So I would oppose this amendment. I am sure it is well-meaning, and I  certainly believe the gentleman is concerned about what China does, and  I don't know exactly what they do. I heard his brief explanation, but  the fact of the matter is looking at an option--and the gentleman is  correct, we would have to approve that option. We, the Congress of  United States, the Representatives of the American people, and the  Senate, would have to approve that option, and we would have authority  over that because, as he said, that is what the Constitution says.   Nonetheless, not looking at options I don't think is a good policy  for this country, for any business, or for any family. Look at your  options.   Mr. Chair, I urge us to reject this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Is the gentleman opposed to the working group that now  exists?    I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.    Reclaiming my time. First, the gentleman is an expert and  knows much more than I do about this. I take that as a given.   Secondly, he is on the authorizing committee. That committee has full  authority to do that. He says it wouldn't be in order. It is not  authorizing, but it says none of the funds, which means that whatever  is going on can't use any funds to do this.   He says it is about creating and not studying. I hear him, but this  is an authorizing issue, and it ought to be in the hands and the  consideration of the committee of jurisdiction. Apparently, it hasn't  moved, which is why the gentleman is now trying to get it through by a  backdoor, in effect, of saying none of the funds can be used for the  purposes that are ongoing.   So, Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, I urge its rejection, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment.   The CFPB is vital in safeguarding the interests of American  consumers.   You are on your own. That is the ongoing message that Americans hear  from our Republican colleagues. You are on your own, and we are not  going to protect you.   The CFPB serves as an independent agency dedicated to ensuring that  financial products and services are fair, transparent, and free from  deceptive practices.   Very frankly, we are dealing with trillion-dollar financial  institutions. There is no consumer except the most expert who can, on  their own, make sure they are getting a fair shake and who can, on  their own, make sure they are not getting rolled and make sure that  they are not being ripped off.   That is what this agency is supposed to do.   By holding financial institutions accountable, the CFPB protects  consumers from predatory lending, fraud, and other forms of financial  exploitation.   That is the little guy. That is the little guy who can't do it for  himself or  [[Page H5589]]  herself and is counting on us to make sure that what is represented to  them is, in fact, fair and not, as I said, ripping them off.   The CFPB promotes fair and transparent financial markets by enforcing  regulations and consumer protection laws. This oversight helps maintain  the integrity of the financial system, fostering trust and confidence  among consumers and businesses alike.   If we don't have it, if we zero fund it, then guess what, Mr.  Chairman?   Confidence is going to go away.   Guess what, Mr. Chairman?   Financial institutions--some very small, some medium size, the large,  maybe they will get away with it, they will be able to sustain  themselves--but the financial system will lack confidence, and we know  that confidence is critical to the financial community and our economy  operating effectively.   The CFPB conducts investigations, issues fines, and enforces  compliance to deter companies from engaging in harmful or fraudulent  activities, ultimately reducing the risk of financial crises and market  instability.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  oppose this amendment.   Very frankly, as I have said in the past, in the twenties, we didn't  have these--the 1920s, not the 2020s. In the 1920s we didn't have any  of these protection agencies. The reason they were created in the  thirties was to try to stabilize the markets. Very frankly, we have had  an extraordinary market for the most part.   Now, I have been here when we have had some real downturns, and  confidence was lost. Nevertheless, if we eliminate CFPB and other like  agencies or, frankly, reduce the resources that some agencies like the  SEC have to make sure that our markets are safe, secure, and  transparent, then our economy is not going to be the kind of economy,  frankly, that we want. Very frankly, our economy is not going to be the  kind that we have now in terms of a pretty vital, vibrant market  creating some 13 million, 14 million jobs over the last 24 months.   So, Mr. Chairman, this is not about politics. This is about our  economy, its stability, and the confidence that people have in it. I  urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``no'' on this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, we had this discussion a little earlier on Mr.  Barr's legislation.   This is before the Supreme Court. You are making a representation  that this is unconstitutional. You are going to find out the answer to  that probably by early summer of next year. We will be in session. We  can respond to that.   This is a matter that ought to be considered out of the Financial  Services Committee and reported to the floor, and we ought to consider  it.   This was not adopted without thought. You may disagree with the  conclusion that was arrived at, but it had a lot of discussion. By the  way, for those of you who have not been here a long time, it had a  conference. You may not know what a conference is, but what a  conference is, is we pass legislation, the Senate passes legislation,  and they go meet.   We hardly do that anymore, unfortunately. That is sad, in my view. I  have been here for a long time, and conferences are good. That is the  way the process ought to work, as opposed to just putting something  here and zero funding an agency that was created.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, helping the consumer does not seem to be the  objective of the amendments that are made to this bill.   My colleagues have heard numerous statements by Ranking Member  Wasserman Schultz and others about how the consumer is confronted with  extraordinarily complicated and big agencies, and relying on the fact  that what is being sold to them or given to them--sold to them, for the  most part--is safe to use.   They don't have labs to analyze whether that is the case. They don't  have researchers able to understand that. It is not that they are dumb.  Somebody said that I thought that they were rubes. That is baloney. I  think they are smart, bright people.                                time  1130    They don't have the capacity to really know what is in that product.  They can't analyze it. They don't know what toxins may or may not be in  it. That is what this agency is about.   This would reduce the Consumer Product Safety Commission's funding  below the fiscal year 2019 levels. Well, that was now 5 years ago. We  are doing the fiscal year 2024 budget now. It clearly would harm  individual consumers who rely on their work, period. It would harm the  Commission's ability to halt dangerous imports from China, investigate  deaths associated with consumer products, and research emerging  hazards.   This cut of $13 million would bring the CPSC's funding level down  from its fiscal year 2023 funding level of $153 million to its fiscal  year 2019 level of $127 million, a 20 percent reduction.   Well, consumer, you are on your own. That is what the mantra is:  Consumer, you are on your own. I hope that the committee chair would  oppose this. As you know, these levels are significantly below the  President's budget.   Last year, 32 million people sought medical attention for an injury  related to a consumer product. Mr. Chair, 32 million people sought  redress for an injury related to consumer products. There were an  estimated 57,000 deaths in 2021 related to consumer products.   Under this amendment, imports of consumer goods would be  significantly slowed. Companies seeking help with recalls would face  significant delays, and CPSC's efforts to address the online sale of  dangerous recalled products would be greatly harmed.   Consumer, you are on your own. That is unfortunate because the  consumer--our constituents, our fellow Americans--needs to have  confidence. They need to have confidence in the banking. They need to  have confidence in products that are sold to them, so they have the  confidence to buy them, to let their children use them, to have them  present in their homes and in their businesses, and, yes, even in their  cars.   Mr. Chair, I urge us, as protectors of consumers--not Republicans and  Democrats, but as people who want to protect consumers--to reject this  amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, first of all, let me address the gas stoves.  That was a sidebar comment. It wasn't anything about taking gas stoves  out of people's homes or out of their yard or anything of that nature.  It was a political gem that has been seized on by the majority party to  pretend somehow that there was an active effort to take away their  Weber from their yard.   It is absolutely untrue. It was a sidebar comment by one commissioner  about we need to look at gas stoves. It is like defunding the police or  the IRS being an army.   Furthermore, this is not a minor cut. This is a 20 percent cut. Not  this amendment, but when you add it to that which was reduced in the  bill itself, it is a 20 percent cut in protecting consumers. I think  that is a pretty big cut. I urge its rejection, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have a pro forma amendment at the desk. I  rise as the designee of the ranking member.    Mr. Chair, I think my friend has left the floor. Maybe he  hasn't left the floor, but let me read this message. They are going to  reject it out of hand because it comes from the CPSC. The message says:         For what it is worth, we never proposed a gas stove ban,       period. Total nonsense. We had one commissioner say something       in an interview, and then the chair shot it down, but there       is no staff working on anything like this, no proposal to do       anything like this. Same as saying that Congress is doing       something because one Member of Congress is introducing the       bill.    Defund the police. An army of thousands from the IRS. They ought to  stop scaring the American people and giving them misinformation.   That gas stove story is baloney that the gentleman talked about. But  it is a really great political talking point they think because the guy  with the Weber stove in their yard is going to think the Feds are out  to get my Weber. Baloney. However, it is a good talking point because  if someone keeps saying a lie over and over and over again, maybe  somebody will believe it.   I try to tell the truth when I am on the floor. The Bible tells me  the truth shall set you free. Be honest with America.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                    Amendment No. 24 Offered by Mr. Perry     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, You are on your own, consumer. You are on your  own, Mom. You are on your own, Dad. That is what they said in the  1920s. I keep repeating it: You are on your own. The markets went wild,  and they crashed, and millions and millions and millions of people  suffered badly.   This bill already cuts FTC, and this amendment brings salaries and  expenses down to its fiscal year 2019 levels, that is to say that it  cuts in half the complement of employees at the FTC. That is not a  nick. That is a you are on your own.   Boy, the pleaders for doing things that are not legitimate, Mr.  Chairman, must be a long line. We don't want to be regulated. Now, I am  not calling anybody a rube, but I will tell you, maybe you can.   When I go to the gas station and I put the pump on, and the gas goes  in, there is not a single way that I can tell whether that product is  what they say it is.   Do you know what I rely on, Mr. Chairman? I rely on--both at the  State and Federal level--that somebody is checking on that gas to make  sure it is not going to blow up my car. I can't do that. I rely on the  government to do it, to make sure that I am safe, to make sure my car  is not damaged when I pull that pump and some liquid goes into it.                                time  1145    Why do I presume that? Not because the gasoline company says it is,  because the gasoline company may have some incentive to, hey, maybe  shortchange a little bit of this and shortchange a little bit of that.   If somebody is checking, that incentive is eliminated. Just like when  people are checking on making sure you are paying your taxes or doing  the speed limit on the road. They think somebody's checking, so they  are more likely to do that. They are more likely to pay their taxes.   To the extent that the other side continues to try to nip away at the  protections for the consumers and the investors and the purchasers of  food and drugs and other items of consumer products, to the extent that  we erode that, we are going to erode this economy, and we are going to  diminish the quality of life for people and their security.   This agency was reduced significantly by this committee, and this is  not just a nick at it. It is a cut of the muscle and the ability to do  the job consumers and constituents, we call them, expect it to do for  them, their families, and their children. I oppose this amendment and  urge its rejection.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Perry says that. I don't say that.    Mr. Chairman, I don't know that I am going to dignify that  with an extensive response. I think the American public are very  bright, but they don't have assets.   You may smell the gasoline. You may be an expert on gasoline. I know  what gasoline smells like. I put it in my lawn mower. I put it in my  chain saw. I put it in my car. I have no idea beyond the smell what is  in there.  [[Page H5593]]    That is my point. My point is they expect us to be making sure that  when that big gas tanker rolls in that gas station and puts that liquid  in there that it is something they can use in their car and it won't  hurt their car and it won't hurt them. That is my point.   Don't misrepresent my position as saying Americans are dumb. They are  not dumb. They are smart. They are smart enough to know that they need  somebody checking up on the quality of that gas before they put it in  their car.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote and yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, first of all, this bill urges every Federal  agency to return people to the offices, and then where are you? Well,  we don't need the offices now, so we can save money.   You can't have it both ways. If you want people to return, you are  going to need office space for them, and you are going to need to  maintain it.   By the way, operational costs are going to go up and capital costs  are certainly going up when you purchase Federal space. Existing  Federal space may not be in the right place, and maybe you need to go  rent something, as well.   Here, rental space is already cut by $158 million. It is not a  nickel-and-dime there. It is a significant decrease. This amendment  brings that total down to fiscal year, as has been said, 2019 levels.   I don't know. I haven't read the amendment, so I don't know whether  it keeps rental costs down to 2019 levels or construction costs down to  2019 levels or other expenses attributable to the maintenance and  acquisition of property. I think it doesn't and, obviously,  constitutionally it couldn't do that.   Reducing the revenues without reducing the costs is going to cause,  obviously, a very substantial imbalance in the ability of GSA to  operate effectively.   This cut would bring the GSA's rental of space funding level down  from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2019 $5.4 billion, a 3 percent  reduction. It is six times higher than a 0.5 reduction, but,  nevertheless, not insignificant.   GSA plays a critical role, as all of us know, in managing Federal  real estate procurement and tech services, by the way, including our  own offices.   Reduced funding may lead to delays, inefficiencies, and increased  costs in government activities. The chairman is not here, but I know  that he believed, because that is what he proposed and that is what was  adopted, that the appropriate reduction was $158 million.   Now, in addition to that, of course, we had an agreement at 2023  levels, and 149 Republicans voted for that agreement. I don't know  whether the gentleman who offered this amendment, Mr. Chairman, was one  of them. It doesn't really matter. A large number of us voted for  that--314 Members in total.    Mr. Chairman, 75 percent of the Congress voted for a level of  funding, which the Senate is doing because they believe that is the  appropriate level.   In light of the fact that it has already been reduced very  substantially,  [[Page H5594]]  I would strongly oppose this amendment and urge the Congress to reject  it and the House to reject it.   Remember, they have office space, and they are worried about their  own office space either as rented in the private sector or in public  buildings. They pay an offset in the public buildings.   Each Member should think of what has happened to their costs and act  accordingly and don't expect others in the Federal Government to do  what we are not doing ourselves.   I would ask my colleagues to reject this amendment and stay with the  reduction that has been made which I, frankly, think is excessive  myself, but, nevertheless, a very substantial reduction already.   Going to fiscal year 2019 levels was not contemplated by anybody that  voted just a short while ago on the agreed funding levels in this bill.   Now, I want to be fair. The agreed funding levels were not by item.  It was an overall cap. Contemplating a cut of this nature is going to  severely undermine the ability to operate in an efficient, effective  way. GSA, I think, does that and needs the resources to do it on behalf  of all Americans.   Getting those people back in offices is a good optic, but reducing  the ability to maintain those at the same time is not good business.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1200     Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I would make an observation. I understand  what the gentleman is saying. The IRS says there are $688 billion. That  is not chump change, not behind the sofa cushion, $688 billion. They  say that if they have the resources, they can collect a large sum of  that, which is really what the gentleman is looking to do in this  amendment with this agency.   Mr. Chair, this bill provides for a 23-percent cut in enforcement on  moneys that are due and owing under the current law to the Government  of the United States. The gentleman and previous speakers have said how  concerned they are with the deficit. I would think that--again, I will  use the collection department of a corporation as the example--you  would want to collect that money.   If the principle that the gentleman espouses is a good one, and I  frankly think it is, then we ought to apply that to that $688 billion,  which would have a substantial impact on collections.   Let's say we just collected a third of that. That would be more money  than all of these cuts combined and perhaps all of these bills. I find  it confusing and contradictory that the gentleman would want to collect  these debts--of course, the agency says it would cost more to collect  than would be collected. That is their position. Whether that is true  or not, I am not arguing that, but that is their position, as I  understand it.   In the case of the $688 billion, it is, essentially, if you are at  the upper end, $1 of expenditure for $12 of revenue. Frankly, at the  lower end, it is much less, $1 to maybe $1.67 or $1.87. That is a  relatively small return on the investment but a big return on the  bigger taxpayers, whether they are corporate or individual.   Mr. Chair, I think the principle the gentleman enunciates is a good  one. I hope he would pursue it in talking about the IRS' ability to  oversee very complicated and lengthy returns that have resources that  are not very transparent and are from sources that aren't withdrawn  because that might in fact help us get to where he wants to get in  reducing that debt.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, if you want to get tough on Putin, don't elect  one of his friends President of the United States.   This legislation that has been offered, as I understand it, wants to  see a full sanction and prohibition on dealing with Russian oil. That  may be a worthy objective, but I think the way to do it is to do it. We  can pass legislation on that.   As I understand it, 8H is one of the principle ways in which we  implement sanctions that we urge. To do away with that ability without  replacing it--and I may be wrong in what I am saying, so the gentleman  can correct me--does not seem to be a worthwhile objective. In other  words, if you need more, let's legislate more sanctions. We can do  that. Don't take away sanctions that currently exist, even though, as  the gentleman hypothesizes, they are not as effective as they ought to  be.   I hear what he is saying. I very much want to help Ukraine. I hope  your Speaker brings Ukraine to the floor pretty soon. That is really  going to help Ukraine. We need to do it sooner rather than later. We  have 300 votes on average to help Ukraine on his side and my side of  the aisle, Mr. Chairman.   It seems to me that is the way we ought to go about it, rather than  trying to do it through what is a relatively clumsy, in one sense, way  of accomplishing an objective with which I may agree. I don't know all  the ramifications of that, and I don't have the information from  Treasury as to what adverse impact they think it will have. It seems to  me the way to do it is to do it and do it through the legislative  process and have that debate and know the consequences of the action  that the gentleman proposes.    For that reason, I am opposing the amendment and urge its rejection.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Mr. Chair, reclaiming my time.   Let me ask something. As I understand it--again, not having the  information that he has available to him--one of the reasons those  exemptions are given is because of the fear that there will be a  substantial price hike if that oil is not on the market and that price  hike will then go to what a lot of his colleagues have been talking  about, these awful prices at the pump.   Am I correct?   I yield to the gentleman.    And our consumers.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, first of all, our economy is doing better than  almost any economy in the world. I have had numerous debates, Mr.  Chair, or discussions with the majority leader in the last Congress. He  kept talking to me about American energy. I kept pointing out to him,  almost every time he raised it, we were producing more energy than we  had under the previous President, and yet they kept wringing their  hands about how we were undermining the energy industry.   Now, at the same time we are not undermining the energy industry, we  are also trying to deal with an extraordinary crisis that confronts the  global community, and that is climate change. This amendment blocks any  whole-of-government strategy led by the White House to build a  resilience both at home and abroad against the impacts of climate  change.   Nationwide, communities are already facing severe impacts that will  continue to intensify. In 2022, there were 18 separate billion-dollar  weather and climate disasters that impacted the United States:  hurricanes, floods, wildfires, droughts, among other events.                                time  1230    We had a very substantial investment we made in alternative energy.  Now, I happen to be a huge supporter of alternative energy,  particularly in nuclear. I have been a supporter of nuclear energy for  a very long period of time. I have a big nuclear plant in my district.  It is an alternative clean energy option. I want to see that further  expanded. Right now it is somewhat cost prohibitive in terms of getting  loans.   Mr. Chairman, at the time of tremendous need and challenge, this  amendment will make us less prepared to prevent and withstand the  severe impacts of climate change that our country already faces on a  regular basis, as does the world.   Industries have recognized that need and are pursuing that need--not  as vigorously as they were perhaps last year or the year before that-- but pursuing it vigorously. I visited a number of the energy companies  themselves who were involved in the fossil fuel industry, also looking  at alternative energy because they see that as the future.   This amendment undermines both the focus and the process of moving  toward that, which the White House is trying to do. Why?   Because they have a responsibility for all Americans. They have a  responsibility to look at more than 24-month cycles.   We, in Congress, are sort of hidebound by 24-month cycles. We need to  look long term. That is what President Biden is trying to do; look long  term and be prepared. Be prepared for a time when we are smothering our  little globe and heating it up and melting the ice of the world. We are  making agriculture unattainable in certain areas. We are making life  difficult in certain areas.   It is necessary that we look long term. It is necessary that we have  a longer vision. It is necessary that we have an administration that  has the ability and inclination to do just that. That is what they are  doing.   I think this amendment certainly speaks to one segment of the energy  that we have in this country, and that is fossil fuel. We are going to  be using fossil fuel for some years to come, maybe some decades to  come. We need to look long term at more efficient and effective energy  sources that do not cause a danger to humanity.   Mr. Chair, I urge that we not pursue this, we allow the  administration to continue its efforts, and we admit that climate  change is a crisis happening now.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, this program has been a very successful  program. It has been a successful program for the little guy--the small  business. The pilot program has proved to be very successful and has  been operating over three Presidential administrations.   The program expands access to small business financing for  underserved communities, including women, minorities, veterans, and  people in low-income areas. Obviously, the lending community believes  this is a program that works. The permanent program includes all 112 of  the pilot's lenders who wanted to continue SBA lending, along with 31  new mission-driven lenders that were recently approved.   Mr. Chairman, by blocking the SBA from continuing this program, the  amendment would deny economic opportunities for communities and small  businesses that need them the most.   I have talked about, you are on your own. This is an area where small  businesses need help. This is an area where apparently three  administrations thought it was working. Now we are extending it. We  hear that it is in the Congress' ambit. Of course it is. We could  prohibit this, but the administration has made a judgment that it  works. The lending community has made a judgment--apparently they are  not losing money on it--that it works.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Chu).    Mr. Chairman, I understand you say it is irrelevant  whether it works or not. On my side I think we probably think it is  relevant.   As the gentlewoman from California said, we think it is working. We  think it is advantageous for small businesses. We think it is  advantageous for minorities. We think it is advantageous for veterans.  In that context, we think it is very relevant that it seems to work.   The gentleman who is the chair of the committee didn't say it didn't  work, he just said they hadn't come to Congress. Now, if they don't  have the authority to do that, then we ought to raise that issue. I am  not sure that is the issue you are raising. I think that is the issue  you were raising.   The fact of the matter is, fine, then let's have a hearing on it and  begin. Let's have the authorizing committee that is responsible for  this say this is not working or we think it is working and we ought to  continue it. Absent a vote on continuing it, then one could draw the  conclusion that Congress withdraws its approval of it.   I think by simply doing this, Members are going to be voting, in  effect, blind on a program that we on this side think is working for  the people that it needs to help.   Mr. Chairman, I would urge that we reject this amendment.  [[Page H5599]]         Mr. Chairman, my point is we have the right to oversight.  The gentleman has the right to call them to come and testify and call  others to testify on whether this program works or doesn't. We haven't  given up that authority of oversight, as the gentleman refers to. I  think we ought to exercise that.                                time  1245    What I don't think we ought to do is eliminate a program that  apparently works on behalf of people I think all of us want to help.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in perplexion which I presume is  objection.    Mr. Chair, I ask the gentlewoman to yield for a question.    I ask you to yield.    I am asking if you will yield for a question.    What funds in this bill are used for the purposes you are  opposed to?    Precautionary for what?   I am asking--    I understand that.    I understand that, but what you have said is that none of  the funds in this bill can be spent for that objective.    What funds are in this bill to be spent for that  objective?    Reclaiming my time, Ms. Boebert. There are no funds in  this bill to do that, so this is just an opportunity for you to stand  and perhaps speak about an important subject. I understand that.  Nevertheless, there are no funds in this bill to accomplish that  objective.   You don't believe the chairman would put funds in to accomplish that  objective, do you?   I yield.    Do you understand if we do this amendment, then any  subject that anybody has an interest in would be subject to such an  amendment?    Now, the Rules Committee has waived points of order contrary to  [[Page H5600]]  what they said they wanted done when we were in charge because then  they didn't want points of order so they could raise them.   There are no funds in this bill, Mr. Chair, for the objective that  the gentlewoman wants to prevent.   I guarantee you Chairman Womack would not have included any funds to  protect such activity.   I know him, and I know he feels strongly about this.   This amendment has no place in this bill because there is no money in  this bill. You can argue about sanctuary cities, you can argue about  the border, and you can do all of that, but this is not the bill to do  it on.   This raises, therefore, a suspicion that somehow there is money in  this bill that Mr. Womack would have put in or that I would have  sanctioned to accomplish that objective.   That is simply not true, Mr. Chairman, and this has no place in this  bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the gentlewoman has said that I have said that  there are no funds. There are no funds. Nevertheless, she said that  because of this amendment, she is going to handcuff the administration.   You can't handcuff the administration prohibiting funds that don't  exist.   Mr. Chairman, I urge opposition, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, it is so sad to hear on this floor  assumptions made that have little or no basis in truth. It is so sad to  hear a debate that if you are for or against something that is awful,  then you are going to be against giving people who perform their  services in extraordinary ways recognition of that as the private  sector does all the time.   It is so sad to hear representation that we are eliminating gas  stoves that we heard during the course of this debate on this bill, not  in this instant debate, because it is totally untrue, and it is  defaming.   Now, luckily, for Members of Congress, we are essentially  constitutionally protected from defaming people. We can do that in the  course of our business on the floor of the House of Representatives.   Nonetheless, it is sad that some of us do it. It is sad that some of  us demean people who are performing an outstanding and absolutely  essential service for the United States Government, for the people of  this country, and to carry out the duties that we give them.   This assertion of this army of 87,000 people, armed guards at  everybody's door, has been repeated, I think, probably one million  times over the last 2 years or year and a half.                                time  1300    It is not true, and they know it is not true, but they don't care  whether it is true. They believe that the constant assertion through  social media and other means becomes fact for people who do not know  the facts. How sad that we have come to this point.   I say we have come to the point, but we have been at that point for  probably a long period of time, where people assert things that are not  true but do it over and over again. We had a President of the United  States who did that, and because he did assert it, they believed it.   Then along comes their chief of staff, and says: We know it wasn't  true, but we kept telling the American people until they believed it.  They believed it so much that they perpetrated an insurrection and  tried to overthrow the legitimate course and duty of the Congress of  the United States.   This amendment ought to be rejected because it is irrational to say  that, in our enterprise, if you do outstanding work, do what we ask you  to do, and do it effectively, we are not going to recognize the fact  that you did outstanding service because you are an IRS agent or an IRS  executive.   The IRS is the biggest agency in this Treasury Department and in this  bill, and it is the basis of which all other agencies and departments  operate because that is where the revenue comes from. The revenue comes  from that as  [[Page H5601]]  well to pay the debt when we don't have enough dollars to do what we  have asked them to do.   I hope that we would not continue to defame and demote--maybe my hope  is misplaced--as we reduce Federal employees one after another over and  over to $1 in salary because we don't like what they do and don't like  the policies they pursue for the administration.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, there have been over 55 of these amendments.  There have been some passed on voice vote. Every one put on the roll  has lost, and this one will lose.   It is a nonserious amendment and not offered as a serious effort to  legislate as so many requested be done, which is why they wanted so  many amendments.   These are not serious amendments, and I oppose them.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment will block all major rulemaking  by the administration. That is not a policy that we ought to adopt. It  would be challenging at best and harmful at worst to our country, our  economy, and our people. I urge its rejection. I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, the reason I am opposed to this is not because  I am opposed to making regulations more clear, less burdensome, and  less undermining of economic development.   The reason I am opposed to this amendment is because it is a blanket  amendment across the board. That I think is harmful to the  administration of government by any administration, Republican or  Democrat, no matter how many or how few those regulations may be if  they make a determination that regulation is necessary.   I appreciate the gentlewoman saying we ought to do our work. This  Congress is not doing that very well, of course. They had trouble  electing a Speaker, had trouble electing a second Speaker, and they are  having trouble passing appropriations bills. Somebody has got to  sometimes act. We are not doing a very good job of that, and we ought  not to  [[Page H5603]]  preclude across the board an administration from doing any major  rulemaking. I think that is a mistake, and I urge opposition to this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, and I  hope the chairman will also be in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, there are a lot of Vice Presidents I haven't  agreed with. I would never have contemplated offering, Mr. Chairman, an  amendment to strike their ability to carry out the duties to which they  were elected by the American people any more than I would suggest a  Member of Congress that doesn't perform very well or very efficiently  or very effectively have their offices defunded. They were elected by  the people. They are entitled to the resources to carry out those  duties and responsibilities given to them by the American people.   I hope this amendment is overwhelmingly rejected. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Womack), the chairman of our committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to articulate the  Treasury's position.    Mr. Chairman, their response to this amendment is at  first, it is unnecessary as the IMF executive board will not review the  SDR basket during this U.S. fiscal year, so this will not have an  impact on this fiscal year.   Moreover, Treasury says while we agree with the goal of this  amendment to limit the internationalization of the RMB, we believe that  it is important to retain some flexibility over the composition of the  SDR basket so that we can incentivize China to improve its behavior in  the international monetary system, including with respect to its  foreign exchange practices.   Treasury then says we will continue to urge the IMF to push countries  with SDR basket currencies to adhere to the highest levels of  transparency and to correct deficiencies or inaccuracies in their  reported data.   Essentially, they believe, A, it is unnecessary at this time; and, B,  that it will not be considered during this fiscal year. Therefore, I  oppose the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I want to say, however, that we are doing  financial services business in this bill, and we are the Financial  Services Committee to fund regulatory agencies.   To that extent, I understand its relevance. I must say that it is  going to be difficult for Members who haven't seen this process by the  Financial Services Committee to fully understand the ramifications of  the proposal, and I think that is unfortunate.   Having said that, I also believe, again from a nonmember of the  committee, that this cryptocurrency and crypto financial instruments  certainly need to be looked at and are being looked at on both sides of  the Congress to ensure that Bankman-Fried actions don't happen to  defraud a lot of people.   I really think what will happen here is when we go to conference,  assuming we go to conference, that this is going to be looked at. We  are going to hear from Treasury on it and also, obviously, the SEC, to  see where we ought to land on this issue of no funds to carry out, I  presume, any enforcement action related to crypto asset transactions.    I understand the gentleman's comment that there are at least three  other agencies that would have the ability to move.   Mr. Chairman, I think that the best thing to do--this amendment,  obviously, is going to move forward, and I'm going to urge both SEC and  Treasury and the administration to look at it as it moves through  conference.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, section 550 of the bill seems to do the same  thing.   Reading from the bill itself, it says: ``None of the funds made  available in this act may be used to finalize, implement, or enforce  the proposed rule entitled `The Enhancement and Standardization of  Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors,'' Federal reg, et cetera-- ``or any substantially similar rule.''   Is that the same effect as this amendment?    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman.  [[Page H5606]]         Well, I will be half as articulate about it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, from what I understand, the chairman is saying  that standing up twice is twice as good as standing up once.   Mr. Chair, let me say something about my friend Mr. Gensler, whom I  have known since he was a young boy. His father was a friend of mine  when I was in the Maryland Senate. Chair Gensler is a good man. He has  been in at least two administrations, at this point in time, doing an  important job. Some people may differ with him, but he is an honest,  hardworking, extraordinarily intelligent representative chosen by the  administration to carry out their policies.   I would be negligent not to say that of somebody I have known so long  and who I believe has great integrity, although he may have differences  with people.   Mr. Chairman, we have already said this, but we are going to say it  again.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this is another time when we retreat from  oversight. We talk a lot about oversight on the Committee on  Appropriations. We talk a lot about oversight in the authorizing  committees, that we need to find out what the people are doing, what we  asked them to do, that they are doing it properly, and that they are  serving the American people as we want them to do.   The same is true, of course, of those folks who serve in the  regulatory agencies, Treasury and others, to make sure that the  consumers are being treated fairly. I don't know why we keep retreating  from that.   If they do wrong, we ought to call them out for doing that. If they  are doing too much, we ought to call them out for doing too much. To  say that they can't do it undermines the consumer and undermines the  American people who are expecting us to make sure that people are  treating them fairly, on the up and up, and not taking advantage of  them, not because they are not smart, because they are, but they may  not be expert on what they are dealing with.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, let me read the remarks of the Commission in  response to this amendment. It says: The amendment would prevent the  FTC from implementing, administering, or enforcing any rule it may  promulgate pursuant to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that proposed  a ban on employers imposing noncompete restrictions on workers.   Workers are locked in sometimes because they have no other option.                                time  1400    It then goes on to say that evidence shows that noncompete  restrictions are reducing the competitiveness of labor markets and  depriving businesses of a talent pool they need to enter, build, or  expand. The FTC estimates that the proposed rule would increase  workers' total earnings by nearly $300 billion per year, and about 30  million Americans are bound by a noncompete clause.   In other words, what the effect of this amendment would be is having  30 million workers get less pay because of the noncompete because they  have no place to go.   We passed legislation on noncompetes, which have been used by  businesses over time to trap their employees.   This amendment is so broad that it may be used to implement,  administer, or enforce any rule defining or describing unfair methods  of competition.   Why would we adopt an amendment that says the FTC cannot tell people  about unfair competition? I can't conceive of any Member wanting to say  to the American public that we are not going to let them even tell you  that there are unfair competitive practices going on.   That doesn't seem to me to make common sense, and it certainly  doesn't make sense for employees.   I hope that we will defeat this amendment as way too broad and way  too harmful to men and women in the workplace. I don't know the figure,  but the FTC says 30 million people, as much as $300 billion in reduced  wages--that is 30 million people, so that is a lot of people.   Mr. Chair, I urge that Congress, at this point in time, on this bill,  not do this without much greater thought about the ramifications to 30  million people.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I think we all understand that the Chair of the  FTC is a controversial figure. I get that. To draw a piece of  legislation this broadly, I think, misserves the role that the Congress  established the Commission to pursue.   We can certainly step in when there are abuses. This says any rule-- good rule, bad rule, no rule. None of the funds to implement,  administer, or enforce any rule, not the rule that is necessarily under  consideration that we have been discussing, but any rule.   I think that is bad policy, and I think, as I have said, it is  dangerous to the American worker and the American purchaser of goods. I  think that we ought to hone in on the particular and not paint with  such a broad brush that will cause harm to the ability of the agency to  do what we set it up to do.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank my friend for yielding, and I thank the  chairman for his comments.   I understand what the gentleman, Mr. Gaetz, is saying. His ire is  directed at people. The people will be transitory. People come and go.  Members come and go from the Congress of the United States.   What will not be transitory is the ability to have a critically  important agency for us in the long-term to carry out its duty, which  is, after all, to defend America, our Constitution, from enemies both  foreign and domestic, and their duties have been changed to a  significant degree since 9/11.   What this structure that is proposed to be built is supposed to do is  to accommodate the fact that the present building is falling down and  is dangerous to those who work there, some of whom are clerical people  not making any decisions with respect to policy. I would think the  gentleman would be concerned about their safety, as am I, and as is the  chairman, and the safety of those, frankly, who walk around the  building. If the gentleman visited there, he is going to see netting  around the building because the concrete is falling off the building.   I would share, obviously, the chairman's view. I am not totally  objective. They are going to build it somewhere in this region. I live  in this region. I am supportive of this region.   I think we shouldn't transfer ire against the people who are in  positions in the FBI at this point in time.   This building, when and if it is built, is going to be built sometime  in the future and is absolutely essential. FBI Directors preceding the  present FBI Director a number of times have said this is needed.  Experts have said it is needed. The GSA says it is needed. I would hope  that we would not, because of the temporary displeasure or ire or anger  or stronger feeling, if you want to express it, of the present  occupants or the actions they are taking, would not adversely reflect  on the judgment as to whether or not a new capital facility for a  critically important agency is necessary at this time.   I would hope the gentleman would withdraw his amendment. I don't  expect that to happen. If he doesn't withdraw it, I hope it is  defeated.    Mr. Chair, I don't want any misinterpretation that I  adopted the gentleman's premise as to the activities of the FBI. I  disagree with that.    Thank God for that.   Let me say that in the concept of what we are doing, this is  necessary, forgetting about any of the other issues.   I understand what he is saying. I disagree with him, but I appreciate  his position and why he is saying it. To be so, in my opinion,  shortsighted that we delay further--this building has been delayed. The  first request for new facilities was 2009, so we are now talking a  decade-and-a-half essentially. That was my point, but I don't want to  be confused that I adopt his premise on the FBI activities.
