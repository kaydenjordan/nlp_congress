 Mr. Speaker, in recognition of Women's History Month, I  want to honor three incredible women who have had an enormous impact on  central Washington State: Martha Yallup, Violet Lumley Rau, and Sister  Kathleen Ross, who founded what would become Heritage University in  1982. With a vision to create a community and inspire others to serve,  they brought education to the underserved populations of the Yakima  Valley.   Today, Heritage University has grown immensely and now offers more  than 50 undergraduate and graduate majors. The high-quality education  and inclusive environment has led to over 9,500 graduated students who  will continue to grow their legacy.   Martha, Violet, and Sister Kathleen saw an opportunity to have an  impact on the lives of their friends and neighbors, and it is safe to  say they exceeded their goal.   Their perseverance, ambition, and service to the community are an  inspiration for all of us in central Washington, and it is a privilege  and honor to serve them during Women's History Month.                            ____________________
