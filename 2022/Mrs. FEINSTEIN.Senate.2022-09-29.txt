 Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 20th  anniversary of the enactment of the Tibetan Policy Act, which I was  pleased to introduce in the Senate in May 2001, along with 20  bipartisan cosponsors. This critical legislation solidified Congress'  commitment to the Tibetan people, and it makes me so proud to know that  it continues to shape U.S. policy toward Tibet today.   From its enactment, this law set the foundation for U.S. policy  toward Tibet, with the primary goal of preserving the Tibetan way of  life. The Tibetan Policy Act makes it official U.S. policy to preserve  the Tibetan language, religious freedom, and cultural expression and to  press for improved respect for human rights.   The act also addresses the importance of economic development,  education, and healthcare for the preservation and prosperity of the  Tibetan people. This includes addressing the humanitarian needs of  Tibetan refugees and diaspora communities and promoting activities to  protect the environment and sustainably manage the water and other  natural resources of the Tibetan plateau, which has become even more  important now as we deal with extreme heat, flooding, and drought as a  result of climate change.   To achieve these objectives, we established in statute the position  of Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues at the State Department,  whose primary role is to coordinate U.S. Government policies, programs,  and projects concerning Tibet. These include U.S. Government assistance  for nongovernmental organizations to work in Tibetan communities in  China and programs to support human rights and democracy in Tibet,  among others.   The Special Coordinator's central objective, however, is to promote  dialogue between the Chinese Government and Tibet's exiled spiritual  leader, the Dalai Lama, and his representatives. This is very important  to me as I have always believed in the importance of dialogue to  improve mutual understanding and respect, especially with those with  whom you have the deepest disagreements. It was important to me as  mayor of San Francisco, when we developed the first ``sister city''  relationship with Shanghai in 1980, and it remains important to me  today as a U.S. Senator.   However, to my disappointment, dialogue between the Chinese  Government and the Dalai Lama's representatives have stalled since  2010. I have encouraged this and prior administrations at every  opportunity to open and exercise channels of communication with China,  and I likewise call upon the Chinese Government to engage in dialogue  with the Dalai Lama, who is unquestionably the cultural and spiritual  leader of the Tibetan people.   The Tibetan people remain close to my heart, as they are for so many  in California and as they were for my late husband, Richard Blum, who  introduced me to Tibet and felt so passionately about advancing the  human rights of Tibetans and preserving their unique heritage.   I am proud of what we accomplished with this legislation, but there  is more work to be done. It is imperative for those of us in Congress  to continue vigorously supporting the aspirations of  [[Page S5535]]  the Tibetan people, to safeguard their identity and culture, and to  advocate for the importance of dialogue to improve their relations with  the Chinese Government. I urge my colleagues to join me in doing so.                            ____________________
