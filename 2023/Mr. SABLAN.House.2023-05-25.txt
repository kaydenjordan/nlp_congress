 Mr. Speaker, on a day like this, the last day of the week  when Members get to vote by 11 o'clock, and then they start running out  that door, I used to be envious.   Today, I am actually astonished; astonished at the problem before us  and that people have decided to take a break for Memorial Day. When I  go home, I have to go home and face 700 families, veterans and their  families, and their question is going to be: What is going to happen to  our benefits?   You might have to fill out extra paperwork to get it. People will  lose access to their food benefits and their health benefits. Teachers,  firemen, first responders, and police officers, these are the  individuals who are going to lose access to the benefits that they  usually get either from Social Security, from their VA checks, et  cetera.   Mr. Speaker, I think we should all come back tomorrow and continue  the work we have before us. It is too important to allow us to go home.                            ____________________
