 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 910) to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide  a safe harbor related to certain investment fund research reports, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 910         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Access to Investment       Research Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. SAFE HARBOR FOR INVESTMENT FUND RESEARCH.         (a) Expansion of the Safe Harbor.--Not later than the end       of the 180-day period beginning on the date of enactment of       this Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission shall       propose, and not later than the end of the 270-day period       beginning on such date, the Commission shall adopt, upon such       terms, conditions, or requirements as the Commission may       determine necessary or appropriate in the public interest,       for the protection of investors, and for the promotion of       capital formation, revisions to section 230.139 of title 17,       Code of Federal Regulations, to provide that a covered       investment fund research report that is published or       distributed by a broker or dealer--        (1) shall be deemed, for purposes of sections 2(a)(10) and       5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(10),       77e(c)), not to constitute an offer for sale or an offer to       sell a security that is the subject of an offering pursuant       to a registration statement that is effective, even if the       broker or dealer is participating or will participate in the       registered offering of the covered investment fund's       securities; and        (2) shall be deemed to satisfy the conditions of subsection       (a)(1) or (a)(2) of section 230.139 of title 17, Code of       Federal Regulations, or any successor provisions, for       purposes of the Commission's rules and regulations under the       Federal securities laws and the rules of any self-regulatory       organization.        (b) Implementation of Safe Harbor.--In implementing the       safe harbor pursuant to subsection (a), the Commission       shall--        (1) not, in the case of a covered investment fund with a       class of securities in substantially continuous distribution,       condition the safe harbor on whether the broker's or dealer's       publication or distribution of a covered investment fund       research report constitutes such broker's or dealer's       initiation or reinitiation of research coverage on such       covered investment fund or its securities;        (2) not--        (A) require the covered investment fund to have been       registered as an investment company under the Investment       Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) or subject to       the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the       Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m, 78o(d)) for       any period exceeding the period of time referenced under       paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A)(1) of section 230.139 of title 17,       Code of Federal Regulations; or        (B) impose a minimum float provision exceeding that       referenced in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A)(1)(i) of section 230.139       of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations;        (3) provide that a self-regulatory organization may not       maintain or enforce any rule that would--        (A) prohibit the ability of a member to publish or       distribute a covered investment fund research report solely       because the member is also participating in a registered       offering or other distribution of any securities of such       covered investment fund; or        (B) prohibit the ability of a member to participate in a       registered offering or other distribution of securities of a       covered investment fund solely because the member has       published or distributed a covered investment fund research       report about such covered investment fund or its securities;       and        (4) provide that a covered investment fund research report       shall not be subject to section 24(b) of the Investment       Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-24(b)) or the rules and       regulations thereunder, except that such report may still be       subject to such section and the rules and regulations       thereunder to the extent that it is otherwise not subject to       the content standards in the rules of any self-regulatory       organization related to research reports, including those       contained in the rules governing communications with the       public regarding investment companies or substantially       similar standards.        (c) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be       construed as in any way limiting--        (1) the applicability of the antifraud or antimanipulation       provisions of the Federal securities laws and rules adopted       thereunder to a covered investment fund research report,       including section 17 of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C.       77q), section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15       U.S.C. 80a-33), and sections 9 and 10 of the Securities       Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78i, 78j); or        (2) the authority of any self-regulatory organization to       examine or supervise a member's practices in connection with       such member's publication or distribution of a covered       investment fund research report for compliance with       applicable provisions of the Federal securities laws or self-      regulatory organization rules related to research reports,       including those contained in rules governing communications       with the public, or to require the filing of communications       with the public the purpose of which is not to provide       research and analysis of covered investment funds.        (d) Interim Effectiveness of Safe Harbor.--  [[Page H2979]]         (1) In general.--From and after the 270-day period       beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, if the       Commission has not adopted revisions to section 230.139 of       title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, as required by       subsection (a), and until such time as the Commission has       done so, a broker or dealer distributing or publishing a       covered investment fund research report after such date shall       be able to rely on the provisions of section 230.139 of title       17, Code of Federal Regulations, and the broker or dealer's       publication of such report shall be deemed to satisfy the       conditions of subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) of section 230.139       of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, if the covered       investment fund that is the subject of such report satisfies       the reporting history requirements (without regard to Form S-      3 or Form F-3 eligibility) and minimum float provisions of       such subsections for purposes of the Commission's rules and       regulations under the Federal securities laws and the rules       of any self-regulatory organization, as if revised and       implemented in accordance with subsections (a) and (b).        (2) Status of covered investment fund.--After such period       and until the Commission has adopted revisions to section       230.139 and FINRA has revised rule 2210, for purposes of       subsection (c)(7)(O) of such rule, a covered investment fund       shall be deemed to be a security that is listed on a national       securities exchange and that is not subject to section 24(b)       of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-24(b)).        (3) Covered investment funds communications.--        (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B),       communications that concern only covered investment funds       that fall within the scope of section 24(b) of the Investment       Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-24(b)) shall not be       required to be filed with FINRA.        (B) Exception.--FINRA may require the filing of       communications with the public if the purpose of those       communications is not to provide research and analysis of       covered investment funds.        (e) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:        (1) The term ``covered investment fund research report''       means a research report published or distributed by a broker       or dealer about a covered investment fund or any securities       issued by the covered investment fund, but not including a       research report to the extent that it is published or       distributed by the covered investment fund or any affiliate       of the covered investment fund.        (2) The term ``covered investment fund'' means--        (A) an investment company registered under, or that has       filed an election to be treated as a business development       company under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that       has filed a registration statement under the Securities Act       of 1933 for the public offering of a class of its securities,       which registration statement has been declared effective by       the Commission; and        (B) a trust or other person--        (i) issuing securities in an offering registered under the       Securities Act of 1933 and which class of securities is       listed for trading on a national securities exchange;        (ii) the assets of which consist primarily of commodities,       currencies, or derivative instruments that reference       commodities or currencies, or interests in the foregoing; and        (iii) that provides in its registration statement under the       Securities Act of 1933 that a class of its securities are       purchased or redeemed, subject to conditions or limitations,       for a ratable share of its assets.        (3) The term ``FINRA'' means the Financial Industry       Regulatory Authority.        (4) The term ``research report'' has the meaning given that       term under section 2(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15       U.S.C. 77b(a)(3)), except that such term shall not include an       oral communication.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arkansas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arkansas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today I rise in support of H.R. 910, the Fair Access to Investment  Research Act, which I have had the pleasure of working on with my  friend from Illinois (Mr. Foster) in this Congress and now-Governor  Carney in the last Congress.   Mr. Foster, I had the pleasure to speak with Governor Carney this  weekend and tell him of our great collaboration in this Congress, and  he sends his warmest regards for the process.   This bill, Mr. Speaker, is a commonsense, bipartisan, bicameral  effort to increase access to research and information on exchange- traded funds, or ETFs, an important and rapidly growing investment  vehicle in the United States and around the world.   Before coming to Congress, I worked in the banking and investment  industry for nearly three decades, and I have witnessed firsthand the  explosive growth in the ETF industry. Since I started my latest firm in  the late 1990s, I have seen the exchange-traded fund selection grow  from about 100 funds with about $100 billion in total assets to today's  2,000 funds with about $2.4 trillion in investment assets.   However, despite this rapid growth in the popularity in the ETF  market and their increasing importance to retail investors, most  broker-dealers do not publish research on ETFs due to anomalies in our  securities laws and regulations.   The SEC has implemented safe harbors for research in support of  various asset classes, including listed stocks, corporate debt, and  closed-ended funds, and Congress has provided explicit safe harbors for  research related to the offerings of emerging growth company  securities. However, despite their similarities to those asset classes,  ETFs do not benefit from similar safe harbors.   An ETF safe harbor is also not a novel concept to the Commission, and  there is bipartisan consensus that this is something that the SEC  should have done years ago. In addition to providing feedback on this  bill for the past 3 years, the SEC, itself, has looked at granting a  safe harbor for ETF research on multiple occasions but never quite got  around to it.   The Fair Access to Investment Research Act simply directs the SEC to  provide a safe harbor for research reports that cover ETFs so that  these reports are not considered offers under the Federal securities  laws. Because ETFs are continuously brought to the market, a safe  harbor is necessary for broker-dealers to publish this research.   It also holds the SEC accountable to Congress by providing an interim  safe harbor if the SEC does not act within a 270-day period, which  would be effective until the Commission finalizes its rules in this  area.   Providing this safe harbor will increase access to investment  information for consumers and improve the efficiency of our capital  markets. Given the importance of ETFs to the market and to the 6  million or so U.S. households that hold ETFs, steps to facilitate  research and allow investors access to this useful information are long  overdue.   Mr. Speaker, we want more information for our consumers about how  their investments work, how an ETF fits into their investment  portfolio, how it is consistent with their time horizon and their  goals, and what the transaction costs are. What are the unique  strategies around that ETF? Does it, in fact, use leverage or not? All  these kinds of details will help our consumers know more about these  products.   As our Capital Markets Subcommittee ranking member, Mrs. Maloney,  stated so eloquently at our markup earlier this year: It makes sense to  get more research out there on ETFs. After all, if you are concerned  with the growth of ETFs, then the last thing you want is less research.   True it is.   This bill in no way undermines or eliminates any investor protections  in the Federal securities laws or the SEC's ability to oversee the  registration and sale of ETF securities explicitly, containing a rule  of construction that the applicability of the antifraud and  antimanipulation provisions of the Federal securities laws are in no  way limited by this legislation.   This safe harbor would also only apply to bona fide research and in  no way limits FINRA, the Federal securities regulators, and the SEC's  ability to regulate sales and marketing literature that is used for  ETFs.   I would like to thank, again, my colleagues, Mr. Foster and Governor  Carney, Senators Heller and Peters for their work in the United States  Senate, my chairman, the ranking member, and Mrs. Maloney and the staff  on both sides of the aisle for their hard work on this pro-consumer,  commonsense proposal to make more information available to America's  investing households.   In March, H.R. 910 passed the House Financial Services Committee by  an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 56-2,  [[Page H2980]]  and a similar version of this legislation passed the House in the last  Congress by a vote of 411-6.   I urge all my colleagues to support this bill today, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Illinois for his  comments and his constructive help on designing and completing the  legislative process on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, an integral process of getting this bill completed was  certainly by our staff, and I want to pay particular attention to Holli  Heiles of my personal staff, who, this day, leaves the world of the  personal staff and moves to the Subcommittee on Capital Markets,  Securities, and Investments of the House Financial Services Committee.  I want to thank Holli Heiles for her outstanding work on this bill and  for her outstanding work on behalf of the people of the Second  Congressional District of Arkansas, as well as to congratulate her on  her move to the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work done together on this  bill. I don't have any other speakers on this particular bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bacon). The question is on the motion  offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 910, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1312) to amend the Small Business Investment Incentive Act of  1980 to require an annual review by the Securities and Exchange  Commission of the annual government-business forum on capital formation  that is held pursuant to such Act, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1312         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Capital       Formation Enhancement Act''.       SEC. 2. ANNUAL REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT-BUSINESS FORUM ON CAPITAL                     FORMATION.         Section 503 of the Small Business Investment Incentive Act       of 1980 (15 U.S.C. 80c-1) is amended by adding at the end the       following:        ``(e) The Commission shall--        ``(1) review the findings and recommendations of the forum;       and        ``(2) each time the forum submits a finding or       recommendation to the Commission, promptly issue a public       statement--        ``(A) assessing the finding or recommendation of the forum;       and        ``(B) disclosing the action, if any, the Commission intends       to take with respect to the finding or recommendation.        ``(f) Forum Findings.--Nothing in this section shall       require the Commission to agree to or act upon any finding or       recommendation of the forum.''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arkansas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arkansas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1312, the Small Business  Capital Formation Enhancement Act, which would require the Securities  and Exchange Commission to respond to the recommendations from its  annual forum on small business capital formation.   Small businesses are the backbone of the U.S. economy, and, according  to the SBA, have provided 55 percent of all jobs and 66 percent of all  net new jobs over the past 40 years. These small  [[Page H2981]]  businesses are intimately familiar with their businesses and the  regulatory environment, and who better to provide insights to  regulators and lawmakers on how to best provide and promote capital  formation and remove unnecessary regulatory barriers and burdens?   Nearly four decades ago, in 1980, Congress recognized the importance  of our small-business owners and their having a voice and sharing their  recommendations with the SEC, and Congress required the SEC to conduct  an annual forum to review the current status and issues surrounding  small business capital formation. But while the Commission is required  to conduct this forum, its obligation goes no further.   Though the SEC often praises this small business forum and the  insights and recommendations from the small business community, the SEC  has no obligation to respond to or act on the forum's recommendations  and findings and has rarely done so. For example, many of the  provisions of the JOBS Act came from recommendations from the small  business forum, but it was Congress who had to move forward with these  ideas, not the SEC.   This commonsense bill introduced by Mr. Poliquin and Mr. Vargas would  require the SEC to formally respond to these recommendations just like  they legally have to acknowledge and respond to recommendations from  their Investor Advisory Committee. Similar legislation passed the House  last Congress by a nearly unanimous vote, and, earlier this year, H.R.  1312 passed the House Financial Services Committee by a unanimous vote.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill,  and I thank, again, my good friends from Maine and from California for  their hard work on this bipartisan bill that ensures the voice of our  small business community is heard.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I appreciate the gentlewoman from New  York's views and her helpful work on this legislation.   We have lost over the last 20 years some 50 percent of our public  companies. When I was getting out of college, one of the great dreams  in business would be that you could have a company that was so  successful that you could go public. Over the years, obviously that  process has made it more and more difficult for our entrepreneurs to  pursue their dream of a public company.   So what better way to make sure their voice about our rules, our  laws, the process of being public, and the process of registering and  disclosing is all made in a way that does not discourage our  entrepreneurs and our small-business people from pursuing that dream of  going public.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr.  Poliquin), my distinguished friend who serves on the House Financial  Services Committee and is a gentleman who is a voice for small business  at every meeting of the House Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 1312, as amended.   The question was taken.

[[Page H2982]]    The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1366         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``U.S. Territories Investor       Protection Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. TERMINATION OF EXEMPTION.         (a) In General.--Section 6(a) of the Investment Company Act       of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-6(a)) is amended by striking paragraph       (1).        (b) Effective Date and Safe Harbor.--        (1) Effective date.--Except as provided in paragraph (2),       the amendment made by subsection (a) shall take effect on the       date of the enactment of this Act.        (2) Safe harbor.--With respect to a company that is exempt       under section 6(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940       (15 U.S.C. 80a-6(a)(1)) on the day before the date of the       enactment of this Act, the amendment made by subsection (a)       shall take effect on the date that is 3 years after the date       of the enactment of this Act.        (3) Extension of safe harbor.--The Securities and Exchange       Commission, by rule and regulation upon its own motion, or by       order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally,       under section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15       U.S.C. 80a-6(c)), further delay the effective date for a       company described in paragraph (2) for a maximum of 3 years       following the initial 3-year period if, before the end of the       initial 3-year period, the Commission determines that such a       rule, regulation, motion, or order is necessary or       appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of       investors.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arkansas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on this bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arkansas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today I rise in support of H.R. 1366, the U.S. Territories Investor  Protection Act, and I thank my friend and colleague from New York for  her exceptional efforts in designing and bringing this bill to us  today.   H.R. 1366 repeals a provision in the Investment Company Act of 1940  that exempts investment companies in Puerto Rico, Guam, and other U.S.  territories from registering with the Securities and Exchange  Commission, the SEC, so that they have to play by the same rules as  their mainland counterparts.   When Congress first enacted the Investment Company Act in the 1940s,  a nonregistration exemption for investment companies in the  noncontiguous territories made a lot of sense as it was extremely  expensive and difficult for the SEC to send staff to travel to these  territories and inspect the local companies. In fact, Mr. Speaker, back  in the 1940s, Eastern Air Lines bragged of their 6-hour-and-10-minute  service between New York and San Juan one way for $1,700 in today's  money. So, in fact, it was challenging to get to the territories.   But with all the significant advances in technology and travel, these  logistical barriers no longer exist. As such, this bill repeals this  archaic exemption and provides a reasonable and safe harbor to allow  those companies currently subject to the exemption to transition.   Similar legislation passed the House in the last Congress by voice  vote, and, earlier this year, H.R. 1366 passed the House Financial  Services Committee by a unanimous vote.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank my friend from New York for her leadership and her  voice on behalf of Puerto Rico and the islands in this regard, and for  her long public service and particular leadership in this time of  important change in Puerto Rico.   Recently, Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to take an all-too-quick  trip to San Juan to assess the current economic conditions on the  island. It was too brief in that it was less than a day, which seems  completely unfair to any visitor to the beautiful island of Puerto  Rico.   I want to thank my host, our distinguished delegate from the  Commonwealth, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon for hosting me on that visit. I  thank her for her cosponsorship on this bill and her leadership on the  island here in Congress. We are grateful to have her as a new Member of  this body.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).  [[Page H2983]]    Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in  support of the U.S. Territories Investor Protection Act. I am a  cosponsor of this bill, and I thank Representative Velazquez for  introducing H.R. 1366 and the Members who have joined in supporting  this important legislation.   The U.S. Territories Investor Protection Act will close a loophole in  the current law. By passing this bill, Congress will bring to Puerto  Rico's investors the same protections enjoyed by investors residing in  the 50 States.   Under current law, investment funds that are located and organized in  the U.S. territories and sell to only residents of the territories are  exempted from the Investment Company Act of 1940, which governs  entities, such as mutual and exchange-traded funds.   Because of this exemption, investment companies located in the U.S.  territories can sell their products to territory residents while not  being subjected to the oversight, disclosure, and conflict-of-interest  requirements that govern investment companies located in the States. As  a result, investors residing in Puerto Rico and the other territories  have experienced investment losses, some of which likely would have  been prohibited had the 1940 act applied to the territories.   For example, UBS operating in Puerto Rico served as an adviser to  Puerto Rico's Employees Retirement System and, in 2008, led the  underwriting of a $2.9 billion bond issue for the government pension  agency. UBS then placed $1.7 billion of those funds into UBS-managed  mutual funds that UBS then sold exclusively to customers on the island.  This investment would have been forbidden by the Investment Company Act  if these funds were sold in the States.   The Puerto Rican investors holding these bonds have suffered massive  losses and are claiming that UBS did not properly disclose the risks of  these funds. On the island, hundreds of these customers have filed  arbitration claims with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and  seek more than $1.1 billion in damages. UBS continues to lose these  cases for failing its fiduciary responsibilities.   Today's vote on H.R. 1366 will help end such outrageous investment  abuse and gives Congress another opportunity to align the laws  governing Puerto Rico and the other territories with the laws governing  the 50 States.   H.R. 1366 will remove the territories' exemption and make the  Investment Company Act of 1940 apply to companies that are located,  organized in, and sell to residents of the territories.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 1366,  the U.S. Territories Investor Protection Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. McClintock). The question is on the  motion offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1366.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
