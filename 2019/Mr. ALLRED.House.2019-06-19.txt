 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the outgoing mayor  of Dallas, Mike Rawlings, for his 8 years of exceptional service to our  great city.   Under the mayor's leadership, Dallas saw incredible economic growth.  Unemployment has outperformed the State and national rate for 51  consecutive months.   There is no better advocate for Dallas, as the mayor traveled all  over the world working to bring investment to our city and help every  part of the city succeed. He helped to improve the quality of life by  adding 215 of parklands and 40 miles of trails. He has worked to close  the gaps in opportunity in our city.   Maya Angelou said: ``You may not control all the events that happen  to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.'' Mayor Rawlings  showed incredible leadership in times of crisis, and there is no better  example than the grace and leadership he showed in handling the July 7,  2016, attacks on Dallas police officers. He has been a unifying voice  for our city.   As a son of Dallas, I want to thank Mayor Rawlings for his service.                            ____________________
