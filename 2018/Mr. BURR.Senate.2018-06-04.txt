 Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate with the  citizens of Madison, NC, the town's 200 years of rich history. Named  for President James Madison, the town was acquired at auction in June  1818.   In Madison's infancy, tobacco was a high-demand commodity and  employer in town due to its location on the Dan and Mayor Rivers, which  offer fertile soil for cultivation. By the late 1800s, Madison was home  to more than 40 tobacco factories, 1 reported to have been the largest  grower of tobacco in the world at that time. In the early 1900s,  Madison reaped the benefits of a growth in the textiles industry when  Gem Dandy, Inc., opened for business in town. It remains headquartered  there today. Madison gained another employer in the mid-1990s when  Remington Arms made Madison home to its headquarters.   Today Madison boasts two historic districts and several landmarks  listed on the National Register of Historic Places.   I am proud to offer my congratulations to the citizens of Madison, NC  on the occasion of their bicentennial.                            ____________________
