 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 24, which seeks  to nullify the duly enacted laws of the District of Columbia and  violates the principle of local, democratic self-government, which is  at the heart of the home rule charter for Washington, D.C., and also  violates the equal protection and democratic principles that animate  our Constitution.   I would like to begin just by observing a striking juxtaposition in  contrast between the address we heard last night, the State of the  Union Address from the President, and the lecture that we just received  now from the floor leader.   President Biden appeared here with a message of unity under the  powerful economic growth that we are experiencing as a country--12  million new jobs added, record progress that we are making on climate  change, massive investment in the American people in the Inflation  Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Act, the $1.2 trillion investment  in the roads, highways, bridges, ports, and airports.    We are dramatically reducing healthcare costs for people in the  Medicare program, reducing to $35 a month what diabetics have to pay  for their insulin shots.   We are making progress for America. So, what do our good friends  across the aisle come back with today, the day after this great  statement of national purpose and progress? They want us to become the  supercouncil for the District of Columbia and begin to micromanage the  bills that are being passed by the representatives locally of 713,000  people.   With no national agenda, with no plans for getting on board with  American progress, what do they have? Well, they are going to bring us  a whole series of these disapproval resolutions for the people of  Washington, D.C.   They don't want to vote in Washington, D.C. They don't want to live  in D.C. They can move to D.C. and run for D.C. Council if that is their  interest, but no, they just want to lord it over the people of  Washington.   They don't like the District of Columbia's voting rules, and they  don't like the criminal justice reform they just engaged in for a  period of a decade with judges and lawyers, the D.C. Bar, and the  people participating. They don't have a hearing on any of it. They just  want to decree that they are going to strike it down.   Just you wait, they will be coming back with gun safety laws that  will appear in Congress from the people in D.C. because there is that  part of the home rule charter that gives us this opportunity if we want  to micromanage their policies.   We will see gun safety laws; we will see abortion legislation; we  will see equal rights for the LGBTQ population--all of these things the  Republican minority used to do a long time ago. They have brought back  the worst possible instincts.   They don't want to have a hearing on it. We didn't have a single  hearing in the Oversight and Accountability Committee about any of this  legislation. None of it.   Did they go to the D.C. Council when it was debated? No, they didn't  do that.   Did they invite the Mayor or the D.C. Council to come here? No, they  didn't do that.   They just decided they are going to slap around the local population.  None of us would accept it for the localities that we represent.   Now, it so happens that people in Washington, D.C., are not just a  locality and municipality. The people in Washington are involved right  now in a petition for statehood admission to the Union.   In fact, in the 116th Congress and the 117th Congress, this body  voted to approve their petition for statehood, but our friends across  the aisle opposed that.   It passed the House. If the Senate had approved it, well, then the  people of D.C., or whatever their local system is, would be able to  decide these things on their own, just like the people in New York City  or Albany or any other town in New York would be able to decide for  themselves.  [[Page H764]]    I thought that our friends over there were interested in local self- government. I thought they supported home rule, but apparently not when  it comes to the people of Washington, D.C.   We reject this throwback attempt at micromanaging the affairs of the  people of Washington. They don't need lectures about voting rights.  They need voting rights. They are the only population of taxpaying,  draftable American citizens in the country who don't have equal voting  rights in Congress.   When January 6 came and people stormed this Chamber and waged  violence against the Capitol Police, against the Metropolitan Police  Department, against hundreds of people who live in Washington, as well  as in Maryland and Virginia, the people of Washington stood with  democracy. They stood with Congress.   They have a legitimate grievance, not a phony, counterfeit grievance.  They are not claiming to have won an election they didn't win. All they  are asking for is equal rights.   Let's grant them their statehood. If you can't stomach the idea that  they would be a State, at least allow them their home rule rights to  decide for themselves who is going to vote in Washington, D.C., what  their criminal laws are going to be, what their laws on abortion are  going to be, and what their civil rights and civil liberties practices  are going to be in the District of Columbia.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to make a couple of corrections.   First of all, the D.C. legislation that would be disapproved by this  resolution allows only for voting in local elections--school board  elections, Advisory Neighborhood Commission elections, council  elections. It does not allow voting in Federal elections for  noncitizens.                                time  1715    The Constitution, contrary to what the gentlewoman said, permits  noncitizen voting at the local level, and there are a number of  jurisdictions that do that.   Mr. Speaker, yield 5 minutes to the very distinguished gentlewoman  from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I was just reviewing some materials that showed that  both the States that the gentlewoman from Colorado and the gentleman  from New York represent had noncitizen voting in the 18th, 19th, and,  in the case of Colorado, up to the 20th century. So I think if they are  talking about giving away the sacred right to vote, their States have  done that before.   It has got a kind of interesting history to it. To me, it is  basically irrelevant because it is not our decision to be making. It is  up to the people of D.C., just like it is up to the voters of Colorado  and it is up to the voters in New York.   But the history of it is intriguing because when the country  started--as I am sure the gentlewoman is aware--there were race  qualifications for voting and there were gender qualifications for  voting. It was only through social struggle that these were removed.  But at the beginning of the Republic, all that mattered was the  property qualification--the wealth and property qualification--for  White men. If you were a White man, regardless of your citizenship  status, you had the right to vote.   That lasted basically up to the Civil War. But it became a bone of  contention between the North and the South because the Northern States  were continuing to defend alien suffrage and the Southern States  opposed it. In fact, Mr. Speaker, if you look at Article I of the  Confederate Constitution, the very first thing it does, it says that  you must be a citizen of the Confederacy in order to vote there.   They didn't want noncitizens voting.   Why?   Because the immigrants were overwhelmingly antislavery.   It was very clear in the debates in Congress about this that the  Southern States wanted to get rid of it, which is why the Confederacy  banned it. After the Civil War, noncitizen voting spread around the  country.   But the point is that when we are talking about local noncitizen  voting--who is going to vote in your school board or town council  elections--that should be decided locally.   My colleagues who are the ones determined not to make the District of  Columbia a State should be the first ones to say that if it is just a  local government, then let them decide on who is going to vote on  matters of garbage collection and who their teachers are going to be.  The jurisdictions that have done this, like Los Angeles, have wanted to  make sure that parents in local public schools get the right to vote  regardless of their citizenship status.    Most of the noncitizens, of course, are lawful residents, people with  green cards, and permanent residents, and they want them to be engaged  and involved.   In any event, if my friends really support home rule and local self- determination, they will allow the people of Washington, D.C., to  decide.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Ocasio-Cortez).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  just to respond to the gentleman before he goes, perhaps.   When I said that they were returning to their worst possible  instincts, that was actually a bipartisan comment because in the old  days it was Democrats, racist Dixiecrats on the House District  Committee who lorded over the District of Columbia and denied the  people of Washington their rights. They are returning us to those days  where Congress will micromanage the affairs of Washington, D.C., and  not allow the people their own self-government.   He said you don't need to be a Republican or a Democrat to understand  the issue. It would actually help to know your Abraham Lincoln because,  of course, Lincoln was a major defender of noncitizen voting to the  extent you guys want to act like a super D.C. Council and get into the  merits of it.   In fact, when he was elected, his Southern opponents said he was  elected on the strength of the noncitizen vote in New York, as a matter  of fact, and in Illinois and other States where they had so-called  declarant alien suffrage, which means if you are on the pathway to  citizenship you are allowed to vote, which is a policy that makes a lot  of sense, but different jurisdictions have different policies according  to home rule and self-government.   When Lincoln was here, his major legislative initiative,  interestingly enough, was to abolish the slave traffic in the District  of Columbia because he felt that freedom and democracy should obtain in  the Nation's Capital. That is something that our colleagues should also  think about in terms of defining an agenda of their party. I know they  are careening from this issue to that issue, but if you are thinking  about D.C., think about what Abraham Lincoln did.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, the distinguished gentlewoman from Colorado  boasts that her State is number one in auto thefts, number one in bank  robberies, and number two in fentanyl, as I understand it. It sounds  like they have got their hands full with their own problems, and I  don't know that they should be spending their time dictating to the  people of Washington, D.C., what their voting rights policy is going to  be.   Now both the gentlewoman from Colorado and the gentleman from New  York invite the question of would it actually be administratively  possible for a jurisdiction to have two separate voting lists for those  who are eligible to vote just in local elections and those who are  eligible to vote in both local and Federal elections?   Well, that is a great question that you could have posed at a hearing  within the Oversight Committee if we had one, but we didn't have it. I  actually happen to have researched this question, and there are a  number of jurisdictions around the country which permit noncitizen  voting at the local level, and they have one list for that. If you are  a noncitizen when you enter, your name is checked off that list, and  you get one ballot which is just for your school board elections and  the local elections. Then if you are a citizen, you get a complete  ballot that includes local, State, and Federal elections, so there  actually is an answer, and it is working in multiple jurisdictions  around the country, including several in my home State of Maryland. I  think the same thing used to be able to work in New York State as well;  so that is something that would be easily researchable, and it is  something also that we could have answered if we had followed regular  order and actually had so much as one hearing on this subject before  deciding to jump in like King Kong and squash the people of Washington,  D.C.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from the District of Columbia, (Ms. Norton), the distinguished  nonvoting Delegate.                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I should say that none of those  jurisdictions have been overrun with fentanyl or illegal aliens. All of  those jurisdictions are functioning democratic self-governmental units,  just as the jurisdictions in New York and Colorado that had the same  practice were.   This really isn't about noncitizen voting, Mr. Speaker. This is about  democratic self-government and allowing local jurisdictions to make  home rule decisions for themselves because this isn't the end of it. It  is just the beginning.   Tomorrow, I think we are going to be considering a resolution of  disapproval for the District of Columbia's criminal justice reform that  they have engaged in over the last 9 or 10 years involving Federal  judges, local judges, council members, the D.C. Bar, and so on. We  didn't know anything about that. We didn't have a hearing. Yet, someone  is going to pick something out.   What the good chairman of our committee talked about in the Rules  Committee was a carjacking law where I guess the minimum sentence  changed. Well, we looked up Kentucky. Kentucky doesn't even have a  carjacking law. You would have to use armed robbery, which can only get  you 20 years. The District of Columbia would treat carjacking with up  to a 24-year sentence.   These are the kinds of measurements we are going to have to go  through with everybody's State and everybody's jurisdiction if we are  really going to turn ourselves into the super-D.C. Council and try to  get to know the people of Washington and what their concerns are and  what they are into.   The whole reason we went to home rule in 1973 was so that Congress  could spend its time on national policy issues, the kind that President  Biden was talking about last night. We just added 12 million new jobs  to the American economy. We passed a $1.2 trillion infrastructure plan  to invest in the ports, airports, bridges, roads, and highways all  across America, not just in the District of Columbia, no insult  intended. That is a very tiny part of the jurisdiction of Congress, and  they want to turn us basically into an appellate legislative division  over the District of Columbia.   Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This legislation promises to be the first of many. I think tomorrow  criminal justice reform comes up. I know that the MAGA wing of the  Republican Party doesn't like Medicaid-funded abortions in Washington,  D.C. They don't like the stricter gun safety laws that the people of  Washington, D.C., have passed. They don't like their progressive  legislation protective of the LGBTQ community and so on.   We are headed now for a mini culture war between the dominant MAGA  wing of the Republican Conference today and the people of the District  of Columbia, who find themselves in an odd situation because they want  to be admitted to the Union the way 37 States have been admitted to the  Union after the original 13 were.   That means, by the way, that three-quarters of the States, nearly 75  percent of the States, came in after the original 13. They appealed to  Congress to use our powers under Article IV of the Constitution to  admit new States. They had exercised their powers under the First  Amendment, under the Ninth Amendment, and under the 10th Amendment to  organize a new statehood constitution and to petition for admission to  the Union.   Our muscle memory is weak here because it hasn't happened since  Hawaii and Alaska, but Thomas Jefferson thought that this was the  destiny of communities under the United States of America. We would not  be a colonial power that would continue to lord over people  perpetually. On the contrary, when he talked about the Northwest  Ordinance, he said as sufficient population formed and as commitment to  democratic principles were realized, these new communities would be  admitted as States.   I think, as a matter of basic civic respect and self-respect, we owe  the people of Washington our attention when they are asking for  admission to the Union. These are people who pay more per capita in  Federal taxes than anybody in the country, more in hard dollars, I  believe, than the people of 18 or 20 States. They have served in every  war that America has ever fought. They are subject to the military  draft.   It is just that when Eleanor Holmes Norton, the distinguished  professor of constitutional law from Georgetown University, comes to  this floor, she comes as a nonvoting Delegate. There is no  representation and no voice over in the Senate. That is an offense to  basic democratic principles that we teach children in second grade.    We should be passing statehood again in the 118th Congress the way we  passed it in the 117th, the way we passed it in the 116th, and we  should get the Senate to focus on it. Short of that, the very last  thing we should be doing is rolling back the limited rights the people  of Washington have to exercise home rule powers.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this resolution, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
