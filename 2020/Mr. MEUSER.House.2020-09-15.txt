 Mr. Speaker, the Commitment to America introduced by  House Republicans is a plan which can be accomplished in the next  Congress with the right leadership in place. It is our commitment to  the American public that we have clear objectives and we will deliver  results for the people.   The plan calls for us to restore our way of life, rebuild our  economy, and renew the American Dream.   As we restore our way of life, we will defeat the coronavirus by  expanding rapid testing capabilities and developing a vaccine that is  safe and effective sooner rather than later.   We will rebuild our economy with unprecedented growth, including,  once again, regaining historically low unemployment for all, including  women, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans.   We will rebuild by continuing to support employees and employers,  upgrading and modernizing our infrastructure, and implementing free and  reciprocal trade agreements that give made-in-USA products and farmers  a competitive edge on the world stage.   We will renew the American Dream by providing every child the  opportunity to attend an excellent school, every veteran a choice in  healthcare and job opportunities, every citizen a pathway to pursue a  meaningful career, and every senior an assurance that Social Security  and Medicare will be protected.   This Republican Commitment to America plan is the framework to  complete a great American comeback and ensure a great future for our  country.                            ____________________
