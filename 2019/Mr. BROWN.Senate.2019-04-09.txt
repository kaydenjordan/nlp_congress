 Madam President, we lost an American hero today--the last  in the line of heroes that will I explain in a moment. He was Ohio  native Lt. Col. Richard Cole, and he was the last of the fabled  Doolittle Raiders.   In the spring of 1942, the Nation was reeling from Pearl Harbor, and  80 Americans embarked on a mission that many thought to be impossible.  They knew the dangers. They knew many of them would not come home. The  Raiders showed America and the world that the United States and the  Allied Forces could win the war. It was considered a turning point in  the news coverage and in people's minds.   Like my dad, the Doolittle Raiders came from a generation that spoke  proudly of their service to their country. They rarely drew attention  or talked much about their own courage. They sought no recognition but,  oh, how they earned it.   It was an honor to help award the Congressional Gold Medal to the  Doolittle Raiders in Washington 4 years ago--a long time in coming and  so deserved. I believe, at that time, there were five Doolittle Raiders  left, and after the death of Mr. Cole, there are none today.   I am so glad that Dick Cole was able to live to receive that medal,  as were a handful of others. These men are no longer with us, so it is  all the more important that we continue to tell their story. My heart  goes out to the families and friends of Lieutenant Colonel Cole and to  those of all the Raiders. I thank the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders  Association for keeping that memory alive.
