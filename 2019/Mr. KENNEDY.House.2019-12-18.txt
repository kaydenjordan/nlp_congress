 Madam Speaker, ``Dear Ellie and James. This is a moment  that you will read about in your history books.   ``Today I will vote to impeach the President of the United States.   ``I want you to know why. He broke our laws. He threatened our  security. He abused the highest, most sacred office in our land.   ``I want you to know that it does not feel good. I can't stop  thinking about the cost to our country. Not just the impeachable  offenses, but the collateral damage of a President who uses power like  a weapon against his own people, erodes our decency, degrades our  dignity.   ``I don't yet know how they will tell the story of this era, but I  want to tell you the story of this day. Let the record show that today  justice won, that we did our job, that we kept our word, that we stood  our sacred ground.   ``Let the record show that we did not let you down.   ``I love you. Listen to Mom. Be home soon.''                                time  1100
