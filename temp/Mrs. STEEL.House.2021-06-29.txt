 Madam Speaker, I rise to condemn the Chinese Communist  Party for 100 years of human rights violations.   The CCP centennial is not a cause for celebration but a time to  reflect on the millions of people who have been repressed, tortured,  and killed at the hands of the Communist regime.  [[Page H3292]]    From the suppression of a free press in Hong Kong to the mass  internment and torture of the Uighurs, the record of human rights  abuses carried out by CCP is as horrific as it is long.   We must hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable. As a member of  the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, I am committed to  working with my colleagues to hold China responsible for their abuse.   Madam Speaker, I stand with those fighting for freedom and democracy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Suozzi for leading  this important tax matter. It is very important to our constituents.   Taxpayers in California's 48th Congressional District, which I am  proud to represent, were responsible for 19.8 percent of all SALT  deductions in 2018.   The average SALT deduction lost in my district was $28,532. In a  place like Orange County, where we already pay some of the highest  taxes in the country, this cap takes more money from hardworking  families.   There were great improvements made in the 2017 tax reform law, like  simplifying the tax code and making the corporate tax rate more on par  with other nations. But it also chose winners and losers; and,  unfortunately, those in high-cost-of-living States, like in New York  and California, are paying the price.   This is a bipartisan issue because we know how much this affects  hardworking families in these high-cost States. I do think we can make  progress on this, but not at the cost of raising taxes on Americans and  American businesses, especially at a time when we are working to  rebuild our local economies and get businesses back open.   This is a bipartisan issue. We can't muddy the water by adding it to  partisan legislation that will pass on party line only. I don't want to  see additional tax gimmicks come before Congress. I want the deduction  back on the table.   I am proud to support two pieces of legislation that would fully  repeal the SALT cap. One bill by my fellow Californian,  Mike Garcia;  and the other one by New York Congressman   Thomas Suozzi.   Our constituents should keep more of their hard-earned money. It  belongs to them, not the Federal Government.   I am proud to join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  continue calling for a repeal of the SALT cap.
