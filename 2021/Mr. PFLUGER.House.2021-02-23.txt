 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of my friend, Luke Letlow.   Luke and I spoke many times as we both prepared to enter Congress,  and we shared the privilege of both representing districts that are  centered around a couple of very important things, faith, family and  agriculture. I looked forward to serving with him and working together  to better the lives of our farmers and our ranchers across the district  and across the entire country.   Luke led a life of public service to the good people in the great  State of Louisiana from a young age, beginning as a young college  graduate serving on the staff of Congressman John Cooksey, the  Representative of Louisiana's Fifth District at that time.   He went on to serve the people in multiple capacities before  launching a successful Congressional bid of his own.   He was a man of faith in Jesus Christ, and he lived his life in  accordance with His guiding principles. There is no way for us to know  the thousands of lives that he had already touched before he entered  into a plan to run for Congress, and how many lives he touched in those  years of service, and the countless others who were blessed just by  knowing him.   There was nothing that he loved more than serving others and  primarily, his love of being a husband and a father, a husband to his  wife, Julia, and a father to their two children, Jeremiah and  Jacqueline, something that his legacy will live on forever in our  hearts.   Today, we give glory to God for his life and pause to reflect on that  legacy which will live on through Julia, Jeremiah, and Jacqueline. My  prayers are with all of them.   His passing is a tremendous loss to this U.S. Congress, to the State  of Louisiana and, more importantly, to his family and friends who loved  him and cherished him.                                time  1945
