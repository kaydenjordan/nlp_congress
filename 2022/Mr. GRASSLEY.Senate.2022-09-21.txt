 Mr. President, today, roughly 175 Americans will die  from fentanyl poisoning. Many of them won't even know that they have  taken the fentanyl. They will think they have taken Xanax for anxiety  or oxycodone for pain. That is what Devin Anderson--you will see his  picture here in a minute--of Shelby, IA, thought when he took a  fentanyl pill marked like an oxy.   Devin had fought hard for his sobriety. He had enrolled in treatment  and moved back home, but he was struggling with anxiety. To cope, he  took a pill from a friend.   Devin's coworker came to pick him up for work in the early morning of  February 24 of this year. Devin wasn't ready, so his coworker called  him. When Devin didn't answer, he called again. Devin's 14-year-old  brother heard the phone ringing. He went downstairs to investigate and  found Devin unresponsive.   Devin was 23 years old when he died. His mom wants you to know that  Devin was a kind person and he was loved by his friends.   In 2021, fentanyl killed more Americans between the ages of 18 and 45  than any other cause. That is more than COVID-19, cancer, and car  accidents combined.   Six months ago, I stood where I am now and asked for a permanent  solution for fentanyl scheduling. Today, we are absolutely no closer to  a permanent solution than we were back then, 6 months ago.   While Congress has been waiting to take action, the cartels have not.  The cartels have simply rebranded, coloring fentanyl like candy to  addict America's children. Fentanyl is in our schools, like in  Blackwood, NJ, where a 12-year-old overdosed on a schoolbus after his  uncle made him clean a fentanyl trap house; or in Chipman Junior High  School in California, where a 13-year-old brought 150 fake Percocet  pills laced with fentanyl, with 4 out of every 10 fake pills containing  a potentially lethal dosage of fentanyl. Both of these schools are  hours away from the Mexican border, but despite Customs and Border  Protection's efforts, fentanyl has reached our children's hands.   So when the Vice President tells the press that our border is secure,  we all know that is just plain wrong and irresponsible, and that  attitude, that the border is secure, ends up killing.   In the Federal Government's absence, parents like Arletha and Robert  Gilliam have been forced to fill the void. Their daughter Ciara died  last month because of fentanyl. And you see Ciara right here. By all  accounts, Ciara had a big heart. As her dad puts it, if you were in a  bad mood, Ciara would make sure that that bad mood didn't last very  long. Even though she had graduated from Iowa's Ankeny Centennial High  School and lived on her own, she still FaceTimed her mom every day.   But on August 23 of this year, no one could get hold of Ciara, so her  grandparents drove by her house. Her car was in the driveway. Ciara's  grandparents knocked, both on her doors and her windows, with no  response. Finally, Ciara's grandpa crawled through her bedroom window.  There, he found her dead on her bedroom floor. Fentanyl shut down her  organs, and she went to sleep. She never woke up again. She was only 22  years old.   Ciara's parents are now searching for answers they never should have  had to find in the first place. They have offered a $50,000 award to  locate the dealer who supplied the fake pill that killed their  daughter. They deserve better than that. They deserve congressional  action, and they deserved it in 2017 when the DEA, the Drug Enforcement  Administration, first scheduled fentanyl.   Grieving parents are the unsung heroes in the fight against fentanyl.  Time after time, they push through their heartbreaks to share their  stories, as you have heard me tell for two families, and now they  demand action so that more kids don't die. It is time for Congress to  match the efforts of those parents.   The Department of Justice has been very clear:         The permanent scheduling of FRS is critical to the safety       and health of our communities and class-wide scheduling       provides a vital tool to combat overdose deaths in [America].    End of quote from the Department of Justice.   For those whom we have lost, like Ciara and Devin, and for the  countless lives that we will save if we take action, it is time that we  give them the  [[Page S4893]]  tool they need, and that is the scheduling of fentanyl--and on a  permanent, long-term basis.                  Combating Violent and Dangerous Crime Act    Mr. President, on another subject--and a shorter subject for anybody  waiting to talk--it is dangerous to live in many places in America,  especially in blue cities. Like inflation, violent crime remains very  high. For example, compared to 2019 midyear figures, America's largest  cities have seen a 50-percent increase in murders and a 36-percent  increase in aggravated assaults. And it is no mystery what is causing  this spike in crime. Blue city progressive, pro-criminal prosecutors  and radical bail reform laws fuel this spike, a spike in violent crime,  by letting dangerous, repeat criminals go unpunished and, in some  cases, even uncharged.   The recent tragedies in Memphis, TN, earlier this month underscore  the dangers that families face at the hands of chronic criminals. And  remember the words ``chronic criminals'' because the fact is that the  majority of violent crimes are committed by a relative handful of  repeat offenders like the two in Memphis. For example, criminals in  Chicago charged with shootings and murders have, on average, 12 prior  arrests. In Oakland, CA, only around 400 people, or just one-tenth of 1  percent of Oakland's population, were responsible for a majority of the  city's murders. Now, just think, one-tenth of 1 percent of the  population of that city is responsible for a majority of the murders in  Oakland.   Federal law enforcement has a unique and very vital role in targeting  repeat violent criminals, but for the last 2 years, the Senate's  ability to actually pass bills that expand criminal law to reduce  violent crime and target repeat violent criminals has hit a brick wall.  It is just impossible to get any consensus even though we all know it  is a very major problem.   In July, as part of my effort to promote a solution to this problem  of major crime caused by a very small number of people in each  community, I introduced a bill that I entitled ``Combating Violent and  Dangerous Crime,'' which is cosponsored by 26 of my Republican  colleagues in the Senate. The House companion bill was introduced  September 15, with seven Republican cosponsors.   The bill has seven simple solutions that will help to reverse this  violent crime spike by putting dangerous criminals in jail and keeping  them there. These commonsense solutions will fix real problems and  bring immediate relief and increased safety to communities plagued by  the scourge of violent crime.   Given the unprecedented increase in murders, we can and we should  make it easier to prosecute murders. This bill will do that.   Mr. President, 2021 was the deadliest year to be a law enforcement  officer since 9/11. We should make it easier to prosecute people who  attack law enforcement. This bill will do that.   Carjackings are way up nationwide--200, 300, and even 400 percent in  some cities. We should deter carjacking with sufficient sentences. This  bill will do that.   Dangerous drugs are being marketed to young people as colorful  candy--I just spoke about that--and these children are dying from  overdoses. We should make it so that no children die from fentanyl made  to look like candy. This bill will do that.   Bank robbery, kidnapping--the list of violent crimes that would be  strengthened by this bill goes on and on.   I stand ready to work with Democrats who want to provide relief to  their constituents from this crimewave. So if any of them are open to  any of these provisions, I want them to know that I am ready to work  with them. Let's partner together to make the American people safer.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I think you all might remember when the  Biden administration's so-called  [[Page S4894]]  experts claimed that inflation was ``transitory.'' It ended up that  they couldn't have been more wrong by using that word.   Since President Biden took office, Iowans have seen prices rise 13.7  percent. That adds an extra $666 to their monthly budget. Couple that  with falling real wages, and Iowans have been strapped very thin.   This combination of rising prices and falling real wages has hit  rural Iowa communities particularly hard. As a result, according to a  report issued by Iowa State University, the disposable income of rural  Iowans fell 33 percent over the past 12 months alone. It is no wonder,  then, that the high cost of living is the number one concern that I  hear about from Iowans as I travel all of our 99 counties.   However, here in DC--and remember, DC is an island surrounded by  reality--here in this town, the primary concern of President Biden and  congressional Democrats has been enacting their very partisan agenda.   They have refused to work with Republicans on sensible policies to  tame inflation and provide targeted relief. In the process of doing  that, they haven't even followed the advice of their own brethren. And  I will use Larry Summers as an example, that Harvard professor and  former Secretary of Treasury. He said, way back in January, before this  President was sworn in, that the economy was turned around: Don't spend  any more money or you are going to have inflation.   And, immediately, within 60 days of being in office, this new  President and this new Congress passed a $2 trillion appropriations  bill to feed the fires of inflation.   So instead of taming inflation, they rebranded the reckless tax-and- spending spree that they had pursued for more than a year as a bill  recently passed called the Inflation Reduction Act, which I call the  ``Inflation Enhancement Act''--never mind that outside experts  uniformly concluded the bill's hodgepodge of the Green New Deal and the  subsidies that go with that program and the tax hikes would do nothing  to address inflation today.   Of course, if you want to stop inflation, now caused by excessive  government spending, the first thing you should do is stop spending; or  another way you can say it--and common sense dictates this: When you  are in a hole, quit digging.   Instead, Democrats doubled down with Big Government spending and  coupled it with job-killing tax hikes. The National Association of  Manufacturers said they would lose about 217,000 jobs. Democrats'  policy decisions made even less sense given that, only a week before,  we learned our economy had shrunk for two straight quarters, indicating  recession.   And everyone knows, as President Obama once said--and this seems to  be the third term of the Obama Presidency, but this is what he said  when he was actually President:         The last thing you want to do is to raise taxes in the       middle of a recession.    And yet it was done in that bill in August by more than $300 billion.  The last thing our economy needed was another tax-and-spending spree,  but Democrats just couldn't let go of their wish list.   What is more, at the height of hypocrisy, Democrats touted the  Inflation Reduction Act as an example of fiscal responsibility. Yet the  supposed savings they claim will result from the bill was then  immediately dwarfed in just 1 day of actions by President Biden's  unilateral student loan announcement, which will cost American  taxpayers at least $500 billion. And some people are saying it could  cost up to $1 trillion.   When President Biden announced that he was wiping out $10,000 to  $20,000 of student loan debt for people making as much as $150,000 or  $250,000 for households, that likely illegal action will send the bill  for this student loan giveaway to Americans who did not attend college  or people who graduated from college already paying off their college  expenses. And at the same time, it is going to fuel the fires of  inflation.   So much, then, for the lip service about deficit reduction and  inflation. But we now know that that inflation was not transitory. It  is persistent. Iowans are sick and tired of paying the price for the  failures of this Biden economy.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
