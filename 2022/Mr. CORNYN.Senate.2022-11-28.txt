 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, as the Senate knows, this week, we will  be voting on a bill called the Respect for Marriage Act. Tonight, we  will vote on a procedural matter to move that legislation along.  [[Page S6814]]    Supporters of this legislation have framed it as a way to protect the  rights of same-sex couples to get married in any State in America. To  be clear, that is already the law of the land. It has been so since  2015 when the Supreme Court ruled in the Obergefell case, and there is  no reason to believe that this decision is in any imminent jeopardy.   Some colleagues have tried to claim that because of the Supreme  Court's decision in the Dobbs case, which overruled Roe v. Wade, that  somehow that has opened the floodgates of the Supreme Court to overrule  all of the precedent that it disagrees with. Well, the Justices, in  their concurring opinions in Dobbs, made clear that is not true. For  example, they mentioned landmark precedents like Griswold v.  Connecticut, Loving v. Virginia, and, notably, Obergefell v. Hodges.   One Justice wrote:         I emphasize what the Court today states: Overruling Roe       does not mean the overruling of those precedents, and does       not threaten or cast doubt on those precedents.    I don't know what more the Supreme Court can say to indicate that  Obergefell is not threatened by this Court anytime soon. So I am left  with the conclusion that this idea that we have to pass this  legislation in order to preserve what has already been recognized by  the Supreme Court as a constitutional right, that this is based on,  frankly, a scare tactic. Nevertheless, some of our colleagues claim  this legislation is absolutely necessary.   But while this bill does not move the needle on same-sex marriage,  this legislation will raise serious issues for religious liberty. We  all know that many Americans hold sincere beliefs--religious beliefs-- objecting to same-sex marriage. Obergefell did not place any new  requirement on those individuals or their religious institutions. The  Obergefell decision coexists today with other Supreme Court precedents,  like Masterpiece Cakeshop or Fulton v. City of Philadelphia or Burwell  v. Hobby Lobby.   Each of these decisions recognized that religious liberties shall and  must be protected as required by our Constitution; namely, the equal  protection clause and the free exercise clause.   For example, Obergefell doesn't compel Catholic priests or Jewish  rabbis to conduct marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples, but it  certainly doesn't subject religious organizations or faith-based  institutions or even private citizens to lawsuits for exercising their  deeply-held religious objections to same-sex marriage. If the Respect  for Marriage Act becomes law as it is currently proposed, without  amendment, that would change. Unlike Obergefell, this legislation  expressly empowers private litigants to sue religious institutions,  faith-based organizations, and private parties who oppose or have  sincere, religious-held beliefs against same-sex marriage.   Think back to the Masterpiece Cakeshop lawsuit. The owner of a bakery  in Colorado declined the request to make a wedding cake for a same-sex  couple because it didn't align with his religious beliefs. If this  legislation passes, we can expect similar lawsuits by secular warriors  targeting people, from cake bakers, to florists, to website creators,  to venue owners, or just about any other small business that doesn't  bend a knee to their world view.   But it is not just individuals with deeply held religious beliefs who  will have a target placed on their backs; it is also religious  institutions themselves. I am not talking about churches or synagogues  or mosques; I am talking about many of the faith-based social service  agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and charities that are  supported by people of faith as part of their mission. Well, this  legislation would permit a private lawsuit against let's say an  institution of higher learning, like a major university, or your  child's preschool or Mother's Day Out. It includes religious charities  and nonprofits that carry out incredibly meaningful and important work,  and it includes anyone acting ``under [the] color of State law.''   Now, that is an interesting choice of the scope of this right of a  private right of action--anyone acting under the color of State law.  This is a very broad term that comes directly from the text of the  bill, and it is not clear entirely who would be subject to this  provision.   If a person receives a professional license from their State to serve  as a lawyer, an accountant, a bartender, a realtor, or a barber, are  they acting under color of State law? I think that is a plausible  argument. If a nonprofit receives public funds to perform a service on  behalf of the government, are they acting under color of State law? It  is not clear, and it needs to be clear.   The range of people who can be sued will only be limited by lawyers'  imaginations. Trial lawyers and the Biden Department of Justice could  have a field day. Individuals and organizations that are trying to do  good works consistent with their faith would be forced to spend a small  fortune defending themselves in court, just as the owner of Masterpiece  Cakeshop did for 10 years.   This legislation could open the door for the government to take  serious action against religious institutions for adhering to their  sincerely held religious beliefs. The Federal Government could deny  grants for research to colleges and universities like Baylor  University, Southern Methodist University or Texas Christian University  in my State. Faith-based groups and nongovernmental organizations could  be barred from working with the Federal Government to take care of the  tens of thousands of unaccompanied children who are coming across our  border as part of the current border crisis. Cities and States could  deny foster care permits and licenses to religious organizations that  do an immeasurable amount of good, including Catholic Charities, the  Little Sisters of the Poor, and Buckner International. The Internal  Revenue Service could seek to revoke the tax-exempt status of  organizations that fail to comply with this new secular mandate.   Now, lest we think that is a fever dream or a conspiracy theory, let  me just take you back to the Obergefell argument. Justice Alito asked  the Solicitor General if an institution that opposed same-sex marriage  could lose its tax-exempt status. The Solicitor General said: ``It's  certainly going to be an issue.'' He was correct, and now the issue is  front and center.   Now, I believe that the sponsors of this legislation sincerely  believe that the consequences I am describing will not follow. They may  believe, in good faith, that they have protected the free exercise of  religion and religious liberties. But I don't believe they have been  successful in doing that. That is why I believe that the amendments  that have been proposed by Senator Rubio, Senator Lee, and Senator  Lankford should be voted on to make clear what I think the sponsors of  this legislation intended to do but weren't quite successful in clearly  accomplishing.   Well, just remember the IRS has virtually unlimited authority to  target religious schools, nonprofits, and organizations by revoking  their tax-exempt status, leaving them to the dead end of ruinous and  years-consuming litigation.   Now, this isn't, like I said, a farfetched conspiracy or an  unrealistic doomsday scenario. We have seen what a politically  motivated Internal Revenue Service can do.   Perhaps we all remember the IRS targeting controversy under the Obama  administration. Under the leadership of Lois Lerner, bureaucrats  subjected conservative groups to a different level of scrutiny, when  examining their tax-exempt status, from left-leaning groups. Employees  of the IRS actually developed a spreadsheet that became known as the  ``Be on the Lookout'' list or simply the BOLO list. If the name of the  political group included terms like ``tea party'' or ``patriot,'' it  was subjected to a different level of scrutiny.   These IRS bureaucrats delayed the approval of these organizations'  tax-exempt status and requested completely unnecessary information. It  asked some applicants to disclose the names of their donors, as well as  the amounts of each donation, which is constitutionally suspect. A pro- life group was even asked to provide the percentage of time that the  group spent on prayer groups compared with their other activities.   Well, this IRS targeting scandal happened about a decade ago, but,  since then, the IRS has been given even more power and more authority.  The most recent reckless tax-and-spending bill, the so-called Inflation  Reduction Act,  [[Page S6815]]  gave the Internal Revenue Service an additional $80 billion and 87,000  new IRS agents. This army of new agents would have the capability to  turn its attention on every church school and organization that did not  recognize same-sex marriage because of their sincerely held religious  beliefs.   So you have to wonder: Who will be on the BOLO list next? Given  everything we have seen and the experience we have had in this area, I  can't say I have much confidence in how this will be handled.   So, to summarize, this legislation does not move the needle in terms  of the rights of same-sex couples. They can already marry in every  State in the country, and this bill doesn't change that. What it will  do is force religious organizations to make an impossible choice:  Abandon your beliefs or face the wrath of the U.S. Government.   So let me just repeat what I said a moment ago. I believe the  proponents of this legislation thought they were protecting and  preserving the religious liberties of people with sincerely held  religious beliefs. But when they include a private right-of-action for  someone acting under ``color of State law,'' it refers to any public  act, any right or claim, and, as I said, you can interpret ``color of  state law'' to cover everything from professional licensing to teaching  certificates, to building permits, to food and beverage licenses.   So, I think, if the proponents of this legislation really believe  that protecting religious liberty should be our goal, the best way to  accomplish that is to allow votes on these amendments by Senator Lee,  Senator Rubio, and Senator Lankford, who provided an extra clear  assurance that this legislation does not constitute a national policy  endorsing a specific view of marriage.   I know it may sound like a simple clarification, but it could mean  the difference between faith-based nonprofits ending up in the  crosshairs of the IRS or some private-party lawsuit claiming they are  operating under color of State law and the ability to maintain their  tax-exempt status or carry on the important good work that many  organizations do in our communities all across the country.   So if that indeed is the purpose of our colleagues--to try to protect  those religious organizations, those people of faith who are doing good  works that we want to encourage and we want to support--then I believe  that we can accomplish their goal by passing the amendments that have  been proposed by Senator Lee, Senator Rubio, and Senator Lankford. If  that is their goal, they shouldn't have any objection to this  clarification.   But we simply can't stand by and allow this legislation--or any  legislation, for that matter--to foot stomp the First Amendment rights  of people of faith. Unless this bill is amended, it will invite a wave  of lawsuits against churches, synagogues, mosques, and religious  nonprofits, simply because they are living in accordance with their  faith.   One other thing I should point out that was mentioned by the U.S.  Conference of Catholic Bishops is that, in the one area that I would  call it a safe harbor to protect religious liberty--I think it is 6(b)  in the bill that has been offered--the protection of religious liberty  that, again, I think, our colleagues in good faith intended to provide,  is limited to those ``whose principal purpose is the study, practice,  or advancement of religion.'' So that clearly would involve things like  church services or religious observations at a mosque or synagogue. But  would it cover a church's daycare facility that provides for the  children whose parents attend their church? Would it cover universities  like I mentioned earlier--Baylor University, a Baptist university,  Southern Methodist University, Texas Christian University--and the work  they do? How about Catholic Charities, which is one of the principal  providers of humanitarian services at the border, which resulted due to  the border crisis that we are experiencing.   None of those would be protected, I would argue, under the limitation  in section 6(b), and this was actually pointed out by the U.S.  Conference of Catholic Bishops. I think they are right.   But again, if the goal of the bill is to preserve religious liberty,  I think the bill needs to be amended. Religious liberty is the  cornerstone of our democracy. It is explicitly protected by the U.S.  Constitution, and we cannot allow it to be trampled on.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
