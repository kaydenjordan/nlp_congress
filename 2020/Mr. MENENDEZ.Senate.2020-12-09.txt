 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act  of 1976, I move to discharge the Foreign Relations Committee from  further consideration of S.J. Res. 77, a joint resolution providing for  congressional disapproval of the proposed foreign military sale to the  United Arab Emirates of certain defense articles and services.    Mr. President, today I am asking our colleagues to  stand up for two very important principles. One is the congressional  oversight over arms sales abroad and, secondly, to ensure that these  sales, in fact, promote and protect the long-term national security of  the United States.   Colleagues, I wish we didn't find ourselves in the position of having  to discuss our concerns with this sale in this kind of forum. The  United Arab Emirates has, indeed, been an important partner in the  fight against terrorism and across the region and, I believe, will  continue to do so. However, a sale of this magnitude requires the  appropriate due diligence.   For the past few decades, the executive branch has respected the  congressional oversight of the arms sales process, a critical piece of  which is an informal review period during which we get answers to  pressing questions. We have an opportunity to review sensitive  information so that, when sales come up for the formal notification,  which is what we have before us now, we have a clearer path forward.  Unfortunately, in this case, the Trump administration decided to simply  ignore congressional rights here and the review process, formally  notifying the sales of these complex weapons systems, along with other  weaponry, totaling $23 billion.   Beyond obliterating the congressional review process, the  administration also seems to have rushed through the interagency review  of a sale of this magnitude. Whereas, a sale of this scope would  normally merit months and months of detailed deliberations between the  Departments of Defense and State, this sale was announced with more  missing than a few dotted i's and crossed t's.   I will go into more detail later before we vote, but the bottom line  is that there are many outstanding issues that are critical to U.S.  national security that have not been addressed, including, by way of  example, the United Arab Emirates' present and future military  relationships with Russia and China. My understanding is that there are  negotiations to have with China regarding an airstrip for the Chinese  military off of the UAE. Is that in the national interest and security  of the United States?   Should we not have a definitive commitment from the UAE that it will  not move forward if these arms sales move forward, including with the  most sophisticated stealth jet fighter that we have? How do we work to  safeguard U.S. technology? the guarantees we will have in place about  how U.S.-origin weapons will be used given the Emirates' history of  transferring weapons to a terrorist organization and violating the U.N.  arms embargo in Libya? the longer term implications of an arms race in  the region? and then, yes, the impact that it could have on both our  and Israel's qualitative military edge?   If we aren't going to be willing to ask these questions, then we have  to think about the magnitude of the sale without caring about the  consequences.   I have heard a number of my colleagues advocate in support of these  sales because they believe it will help our like-minded partners better  posture against Iran. Now, no one is more clear-eyed in this Chamber or  has pursued Iran and its threat of nuclear weapons more than I, and we  are clear-eyed about the threat Iran continues to pose to national  security interests, but we have yet to understand exactly what military  threat the F-35s or armed drones will be addressing vis-a-vis Iran.  Furthermore, according to the Trump administration, as recently as last  year, the UAE continued to host a number of companies that facilitated  Iranian financial transactions in violation of various U.S. sanctions.   So Iran is a threat, but you are helping it facilitate U.S. financial  transactions. It is not that I have said so but that the Trump  administration has said so. Meanwhile, over the past year, Iran has  ramped up its nuclear capabilities amidst American diplomatic fallout.   So, if we really want to talk about countering Iran, we need a  comprehensive, diplomatic strategy. Arming partners with complex  weapons systems that could take years to come online is not a serious  strategy with which to confront the very real and timely threats from  Iran.   I have also heard some of our colleagues argue that, if we do not  sell these weapons, the UAE will turn to China and Russia. Well, let's  be clear: They already do. They already do. Our own Department of  Defense's inspector general recently reported that the UAE may be  funding the Russian mercenary Wagner Group in Libya. U.N. reporting  implicates the UAE's use of Chinese-manufactured drones, in violation  of the U.N. arms embargo, also in Libya.   So, while I absolutely agree that we have to counter Chinese and  Russian influence in the region, again, this requires a real strategy,  not simply more arms. Isn't this a conversation and a commitment that  we should get in writing from the UAE as part of such an arms sale? We  don't have that. Furthermore, if we go forward with these sales, yet  deny similar requests to countries like Qatar or Saudi Arabia, where  will they go for their advanced weaponry to keep pace, and what  reaction will Iran have to them? Do we really think we can sell this  just to the UAE and not have those other countries come knocking on our  door, starting a very sophisticated arms race in a tinder box of the  world?   Finally, let me be very clear: I applaud the Abraham accords as a  historical turning point for Israel and the Arab world. These new,  formal relationships have the possibility of transforming the region  much more broadly and bringing peace, stability, and prosperity to  people who desperately want  [[Page S7297]]  and deserve it. Yet, as the administration and the Emirates have  continued to stress, these sales are neither a reward nor are they part  of these accords.   So why can't we take a little more time to really assess the best way  forward? We are in the midst of promoting a sale--this is the  administration--that has some of the most significant transfers of  advanced U.S. technology without clarity of a number of key details  regarding the sale or sufficient answers to critical national security  questions. This is far more than about congressional prerogative,  although I would argue that it is a critical element of our policies on  arms sales; this is about national security concerns to which we should  have an answer before those arms sales move forward.   Again, colleagues, the bottom line is this: There are far too many  outstanding questions and very serious questions about long-term U.S.  national security interests. Perhaps, after considerable engagement  with the executive, we would assess that all of these sales do, in  fact, advance our national security. Given the length of time it will  take for the delivery of these systems, it would seem quite reasonable  to expect to have 40 days to evaluate these questions.   So I urge my colleagues to stand up for Congress's role in the  process of determining arms sales as well as for having clear answers  to the critical questions that are posed to long-term U.S. national  security interests.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support these two resolutions of disapproval. I appreciate my  distinguished colleague from Kentucky and his support and advocacy here  in these particular arms sales to the United Arab Emirates.   Simply put, many aspects of this proposed sale remain conceptual-- conceptual. We are being asked to support a significant transfer of  advanced U.S. technology without clarity on a number of key details  regarding the sale or sufficient answers to critical national security  questions.   There are simply too many outstanding questions about the protection  of critical U.S. military technology and the broader implications of  these sales to U.S. national security regarding the UAE's  relationships, for example, with Russia and China as they exist today-- as they exist today.   I have heard some of my colleagues say: Well, aren't we concerned  that they will go to Russia--they have relationships with Russia and  China as it exists today in a military purchase context--and about the  long-term implications, of course, to the United States and to our  ally, the State of Israel, in terms of national security?   Now, it is disappointing that we are forced to discuss these issues  in such a public way through a formal congressional expression of  disapproval. That is not normally how we do this. However, the  administration left us no  [[Page S7315]]  choice because of the way that it attempted to rush through these sales  by completely subverting congressional oversight, and, it appears,  increasingly, the need for greater interagency review.   Now, the U.S. Congress has a unique legislative responsibility to  oversee U.S. arms sales abroad. This process allows Congress to engage  privately with relevant national security agencies and the intended  recipient countries in order to better understand the intricacies and  security implications of any proposed sale. But as it has done before,  the administration decided to ignore the congressional responsibilities  here and rush through with this sale. They blew right through that  period of review that the Congress has had normally for about 40 days.   Let me just say, the United Arab Emirates, from my view, has been an  important partner in the fight against terrorism and for other U.S.  national security priorities, and I will suspect it will continue to be  so after this. It is unfortunate, however, that we find ourselves in  this situation.   Following the historic Abraham accords, we started hearing that the  administration was planning to grant the UAE a longstanding request-- the sale of the most advanced U.S. stealth fighter jets. Both the  Emiratis--and I have spoken to their Foreign Minister and to their  Ambassador--and the U.S. administration continued to insist, however,  that there is no connection--none--between the Abraham accords and this  sale. So that is a red herring for those who are concerned that somehow  we are going to disrupt the Abraham accords.   While I join just about all of my colleagues in applauding the  advancement of diplomatic relations that builds upon years already of  Israeli and Emirati engagement, there is absolutely no reason to rush  through an arms sale of this magnitude, especially when we are being  told there is no connection.   Interagency review of such sales usually takes many months of careful  deliberation. The Departments of State, Defense, and others must assess  what capabilities are safe to sell, what technology security measures  are appropriate and necessary, what restrictions on use are imposed,  and how the sale will affect the national security of our friends and  allies in the region and elsewhere.   Once these deliberations have concluded, a sale of this magnitude  usually sits with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for an  informal review process that, by the State Department's own  requirement--the State Department's own requirement--would last 40  days.   Then, for reasons the administration has concealed, it completely  subverted this review process and officially started a statutory 30-day  review--all before any briefings were even given to staff, let alone  Senators and members of the committees of jurisdiction.   To date, we have yet to get a clear answer as to why the President  and the Secretary of State are trying to, again, circumvent the  congressional arms sales oversight process by rushing the sale of 50 of  the most advanced fighter jets in the world--technology that gives  Israel and the United State a critical military advantage over any  adversary.   Moreover, the administration wants to push through without any  congressional oversight the second largest ever sale of armed Reaper  drones to the UAE and over 14,000 additional aircraft munitions on top  of the 60,000 already sold to Abu Dhabi as part of the nonemergency  last year. I say ``nonemergency'' because they declared an emergency,  but there was no emergency to be justified.   Delivery of the most advanced features could take years. I say that  because, therefore, there is no reason that giving us a timeframe to do  what we normally do to determine whether this is the right sale in the  national security interests of the United States, not starting an arms  race in the Middle East, also dealing with Israel--is that too much to  answer when you are not even going to get any of this equipment for  years? These are major sales by any measure.   Part of this conversation is also, as my colleague has said, about  Israel's qualitative military edge that it currently has over its  neighbors and was expected to maintain with its own purchase of 50 F- 35s that are still in the process of being built and delivered.   Let me make it clear. I take a backseat to no one when it comes to  advancing U.S. policies to protect Israel's national security. I have  proven that time and again. But this sale is fundamentally about U.S.  national security, about the U.S. qualitative military edge, and about  our long-term national security. It is also about not wanting to start  and thinking about, at least, what does it mean in terms of an advanced  arms race in the region.   Unfortunately, particularly for Members who do not serve on national  security committees, there is much we cannot discuss in an open  setting, but let me assure all of my colleagues that these sales have  very real implications for their own technology security.   On October 9 of this year, Armed Services ranking member Senator Reed  and I sent a letter to former Secretary of Defense Esper and Secretary  of State Pompeo with 16 detailed questions about the F-35 sale. To  date, we have not received satisfactory answers to any or all of those  questions.   I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the  Congressional Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       Hon. Mike Pompeo,      Secretary of State, Department of State, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mark Esper,      Secretary of Defense, Department of Defense, Washington, DC.        Dear Secretary Pompeo and Secretary Esper: We write today       to seek clarity on public reporting and mixed messaging from       the Administration on a proposed sale of the F-35 aircraft to       the United Arab Emirates. As you well know, Congress has       statutory authority over foreign arms sales, but it appears       that the Administration is trying to rush through a       precedent-setting sale of the United States' most advanced       fighter aircraft to a country in a volatile region with       multiple ongoing conflicts. The Administration appears to be       ignoring long-standing, deliberative, internal U.S. processes       for considering whether selling such a sophisticated and       mission-critical military system abroad could compromise the       United States' national security interests--and in this case       Israel's--and instead is rushing to meet a political       deadline.        There are numerous questions as to how the national       security interests of both the U.S. and Israel will be       served, or undermined, by such a sale. We fear that the Trump       Administration's recklessly accelerated timeline will       preclude sufficient and comprehensive consideration of these       issues by the national security professionals in the       Departments of State and Defense, as well as by the Congress.        Emirati officials have publicly and privately declared that       their decision to normalize relations with Israel was not       dependent on getting the F-35; however, the Administration's       attempt to move at breakneck speed so close to this       announcement would give the appearance that it was.       Additionally, this sale seems more tied to the American       political calendar than to a sober deliberation about       regional security.        U.S. national security and the safety of American troops       could be seriously compromised by this sale. The F-35 is one       of the most advanced aircraft in the world, giving the United       States and its allies and partners a tremendous military       advantage. This therefore creates an immense       counterintelligence threat against this aircraft. Indeed,       assessing the risk to our own military advantage is a       critical part of the internal deliberations we must make       before agreeing to provide this aircraft, including any       recipient country's history of use of U.S. origin weapons and       its capacity and willingness to protect critical U.S.       technology. Indeed, given that the F-35 has been financed,       developed, produced, and sold to our security partners as       part of an international consortium, the sale has the risk of       undermining their security as well.        In light of these concerns, we have listed below a series       of vital questions that must be fully answered before this       sale is sent to Congress for review, as required by statute.        1) What precisely has the U.S. agreed to in terms of       selling the F-35 and other aircraft to the UAE?        How many?        On what timeline for delivery?        Has the U.S. received a formal Letter of Request from the       UAE for these aircraft?        2) Would the Emiratis have signed the Abraham Accords if       not for the promise of this sale? Were F-35s or any other       military sales discussed as part of deliberations related to       the Abraham Accords?        3) Has the UAE articulated a military threat necessitating       the acquisition of F-35 aircraft?        How would the UAE employ F-35s against that threat?        Are there other military or other means that could also       counter this threat or threats?  [[Page S7316]]         4) It has been reported that the U.S. and the UAE have       agreed to conclude a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) for       the aircraft by December 2nd. This is an extremely       accelerated schedule for interagency review, consultation       with Congress, and preparation of the LOA and negotiation on       its terms with the UAE--a process that can take months, if       not longer.        Is this deadline correct?        If so, why did the Administration agree to this arbitrary       deadline in concluding an LOA?        How would such an accelerated timeline affect the       Congressional review and approval process?        5) It has traditionally taken months for a complete and       comprehensive interagency review of a proposed sale of this       importance and sensitivity.        Has the U.S. interagency reviewed and determined what       variant of the aircraft would be best to sell, in terms of       protecting the aircraft's technology and in terms of       protecting Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME)?        If not, when will that review commence and how long might       it take?        6) Has a determination been made that the sale of this       aircraft to the UAE will not jeopardize Israel's Qualitative       Military Edge?        If so, upon what basis was that determination made?        7) Will any aircraft sold to the UAE be reduced in       capabilities compared to comparable U.S. aircraft?        If so, how much less capable will these aircraft be       compared to Israeli and U.S. F-35 aircraft and other       aircraft?        Exactly which systems, software, and components will be       reduced in terms of operational capability in comparison with       Israeli and U.S. aircraft, and to what degree and with what       effect? Please provide a detailed written and graphic       comparison.        8) What anti-tamper measures will be incorporated into the       F-35 and other aircraft sold to the UAE to ensure that       critical or sensitive military technology and components       within such aircraft are not compromised, either in operation       or in terms of revealing classified information about such       technology and components?        9) Will the UAE be required to enter into binding       commitments not to employ such aircraft in situations that       might expose them to technological intelligence collection       efforts, such as exposure to advanced anti-aircraft radar       systems?        10) What secondary security measures will be put in place       to protect critical U.S. technology inherent in the F-35?        Will the U.S. require continuous U.S. presence on base to       monitor the security of the aircraft?        Will the U.S. be made aware of any proposed third-party       nationals to visit the base(s) where the F-35 aircraft are       based?        Will the U.S. be able to veto any physical presence of such       nationals if, in the opinion of U.S. personnel present in the       U.S. Embassy or in Washington, the close physical proximity       of such third-party nationals could constitute an       intelligence threat to sensitive technology in or of these       aircraft?        Will any automatic electronic security measures be employed       to protect U.S.-origin aircraft, manuals, and related       documents?        Will the maintenance and servicing of these aircraft be       performed solely by U.S. personnel, or in concert with       Emirati personnel?        11) What measures will be taken to counteract any reduction       in Israel's QME?        Will the U.S. shift from a Qualitative Military Edge       measurement to a Quantitative one, selling or providing more       aircraft and munitions meant to overwhelm the heightened       military threat to Israel?        If so, how will these additional arms to Israel be       financed? Will the U.S. need to increase Foreign Military       Finance levels in order to offset this sale to the UAE?        12) The UAE has taken an active role in supporting Khalifa       Haftar, who has continued a brutal military campaign in Libya       against the internationally recognized Libyan government.       According to recent reports, the UAE may even have violated       the U.N. arms embargo on Libya.        What will prevent the UAE from using F-35 aircraft in       conflicts where the United States and its allies are pressing       for a diplomatic solution?        Will the United States require any commitments from the UAE       that it will not employ such aircraft to the detriment of       Israel's security interests or the foreign policy and       national security interests of the United States, as       determined by the Israel and the U.S. respectively?        13) To what extent would this sale stimulate an arms race       in the region, both among the Gulf States and with Iran? With       the arms embargo against Iran in danger of expiring, would       this sale provide greater encouragement to China and Russia       to sell Tehran advanced fighter aircraft and advanced air       defense systems, in numbers and under more favorable       financial terms than would otherwise be the case?        14) In 2017, the UAE and Russia signed an agreement to       develop a fifth-generation fighter jet, along with a separate       UAE purchase of Russian Sukhoi Su-35 fighters. In addition,       after being rebuffed in its attempts to purchase armed drones       from the United States, the UAE reportedly purchased Chinese       surveillance drones and outfitted them with targeting       systems. Other reports indicate that expatriates from       countries aligned with China operate some of the UAE's       weapons systems.        What is the status of the UAE's cooperation with Russia?       Would these efforts present security and counterintelligence       threats to the F-35?        What assurances and commitments, if any, has the UAE made       to the United States to safeguard U.S. technology from       Russian and Chinese personnel that may be involved in either       of these programs?        Has the UAE agreed to terminate all such cooperation and       purchases from Russia and China?        15) What are the Administration's thoughts regarding other       sales of the F-35 in the region?        16) Have you, or will you, consult with our partners about       these risks and their views of this potential sale to the UAE       concluding the sale?        Will you take their concerns into account during the       interagency review process to address their concerns?        We look forward to your immediate response.            Sincerely,      Robert Menendez,        U.S. Senator.      Jack Reed,        U.S. Senator.     I am not opposed to these sales if they make sense and  pose no threat to U.S. or Israel security in the short and the long  term. But these sales require and deserve careful and deliberate  consideration within the interagency process and by this Congress.  However, that simply has not happened.   A little while ago, my distinguished colleague from Missouri, Senator  Blunt, asked on the floor: Well, what do you have to do to be a trusted  partner? Let me try to answer that question.   Following a classified briefing with the administration--the details  of which I will not discuss here--there are a whole host of issues that  a trusted partner would ultimately have to agree to.   One, the United Arab Emirates has been building its military  relations with Russia and China. Just a few years ago, the Emiratis and  Russia signed an agreement to develop a fifth-generation fighter jet  and to purchase Russian Sukhois. Our own Department of Defense  inspector general recently indicated that they may be funding the  malicious Russian Wagner mercenary forces in Libya. So what is the  status of and what specific efforts are we taking to address the UAE's  current and future military relationship with China--where they are  talking about building an airbase outside the UAE's waters, on  artificial land--and Russia? There are no answers to that. Do we not  deserve, if we are going to send the most sophisticated equipment in  the world to the UAE, to make sure that there is a written commitment  that they are going to phase out those military engagements?   What specific steps and assurances are the United States taking to  safeguard U.S. military technology against sophisticated espionage, and  what specific commitments do we have from the Emiratis? There is no  answer to that question. A trusted partner would agree to those  safeguards.   Three, the UAE last year transferred U.S.-origin weapons to a  terrorist organization in Yemen that has a history of targeting  civilians. The Emiratis have been repeatedly accused, along with  others, of violating the U.N. arms embargo on Libya. Well, what  assurances do we have about how and where these new sophisticated  weapons would be used? There is no answer. A trusted partner would  agree to those limits.   Four, the long-term threat of a highly lethal arms race and the great  power competition implication this could set off across the region and  implications for future gulf cooperation--the Qataris have already  asked for their own F-35s. Is that what is next? Saudi Arabia--well,  they may say: We like the United Arab Emirates, but we can't be  inferior for our own national security.   What security threats would be posed when the entire region is armed  with the most sophisticated weapon we have to offer? There are no  satisfactory answers, if any, to these questions.   What guarantees do we have that these weapons will not be used  against the United States or Israel's national security in the future?  How will that be determined?   What might Israel need in the future to secure its qualitative  military edge? There is no clear answer to that.   What specific military threat have the Emiratis articulated that they  need the F-35s to address right now? If  [[Page S7317]]  they have specific needs, then we need to know that because if these  aren't going to come online for some time, maybe their needs are more  consequential and they need to be dealt with in a different way.   How might the Iranians react to the increase of stealth fighter  aircraft in their neighborhood? We have no analysis of that.   Finally, the timeline. When will the letters of offer and acceptance  be concluded? Why was there an initial artificial deadline? Why the  rush to cut short the normal, monthslong interagency review process by  the Congress and national security professionals? Why? Why? Are they  trying to lock in the sale before President-Elect Biden is inaugurated,  regardless of the possible cost to U.S. and Israeli national security?  We have no answer to that.   As I have said before, the United Arab Emirates has been an important  partner for critical U.S. interests, including the fight against  terrorism and in our efforts in Afghanistan. But according to the  United Nations and to the Department of Defense's own inspector  general, at the same time, the UAE also seems to be working against our  stated interests in other areas. A trusted partner would be in  collaboration and in cooperation with us.   Look, I wish we could have had these discussions in more appropriate  settings. That is what we normally would have done.   This is, of course, not the first time the administration has  subverted Congress's important oversight role in arms sales. Last May,  the administration notified more than $8 billion of weapons to Saudi  Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It cited a bogus ``immediate''  threat from Iran, despite the fact that most of the sales, like these  F-35s, would take years--years--to reach their intended recipients.   So, colleagues, at the end of the day, we must assert our  congressional prerogative, not for the sake of prerogative in and of  itself but to safeguard the U.S. national security interests that we  are all collectively and individually entrusted to do.   We must demand answers to the very serious and very reasonable  questions many have of this sale. Perhaps with due diligence, we will  find that this sale will indeed bolster U.S. national security, but  right now, the truth is, we do not have clarity on that most  fundamental question.   Colleagues, do you really want a sale of this magnitude to go through  without the appropriate vetting measures?   Voting against these resolutions sends a message to the executive  branch--I don't care who is sitting there; the present occupant, a  future occupant--whoever is sitting in the White House, that we are  willing to give up our congressional responsibilities. It is hard to  bring that back once you let it go. It says that we will not stop arms  sales in the future that have not gone through the appropriate review  process.   For that reason, I urge all of our colleagues to support these  resolutions of disapproval so that we may have more time to assess for  ourselves the nuances of these sales and the repercussions they may  have in the region for decades to come, to ensure technology transfer  doesn't take place, and to ensure that the national security interests  of the United States are preserved. I urge you to support these  resolutions to stand up for those propositions. Both are critical to  protecting U.S. national security interests.                  Vote on Motion to Discharge--S.J. Res. 77    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all debate time on S.J.  Res. 77 and S.J. Res. 78 be yielded back.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
