 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Childhood Cancer STAR Act, one of the most comprehensive pieces of  childhood cancer legislation ever taken up by the Congress and another  major bipartisan accomplishment of the House Committee on Energy and  Commerce. I certainly congratulate Dr. Burgess.   It is heartbreaking when a child is stricken with one of these life- threatening diseases. I have met with families who have faced these  terrible circumstances, and I have been touched by their stories of  perseverance and hope.   There is more work to be done. We need to improve Federal services  for the pediatric cancer community, from research and access to  treatment and survivorship. Federal healthcare and research entities  must do all they can. The Childhood Cancer STAR Act delivers more  resources and reform to make sure we are winning the fight against  pediatric cancer by expanding grants for promising and expanded  programs.   Last week I stopped by the Hunterdon County Relay for Life event in  Ringoes, New Jersey. The event brought together cancer patients,  survivors, and their families. The crowd was large and enthusiastic in  the fight against these terrible diseases.   We owe it to those participants to ensure that federally supported  research entities are doing all that they can do in this area. The  Energy and Commerce Committee has made the cause of Cures a centerpiece  of our work. This bill provides greater hope for all of the Nation's  youngest patients and their loved ones.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
