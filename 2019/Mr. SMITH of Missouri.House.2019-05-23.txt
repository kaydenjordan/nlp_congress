 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about a  broken agreement and a missed opportunity to help families save for  their children's education.   In April, the Ways and Means Committee marked up this bill in a very  bipartisan manner. We heard ideas from both sides of the aisle to help  Americans save for the future and their retirements.    Like all good negotiations, there was give and take. No side got  everything they wanted, but we reached an agreement where we could pass  the bill unanimously. In short, this is how the American people expect  their government to work.   Madam Speaker, unfortunately, it became clear that this agreement was  not in good faith. At the last minute, Democrats decided to undermine  our bipartisan work on the Ways and Means Committee and stripped out an  issue many Republicans feel strongly about: helping families afford  everyday K-12 education costs.   Expanding 529 education savings accounts to cover common K-12  expenses would help all families save for their children's education  and their unique needs, no matter where they attend school, whether it  is public school, private school, religious school, homeschool, and so  on.   Madam Speaker, I want to know, what is so controversial about helping  families afford educational therapies for students with disabilities?  What is so controversial about making it easier to pay for tutoring,  books, and standardized testing fees?   This is a missed opportunity to help families afford education costs  no matter where they send their children to school, and it is a shame  that partisan politics is getting in the way of helping families  everywhere.
