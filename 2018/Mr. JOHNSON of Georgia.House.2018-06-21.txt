 Madam Speaker, our job as legislators is to  listen to each other and find common ground, to compromise for the good  of the American people.   Today, Trump Republicans are trying to do comprehensive immigration  reform without any committee hearings with Democrats, with no  consultation. This is a spectacle trying to pass legislation on such an  important subject in such a haphazard and slipshod manner.   Congress can certainly do better than this, and the American people  deserve better than this.   Never again should these Trump Republicans ever claim that they  adhere to regular order. The integrity of our process in this House  depends upon careful consideration of bills through regular order so  that only thoughtful legislation is passed.   In our consideration of important legislation, the debate and the  ability to compromise are essential. Sadly, I fear that we have lost  the ability to engage in honest debate and we have lost the will to  compromise.   Though the ability to compromise is important, we Democrats can't  agree to lock up children in cages. We can't agree to a bill that  leaves Dreamers behind. Compromise does not allow us to turn our backs  on asylum seekers or to stop family immigration or to kill the  diversity visa program or waste billions of dollars building Trump's  border wall. This bill does all those things.   We have a national crisis on our hands, and as we speak, 2,300  children have been torn away from the arms of their parents at the  U.S.-Mexico border, and it is our job to remedy this disgrace and  reunite these families.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues not to support the Border  Security and Immigration Reform Act. A bipartisan solution is out  there, but clearly this bill is not it.
