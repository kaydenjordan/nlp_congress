 Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, I went to the southern  border, and I was shocked and appalled to hear about the humanitarian  crisis, the violence, and the drug smuggling firsthand, on-site.   President Biden's and the Democrats' open border policies have  allowed a record number of illegal immigrants and illegal drugs to  enter our country.   There are staggering numbers of encounters at the border each month,  and more illegal immigrants are, unfortunately, slipping past in areas  without a fence or enough Border Patrol.   Now, the Biden administration is thinking about repealing one of the  more effective methods of deporting illegal immigrants, title 42.   Title 42 is a public health law that authorizes U.S. border agents to  promptly send back migrants and illegal immigrants if they pose a  health risk to Americans and are from a country with a communicable  disease outbreak.   During the height of the COVID crisis, they want to let them in by  repealing title 42. It will mean even more illegal immigration into  this country and eliminate one of the few tools that the administration  has used to expel illegal immigrants.    The audacity of this administration that has tried to force vaccine  mandates on Americans, force them to still wear masks on airplanes and  at airports, and at the same time allowing unlimited illegal  immigration. We must preserve title 42.  [[Page H3901]]                                ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for  leading this tonight. I really appreciate it.   There is so much that could be said about that. I think the really  personal things about Don Young are what I would like to reflect around  this place.   When I first got here almost 10 years ago, we had kind of a common  kinship in that we are both actually from northern California. He was  born in a town near Meridian, California, not far from Yuba City, which  is my back yard too, part of a rice farming outfit there.   I knew his brother Doug from Woodland, part of Republican politics  there. Both these guys are obviously characters.   So, for Don, though, you could tell he was just a pillar, just being  around him. Of course, his portrait is on the wall in the committee  room and such, his work on transportation, but it is the small things  that really make a difference; his warmth, him and his wife Anne, for  me and my staff that would be around him at various events going on  around the district.   We talk a lot about that chair over there, right. And so I sat in the  chair, not because I didn't know, because I did know, and I wanted to  see what would happen.   So I am sitting there, and he walks in. I got this thumb on my ear  here. He grabbed it, and I said oh, I guess it is time for me to go.  Sir, I am just warming the chair up because you are from Alaska. You  need the chair warm for you. He bought that, but I got right out of  there too.   Now, just recently, I think it was last Wednesday, you know, he was  in a wheelchair recently due to issues and such. And so we were heading  to the elevator over here. And most of the time you might yield to that  and let somebody with that issue going on have the elevator to  themselves. Not this group.   Me and about four other guys, we all piled in there with him because  we all wanted to be with Don Young, even just for a short elevator ride  and see what he was going to say and what kind of things were going to  go on.   That is the man we all love and are going to miss terribly and whose  sweet  [[Page H3957]]  wife, Anne, God bless you. It has just been a pleasure knowing and  being with you here.
