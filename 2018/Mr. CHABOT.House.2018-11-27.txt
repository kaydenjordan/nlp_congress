 Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of this  legislation.   I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their  leadership.    I would like to highlight a specific portion of the bill. This  provision preserves an important piece of American history and it  supports American jobs. It would reinstate the Delta Queen's  grandfathered status from a law that prohibits wooden boats from  carrying overnight passengers.   Congress granted the Delta Queen a reprieve from that grandfathered  law, which adversely impacts it, for four decades. In doing so,  Congress recognized that the Delta Queen was constructed before the law  that adversely impacted it was in place and that the law was intended  to regulate vessels at sea, oceangoing vessels. It was never intended  for river-faring boats like the Delta Queen. That is why Congress  granted this reprieve for 40 years. We failed to do that back in 2008.   We are looking at $100 million in development, in economic dollars in  the river areas of this country, including the city of Cincinnati, my  area. It used to be the home port. It will be one of the stops. It  means a lot of jobs for a lot of people. It will be safely done.
