 Madam Speaker, because I have a heart, I will  vote for universal pre-K. I have been to the classrooms, and I have  seen those babies' bright eyes, eager to learn. I have also understood  while I was there that there were other children who wouldn't have that  benefit. They were getting a late start while others were getting a  head start. This universal pre-K will give the same start to all of  these children.   I am voting for the future because I have a heart.
