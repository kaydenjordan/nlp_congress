 Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote on yet  another bipartisan resolution to overturn a harmful Biden  administration regulation.   In its latest iteration, the administration's bid for student loan  socialism--its so-called income-driven repayment scheme--would likely  go down in history as the most expensive Federal regulation in our  history.   Leading estimates predict this policy would heap a $559 billion bill  onto taxpayers over the next decade. In exchange, a majority of the  high-earning borrowers who choose to take on student debt would avoid  ever paying back the principals they borrowed.   The administration's plan would actually remove the guardrails that  ensure Federal loan relief goes to low-income households. Apparently,  loyal blue-State doctors and lawyers are the most important  beneficiaries of student loan socialism.   Whichever way you slice it, the President's policy is a raw deal for  working Americans who have made the sacrifices to pay off their student  loans or avoided debt altogether. But with taxpayers footing the bill,  it is also a powerful incentive for schools to raise the price of  college even higher.   A bipartisan majority of our colleagues has already rejected the  socialist fever dream, and President Biden's first attempt at massive  loan cancellation was actually struck down by the Supreme Court. But  today, thanks to the leadership of Chairman Cassidy, Senator Thune, and  Senator Cornyn, the Senate has another chance to kick student loan  socialism to the curb.   I would urge my colleagues to support the resolution later today.                               Border Security    Mr. President, on another matter, it is impossible to ignore the  crisis at our southern border that has erupted on Washington Democrats'  watch--back-to-back, record-setting years that saw millions upon  millions of illegal arrivals at the border and historic quantities of  fentanyl and other lethal drugs pouring across to decimate American  communities.   Let's remember where this crisis came from. President Biden  campaigned on open-borders policies. His message was so compelling that  crowds literally showed up at the southern border with his campaign  logo on their shirts. As one put it back then, the President had  ``promised us that everything was going to change.''   Vice President Harris offered a refrain of her own. She said:         Say it loud, say it clear, everyone is welcome here.    She called the previous administration's commonsense border security  measures ``criminalizing innocent people.''   Well, this is the administration that canceled commonsense policies  like ``Remain in Mexico,'' shelved DHS resources meant for border wall  construction, and abandoned overstretched border enforcement personnel  to contend with the tidal wave of mass migration.   Today, cleaning up the administration's mess at the southern border  is a matter of urgent national security. I am grateful to a group of  Senate Republicans, including Lankford, Graham, and Cotton, who have  been working in good faith on substantive policy reforms to bring this  crisis under control.   The goal here is simple: Slow the flow, and stop the catch-and- release asylum system that is overrunning border communities and blue  cities alike. The crisis isn't crying out for boatloads of new taxpayer  dollars, just commonsense policy reform.   Unfortunately, Senate Democrats do not appear ready to admit this  reality. They are apparently not ready to seriously address asylum  abuse. That is a stance that has put them out of step with even left- leaning governments across the Western world.   For example, Germany, which is struggling with an asylum caseload  costing roughly $53 billion, is exploring trusted third country  policies to keep asylum seekers outside its borders while their cases  are adjudicated. Finland is considering closing some crossing points  along its borders as Russia weaponizes migrant flows against the West.   Responsible people everywhere recognize that enforcing sovereign  borders isn't some hand-wringing moral outrage. In fact, what is  outrageous is refusing to do so.   The American people deserve safe streets, stable prices, and secure  borders. These are the fundamental responsibilities of any government,  but on all accounts, the Biden administration is failing to deliver.                                    China    Mr. President, now on one final matter, 1 year ago, President Biden  met for the first time with President Xi, the head of the Chinese  Communist Party, and he pledged that the United States would compete  vigorously with the PRC. One year later, the President and the chairman  will meet again--today. So let's take stock of whether the Biden  administration is living up to its pledge of vigorous competition.   The stakes of this competition simply cannot be overstated. The  Chinese military is outpacing us in pivotal military capabilities like  hypersonics, precise long-range fires, and even naval vessels. Beijing  has secured a commanding share of the rare minerals necessary to create  critical supply. Chinese agents are engaged in an aggressive effort to  steal sensitive Western technologies and government secrets. And the  PRC consistently signals its disdain for national sovereignty, human  rights, and the free flow of commerce.   In other words, strategic competition with China is going to  determine the course of the next century of American history. Yet the  Biden administration has too often met this historic moment with  weakness and naivete. Time and time again, it has sacrificed  competition on the altar of green climate policy.    In the administration's quest to turn the American automobile  industry electric, it has apparently made peace with sending American  tax dollars to the Chinese industries that dominate battery-making  inputs. In pursuit of grand climate diplomacy, the administration's  envoys have been literally laughed out of Beijing by a state that keeps  on increasing its carbon emissions and has no plan to start cutting  them literally for years.   Meanwhile, the consequences of the Biden administration's neglect for  American hard power are only getting more dangerous. The PRC is  acquiring new weapons as much as six times faster than the United  States, and for each of the past 2 years, it announced a 7-percent  increase in military spending. But even as the President's national  defense strategy identifies China as ``the pacing threat,'' his defense  budget requests haven't even kept up with inflation.   Chairman Xi has gone out of his way to align closely with fellow  adversaries of the West, stepping up joint military exercises with  Putin's forces and helping both Moscow and Tehran endure Western  sanctions.   China has made military competition with the West a top priority. We  can't afford to ignore this challenge. Our allies certainly aren't.  Japan, South Korea, Australia, and other Indo-Pacific partners are  investing heavily--heavily--in their own defensive.   Taiwan is seeking to make itself a harder target for Chinese  aggression, but America must continue to do its part. We have to keep  investing in the  [[Page S5518]]  sort of defense industrial base that can sustain this armament and  strengthen our own military for effective deterrence. The Senate has  multiple opportunities before us--in both supplemental measures and  full-year Defense appropriations--to do exactly that, and we can't  afford not to seize these opportunities.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
