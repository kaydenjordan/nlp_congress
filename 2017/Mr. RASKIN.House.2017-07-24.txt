 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Fulbright Program, which more than 370,000 people from the United  States and over 180 countries have participated in since its founding  in 1946.   For 70 years, the Fulbright Program has promoted strong relationships  between Americans and other people and stimulated international  education and progress. Some 57 Fulbright Fellows have received Nobel  Prizes; 82 have received the Pulitzer Prize; 33 have gone on to serve  as head of state; and 10 have been elected to the U.S. Congress.   All over the world, more than 370,000 Fulbright alumni are making  waves in science, medicine, public service, art, business,  philanthropy, and education.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump now proposes a staggering 55 percent cut  to the Fulbright Scholar Program. This would devastate a successful and  flourishing project.   Our country benefits enormously from Fulbright Fellows past, present,  and future, and I urge all of my colleagues to continue supporting this  excellent program on a full basis.                            ____________________
