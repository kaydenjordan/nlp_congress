 Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I rise today in support  of the Department of Veterans Affairs and Whistleblower Protection Act,  which the House of Representatives will consider today.   Time and time again, I have called to reform the VA, an organization  that has been mired in a culture of corruption and bureaucratic  incompetence. The VA has consistently failed to meet our Nation's  obligations to veterans, the men and women who have sacrificed so much  in the protection of our freedoms.   This act also provides the necessary protections for those who do the  right thing and come forward to report wrongdoing. This legislation  makes it possible to fire the bad VA employees who have failed our  Nation's veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, along with those in the Senate,  for their hard work and support of this legislation. I look forward to  getting it to the President's desk for his signature and to finally  bringing accountability to the VA.
