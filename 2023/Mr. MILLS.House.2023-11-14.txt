 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This amendment cuts back spending for the Office of Public Health  Scientific Services by more than $158 million to return us back to our  FY19 funding levels. This reins back the irresponsible, ballooned  spending that we have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.   The House of Representatives has to hold itself accountable to fiscal  responsibility. We cannot continue to spend money that we do not have,  entrenching our country into more debt that future generations will be  unable to pay back.   Our public health offices, particularly during COVID-19, have proven  they do not effectively follow scientific method. In fact, I would  argue that this body only follows political science, not medical  science. While some of these offices certainly played roles in helping  to research the effects of COVID, others like the Office of Public  Health Scientific Services, were ineffective and do not serve their  purpose.   We do not need another redundant public health office to advance the  politicized work of the Federal Government's public health operations.  Furthermore, as a businessowner, I know the value of industry driving  policy and not policy driving industry. These cuts encourage increased  collaboration with the private sector to leverage external resources  and expertise to support the public health initiatives.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman actually stepping  up. She asked two key questions that I really liked. First off, what  would it eliminate was one of the questions. Well, what it would  eliminate is the wasteful and fraudulent spending that has gone to the  NIH, as well as to those who have actually continued to pursue things  like gain of function under Fauci, and we saw how that worked out.   The other thing she also questioned, what should we have learned.  Well, what we have learned is that we are actually spinning ourselves  into an economic abyss; the fact that we are actually leading the  Nation when it comes to continually frivolous spending. I love how only  in Washington can we call something emergency spending levels but then  maintain it throughout the period in which we are going to move  forward.   We have to acknowledge the fact that in 2019, pre-COVID spending  levels, if you did a 3\1/2\ percent adjusted rate, that would get us to  an actual spending cap of $1.477 trillion today, not the $1.586  trillion, not the $1.786 trillion, and certainly not the $2 trillion  that the Democrats want to continue to spend.   The bottom line, Mr. Chair, is this: We are not saying that we will  not have the necessary spending for our public health sectors and  others to continue to do their job. What we are saying is that we  should return our spending levels to pre-COVID, pre-emergency levels  that would be in sync with what we have always done, at a 3\1/2\  percent adjusted rate.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, in closing, it is very clear that the only  thing that D.C. continues to do successfully is spend American taxpayer  funding. We did not do what was necessary to mitigate these risks.  There was always this 2 weeks to slow the curve. I wish there were 2  weeks to slow our spending. We need to get back to where we were before  so that we can get control, start looking at economic growth, start  looking at what is best and having industry drive the actual policy,  not policy drive the industry. We need to reduce and limit the  government's reach into the public sector to ensure that they have what  they need driven by them, for them.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment is pretty simple. This would cut  back on the spending for the office of the NIH Director by more than  $160 million to return us back to the fiscal year 2019 funding level.  This amendment ensures appropriate accountability for the NIH's recent  failures while also advancing the urgent need for better fiscal  responsibility of the House.   When the Republicans took over the majority, we promised to rein in  inflation and government spending. We must do more than talk. We must  start to act.   The NIH resoundingly failed to do its due diligence to prevent gain- of-function research at Chinese labs, and this failure was fundamental  to the existence of the virus that caused the pandemic.   To date, there has been absolutely no accountability for these  failures and others, and Congress would be failing its duty to ensure  accountability by doing nothing and continuing this irresponsible  funding to the NIH.   We must stop Fauci's experimental process, start holding  accountability, get research into finding out exactly what the leading  cause was, and make sure we have the necessary prevention.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman for her  acknowledgment that we have increased spending by $8.4 billion, of  which some of that funding led to additional trillions of dollars in  spending and thousands of lives lost, as we funded things like the gain  of function under Fauci, which led to the spread of COVID.                                time  1400    Now, when you talk about the cut of $160 million, the only response  that I can think of is you are welcome. You are welcome to the American  people for us saving money and for us actually doing our job to be  fiscally responsible once again.   You are welcome that we won't allow continuation of funding for gain  of function that would lead to another pandemic, as we saw across the  world. You are welcome that we are actually, in the Republican Party as  the majority, taking a stand to stop the out-of-control and runaway  spending that has been irresponsible and driving generations and  generations into future debt.   Mr. Chairman, this is pretty simple. Without that funding there  probably would have been no pandemic. Unless we are going to get  accountability and do the necessary research, I cannot continue to  sponsor Fauci and NIH and their efforts to go ahead and spread and lead  to another COVID.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I love how our colleagues on the left refer  to every conspiracy as a conspiracy until it is found to be factual,  which is 99 percent of the time.   I am also aware that Mr. Fauci is no longer there and we are very  thankful for that. His accountability on what he had done with helping  to fund gain of function, which was actually something that led to  spreading the Wuhan virus, which was also in partnership with China-- this is something that still needs accountability research and the  necessary review within Congress.   I am aware that we are continuing to spend at emergency COVID levels  and we need to get back to where we were before. This is simple  mathematics. If emergency-level spending is meant to be only during a  time of emergency, then why do we continue to make that the new  benchmark of spending moving forward.   The whole point is, is that we would bring it back to the pre-COVID  spending levels, which is what the American people are looking at. They  are looking for us to stop the irresponsible spending and actually get  to what the root cause is, which is the U.S. Congress.   I hate to say it in this way, but the bottom line is that I will not  continue to fund these types of things.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support me in this, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
