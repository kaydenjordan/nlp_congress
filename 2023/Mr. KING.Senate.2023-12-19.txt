 Mr. President, I rise to provide a brief statement on the  nomination votes on December 18, 2023. I was unable to attend the votes  due to inclement weather. Had I been here on Monday, December 18, 2023,  I would have voted in ``yea'' on vote No. 347, the confirmation of  Executive Calendar No. 415, Martin O'Malley, of Maryland, to be  Commissioner of Social Security.                            ____________________
