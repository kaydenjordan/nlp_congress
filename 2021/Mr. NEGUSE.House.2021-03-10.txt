 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the more than 100,000 Americans who  every year are impacted by gun violence, and I rise today to give voice  to the overwhelming majority of the American people who support  universal background checks.   Communities in Colorado have experienced the tragedy and the grief of  gun violence far too many times--Columbine, Aurora, Highlands Ranch.   Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. We have lost too many parents,  friends, neighbors, students, and children to gun violence.   This Congress must act, which is why I support H.R. 8. We must act on  gun violence. We must pass H.R. 8, and we must send it to President  Biden's desk.
