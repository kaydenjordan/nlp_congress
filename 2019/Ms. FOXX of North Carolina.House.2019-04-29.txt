 Mr. Speaker, April is National Internship  Awareness Month, and I rise to highlight the wonderful educational  opportunities internships provide.   They promote experiential learning that helps people make career  choices amid a wide range of potential professional tracks. Employers  increasingly prefer to hire people with relevant work experience, and  internships are a great way to gain this asset.   Congress mirrors this trend and financial means should not be a  limiting factor in one's participation in a congressional internship.  That is why I, in past years, set aside part of my annual office budget  to offer paid internships, and I am pleased that appropriations passed  into law last year provide funding for all House offices to do the  same.   I encourage more employers to consider offering internships, and I  encourage people to explore those opportunities in Congress and all  fields to help them inform their career paths.                            ____________________
