 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  also thank my partner in this legislation and Chairman Graves for his  positive comments.   As was mentioned, in 2017 an Air Canada plane at San Francisco  International Airport got within 59 feet of crashing into four planes  loaded with passengers, putting the lives of more than 1,000 people at  risk, which would have been the greatest aviation disaster in American  history. When the National Transportation Safety Board investigated,  they found that the outdated NOTAM system was the largest part of the  near disaster.   Since then, I and others have been working with the aviation  industry, the FAA, the NTSB, and the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee to address the critical issues with NOTAMs. Updating them and  making them more accessible to the people who use them is essential to  the safety of the flying public and the confidence of the users.   Earlier this month, we learned what happens when there is an outage  in the system: chaos and grounded flights.   In response to the Air Canada incident, I authored the Safe Landings  Act, which would work to improve many aspects of aviation safety  technology, including to the NOTAM system. With Members of both parties  and the chair and ranking member, we have worked over the years to  continue to hold the FAA accountable for the safety of passengers,  crew, and aircraft.   In 2018, we included a requirement in the FAA reauthorization to  speed up the modernization of the NOTAM system. Last year, more than 4  years after the provision passed into law, I led a letter with Ranking  Member Larsen to the FAA asking why the system was still outdated.  [[Page H301]]    The mass flight cancellations that resulted from the outage further  emphasized the need to make rigorous and immediate updates to the  NOTAMs, and brought public awareness to this critical system.   I am proud to have worked with my colleague and friend from Minnesota  on this bill in a bipartisan manner and look forward to protecting the  safety of the flying public. With the creation of this task force, this  will be accomplished.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a good  friend and a wonderful professional, Randy Sawyer.   Randy has been a dedicated public servant in the county I represent  in San Francisco Bay Area, Contra Costa. Contra Costa is home to a  heavily industrialized part of the bay area with refineries and  chemical plants.   Randy has served important roles at the Contra Costa Health Services,  beginning as a specialist engineer in the Hazardous Materials Division,  then becoming the Chief Environmental Health and Hazardous Materials  Officer, and ultimately ending as the Deputy Director.   Among Randy's efforts to promote public health, he helped to champion  the county's community warning system, one of the best response teams  in the State and the country, to alert county residents and businesses  when they are impacted or in danger of being impacted by an emergency.   He also helped Contra Costa lead the county in refinery safety with  his work on the industrial safety ordinance, which I am proud to be an  author of.   The legacy of Randy's work will continue to protect residents in the  bay area for years to come. Please join me in congratulating Randy on  his retirement and honoring him for his 30 years of public service.                            ____________________
