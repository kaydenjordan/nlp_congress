 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the MILCON  amendment.   This is actually something that we agree on, that most people would  agree on. We have apartments that our airmen are staying in at Hill Air  Force Base where literally they have to section off corners of the  sidewalk because bricks are falling off the building.   This is not up to the standard of what we would like to provide for  our men and women who are willing to go and serve in this capacity.  This is something that we all agree on.   The reason I stand to oppose the amendment is because it just  increases the costs for a MILCON budget that is already laden with a  lot of work with very little money. This will require a sort of  preference for local hiring, which is a good thing, but it also adds in  a lot of bureaucracy with respect to licensing and making sure that  every single military construction contractor has all the little  prerequisites for each State. This is something that we have rejected  in the past, and it ultimately just adds a lot of cost.   It is ironic that both the Trump and Biden administrations disagree  with this. Chambers of commerce actually oppose this. A few others that  are noteworthy are the defense industry of America, Association of  General Contractors, and American Council of Engineering Companies.  They all oppose this effort.   Again, this impacts the skilled workforce. Every single construction  company that I talk to right now says they can't even hire in their  local area. So to require companies to go to each area where there is a  base and take away some of their skilled workforce to then go hire a  workforce that is in that particular city, it adds an extra burden.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Speaker, I oppose this amendment  passionately as I jumped into a debate on this during general debate,  because I am so excited to jump into it. I appreciate the opportunity  to speak.   This to me is a classic case of we agree, we just are seeing a very  different approach in how we want to go about doing this. I have  enjoyed my time on the Armed Services Committee immensely these past 9  months, and for one reason alone, we can find areas of collaboration  and areas that we can work on together.   Military construction that will go towards projects like providing  housing for our men and women serving is a top priority across the  board for Democrats and Republicans. I am going to highlight just some  of the fundamental, key reasons why this amendment and many others,  especially industry folks, with respect to the chamber of commerce, the  National Defense Industry of America, the Associated General  Contractors of America, and American Council of Engineering Companies,  they oppose this effort.   In addition to the industry side, and I never thought that I would  say this as I start my debate, President Biden  [[Page H4858]]  and his administration are also in opposition to this for a few key  reasons.   One, this impacts skilled workforce. The local hiring preferences  would significantly impact the military construction contractors'  workforce by creating scenarios where long-term, highly skilled workers  may have to be laid off in order to meet local hire mandates. Then, in  order to comply with the requirements, employers would have to bring in  unnecessary and unskilled workers to fill those now vacant positions,  creating additional costs and safety concerns.   Local preference requirements falsely assumes that there is a local  pool of qualified military contractors at the ready, and they are  capable of performing the work. In the language you see, the language  even uses ``when practical.'' And I always struggle with that, because  how can we legislate on ``when practical''?   I believe we should let the individuals that are putting out bids and  winning these contracts determine what they can best do for those  areas.    Now, I am a huge supporter of local support. And you can go to Hill  Air Force Base in Layton, Utah, to find out how we have been able to  embrace the local community and enhanced use-lease projects. We are  doing it better than anywhere else in the country, and I am firm on it,  and I am actually willing to share the best practices, and I am pushing  hard to change up some of these budget requirements or these labeling  requirements so we can kind of blow through the issues that we have.   The MILCON budget is overloaded right now. We do not have the money  to do a fraction of the projects that we have out there. Like I  mentioned earlier, bricks are literally falling off the dormitories for  our airmen.   Other reasons to oppose it. This is contrary to judicial precedence.  Leslie Miller, Inc. versus Arkansas, the Supreme Court ruling held that  the bid on Federal contracts cannot be required to first submit state  licensing procedures. It undermines competition.   And lastly, but most importantly, it increases cost to contractors  and government at a time where we don't have enough money in our MILCON  budget to add additional costs.   So again, with the increased costs right now every construction  company I talk to are bursting at the seams with potential projects and  no labor to do it. If we add on additional requirements to hire  specifically locally, even if the contract is sort of similar, if you  do the base in Tinker and then you go to Air Force base, and you go to  Wright-Patt, there is consistency there. There is opportunity to scale.  This is a fundamental business concept where we have to be able to  leverage and allow for business and industry to thrive and do this more  cost effectively.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2350     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am just going to reiterate the  concept of the enhanced use lease that is done better than anywhere  else that I have discussed or heard or seen at our base in Utah.   I want to take this opportunity to highlight that that is embracing  the local workforce, and it is doing it more cost-effectively on  multiple different types of projects.   I am going to continue to push for us to embrace that concept more  within all of our military bases because it has proven to be a really  good model to do it more cost-effectively and with the right type of  labor.   This adds an extra burden that is unnecessary to be able to  accomplish what we want it to. I will again reiterate that increased  costs to a MILCON budget that can't even do the work that it is trying  to do right now is only going to exacerbate the issue. We need to let  these companies that bid on these projects do this the appropriate way  and without adding a whole bunch of extra burdens.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
