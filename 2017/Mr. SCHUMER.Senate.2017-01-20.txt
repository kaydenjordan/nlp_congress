 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today we celebrate one of our democracy's  core attributes: the peaceful transfer of power. It is remarkable. I am  always amazed how voters, on a cold November evening in my State, come  home from work--they would like to serve dinner to their kids or sit in  their favorite chair and watch their favorite TV show, but in quiet  dignity, they wait in line and wait their turn to cast their vote. Then  everyone awaits the decision. And the next morning, we all abide by it.  It is an amazing thing about this democracy. There are no riots and  tanks in the streets. It is a great thing. And although I regret the  outcome of the election obviously--deeply--I still am awed by how the  wellspring of democracy continues to work for 225 years after the  Founders put together the remarkable document, the Constitution.   Now it falls to us--Senators from both parties--to promote and defend  these principles, as we must every day: the rule of law, equal  protection for all Americans under it, and freedom of speech, press,  and religion. We must also endeavor to expand opportunity and increase  prosperity while broadening the circle of Americans who share in it.  The peaceful transfer of power occurred, and our work starts now.   President Trump said in his inaugural address this afternoon:         For too long, a small group in our Nation's capital has       reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne       the cost. Washington flourished--but the people did not share       its wealth.    He promised to combat that trend, but in one of his first acts as  President, President Trump made it harder for Americans to afford a  mortgage. For working-class Americans, struggling Americans, now it is  harder for them  [[Page S349]]  to get a mortgage. What did he do? He reversed a recent decision by the  Department of Housing and Urban Development to reduce annual insurance  premiums that many borrowers pay, saving new homeowners an average of  $500 per year. What a terrible thing to do to homeowners. President  Trump, with a flick of the pen, ended that new policy, making it harder  for Americans of modest means to obtain their piece of the rock, the  American dream: their own home. It took only an hour after his positive  words on the inaugural platform for his words to ring hollow. And  actions speak louder than words. One hour after talking about helping  working people and ending the cabal in Washington that hurts people, he  signs a regulation that makes it more expensive for new homeowners to  buy mortgages--1 hour later.   I ask the American people--because we Democrats are going to do this.  We are going to hold the President accountable. Look at what the  President said and then an hour later, look at what the President did.  Again, actions speak louder than words. The words on that inaugural  platform in relation to this new action ring hollow.   Democrats agree with President Trump on this: The working men and  women of America do not need more promises, they need policies that  give them a leg up, help them succeed, help them afford a home, for  instance. We urge President Trump to reverse this decision and give new  homeowners across America their $500 back.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter--nominations--Senators  on both sides of the aisle have expressed support for the President's  key national security nominees. This evening, we expect to be able to  vote on General Kelly and General Mattis, and we look forward to  beginning the debate on Congressman Pompeo in the hopes that he can  also receive a quick vote, but from there, we intend to have a full and  rigorous debate on the President-elect's remaining nominees.   My friends on the other side of the aisle did not want to have a full  debate on the merits of these nominees in committee, so they should be  prepared to do so on the Senate floor. Over the last several weeks,  Republicans have made a mockery of the Cabinet hearing process, trying  to jam through nominees in truncated hearings--nominees with serious  conflicts of interest and ethical issues unresolved--without giving  Senators and the American people a fair chance to question and hear  from these nominees.   If ever there were a group of Cabinet nominees who cry out for  rigorous scrutiny, it is this one. I have never heard such a parade of  potential ethical violations. The President-elect's Cabinet is a swamp  Cabinet, full of billionaires and bankers, loaded with conflicts of  interest and ethical lapses as far as the eye can see.   Congressman Mulvaney failed to pay taxes on a household worker--the  exact same issue that has caused past nominees to withdraw.   Congressman Price is facing serious scrutiny for trading stock with  one hand and pushing legislation to boost that stock with the other.   Rex Tillerson has refused to recuse himself from matters relating to  ExxonMobil for the length of his term.   Just yesterday we learned that Steve Mnuchin tried to hide his  holdings in the Cayman Islands from the Senate Finance Committee.   And, of course, at the top of the list is Betsy DeVos. Her ethics  paperwork just came in after the hearing was completed. Did she not  want to answer any questions on it? It shows that she was invested in  multiple education companies, including companies that have millions of  dollars of contracts with the Department of Education to collect on  student debt. Senators have not been given an opportunity to question  her about these investments because we only got the information after  the hearing. Sadly, the list goes on and on.   The President-elect isn't draining the swamp with his Cabinet picks,  he is filling it up. It is no wonder that the American people have  expressed discontent with how this transition period is going.   These issues that I mentioned, and many others, deserve to be  thoroughly and rigorously reviewed by the Senate. If Senate Republicans  will not let that happen in hearings, it will happen right here on the  floor.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    My fellow Americans, we live in a challenging       and tumultuous time--a quickly evolving, evermore       interconnected world; a rapidly changing economy that       benefits too few while leaving too many behind; a fractured       media; a politics frequently consumed by rancor. We face       threats foreign and domestic. In such times, faith in our       government, our institutions, and even our country can erode.       Despite these challenges, I stand here today confident in       this great country for one reason: you, the American people.        (Applause.)        We Americans have always been a forward-looking, problem-      solving, optimistic, patriotic, and decent people. Whatever       our race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity,       whether we are immigrant or native-born, whether we live with       disabilities or do not, in wealth or in poverty, we are all       exceptional in our commonly held yet fierce devotion to our       country and in our willingness to sacrifice our time, energy,       and even our lives to making it a more perfect union.        Today, we celebrate one of democracies core attributes--the       peaceful transfer of power. Every day, we stand up for core       democratic principles enshrined in the Constitution; the rule       of law; equal protection for all under the law; the freedom       of speech, press, religion--the things that make America       ``America.'' We can gain strength from reading our history       and listening to the voices of average Americans. They always       save us in times of strife.        (Applause.)        One such American was MAJ Sullivan Ballou. On July 14,       1861, when the North and South were lining up for their first       battle, a time when our country was bitterly divided and       faith in the future of our country was at a nadir, Major       Ballou of the 2nd Rhode Island volunteers penned a letter to       his wife Sarah.        It is one of the greatest letters in American history. It       shows the strength and courage of the average American. Allow       me to read some of his words which echo through the ages.        My very dear Sarah [he wrote], the indications are very       strong that we should move in a few days--perhaps tomorrow.        If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield       for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or       lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and       my courage does not halt or falter.        I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon       the triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to       those who went before us through the blood and suffering of       the Revolution. And I am willing--perfectly willing--to lay       down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this       Government and to pay that debt.        Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to       you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could       break; and yet my love of country comes over me like a strong       wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to       the battlefield.  [[Page S364]]         Sullivan Ballou gave his life on the battlefield a week       later at the first Battle of Bull Run. It is because Sullivan       Ballou and countless others believed in something bigger than       themselves and were willing to sacrifice for it that we stand       today in the full blessings of liberty in the greatest       country on Earth. That spirit lives on in each of us,       Americans whose families have been here for generations and       those who have just arrived. I know our best days are yet to       come. I urge all Americans to read Ballou's full letter. His       words give me solace and strength. I hope they will give you       the same.        (Applause.)        Now, please stand while the Associate Justice of the       Supreme Court, Clarence Thomas, administers the oath of       office to the Vice President of the United States.        Associate Justice CLARENCE THOMAS administered to the Vice       President-elect the oath of office prescribed by the       Constitution, which he repeated, as follows:        I, MICHAEL RICHARD PENCE, do solemnly swear that I will       support and defend the Constitution of the United States       against all enemies foreign and domestic; that I will bear       true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this       obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose       of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the       duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me       God.        Associate Justice THOMAS. God bless you.        (Applause.)        (Performance by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, accompanied by       the United States Marine Band.)        (Applause.)         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 17, submitted earlier  today.    I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.
