 Mr. President, my colleagues and I are here today to  highlight the fact that our Democratic colleagues have shown the  American people how truly radical they are when it comes to abortion.   The Women's Health Protection Act--what I believe should be better  known as the ``Abortion on Demand Until the Moment of Birth Act''-- casts a vision of abortion in America, one utterly without limitation.   Federalism is one of the truly genius ideas behind the U.S.  Constitution. Federalism means that we make the majority of our  decisions at a more local level rather than at the national level. When  we rely on the principle of federalism, more people across the country  have more reason to be content with the laws they have. People have a  greater say in the legislative process at the local level, which means  they get more of the kind of government they want and less of the kind  of government they don't want.   For nearly the last half-century, the decisions in Roe v. Wade and  Planned Parenthood v. Casey have abused the Constitution by reading  into the Constitution a right that exists nowhere in the Constitution.   These wrongly decided cases have wreaked havoc on public trust in  government, on the republican nature of our government, on the public's  understanding of the Constitution. More gravely, these decisions have  permitted the euphemistically described ``termination'' of 63 million  American lives. That is more than 45 times the number of American lives  lost in war since the founding of our Nation--every war combined.  Forty-five times that. Let that sink in for a minute.   Abortion is a tragedy. It is one that is scarring our Nation's  history because of what it says about how we respect human life. Those  scores of millions of lives represent--each and every one of them-- unique and unrepeatable genetic makeups and identities and potentials.  They represent the loss of Americans of all races, varying physical and  mental abilities, all political affiliations and professions, with many  targeted because of their race, sex, or disability. Their termination  is a loss of ideas, of innovation, and of compassion. Those abortions  erase all potential families and communities. Those abortions represent  the loss of infinite potential, connection, and love. Abortion is a  tragedy that scars our history.   So when I read Justice Alito's draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson  Women's Health Organization, I was elated--elated--because it relies on  federalism and a sound reading of the Constitution to reassert that  there is no constitutional right to an abortion. Just because a  combination of lawyers wearing robes 48 years ago decided that would be  the case does not make it so. Our Constitution is difficult to amend,  and it is deliberately that way. They didn't follow this procedure;  they tried to circumvent it, and they were wrong.   Regulating abortion is a matter reserved for the American people and  their elected representatives, not nine unelected Justices. For that  very reason, a number of people have turned against it, and because  they can't characterize it the way that it actually is, they  mischaracterize it.   Then they go so far as to encourage people to show up to the homes,  the private residences, of the Supreme Court Justices in question.  There is no reason to do this that doesn't involve an implicit threat  of violence. When you show up at someone's home, you are sending an  unmistakable message: We know where you sleep. That is why this is  expressly prohibited under Federal law. There is a Federal criminal law  prohibiting this under 18 U.S.C. section 1507.  [[Page S2400]]    Now, stunningly, the White House--the White House--the President's  personal spokesperson, Jen Psaki, just in the last few hours, has  repeated this charge, has encouraged people to do this, saying:         We certainly continue to encourage protests outside of       judge's homes.    This is wrong, and I call on the President of the United States  personally to undo this. He is encouraging unlawful behavior that is  inherently dangerous and is inherently threatening.   This radical bill that has emerged in the days immediately following  the leak of the Dobbs draft opinion is shrouded in the lie of  protecting women's health while allowing for killing babies by any  means, however gruesome, violent, atrocious, heinous, or cruel, right  up until the moment of birth, preempting any State laws that might  choose to protect life. Those late-term abortions not only kill viable  babies, but they are unreasonably needlessly cruel, and they are  extremely dangerous procedures for the mothers themselves.   Unlimited abortion is also widely unpopular. Only 17 percent of  Americans believe that is the right policy. Among medical  professionals, the feelings are similar. Research shows that over one- third of OB-GYNs in America would not even refer a patient for an  abortion. But this bill as written would require those same doctors not  only to refer but also to provide abortions or risk their employment,  notwithstanding any ethical objection they may have to it,  notwithstanding any religious objection they may have to it.   By waiving the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, carving it out--the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, as it is known, a religious  liberty protection enacted by an overwhelming supermajority of  Democrats and Republicans--this bill would require hospitals and  healthcare workers to perform abortions in violation of their own  religious convictions.   With this bill, Democrats in the House and the Senate are attempting  to take this issue away from the people, away from the States, and  force their radical abortion agenda on the American people as a whole.  Now, make no mistake, this is their vision for America, fully funded by  the abortion industry. It also perpetuates the tragedy of abortion--one  that is a scar on our country's history.   I hope and pray that State legislatures across the country will  follow the example of the State of Utah and pass laws to protect the  lives of preborn babies and their mothers.
