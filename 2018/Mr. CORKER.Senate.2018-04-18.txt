 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION                  Mexico--MH-60R Multi-Mission Helicopters         The Government of Mexico has requested to buy eight (8) MH-      60R Multi-Mission Helicopters, equipped with: twenty (20) T-      700 GE 401 C engines (16 installed and 4 spares); sixteen       (16) APS-153(V) Multi-Mode radars (8 installed, 8 spares);       ten (10) Airborne Low Frequency Systems (ALFS) (8 installed       and 2 spares); fourteen (14) AN/APX-123 Identification Friend       or Foe transponders (8 installed and 6 spares); twelve (12)       AN/AAS-44C Multi-Spectral Targeting Systems Forward Looking       Infrared Systems (8 installed, 4 spares); twenty (20)       Embedded Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation       Systems (EGI) with Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing       Module (16 installed and 4 spares); thirty (30) AN/AVS-9       Night Vision Devices; one thousand (1,000) AN/SSQ-36/53/62       Sonobuoys; ten (10) AGM-114 Hellfire missiles; five (5) AGM-      114 M36-E9 Captive Air Training missiles; four (4) AGM-114Q       Hellfire training missiles; thirty eight (38) Advanced       Precision Kill Weapons System (APKWS) II rockets; thirty (30)       Mk 54 Lightweight Hybrid Torpedoes (LHTs); twelve (12) M-240D       machine guns; twelve (12) GAU-21 Machine Guns. Also included       are twelve (12) AN/ARC-220 High Frequency radios; spare       engine containers; facilities study, design, and       construction; spare and repair parts; support and test       equipment; communication equipment; ferry support;       publications and technical documentation; personnel training       and training equipment; U.S. Government and contractor       engineering, technical and logistics support services; and       other related elements of logistical and program support. The       total estimated value is $1.20 billion.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a strategic regional partner. Mexico has been       a strong partner in combating organized crime and drug       trafficking organizations. The sale of these aircraft to       Mexico will significantly increase and strengthen its       maritime capabilities. Mexico intends to use these defense       articles and services to modernize its armed forces and       expand its existing naval and maritime support of national       security requirements and in its efforts to combat criminal       organizations.        The proposed sale will improve Mexico's ability to meet       current and future threats from enemy weapon systems. The MH-      60R Multi-Mission Helicopter will enable Mexico to perform       anti-surface and antisubmarine warfare missions and secondary       missions including vertical replenishment, search and rescue,       and communications relay. Mexico will use the enhanced       capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to       strengthen its homeland defense. Mexico will have no       difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin Rotary and       Mission Systems in Owego, New York. There are no known offset       agreements in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       assignment of additional U.S.  [[Page S2258]]       Government and/or contractor representatives to Mexico.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.
