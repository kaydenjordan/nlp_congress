 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 681, I call up  the bill (S. 140) to amend the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights  Quantification Act of 2010 to clarify the use of amounts in the WMAT  Settlement Fund, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 140.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 140, as amended, which consists  of three sections promoting Tribal self-governance and sovereignty over  their lands, resources, and businesses belonging to Indian Tribes.   Section 1 of S. 140 amends current law to ensure the completion of a  Tribal water system in Arizona. It makes a technical amendment to the  White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of 2010 to  clarify that authority exists for any necessary cost overruns  associated with the Tribe's rural water system, provided it falls  within the existing authorization level.   This provision provides the White Mountain Apache Tribe and the  Department of the Interior certainty that there will be sufficient  funds to complete the rural water system.   Section 2 of S. 140 is identical to S. 249, a bill referred to the  Subcommittee on Indian, Insular and Alaska Native Affairs, which I  chair. The Natural Resources Committee reported S. 249 favorably on  July 24, 2017, by unanimous consent.   Section 2 amends what is commonly known as the Long-Term Leasing Act,  to authorize two Indian pueblos in New Mexico to lease their restricted  fee lands for up to 99 years, subject to the approval of the Secretary  of the Interior.  [[Page H115]]    Such leases may be for a variety of nonmineral development purposes.  While current law generally authorizes Indian Tribes, subject to the  approval of the Secretary, to lease their trust and restricted lands,  the terms of the leases may not exceed 25 years.   This bill would authorize the pueblos of Santa Clara and Ohkay  Owingeh to lease their restricted fee lands for terms of up to 99  years.   Congress has amended the Long-Term Leasing Act more than 40 times to  adjust the terms and conditions of leases of Indian lands and to  authorize leases of specific Indian lands by their Indian owners for a  term of up to 99 years, subject to the approval of the Secretary.   While the Natural Resources Committee does not have jurisdiction over  section 3 of S. 140, I wish to express my full support for promoting  Tribal self-governance by giving Tribes parity with States and local  governments for the purposes of the National Labor Relations Act.   Tribal self-governance, or sovereignty, means that a Tribe may make  its own laws and be governed by them. Since President Nixon launched  the era of Indian self-determination, Tribes have shown that when they  assume management and control over their affairs, they actually  outperform the Federal Government.   Thus, section 3 of S. 140 will continue and enhance the policies of  Tribal self-determination that have almost always enjoyed strong  bipartisan, bicameral support for these measures.   S. 140, as amended, is fully consistent with promoting this important  Tribal economic opportunity and freedom to do as they see fit.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  South Dakota (Mrs. Noem).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Mexico (Mr. Pearce).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in summary, this Federal Government has had a very  spotty record over the many decades of its treatment of Native American  Indian Tribes in this Nation, and for us to not act in order to  countermand what the National Labor Relations Board has done on its own  would be a mistake. It would be wrongheaded, in that if we are going to  have the types of relations, these government-to-government relations  with Indian Tribes in this country, that level of respect, then  Congress needs to act, Congress needs to maintain that relation.   So for local governments, State governments to have this protection  from the NLRA and the Tribes not to, then we would be making a severe  mistake to not take action here today with this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support for all portions of S. 140 today,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Tehama  County Farm Bureau in my district on their 100th annual meeting. This  on the heels of their centennial of being in business in Tehama County.   They are headquartered in Red Bluff, California. They have been an  organization very dedicated, obviously, to farming, ranching, and  agriculture in all its forms in Tehama County and its neighboring  counties as partners as well.   Just last month, it was actually recognized as the Midsize Farm  Bureau of the Year, according to the California Farm Bureau Federation  Annual Meeting.   The Farm Bureau is very important and very involved in the fiber of  rural communities with ag production, farming, ranching, hay, and all  those operations that make what agriculture needs go round, as well as  the activities at the fair with the kids, and with their future. The  Farm Bureau, indeed, is an important part of the future of agriculture  and feeding people in this country.   Mr. Speaker, again, I congratulate Tehama County Farm Bureau's  membership, board, and leadership for hanging in there and serving that  group of people for 100 years.                            ____________________
