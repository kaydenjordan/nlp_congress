 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I share my colleague's concern about China's malign  activities. That is why, last year, I negotiated $300 million on a  bipartisan basis to counter Chinese influence. And that is why I wrote  this bill to give the State Department the flexibility to spend more  than $300 million, if that is necessary.   A President who has America's best interests at heart would use this  flexibility to invest in a whole-of-government response to the China  threat. Unfortunately, President Trump refuses to spend the money that  we have appropriated and have given to him.   On Twitter, President Trump, I am told, lavishes praise on President  Xi. In private, according to his National Security Advisor, President  Trump begged Xi for help in winning reelection.   The Trump administration has turned a blind eye to Xi's human rights  abuses and endorsed a trade deal that allows China, frankly, to  continue to cheat.   Worse still, this motion to recommit is really an attack on America's  environmental leadership. That is what this motion to recommit is all  about. As the Republican whip has announced, this MTR slashes funding  for the Green Climate Fund, which is essential to combat climate  change.   This amendment ratifies the Trump administration's head-in-the-sand  approach to climate change, which weakens our standing in the world and  leaves our Nation vulnerable to this existential threat.   At its heart, the motion to recommit asks us to weaken American  leadership in climate while trusting President Trump to prioritize the  United States' national security against our enemies.   The last four years makes clear that this just is not correct.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to recommit,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
