 Mr. Speaker, on the first day of this month, President  Trump promised an infrastructure package ``in the next 2 to 3 weeks,  maybe sooner.''   Here we are into week three and in the middle of National  Infrastructure Week. So, Mr. President, where is the plan?   I wish we were spending today working together to create jobs by  making meaningful investments in our roads, our bridges, our rail, and  our airports. That is what the hardworking men and women I represent  wish Washington would focus on, too. But, instead, at breakfast tables  all over the country, moms and dads turn on the morning news and have  to explain to their kids what is an obstruction of justice before  putting their kids on the school bus and traverse our bumpy and  potholed roads.   This is a dark moment in our Nation's history. History demands that  we rise to the occasion. Nobody is above the law, not even the  President of the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing for the good  of our country. Join us in demanding a true and independent  investigation to get to the bottom of the President's ties to Vladimir  Putin and any possible attempted coverup.                            ____________________
