 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Shimkus yielding. And I  want to thank Chairman Walden, as well, for his hard work in this area,  as well as Mr. Shimkus', and the entire Energy and Commerce Committee  for their leadership in this area.   As chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I continue to hear  from small-business owners all across America that compliance with  regulations is one of the greatest challenges that they face, and this  is, in essence, what this is.   In fact, today, I chaired a hearing on how the regulatory process is  impacting small businesses. The bill before us today, the BRICK Act,  would provide crucial relief to America's brick, clay, and tile  industries, the majority of which are, by definition, small businesses;  and we should always remember that small businesses create about 7 out  of every 10 new jobs in America.   The BRICK Act would ensure that small-business owners don't have to  worry about spending millions of dollars to comply with a regulation  that may well be thrown out in court. I would urge my colleagues to  support this important legislation.
