 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to instruct conferees at  the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Army has a surplus of pistols. The M-1911 A-1, a  .45-caliber pistol--the Armed Forces standard issue sidearm for more  than 50 years--was replaced in the 1980s by a newer model.   Since then the Army has accumulated stores of surplus M-1911 pistols  which are housed at taxpayer expense in Alabama.   There is no national security reason to keep these pistols. The Army  stopped issuing them 30 years ago, yet the Army has been prevented from  disposing of them due to parochial interests tied to the Civilian  Marksmanship Program, or CMP.   The CMP's proponents basically want to transfer the pistols to a  private corporation so that it can sell them. Do we want this to  happen? We have the opportunity in this year's NDAA to stop this  transfer of tens of thousands of M-1911 A-1 pistols which constitutes a  multimillion-dollar government giveaway.   It is also important to note that this would make our streets more  dangerous at a time when gun violence is all too common.   The CMP was established in 1903--just to put this in historical  context--following the Spanish-American War when American militiamen  demonstrated distressingly poor marksmanship. At that time, our Nation  needed a better trained and organized militia, and the CMP helped the  government build a broader base of able citizen-soldiers.   Now, the program was an important component of our national defense  back then. But today, Mr. Speaker, over a century later, we have a  professional military and many rifle clubs, and the CMP is, quite  frankly, no longer needed. Congress clearly understood this when it  privatized the CMP in 1996.   Now, as an initial capital investment at a time when earmarks were  still common, Congress provided the newly chartered corporation with a  stock of rifles, ammunition, and other spare parts. The CMP could sell  the surplus equipment--mostly M1 Garand rifles--in order to fund its  activities until it became self-sufficient.                                time  1400    However, it was never Congress' intent to equip the CMP with  handguns, or it would have provided the corporation with surplus M- 1911-A1 .45-caliber pistols at that time.   Now, more than two decades later, the CMP is running out of rifles to  sell. The reality is that it is in dire financial straits as, more than  20 years later, the program is still reliant on rifle sales to support  its activities.   So, Mr. Speaker, it is clearly not the taxpayers' responsibility to  bail out the CMP. To do so would be an unprecedented government handout  at a time when earmarks have been banned for years.  [[Page H8005]]    So what makes this program so special?   There is nothing.   Beyond this, it would flood our streets with handguns--the guns that  are most often used by criminals. I believe this would be extremely  dangerous when, more than 2 years ago, the first attempt was made to  effectuate this earmark, I heard the argument that storing surplus  pistols, as the Army is now doing, is a waste of government funds.  Well, I agree. However, a handout is not the answer.   There is no national security reason to put these guns on our  streets. In fact, an increase in the number of handguns will only  result potentially in more violence.   So, Mr. Speaker, we should allow the Army to dispose of these pistols  by melting them down, as it plans to do with other surplus arms.   Senate language in the NDAA exempts M-1911-A1 pistols from Army  disposal, but I urge my colleagues to support the motion to instruct  the conferees to reject this exemption. There is no reason to store  these pistols. There is no reason to flood our streets with them. There  is no reason to give an earmark, again, to a private corporation. They  should be melted down and repurchased for other military uses, which is  exactly what this motion supports.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I certainly have great respect for the  chairman and his leadership of the Armed Services Committee. No one  questions his commitment to defending the Nation in support of our  military, but we don't need to support earmarks to a private  corporation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Carbajal).    Mr. Speaker, I would just mention many wonderful  organizations around the country that would love to have earmarks, but  we don't do earmarks anymore.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms.  Rosen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Congress intended for the CMP to become self-sufficient  after it was privatized in 1996. It was never meant to be the recipient  of another multimillion-dollar government handout years later,  especially not a handout of tens of thousands of pistols which then  would be used immediately for sale to the public to fund its  operations.   Again, perhaps one could argue that, when earmarks were around, they  needed this to fund their operations. Again, there was a time when  earmarks were in existence. Earmarks are no longer regular order. They  don't exist anymore. They were done away with several years ago.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is clear that I don't hold with the need for  the CMP to receive Federal support.   On another note, I don't often see eye to eye with the NRA, but I  must agree with the statement on the NRA's website that the Association  is ``the premier firearms education organization in the world.''                                time  1415    Well, the NRA does not receive Federal support from its education  programs, which are widely accessible, and in our professional  military, the need for marksmanship training for national security  purposes has evaporated. Even if we truly think the CMP is deserving of  a government subsidy, Congress should do so through the appropriations  process, not through a provision that is, quite frankly, again, an  earmark.   As my colleagues so well know, earmarks were banned in the 112th  Congress, yet the provisions at issue in the House-passed NDAA would  transfer millions of dollars, ostensibly, in government property to a  corporation that is in the congressional district of the measure's  chief advocate. And while I have deep respect for my colleague, the  government shouldn't be engaged in this type of practice.   The government has occasionally transferred surplus property to  nonprofit corporations for education or other purposes; however, it has  never done so with the intent that the property be immediately sold,  with the proceeds going to the corporation's bottom line. So if that  isn't an earmark, Mr. Speaker, I don't know what is. It is blatant  subversion of congressional order, and it would set, I believe, a very  dangerous precedent.   I hope that my colleagues would join me in upholding the rules of the  House and support the motion to instruct.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to highlight the danger of this  transfer, potentially, to public safety. Injecting tens of thousands of  new pistols onto our streets by providing them to the CMP, I believe,  could be disastrous, as handguns are regularly used in crime.   Now, in 2013, of the 6,498 homicides committed by a firearm for which  the type of weapon was known, 89 percent were handgun related--89  percent. Only 4 percent were carried out using a rifle, the type of  firearm the CMP has traditionally sold.   The qualities that made the M1911A1 .45-caliber pistol a fun sidearm  is the fact that it is easily concealed, extremely reliable, and packs  quite a punch, all qualities that make it prized also among criminals.  In fact, the Department of Justice has tracked 1,768 M1911A1s over the  last decade due to their involvement in criminal activity.   In a time when mass shootings have become all too common and 93  Americans are killed with guns every day, the last thing we need is  more guns on our streets.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, the bill before us, overall, is a fine mark. I  was proud to support it in committee, overall, because it provides for  our national defense. It supports key programs of the Department of  Defense to make sure our warfighters have every advantage possible. We  never want to send our warfighters into a fair fight, and this bill,  overall, goes a long way toward ensuring for our national defense and  provides great support for our men and women in uniform.   Unfortunately, this CMP issue has been an unnecessary distraction. It  is something I don't believe belongs in the bill. I believe that and,  again, I made the point that we have done away with earmarks, and so we  shouldn't be using an earmark and subverting congressional authority  and will through the regular order process, through the appropriations  process, to help to fund a private organization.   Again, there are many, I am sure, meritorious organizations around  the country that would love to have an earmark, but we don't do them  anymore, and we shouldn't be doing a sidestep here to give a private  organization such an earmark.   As I said, I have highlighted again the potential for guns to fall  into the wrong hands. And although the owners of the weapons may be of  good character and those who purchased the guns, to fund, again, the  operations of the CMP, a private organization, even if they have them  in their home, if there is criminal activity that takes place, whether  it is an act of violence or if the home is broken into and the weapon  is stolen, which happens every day in America that a law-abiding  citizen has a weapon that gets in the wrong hands, that weapon is then  used in the crime. The more weapons out there, the more likely  something like that could potentially happen.   This is what we are trying to prevent. We want to do this in a  responsible way. Again, we want to make sure that the guns don't just  wind up out in our streets, and we want to make sure that they are  melted down like other surplus equipment.   The Army surely does not need to store them any longer. We want to  get rid of them. We want the Army to be able to do that, but they  should be able to do what they do with other surplus equipment, and  that is melt it down,  [[Page H8007]]  perhaps use that melted down material for making other weapons that the  Army does need that are relevant at this time.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to oppose the language in the  current NDAA. We should work together and support my motion to instruct  so that, as we go to conference, we have clear direction from the House  as to what the House believes we should do and not allow these weapons  out in our communities. We shouldn't be supporting earmarks.   As I said, I know that the Senate provision does in fact have a  provision there that would allow these weapons to be melted down, and  that is the way that we should go. I believe that we have an  opportunity to make that statement right here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Smith), the ranking member of the full House Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member Smith for speaking on  behalf of this motion to instruct. I deeply appreciate his leadership  on the Armed Services Committee and his years of service, as I do,  again, have deep respect for Chairman Thornberry and his leadership as  chairman of the Armed Services Committee.   Case in point, the NDAA this year, and as has been the case in past  years, has been truly a bipartisan effort, and it's one of the reasons  I truly enjoy serving in the Armed Services Committee is because of the  bipartisan cooperation that is demonstrated when it comes to protecting  our country, when it comes to providing for our national defense,  especially supporting our men and women in uniform. It is a bipartisan  effort. It is unfortunate that in this one particular case we have this  difference of opinion.   We are, again, a program that was initially intended to train  marksmen years ago when we didn't have a professional military. Maybe  it had merit and the organization was supported, but we have a  professional military now, great marksmanship programs and training  programs, as well as private organizations that do this. But it doesn't  require or need a government subsidy, and so it wouldn't be appropriate  in this case any further to continue to support this private  organization, the CMP program with, ostensibly, a earmark.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Mrs. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California for her  comments and support of the motion to instruct. I also want to commend  her and thank her for her leadership on the Armed Services Committee.   Mr. Speaker, just to once again reiterate, a priority of the overall  NDAA that we worked on in a bipartisan, collaborative way, this one  sticking point is this provision in the NDAA that, again, amounts to an  earmark, and it could potentially put tens of thousands of additional  weapons on our streets that could wind up in the wrong hands. It is an  unnecessary step.                                time  1430    Again, when the CMP was first created, it had a legitimate purpose.  That purpose is no longer needed, per se, for the military in terms of  marksmanship training. There are other organizations out there that do  that, but we also have the professional military.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, the provisions in the House-passed NDAA  would give a multimillion-dollar handout in the form of .45-caliber  pistols to the Civilian Marksmanship Program. It is an unnecessary and  unwise use of taxpayer property that would potentially make our streets  less safe.   My motion will instruct our House conferees to reject this earmark  and allow the Army to melt down and repurpose its surplus firearms, as  it does with other firearms or surplus equipment.   Congress needs to find solutions to the endemic gun violence that is  plaguing our Nation right now. We saw, it seems, time after time,  multiple incidents where firearms get into the wrong hands and are  misused, causing loss of life and sometimes, unfortunately, sadly, in  significant numbers, just as we saw, as Ms. Rosen mentioned, with the  terrible shooting in Las Vegas: 58 people lost their lives and hundreds  more were injured. It was a terrible tragedy for Nevada, for those who  lost their lives, and for those who were injured; and, really, it was a  tragedy once again that has plagued and affected our country.   It has to stop. We should not be adding to the problem by injecting  tens of thousands of handguns onto our streets.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will support the motion to  instruct, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H8008]]         Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
