 Mr. Speaker, it is no surprise that the media's  credibility has hit a record low with the American people, according to  a recent Gallup Poll.   The media attacked President Trump because he proved their  predictions wrong and their candidate lost. They attack him because  they are mostly liberal Democrats and he is a conservative Republican.  They attack him because he is reversing many of the policies of  President Obama, whom they openly supported. They attack him because he  is going around them, directly to the American people with his Twitter  messages. They attack him because they can't intimidate or control him.   The media's hate is poisoning the country.   Wouldn't it be better for our country if the media gave the American  people the facts rather than told them what to think?   Wouldn't it be better for our country if the media treated the  President fairly and without malice?  [[Page H1282]]                                ____________________
