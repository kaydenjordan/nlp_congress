 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley).    Mr. Chairman, fossil energy helped make  America the great Nation it is today. West Virginia coal, for example,  helped forge the steel that built skyscrapers and won world wars.   The DOE Fossil Energy account helps our Nation develop the next  generation of fossil technologies. If we don't develop it, other  nations will. America must continue its energy dominance and  independence, and fossil fuels must play a critical role in our energy  strategy.   The Fossil Energy account invests in research and development for  coal, oil, and natural gas, which produce, as you have heard, more than  60 percent of our Nation's electricity.   The research being done at the National Energy Technology Laboratory  in Morgantown, West Virginia, and other locations is paying off. We are  seeing breakthroughs in coal use in energy production, as well as  carbon capture and storage technology.   These breakthroughs mean the United States does not need to rely on  unfriendly nations for energy anymore. Within 5 years, the United  States will become the largest producer in the world of crude oil,  bigger than Russia or Saudi Arabia.   Investing in fossil energy programs will fuel the next generation of  innovation and do so responsibly. Cutting this funding will only set  America back. We have abundant, reliable, domestic energy resources,  and abandoning this research will put our energy future in severe  jeopardy.   President Trump, just last week, took action to strengthen our  Nation's coal-fired power plants to protect our national security and  grid reliability.   Cutting this funding is irresponsible and jeopardizes our energy  independence. Therefore, I urge Members to vote against this amendment,  which would impose significant cuts to R&D funding for fossil energy  technology.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
