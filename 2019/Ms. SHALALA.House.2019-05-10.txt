 Madam Speaker, I rise today during Small Business Week  to celebrate one of the longest-thriving small businesses in Florida's  27th Congressional District.   In publication for 61 years, Miami's Community Newspapers is a  family-run business founded by Ronald Miller in 1958. Today, brothers  Grant and Michael Miller have grown the business to include 14 editions  covering Miami-Dade County.   Miami's Community Newspapers covers the local issues that are the  fabric of our neighborhoods.   Recognizing the accomplishments of high school students and  centennial birthdays, Miami's Community Newspapers is hyper local;  however, they do not shy away from discussing important issues like  transportation and education.   The Miller brothers host breakfast socials and a luncheon series that  has featured everyone from the county transportation director to David  Beckham.   Unknown to most is that the Millers have, for years, given jobs to  numerous people attempting to reenter society after incarceration.   With a distribution of 65,000, their newspapers can be found in every  diner and lobby in Miami-Dade. Today, we honor Grant and Michael Miller  and the 30 employees of Miami's Community Newspapers as a great small  business.                            ____________________
