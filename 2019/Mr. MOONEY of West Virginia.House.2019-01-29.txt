 Actually, Mr. Speaker, I have a point of  clarification for the chairman.   Is this bill affecting all furloughed Federal workers, anyone  furloughed, or anyone affected by the furlough in any way? Any  consumer, any American that is affected?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, in West Virginia's Second  District, we have a lot of Federal workers and contractors who are  affected.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  clarifying that.   Of course, there are a lot of folks in my district who are affected  by the shutdown and also affected indirectly because they are  contractors and such. I have had them approach me over the last few  weeks, wondering if their backlogged projects were going to get funded.  It is important to clarify that.   Of course, we should backpay people, and the good, hardworking  Americans who make this country go around need to get paid.   I understand a little bit of an obsession on the other side against a  border wall that was mentioned by the previous speaker, when this is  really about how government should function and appropriate funds in  the appropriate way, and the power of the purse. Frankly, getting bills  through the House and the Senate has become quite a problem,  particularly with the other Chamber, which doesn't seem to pass  anything and then wants us to do just whatever the Senate does.   We have a lot of dysfunction, particularly on the other side, and  that is what has cost the workers, not this wall. The wall is something  the President said he would do. It is not the wall; it is the  dysfunction of passing bills around here that has caused these  problems.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the leader for the extra minute.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
