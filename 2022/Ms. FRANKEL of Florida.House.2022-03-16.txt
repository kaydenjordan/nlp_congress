 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Speier.  I will tell you what, it is really hard to follow those remarks. I  think all of us--all Americans--really all people around the world who  have been following the brutality of Putin's war, our hearts are  breaking. I thank the gentlewoman for highlighting the special plight  of the women.   As I said, it is almost hard to talk about anything after that, but I  do want to say this. For about 200 years women have been fighting for  rights, for rights that White men and then eventually Black men had,  but we are still fighting for them.   I was just thinking back to my own childhood--and probably your  childhood, too. They had limits on how many girls could get into law  school or medical school; there were no sport scholarships available.  If you were a married woman, you could only get credit in your  husband's name. Abortion was illegal. Equal pay was not even a concept.  We did finally get the right to vote after women were arrested and  chained themselves to the White House.    So if you look back in history, we have been fighting very hard to  get our rights. I want to thank Representative Jackson Lee, she has  highlighted some of the victories over the years and some of the women  who led the way, whether it was with Title IX or Roe v. Wade, or the  bill that was just celebrated today by the President, the Equal Pay  Act, the Paycheck Fairness Act. A lot has been done, but, wait, they  are all in jeopardy.   It is just shocking that after all these years of fighting, every one  of these rights are in jeopardy, including the right to vote, which is  why--and I know my colleagues here would agree--we must have an equal  rights amendment. We must have inscribed in the U.S. Constitution  equality for men and women that cannot be changed at the whim of a  political body.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee).
