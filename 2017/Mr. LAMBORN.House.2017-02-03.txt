 Mr. Speaker, perhaps no aspect of America's economy has  been as overregulated as energy under the Obama administration; so this  week, the House has already acted to repeal two of the most damaging  energy regulations.   This morning we continue the fight to reduce the unnecessary  regulatory costs that are passed along to all Americans by repealing  the Bureau of Land Management's venting and flaring rule. Some  estimates show that this rule could inflict staggering costs  [[Page H954]]  of $1.26 billion on national, State, and local economies, while  generating less than $4 million in new royalties.   In addition, the legal basis for this rule is tenuous at best. The  Clean Air Act authorizes the EPA, not BLM, working in conjunction with  States, to make rules affecting air quality.   The BLM's venting and flaring rule's extreme compliance cost will  force many companies to shut in their wells rather than to continue to  operate them. This will be particularly true for marginal wells that  are often run by family-owned businesses.   And beyond the loss of jobs in Colorado and elsewhere, State and  Federal Governments would lose up to $114 million in tax receipts. This  is money that States like Colorado depend on for funding education and  other critical services.   The increase in natural gas production is to the benefit of everyday  Americans. The U.S. energy boom saved drivers $550 in fuel costs each  year and saved American households over $1,000 last year alone.   Affordable, environmentally responsible energy development is  critical to the U.S. economy, but this rule is a needless burden on  American families. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the  joint resolution of disapproval.
