 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  support of the Raise the Wage Act, which will raise the Federal minimum  wage to $15 per hour by 2025.   I include in the Record a letter signed by many youth organizations  in support of this legislation.         Dear Members of Congress: The undersigned organizations are       writing to express our support for the Raise the Wage Act of       2019, which would incrementally increase the federal minimum       wage from $7.25 to $15.00 over the next 6 years. Beyond       raising the wage, the bill's important provisions include       phasing out the subminimum wages for tipped workers, people       with disabilities, and youth. As organizations committed to       the wellbeing and economic security of young people, we are       united in our goal of ensuring all youth are paid a livable       wage to provide for themselves and their families.        Adults and youth both struggle to make ends meet on today's       minimum wage. Currently, the poverty rate for youth ages 18       to  [[Page H7117]]       24) is 16.1 percent, which is higher than the national rate       of 12.3 percent. Existing law allows employers to pay youth       under age 20 a subminimum wage of $4.25 for the first 90 days       of their employment. While rarely used, this subminimum wage       prohibits youth from being active consumers in their       communities, saving money, or achieving true economic       stability. The Raise the Wage Act will benefit millions of       low-wage workers by increasing their income to a wage that       would allow them to meet their financial needs.        Youth, like many others in this country, use their wages to       support themselves and their families. For example, young       people use their summer jobs earnings to purchase school       supplies and assist family with buying food and contributing       to college costs. Some use their wages to support their own       children, pay rent, and buy other basic necessities.       According to the Census Bureau, approximately 27 percent of       young adults with children live in poverty. Low wages make it       increasingly difficult for these parents to appropriately       care for their children.        Congress has not raised the minimum wage in over a decade.       Studies show that one in nine U.S. workers are paid wages       that leave them in poverty, even when working full time and       year-round. The economy is leaving too many people behind--      including youth and young adults. Because poverty is       structural and caused by systems and policies--like       discrimination, segregation, and low-quality jobs--      policymakers have an important role in addressing it.        Congress must act to raise the wage because it's the       equitable thing to do for workers and it's a financial       imperative--providing individuals with the means to meet       their basic financial needs. By raising the minimum wage and       eliminating the subminimum wage for youth, Congress would       support young people in becoming more economically secure to       help provide for their families and themselves. We urge       Congress to pass the Raise the Wage Act for the good of our       country's economy and the youth who will play a critical role       now and in our future.            Sincerely,        National Organizations: America's Promise Alliance; Center       for Law and Social Policy; Heartland Alliance; Kaleidoscope       Pathways; Opportunity Youth United; Project Z; SparkAction;       Strive International; YouthBuild USA.        State and Local: Arizona: Opportunities for Youth;       California: KIWA (Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance);       Georgia: Georgia Shift; Louisiana: Dreams are Weapons;       Maryland: Baltimore Algebra Project; New York: City of       Albany, Department of Recreation; Pennsylvania: E5, LLC.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, the minimum wage  has been stuck at $7.25 for the past 10 years. During that time, the  cost of housing, food, childcare, education, all of this has risen  higher and higher, but the minimum wage has been stuck.   This week, the Joint Economic Committee, where I serve as vice chair,  released a report on the Federal minimum wage, and it begins with this  chart. It shows that, in 1968, a full-time worker working year-round at  minimum wage would take home roughly $21,000 a year.   Now, 15 years later, a worker working full-time making minimum wage  earns only $15,000 a year in the same dollars, a loss of over $6,000 in  real 2018 dollars. This is a 30 percent drop.   A full-time worker earning $7.25 minimum wage earns roughly $1,250  per month. That is not enough to cover even half of the monthly  expenses of an average family, which total roughly $3,000. It is not  enough to live on, let alone, to support a family.   Now, some critics say the minimum wage is earned mostly by teenagers,  but that is wrong. More than half of those working at or below the  minimum wage are above 25 years of age.   It ignores the fact that the typical minimum wage worker earns half  of their family's income. As a result, boosting the wage will support  millions of children and families across our Nation.   Workers with more money in their pockets will spend it, stimulating  the economy.   It is important to end the gender gap, because half the people  working for minimum wage are women.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I just want to  applaud the gentleman from Virginia,  Bobby Scott, for his selfless and  bold work. He faced many obstacles.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I urge a very  strong vote on this to support the minimum wage and to get millions of  workers the raise they so justly deserve. Over 33 million Americans  deserve this raise. This chart shows it all.
