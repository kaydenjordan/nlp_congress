 Mr. Speaker, over this past week, it has been  heartening to see the climate pledges and vows coming out of Glasgow.  Our success in Glasgow, however, will not come from voluntary pledges  and vows. It must include specific, effective steps that can be put in  place now to begin making a difference.   I have worked on the climate issue since 1991 when I was a member of  the city council that enacted the Nation's first carbon commitments  which we have met over those years. But the cascade of recent  extraordinary weather events has made it clear--as if we needed further  reminders--that we are entering a new era in terms of impact and public  awareness of climate disasters.   The Oregon experience has been searing. We had the worst air quality  in the world last year due to extreme forest fires. And in my district  when we set an all-time heat record of 116 degrees this summer after  setting two other previous all-time highs, we recorded temperatures of  180 degrees in the heart of my district. No wonder hundreds of people  died.    Working on these issues for years, we have had some successes, but we  can no longer afford to be nibbling around the edges. We need bold,  transformative action to meet the scale of this problem. We must  continue to fight to reduce emissions and improve our resilience by  passing the Build Back Better Act and the bipartisan infrastructure  bill together.   But as we undertake that enormous effort, we must also undertake the  massive issues of community preparedness, resilience, and risk  mitigation. We can start with some of the basics: stop allowing new  development in risky places like the fire zone, the urban-rural  interface, or areas with high flood risk. We must deal with repetitive  flood loss in a more thoughtful way, including paying to remove  properties and people to ensure that the vulnerable aren't stranded in  high-risk areas.   We must enhance the protections of the Stafford Act and help FEMA  address the challenges of today's climate. FEMA does not actually have  a mandate to deal with the extreme heat like we had in Portland that  was killing people. We must empower cities and States to be both  proactive and realistic in their approaches to planning,  [[Page H6187]]  development, and hazard mitigation. We must radically approach our  agriculture and deforestation to stop making it worse.   I have introduced legislation that would make it illegal for products  that were grown on illegally deforested land--palm oil, soy, and  cocoa--from entering the stream of commerce, and having a border  adjustment tax will make a big difference to stop people from exporting  their carbon pollution.   Above all, we must mitigate climate change with an emphasis on  equity, and we should harness the forces of nature to heal the land and  reduce carbon. It is more effective, and it is cheaper. Instead of  putting off much-needed policy changes, this will only delay the  inevitable and make the adjustments more difficult as we reap the  consequences of decades of inaction and denial.   Yes, it is going to take massive investments. But we are already  making massive investments. The biggest infrastructure program now, the  Federal Government, is paying to clean up after natural disasters. We  should take some of that revenue stream and instead invest in  mitigation and recovery that will make us stronger going forward.   Over the past months, I have worked to try and assemble my thoughts,  talking to experts and thinking about what would make a difference. I  have a little report I call ``From Ruin to Resilience: Protecting  Communities and Preventing Disaster.'' I look forward to discussing  this with my colleagues to understand their issues and things that we  can do together on a scale that this challenge demands.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to progress and discussion in Glasgow,  but, more importantly, I look forward to progress and action here in  Congress and in our communities. Our future and our children's future  depend on it.                            ____________________
