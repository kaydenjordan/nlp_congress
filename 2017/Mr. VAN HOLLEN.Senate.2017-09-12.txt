 Mr. President, today I would like to discuss the  importance of ensuring that federally funded infrastructure projects  are built to withstand flood damage.   As we work to provide Federal support to the people of Texas,  Florida, and the Gulf Coast, Congress should consider how we can ensure  that our roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure are better  equipped to withstand future flooding.   In 2015, President Obama signed an executive order to reinforce and  expand existing policy regarding Federal action in a floodplain,  directing agencies to use a higher vertical flood elevation and  horizontal floodplain for federally funded projects. This was a common- sense step to improve our resilience in the face of increased flood  risk.   Then last month, President Trump signed an executive order to reverse  his predecessor's action. Despite support from groups ranging from  environmentalists to the insurance industry, the President has decided  to undo what a former director of public affairs at FEMA called ``the  most significant action taken in a generation to safeguard U.S.  infrastructure.''   We must prepare our Nation's critical infrastructure to deal with  flooding. That is why I am I, along with Senators Schatz and Booker, am  introducing the Flood Risk Management Act of 2017. This bill will  codify common-sense flood standards and ensure that federally funded  infrastructure projects are built to withstand flood damage. The  legislation is supported by the Smarter Safer Coalition, a diverse  group of organizations ranging from insurance groups, environmental  organizations to taxpayer advocates.   If we fail to invest when our roads and bridges are being built, we  risk the lives of American families and ultimately spend more taxpayer  dollars to repair them after floods occur. Now is the time to prepare  for the next disaster--not after it occurs.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Baldwin, and Ms.          Hirono):   S. 1801. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require  institutions of higher education to have an independent advocate for  campus sexual assault prevention and response, to the Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
