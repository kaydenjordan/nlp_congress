 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a  conscientious young citizen in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who recently  was named the Upper Bucks YMCA Role Model of the Year.   Jonathan Walsh of Quakertown received this award for his  participation in the YMCA's Teen Fusion after-school program, where he  stood out amongst his peers for his respect, his sense of  responsibility, and his honesty. I commend Jonathan for this impressive  achievement, and I look forward to seeing what this future leader will  accomplish in the years ahead.   I also want to commend the Upper Bucks YMCA for recognizing Jonathan  and wish this organization well as it celebrates its 50th year of  service to the community. I would especially like to thank Upper Bucks  YMCA Executive Director Pat Edwards and President of the Board of  Directors Dale Westwood for all the work they do in our community.                    RECOGNIZING JENNA RUFO AND TODD BAUER     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two education  professionals in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, whose dedication to  our community's students has led to their appointment as assistant  superintendents for the North Penn School District.    Jenna Rufo and Todd Bauer were sworn in on July 9 at the Montgomery  County courthouse and have recently accepted their new  responsibilities.   Before becoming assistant superintendent, Jenna was the North Penn  School District's director of special education, while Todd served as  principal of the North Penn High School. In their new roles, Jenna will  focus primarily on school safety, mental health, professional  development, and cultural issues; and Todd will focus on  accountability, athletics, summer school, redistricting, and school  board policies.   We commend these fine public servants for their work and wish them  the best of luck as they begin this new chapter in their careers.   I also thank former Assistant Superintendent Diana Holben for her  service as well and wish her all the best in her retirement.                           RECOGNIZING MATT PHELAN     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a dedicated public  servant in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. On July 3, Matt Phelan was  officially sworn in as police chief of Tinicum Township by Magisterial  District Judge Gary Gambardella. He had been serving as acting police  chief since January, upon the appointment of James Sabath to chief of  the Newtown Borough Police Department.   The Tinicum Township Police Department hired Chief Phelan in 1998 at  the age of 22, after he studied at Bloomsburg University and graduated  at the top of his class from Temple Police Academy.   His record of selflessness, courage, and professionalism speaks for  itself. In 2015, then-Sergeant Phelan prevented an armed home invasion  suspect from fleeing the crime scene, risking his life in the pursuit  of justice.   We congratulate you, Chief Phelan, on this well-deserved appointment,  and we are grateful for your service to our community, along with the  entire Tinicum Police Department.                            ____________________
