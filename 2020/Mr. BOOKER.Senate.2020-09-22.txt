 Madam President, I rise at a time of great grief in our  country. We have seen 200,000 fellow Americans perish due to COVID. In  addition to that, we have seen heroes in our Nation fall during this  period as well. Still, we have a heavy heart as we have seen the  passing of civil rights greats like C.T. Vivian and, of course, our  colleague in the House of Representatives, John Lewis.   In many ways, we are walking through the valley of a shadow of death,  but as our fellow Americans fall, it is apt that we give tribute to  their character, to the values and virtues which marked their lives,  and to the truth and ideals that they carried for their lives and how  they advanced to us so that we might have better lives.   Truly, if we are recognizing those values and those virtues, then,  the passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a time that calls upon Americans  to pause and recognize her extraordinary life. She was a woman of small  physical stature, but she was truly a giant amongst us.   Even before her years as a Supreme Court Justice, she championed the  rights of Americans and the ideals we hold so dear. She advanced the  cause of liberty and equality and the understanding, as it says,  literally, on the Supreme Court wall, of ``Equal Justice Under Law.''   This spirit that she fought for was buttressed by her massive  intellect, her acumen, her skill, and her strategy that were seen in  her career as a lawyer, as well as her opinions and work as a Justice.   She understood more, or as much as anyone, that the decisions of the  Supreme Court literally have a profound impact on the daily lives of  Americans, that the decisions of the Supreme Court will affect some of  the most fundamental ideals. It could mean the difference between life  or death, the difference between economic security and economic ruin,  the difference between environmental protection and devastation   It affects not just the balance of power in institutions like the  Senate but also the balance of people's lives and their well-being at  their kitchen table.   She knew that our laws are tools through which we could either make  our Nation live up to its promise for all or fall further away from  them. It is in this context that I want to join my colleagues this  evening in discussing Justice Ginsburg's legacy and the future of the  Supreme Court, because so many of the other things that matter most to  us are in the balance right now with the decisions that this body  makes.   Americans know that the decisions of this body as it relates to the  Supreme Court are going to affect some of the deepest issues that  affect their lives--their economic security, their bodily autonomy,  their right to vote, their civil rights, the environment in which we  all live--and the area I most want to focus on is their healthcare-- their healthcare. The ideal of healthcare is fundamental to the ideals  of our founding document. You cannot have life, liberty, and pursue  happiness if you do not have access to healthcare.   The next person appointed to the Supreme Court will make the kind of  decisions that will quite literally affect the quality of healthcare  and, therefore, will affect life-or-death issues.   We know that over the past 6 months, this deadly pandemic has led to  this valley of a shadow of death for our Nation and the globe and has  led to 200,000 people perishing in our Nation. This is directly  affected by the urgencies of this pandemic. Millions of Americans have  lost their jobs, and 30 million Americans weren't getting enough food  to eat. Communities that were already vulnerable have been devastated  by this public health and economic crisis.   Now, more than ever, Americans are relying on our safety nets,  especially when it comes to access to healthcare. The next Supreme  Court Justice will inevitably oversee whether the Affordable Care Act  stays in place or not.   Thankfully, because of the Affordable Care Act and, in particular,  because the expansion of Medicaid has happened in 36 States so far,  more Americans are getting insured. And now during this pandemic, more  important than ever, many Americans--millions of Americans--are staying  insured even though they have lost their jobs.   An article published in the New England Journal of Medicine in August  reported: ``The ACA, having created several new options for health  insurance unrelated to employment, will protect many recently  unemployed people and their families from losing coverage.''   I know the difference that the Affordable Care Act makes, and in  particular the difference that Medicaid expansion has made, especially  for communities like mine in the State of New Jersey, like the one in  which I live, of hardworking people who are still at the lower echelons  of our economic nation.   This is why I know what the Supreme Court decision could mean if it  strikes down the Affordable Care Act. Especially right now, I know what  it would mean.   Turning again to the New England Journal of Medicine, they make it  plain, and they make it clear:         In the current context of millions of Americans losing       their jobs and an ongoing pandemic, overturning the ACA would       most  [[Page S5754]]       likely be devastating to patients, clinicians, hospitals, and       state economies. The very virus that has brought about record       unemployment levels is the same agent that makes health       insurance--and the new options created under the ACA--more       important than ever.    That is the New England Journal of Medicine.   This fall, the Supreme Court of the United States of America will  consider another challenge to the Affordable Care Act. President  Trump's Justice Department has taken the dangerous position that ``the  entire ACA . . . must fall.''   President Trump is trying to take away the security of the ACA, take  away the law that allows Medicaid expansion, take away the law that  protects people with preexisting conditions and allows them to have  healthcare--the law that, literally, medical professionals are saying  is saving lives today.   And now here we are debating a decision of whom we should put on the  Supreme Court. Will we put another--a third--Trump appointee on the  Supreme Court, one that reflects his values and his views, a Justice  that is likely now to tip the balance even further, that would most  likely overturn the ACA and means that millions of families in the  middle of a pandemic will lose their healthcare?   Days before an election, when my colleagues, just a few short years  ago, said we shouldn't make this decision. This is the conclusion of  colleague, after colleague, after colleague. In that case with Merrick  Garland, we were months and months away from an election--269 days.  Now, we are mere days. It is a decision that will affect the lives of  millions, a decision that goes to the core of our healthcare, our  health, our well-being, our ability to afford what should be a right  for this Nation--access to quality healthcare.   If they go forward with this Justice, what will it mean? It will mean  that the Federal health centers that serve communities that need them  the most would be gutted because that is what the Affordable Care Act  has done for America. It would mean that people with preexisting  conditions, from asthma to cancer to lasting complications of COVID-19,  could be kicked off their coverage at a time when they are more  vulnerable than ever. That is what this decision is about.   It would mean that many seniors who are already living paycheck to  paycheck would have to pay more for their prescription drugs and more  for the preventative services that they receive at no cost today  because of the Affordable Care Act that Donald Trump believes should  fall.   It would mean that young adults who now, more than ever, are relying  on staying on their parents' plan until 26 wouldn't be able to do so  because of the Affordable Care Act that Donald Trump believes should  fall. It would mean that countless babies who need to spend time in the  neonatal intensive unit would hit lifetime limits on care within a few  months or a few weeks of being born.   Gutting the Affordable Care Act, seeing it fall as our President  desires, would mean insurance companies would go back to spending more  of Americans' premium dollars on administrative functions than actual  care. This Supreme Court Justice will determine if the ACA, or the  Affordable Care Act, stands or, as Donald Trump wants, it should fall.  And if it falls, it would mean women would go back to paying more for  their health coverage simply because of their sex.   The Affordable Care Act falling would mean at a time when Black and  Latino Americans are disproportionately dying of this virus, reversing  the gains of the Affordable Care Act has made in narrowing those  disparities now, we would see those communities with less coverage,  less care, less access, less justice.   Donald Trump tried to influence the Court, putting a person on who  reflects his views and his values. Donald Trump wants the ACA to fail.  If he is successful, it will mean more onerous requirements and  barriers to healthcare access during a global pandemic that is already  wreaking devastation and havoc on American communities from sea to  shining sea.   In New Jersey, my State, a repeal of the Affordable Care Act combined  with the impact of COVID-19 would mean 686,000 people in New Jersey  would lose their health coverage, all while dealing with a deadly  pandemic and a recession. Nationally, it would mean 23 million of our  fellow Americans, 23 million people--children, adults, and the  elderly--could lose their coverage if the ACA were repealed during this  pandemic.   The fact is, health coverage saves lives. That is not an  exaggeration. This is life or death. Study after study has borne this  out. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports that the  expansion of Medicaid alone under the Affordable Care Act saved over  19,000 lives between just 2014 and 2017, and the States that didn't  expand Medicaid saw over 15,000 people die prematurely. That is just  among adults age 55 to 64.   The Affordable Care Act--think about the lives saved. Think about  those who did not have Medicaid expansion and the lives lost, our  fellow Americans. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--that is what is at stake right  now and before the pandemic hit.   We know that many of the people who have been hardest hit by COVID-19  rely on Medicaid. Since the pandemic, Medicaid enrollment in our  country has gone up as more people have been in need. It has grown for  the first time in 3 years. Because of this pandemic, more people are  hurting, and more of our fellow Americans are finding themselves in  crisis. Across the country, more families are able to turn to Medicaid  during this crisis because of the Affordable Care Act. The State of  Kentucky, which the Republican leader represents, had the highest rise  in Medicaid enrollment, with a 17.2-percent increase from February to  August.   This is how our social safety net should work. It should be there in  a crisis. When there is more disease, when there is more death, when  there is more suffering, we as a nation should show more compassion,  more empathy, and more care, not less.   We saw in 2018, when people were asked why they were voting, why we  saw a surge in turnout, it was because people were concerned about  their healthcare. And that was before the pandemic. This election will  be about many things, but most people will know that this is an  election about the security of healthcare.   One President says, again, and I quote: Let it fall. Another wants to  preserve it and put people on the Supreme Court who will defend it as  fundamentally in line with our constitutional ideals--life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness. That is the jeopardy. That is what is at  stake using the logic not of any Democrat but using the logic of my  Republican colleague after Republican colleague, my Republican friend  after my Republican friend, who--I heard what they said when they  denied Barack Obama a Supreme Court pick. I heard their words. They  were clear. My friend, the head of the Judiciary Committee, even went  as far as to say: ``Use my words against me.''   If it is the final year of President Trump's term, we should wait  until after the election before we put someone on the highest Court in  the land for a lifetime appointment. What is this about? It is about  the most sacred ideals of our Nation--life, liberty, freedom from fear,  freedom from disease.   I don't know what to say because I see what is happening right now.  People speak passionately about a standard, defend themselves, cite  historic precedent, and then when things shift and they have a chance  to show consistency and to show restraint, show allegiance to comity,  show allegiance to the ideals that bond us together, they instead turn  their backs on their very words. Instead, they betray the principle and  rule that they set in place.   If it was just politics, that would be one thing, but what is at  stake is the healthcare of Americans. There are people afraid tonight.  There are people scared across our country--a parent with a child who  has a rare cancer, an adult struggling to afford their prescription  drugs, someone who is out of a job, someone with a preexisting  condition. This is not about politics. This is about them. It is about  their lives and their well-being.   Millions of Americans benefit from the Affordable Care Act. By  pushing, by rushing this through to get another Trump Justice by a  President who wants that action by Congress, who  [[Page S5755]]  wants the Affordable Care Act to fail, what will that mean? Where will  that leave us when this decision goes to that Supreme Court with three  Justices--one of whom should have been Barack Obama's?   Justice Ginsburg stood up for our ideals. She stood up for this  belief that it is the little person, it is the person with the margins  of life, it is the person who has been demeaned and degraded by  powerful forces--that they should have equality. She fought for and won  battles that my generation takes for granted.   Her last dying wish was not about one President or another but that  we should wait until after this election. I believe she said that not  just because of the conflicts of our time, she said that not just  because she believed it was right but because she believed in the  Supreme Court. She believed that the Supreme Court, no matter what the  politics of our time, should be a place that holds legitimacy in the  Republic, that America should not see that as a body that could be  politicalized by the behaviors of Congress, so she said: Wait.   Ironically, it is the same sentiment that my colleagues said we  should do when Merrick Garland was nominated. Then, they were with  Justice Ginsburg. I tell you, she may be gone, but they should honor  her in truth right now by upholding that sentiment, their sentiments,  the very idea that could possibly give us more hope--that healthcare,  that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness can win the day   I yield the floor.
