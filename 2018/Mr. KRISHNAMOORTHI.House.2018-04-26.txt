 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman and ranking  member for including my amendment in the en bloc.   My amendment would require the FAA to study the economic harm caused  by excessive aircraft noise on communities and businesses near major  airports.   Companies adjacent to airports, such as O'Hare International Airport  in my district, see that flight paths have to contend with the economic  activity in that region, and noise disrupts their customers and  interferes with business, in addition to the physiological effects that  constant noise has on employees.   Under my amendment, the FAA will study what happens to businesses  when they are subject to excessive noise throughout the workday. This  will include, but is not limited to, employee productivity and  retention, workplace morale and satisfaction, and other data to help  policymakers grasp the full effect of airport noise on neighborhoods.   This is a bipartisan, commonsense amendment, and again, I thank the  committee for including it in the en bloc.
