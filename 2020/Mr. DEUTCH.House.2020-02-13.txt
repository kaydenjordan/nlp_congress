 Madam Speaker, it has been 2 years since the shooting at  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.   In those 2 years, the surviving families and students have turned  their pain into power. They stood up to gun companies. They testified  before Congress. They helped craft and pass legislation. They worked  with the Federal Government. They worked with the State government.  They won school board seats. They made beautiful, moving art. Students  have lifted their voices, written songs. They have walked out and they  have marched. That is what the survivors of my community are doing.   But there is so much more that Congress and the President can do to  save lives from gun violence. There is so much more we can do to honor  the lives that were lost at Stoneman Douglas: Alyssa, Scott, Martin,  Nicholas, Aaron, Jaime, Chris, Luke, Cara, Gina, Joaquin, Alaina,  Meadow, Helena, Alex, Carmen, and Peter.
