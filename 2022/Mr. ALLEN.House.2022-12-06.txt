 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Lamborn for arranging  this Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, when President Roosevelt convened the inaugural  celebration of National Bible Week, as was mentioned, it was 1941.  America was still recovering from an economic collapse, and across the  sea, war raged in Europe.    It seemed the whole world was shrouded in darkness. But Roosevelt  believed that the Bible is an eternal source of hope.   We know that the Bible is life-changing. As mentioned about the news  of the attack and as mentioned before, NBC was broadcasting the reading  of the Bible; they made a monumental decision during that process. As  they were broadcasting the news, during breaks, they would continue to  read the Bible. They recognized one simple truth: There is no greater  spiritual armor than the Word of God.   So where are we some 81 years later? The pollsters say that 7 in 10  Americans believe that our Nation is in crisis and at the risk of  collapse. There continues to be wars and rumors of wars. But I believe,  as President Roosevelt believed, in the awesome life-changing power of  God's Word.   Ephesians 6 says:         Put on the full armor of God that you may be able to stand       against the schemes of the devil. For we do not wrestle       against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the       authorities, against this present darkness, against the       spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.    As we look around our Chamber here, fellow Members, we are without  excuse. As mentioned earlier, we have ``In God We Trust'' here. We have  lawmakers all around us and, obviously, the full face of Moses, who  gave us the first four chapters of the Bible.   Some 40 years later, after National Bible Week was declared, Billy  Graham gave this prayer, and I will read part of it. He said: ``Our  Father and our God, Thou hast said, `Blessed is that nation whose God  is the Lord.' We recognize on this historic occasion that we are `a  nation under God.' We thank Thee for this torch of faith handed to us  by our forefathers. May we never let it be extinguished. Thou alone has  given us our prosperity, our freedom and our power. This faith in God  is our heritage and our foundation.   ``Thou has warned us in the Scriptures, `If the foundations be  destroyed, what can the righteous do?'  [[Page H8796]]    ``As George Washington reminded us in his farewell address, morality  and faith are the pillars of our society. We confess these pillars are  being eroded in an increasingly materialistic and permissive society.  The whole world is watching to see if the faith of our fathers will  stand the trials and tests of this hour. Too long we have neglected Thy  word and ignored Thy laws. Too long we have tried to solve our problems  without reference to Thee. Too long we have tried to live by bread  alone. We have sown to the wind and are now reaping the whirlwind of  crime, division, and rebellion.''   That prayer was given in 1969, and here we are today. So just as we  turned to the Bible then, I pray that we will turn to it now.
