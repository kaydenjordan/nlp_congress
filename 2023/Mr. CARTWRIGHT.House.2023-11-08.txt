 Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. It  is an admirable thing, what the gentleman from West Virginia is  proposing, protecting investors, making sure investment money is secure  and well protected, but this is attacking the SEC's private fund  adviser rule, and that is something that protects investors.   It has been designed with the intent to enhance regulatory oversight  and transparency within the private fund industry.   The private fund adviser rule increases investor protection by  subjecting private fund advisers to registration and regulatory  scrutiny by the SEC.   When you hear the word ``regulation,'' think protection. The rule  promotes market integrity and stability by minimizing the risk  associated with private fund operations.   Private funds can significantly impact financial markets due to their  size and the extent of their investments.   The SEC's private fund adviser rule aims to enhance investor  protection. It improves market integrity, and it establishes a  consistent regulatory framework for private fund advisers.   This is exactly the kind of protection we need to instill confidence  by investors in the market and keep capital flowing in this country.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this particular  amendment.   Again, it is about protecting investors. The SEC's rule addressing  conflicts of interest in the use of this so-called predictive data  analytics by broker-dealers and investment advisers places a strong  emphasis on protecting investor interests. This rule promotes unbiased  decisionmaking by requiring firms to proactively manage and disclose  conflicts associated with predictive data analytics.   By addressing conflicts of interest, the SEC's rule contributes to  market integrity and fairness, and that is what we need for the  constant flow of capital to where it needs to go in this country.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment is opposed, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   The inclusion of the social cost of greenhouse gases in regulatory  analyses ensures that the full spectrum of costs associated with  greenhouse gas emissions is considered.   This is about full, open, and honest accounting. It includes not only  economic costs but also health, environmental, and societal costs,  providing a more accurate and comprehensive assessment.   The social costs of greenhouse gases account for the health-related  impacts of climate change, such as heat-related illnesses, air  pollution, and the spread of diseases from mosquitos, ticks, and fleas.   Inclusion in regulatory analysis leads to decisions that prioritize  the protection of public health, reducing the burden on healthcare  systems. This leads  [[Page H5629]]  to a more comprehensive cost evaluation, encourages emissions  reduction, preserves the environment, and promotes sustainable economic  growth.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is opposed, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this particular  amendment, which would block a rule that promotes meaningful  shareholder engagement by requiring a higher level of shareholder  support for resubmitted proposals.   This rule helps streamline the shareholder proposal process by  discouraging the repetitive submission of proposals that have failed to  gain substantial support in the past. By requiring shareholders to  demonstrate substantial support for their proposals, the rule  encourages responsible activism and discourages the use of the  shareholder proposal process for purely symbolic or nuisance proposals.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is opposed, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.  [[Page H5630]]     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, as  well.   Contrary to the misrepresentations made by environmental, social, and  governance opponents, the SEC's disclosure rule on ESG investments  takes no position on the merits of these approaches.   The rule does not define ESG or stipulate any particular approach to  it. Instead, this is a rule that requires, for those who make such  investments, the disclosure of information about how ESG is defined and  implemented in applicable investment portfolios.   The rule will offer increased transparency for investors and protect  them from exaggerated or unfounded claims related to ESG investments  being made.   Now, if it passes, my friend from South Carolina's amendment would  leave investors in the dark and leave them vulnerable to getting misled  or bamboozled about ESG claims.   I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, for the reasons previously stated, this  amendment is opposed, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. It  is an amendment that would block the SEC's rule to require companies to  disclose material cybersecurity incidents to their investors.   As SEC Chair Gary Gensler puts it: Whether a company loses a factory  in a fire--or millions of files in a cybersecurity incident--it may be  material to investors.   Mr. Chair, many public companies already provide their investors with  cybersecurity incident disclosures. These rules merely make such  disclosures more consistent and comparable in a way that can be useful  for those making investment decisions.   Why in the world would you want to invest in a company that hides its  cybersecurity incidents?   Efforts like this amendment would undermine transparency and provide  investors with less useful information regarding material cybersecurity  events.   I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is opposed, and I yield  back the balance of my time.  [[Page H5631]]         Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. It  is an amendment that would block the Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board's proposal to strengthen standards for public company  auditors to more proactively identify, evaluate, and communicate a  company's noncompliance with laws and rules.   Why in the world wouldn't we want to warn investors about scofflaw  companies?   The PCAOB's proposal will increase auditor vigilance against fraud  and general noncompliance with laws and regulations. Steps like these  would encourage companies to take more timely action to remediate  issues and reduce harm to investors.   This amendment would represent a significant setback to PCAOB's  commonsense efforts to combat fraud. Let's protect investors. I  strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is opposed, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I acknowledge that there is probably no  Member of this House happier than I am not to have to wear a mask this  afternoon.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. It is a useless  amendment. The COVID public health emergency has ended. This is water  over the dam. We should stop wasting the House's time on useless  amendments.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I urge a ``no'' vote, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment is opposed, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment  which would hinder efforts to promote transparency and accountability  in small business lending and create hurdles for lenders and community  organizations working to help women-owned businesses and minority-owned  businesses access capital.   The CFPB's rulemaking would provide small business owners, lenders,  and the public with critical information about the $1.7 trillion small  business financing market.   This amendment would harm all those who stand to benefit from this  expanded transparency and accountability.   Small businesses are the engines of our American economy. Congress  should not take action such as this amendment to hurt their ability to  prosper.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge a ``no''  vote. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   A nonpartisan civil service ensures Federal agencies carry out their  missions with professionalism, safeguards the rule of law over  partisanship, and ensures continuity between Presidential  administrations.   This didn't use to be a dispute in Washington, D.C. There was a  clear, longstanding bipartisan consensus behind these principles until  the previous administration attempted to undermine statutory merit- based protections for Federal civil servants.   Their effort would have moved tens of thousands of career Federal  employees to a new job classification that would remove their  employment protections.   This amendment seeks to block the Office of Personnel Management's  efforts to uphold these vital protections and works to undermine the  integrity of a merit-based, nonpartisan civil service.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge a ``no''  vote. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is opposed, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, Congress gave the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, the CFPB, the job of ensuring that consumer  protection laws are enforced consistently and that companies do not  engage in unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices.   The statute is clear that this authority extends to oversight of  nonbank companies that offer financial services or products.   Consistent with its mission of protecting consumers from abusive  practices, the CFPB's nonbank registry will provide increased  transparency over this sector and deter bad behavior. This amendment  would stymie the CFPB's important effort on behalf of consumers and  block the agency from preventing abusive practices by nonbanks that  offer Financial Services or products.   Congress has to focus its attention on strengthening consumer  protections for working people and investors, preventing companies from  charging junk fees, and supporting enforcement to crack down on  unscrupulous behavior. These are things we should be doing.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment, I urge a ``no'' vote,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    I claim the time in opposition, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Chairman, the Federal Labor Relations Authority's  proposed changes to rules around how and when Federal employees can  cancel payments of their union dues merely restores a longstanding  policy about dues payments that had been in place since 1981.   The policy merely establishes that employees may opt out of their  union dues payments during a certain time period each year.   Under this longstanding procedure, Federal employees who choose to  join their agency's union are made aware of the annual dues revocation  period. Every year some members choose to revoke their membership and  cease paying dues, a fair process that has worked well for decades.   This amendment would block these decades-old rules and introduce less  stability, less financial security, and less predictability for Federal  employee unions.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment, I urge a ``no'' vote,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   This amendment blocks an important rule requiring major Federal  contractors to publicly disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and  climate-related financial risks and sets science-based emissions  reduction targets.   The Federal Government is the world's single-largest buyer of goods  and services, purchasing over $630 billion in the last fiscal year  alone. Accordingly, the rule recognizes that the Federal Government  also faces significant financial risks from climate change.   This amendment would have us bury our heads in the sand, ignore the  Federal Government's exposure to climate change impacts, and prevent us  from working toward commonsense climate goals. For those reasons, I  urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   This amendment would block the construction of Federal buildings in  Washington, D.C., and with all due respect to the gentleman from  Montana, it is based on a fundamental misconception. It is not like  these projects go up at the whim of the administration. Buildings have  to have appropriated funding, and there is a prospectus process on the  authorizing side.   This is a misguided amendment.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   For more than 50 years, the United States Consumer Product Safety  Commission has worked to fulfill its statutory mission to protect the  public against unreasonable risk of injuries and deaths associated with  consumer products.   By cutting the CPSC's budget by half, this amendment would gut the  agency's staff and undermine its mission.   It is an extreme measure that would place children, families, and  communities around the country at greater risk of injury and death from  product  [[Page H5637]]  hazards. This amendment would leave consumers vulnerable to products  that pose a fire, electrical, chemical, or mechanical hazard or that  can injure children.   Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge a ``no''  vote.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is opposed, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this senseless  amendment.   The White House gun violence task force is committed to treating gun  violence as the public health crisis it is. By approaching this issue  from a public health perspective, the task force aims to reduce the  staggering number of deaths and injuries caused by firearms in the  United States.   The task force emphasizes the importance of data-driven and evidence- based policy decisions that will create solutions that balance the  rights of law-abiding gun owners with the need for public safety.   Mr. Chair, as a gun owner myself, I tell you that task force seeks to  enact commonsense gun safety measures that the majority of Americans  support. These include: background checks for all gun sales, closing  the gun show and online sale loopholes, and implementing red flag laws  temporarily to disarm individuals who pose a danger to themselves or  others.   I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge a ``no'' vote. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Frost).

Climate-related financial risks can have significant adverse  economic impacts on businesses, communities, and the financial sector.   Come on. Addressing these risks is essential to safeguard economic  stability and resilience, and these things are crucial in the face of a  changing climate.   Financial institutions and Federal agencies ought to consider climate  risks in their decisionmaking processes, particularly in investment and  lending practices. By doing so, it promotes responsible and sustainable  investment choices that support projects and businesses with low  environmental impacts.   These executive orders underscore the importance of the United States  taking a leadership role in global efforts to combat climate change. By  setting ambitious domestic goals and engaging with international  partners, the United States can encourage other countries to follow  suit, resulting in a more effective global response to climate change.  The United States should be leading this effort.   These executive orders are essential for combating climate change  because they address climate-related financial risks, encourage  responsible investment, promote global leadership, strengthen  resilience, and accelerate the transition to clean energy.  [[Page H5640]]    They collectively contribute to a more comprehensive and effective  approach to mitigating the impacts of climate change and advancing  environmental sustainability.    For these reasons, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I do urge a  ``no'' vote. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is opposed, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   The SEC guidance that this rule would block provides clearer guidance  for companies for disclosure of non-generally accepted accounting  principles, non-GAAP. This clarity helps investors better understand a  company's financial performance, making investment decisions more  informed. It is as simple as that.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.

The SEC's 2022 proxy adviser rule promotes transparency and  accountability by requiring proxy advisory firms to provide more  disclosure about their methodologies, their potential conflicts of  interest, and their engagement with issuers. This rule aims to improve  the accuracy and reliability of proxy advisory recommendations, which  play a crucial role in corporate governance.   The SEC's 2022 proxy adviser rule strikes a balance among the  interests of issuers, investors, and proxy advisory firms.

The Communications Equity and Diversity Council at the Federal  Communications Commission, the FCC, is instrumental in promoting  inclusivity within the organization. By championing diversity, it  ensures that the workforce represents a broader spectrum of  perspectives, fostering a more inclusive and equitable workplace.   The council's existence improves decisionmaking at the FCC by  incorporating diverse viewpoints. Diverse teams are more likely to  generate innovative ideas, leading to better policies and regulations  that benefit a wider range of people in the ever-evolving  communications and technology sector.   The Communications Equity and Diversity Council also plays a crucial  role in ensuring that the FCC complies with American law as well as  ethical guidelines related to diversity and equity in employment.   For these reasons, I strongly oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.
