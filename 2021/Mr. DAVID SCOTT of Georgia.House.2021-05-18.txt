 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman very  much for yielding. I thank my distinguished Republican colleague for  his very fine comments.   Madam Speaker, this is one of our most important bills because it is  happening at a time when so many of our people are facing such ravaging  financial problems and concerns.   Since the passage of Dodd-Frank, which I worked hard on, as many of  you did, and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,  we charged that agency with ensuring that consumers have access to  safe, accessible, and affordable financial products.   Yet, Madam Speaker, do you know that we still have 7.1 million of our  American citizens who are unbanked, relying on pawn shops and payday  lenders to get by? As this past year has laid bare, many families are  just one crisis, one sickness, one broken vehicle, one emergency from  absolute financial devastation.   Without support from regulated, legitimate financial institutions,  these consumers are forced to turn to predatory lenders and unsound  products. They are at the mercy of some of the most unscrupulous  characters we know.   Our bill is a very strong bipartisan bill, which the gentleman from  Arkansas has articulated well.   Madam Speaker, with this bill, we will prioritize the most  underserved and unbanked persons across our great Nation, and we will  be taking the first step toward improving access and affordability in  banking for all of our American people.   I urge my colleagues everywhere to give this a unanimous vote on the  floor later today.
