A bill to enhance the participation of precision agriculture  in the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.    Madam President, agriculture may well be among the world's  oldest ways of life, but it has never been stagnant. Farmers and  ranchers have always looked for new and better ways to increase crop  yields, conserve resources, and keep their land and livestock healthy  and productive. Today's agricultural producers explore new farming  practices, grow more resilient crops, and adopt new technologies to  produce more and to use less. And the resilience of our food supply and  America's ability to feed our country and the world are in no small  measure thanks to these farmer-driven advances.   As I said, farmers and ranchers are always looking for ways to  improve their operations, but they can face challenges when they are  looking for reliable data. While the U.S. Department of Agriculture  collects a lot of data, little has been done to analyze and organize it  so it is useful for farmers.   Right now, many producers have to rely on anecdotal information to  determine the value of things, like conservation and other production  practices, and decide what to adopt on their farms and ranches. Better  data would make it easier for farmers to decide what practices are the  best option for them.   A recent study of Department of Agriculture data from farms in  several States confirmed anecdotal reports about certain conservation  practices. It demonstrated that farmers who use these practices were  more likely to be able to plant during an exceptionally wet spring.  That is the kind of information farmers need to make informed decisions  about their operations. We need to see more of this kind of analysis.   That is why, earlier this year, I introduced my bipartisan  Agriculture Innovation Act with Senator Klobuchar. Our bill would make  it easier for producers to use USDA data to assess the impact of  various conservation and production practices so that producers can  choose the right practices for their farm and ranch operations. I will  work to get the Agriculture Innovation Act included in this year's farm  bill.  [[Page S745]]    While the macrolevel data that USDA collects can provide valuable  information, farmers are already beginning to look to the next  frontier, collecting real-time microlevel data from their own fields.   Imagine what a farmer could do with real-time information about soil  quality, water uptake, and plant health. Imagine quickly knowing  whether you need more nitrogen or less water in a section of your  field. Imagine having real-time data about your land or livestock at  your fingertips. This is the promise of precision agriculture:  harnessing the power of technology to help producers manage their  operations with real-time data.   GPS can allow farmers to identify field characteristics, map out  irrigation, and optimize crop production on their fields. Soil monitors  can allow farmers to react to conditions as they change and apply  fertilizers more precisely. And remote monitoring can help farmers keep  tabs on everything from resource usage to livestock health and feed  consumption.   This precision agriculture represents a significant leap forward in  farmers' long advance toward producing more and using less. It presents  an opportunity to increase profitability by cutting down on inputs, the  prices of which have spiked amid our inflation crisis. And it is a step  toward broader use of conservation practices that will keep farm land  in productive use for years to come.   But for Americans to reap all of the benefits of precision  agriculture, more work needs to be done.   Today, I am introducing the bipartisan Promoting Precision  Agriculture Act with Senator Warnock to help facilitate widespread  adoption of precision technology. My bill would establish a partnership  between government and the private sector to develop voluntary  interconnectivity standards and prioritize cyber security for precision  agriculture technologies. These standards will help enhance agriculture  update and ensure reliability, usability, and security for producers  and their data. It is an important element of ensuring these new  technologies deliver the advances they promise and of making sure  farmers and ranchers can trust that they are worthwhile investments.   But as farmers look to precision agriculture future, the one thing  that could still hold them back is the continued digital divide.  Without a reliable internet connection, precision agriculture just  doesn't work. Next-generation precision ag technologies will need  stronger connectivity.   Connecting unserved areas to reliable broadband has long been a  priority of mine, and we made a good deal of progress through Federal  investments and policies like my MOBILE NOW Act that removed regulatory  barriers to broadband expansion.   But we still have a lot of work to do.   This year, I reintroduced my Rural Internet Improvement Act to  streamline USDA's broadband authorities and ensure broadband funding  goes to areas where at least 90 percent of households lack broadband  access.   We also need to ensure broadband investments we have already made are  actually going to their intended goal, and that is expanding broadband  access to areas that are currently lacking it.   In the last 3 years, the Federal Government has allocated $79 billion  to broadband programs. But all the money in the world is useless if it  is not being spent properly, which is why I launched a broadband  oversight initiative in December to ensure this funding is going toward  delivering broadband to the Americans who need it most.   It has been clear for a long time how critical an internet connection  is to the future of everything from education and healthcare to  business and everyday life. Connectivity has the potential to truly  revolutionize how we grow food in America.   I am proud that South Dakota has been a leader in precision  agriculture. South Dakota State University was the first in the country  to offer a 4-year precision agriculture degree. In 2021, the university  opened the Raven Precision Agriculture Center where the next generation  of farmers will work to advance the next generation of farming.   Since opening its precision ag center, SDSU has also launched a  precision ag and cyber program with Dakota State University, a leading  cyber security institution.   As I have said numerous times, agriculture is the lifeblood of South  Dakota. And anything we can do to make agriculture more efficient and  more productive is not only good for our Nation's food supply, it is  good for South Dakota farmers and their families.   Precision agriculture is one of those things. It has the potential to  deliver the same kind of advance that crop rotation, the Farmer's  Almanac, and crop engineering delivered for farming. It can make  farming more efficient, more cost-effective, and environmentally  friendly than it already is. And it can help our farms produce more  food for more people with fewer resources and on less land.   I will be working hard to ensure South Dakota farmers and ranchers  and farmers and ranchers around the country have the resources they  need to innovate and that this year's farm bill advances the next  generation of farming.   A farmer is a lot of things: a scientist and a laborer, an innovator  and accountant, an engineer and a conservationist. I am proud to serve  the extraordinary men and women who keep our rich agricultural heritage  alive and thriving. And I will continue working to help them as they  move it into the future.

These standards will help enhance agriculture  update and ensure reliability, usability, and security for producers  and their data. It is an important element of ensuring these new  technologies deliver the advances they promise and of making sure  farmers and ranchers can trust that they are worthwhile investments.   But as farmers look to precision agriculture future, the one thing  that could still hold them back is the continued digital divide.  Without a reliable internet connection, precision agriculture just  doesn't work. Next-generation precision ag technologies will need  stronger connectivity.   Connecting unserved areas to reliable broadband has long been a  priority of mine, and we made a good deal of progress through Federal  investments and policies like my MOBILE NOW Act that removed regulatory  barriers to broadband expansion.   But we still have a lot of work to do.   This year, I reintroduced my Rural Internet Improvement Act to  streamline USDA's broadband authorities and ensure broadband funding  goes to areas where at least 90 percent of households lack broadband  access.   We also need to ensure broadband investments we have already made are  actually going to their intended goal, and that is expanding broadband  access to areas that are currently lacking it.   In the last 3 years, the Federal Government has allocated $79 billion  to broadband programs. But all the money in the world is useless if it  is not being spent properly, which is why I launched a broadband  oversight initiative in December to ensure this funding is going toward  delivering broadband to the Americans who need it most.   It has been clear for a long time how critical an internet connection  is to the future of everything from education and healthcare to  business and everyday life. Connectivity has the potential to truly  revolutionize how we grow food in America.   I am proud that South Dakota has been a leader in precision  agriculture. South Dakota State University was the first in the country  to offer a 4-year precision agriculture degree. In 2021, the university  opened the Raven Precision Agriculture Center where the next generation  of farmers will work to advance the next generation of farming.   Since opening its precision ag center, SDSU has also launched a  precision ag and cyber program with Dakota State University, a leading  cyber security institution.   As I have said numerous times, agriculture is the lifeblood of South  Dakota. And anything we can do to make agriculture more efficient and  more productive is not only good for our Nation's food supply, it is  good for South Dakota farmers and their families.   Precision agriculture is one of those things. It has the potential to  deliver the same kind of advance that crop rotation, the Farmer's  Almanac, and crop engineering delivered for farming. It can make  farming more efficient, more cost-effective, and environmentally  friendly than it already is. And it can help our farms produce more  food for more people with fewer resources and on less land.   I will be working hard to ensure South Dakota farmers and ranchers  and farmers and ranchers around the country have the resources they  need to innovate and that this year's farm bill advances the next  generation of farming.   A farmer is a lot of things: a scientist and a laborer, an innovator  and accountant, an engineer and a conservationist. I am proud to serve  the extraordinary men and women who keep our rich agricultural heritage  alive and thriving. And I will continue working to help them as they  move it into the future.
