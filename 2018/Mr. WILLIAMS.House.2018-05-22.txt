 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 2155,  the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act,  which passed the Senate with bipartisan support last month.   This important legislation stems from years of consideration,  hearings, markups, and floor votes in the House, coupled with a  bicameral commitment with the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs Committee to deliver relief for the American people.   More than half of the 53 provisions included in S. 2155 originated in  the House Financial Services Committee, and I applaud the work of the  chairman throughout this lengthy process.   Right now, small community banks cannot keep up with oppressive  regulations that are reluctantly forcing so many to close their doors.  As I have said time and time again, the practice of one-size-fits-all  does not and should not apply to financial institutions. In order to  unleash our economic potential, Congress must act now to repeal  unnecessary regulations while properly tailoring those we need.   Mr. Speaker, S. 2155 will finally provide the relief for our  community banks by cutting through red tape. In turn, small businesses  and the American consumer will now have better access to credit and  encourage more economic growth and consumption.   Make no mistake about it: this economy is roaring. I have been in  business 47 years, and I know what I am talking about.    I am proud to join colleagues in support of this bipartisan,  bicameral legislation and look forward to President Trump's signature  as soon as possible.   In God we trust.
