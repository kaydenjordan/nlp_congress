 Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, little that we can do here today is going to make a  difference in what those families endured. We can only supply a small  token of our appreciation for the greatest fighting force of men and  women on the planet.   I want you to think with me for a second here. When the world has a  calamity, it doesn't matter whether it is a hurricane, whether it is a  tsunami, whether it is an earthquake, whether it is pestilence, famine,  or rebellion, invasion. When the world has a calamity and they dial  911, who is it that answers? It is the United States of America, isn't  it? With the greatest fighting force of men and women this world has  ever known.   When America is safe, the world is a safer place. To the families,  the Gold Star families, whose family members gave all, we owe them a  debt of gratitude, and not just us, but the world as well.   Mr. Speaker, may God bless them, and may they rest in peace.
