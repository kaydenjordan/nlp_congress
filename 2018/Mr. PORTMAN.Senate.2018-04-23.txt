 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the  achievements of Richard W. Pogue on the occasion of his 90th birthday.  Mr. Pogue is a respected attorney and community leader who continues to  this day to work tirelessly to serve greater Cleveland, the State of  Ohio, and our country. The impact of his generosity, commitment to the  northeast Ohio community where he lives, and tradition of service has  touched countless organizations and individuals. I am pleased to  recognize Mr. Pogue's over six decades of service today.   Mr. Pogue was born on April 26, 1928. He graduated from Cornell  University in 1950 and the University of Michigan Law School in 1953.  After serving 3 years, from 1954 to 1957, in the office of the Judge  Advocate General, U.S. Army, in the Pentagon, he was honorably  discharged with the rank of captain and joined the Cleveland law firm  of Jones, Day, Cockley & Reavis as an associate in 1957. He became a  partner in the firm nearly 60 years ago.   In 1984, Pogue became managing partner of the firm, which was at this  time known as Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue. During the 9 years he spent  as managing partner, he led the firm during a period of unprecedented  growth, including taking the firm into international markets. His area  of practice has primarily focused on antitrust and corporate takeover  work, and he has served as a mediator in a large number of major  commercial disputes.   Mr. Pogue retired from Jones Day in 1994, only to take on a second  career as senior adviser to Dix & Eaton, a Cleveland public relations  firm. He returned to Jones Day in 2004 and currently serves as senior  adviser to the firm.   Mr. Pogue's distinguished professional career as an accomplished  lawyer and corporate adviser alone warrants this recognition. However,  his caring leadership and dedication to civic engagement is even more  impressive and has left a lasting impact on countless organizations  throughout our community and State. He has served as chairperson of  many organizations, including the Cleveland Foundation, Greater  Cleveland Growth Association, Business Volunteers Unlimited, University  Hospitals, and the Cleveland Council on World Affairs. He is known for  his commitment to helping young people, improving our neighborhoods,  many philanthropic endeavors, advising public and private sector  leaders, and guiding business organizations through changing times. He  chairs the advisory committee for the Regula Institute at Mount Union  University and was a founding trustee of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  and Museum. He is a member of the Ohio State Bar Association Committee  to preserve the legacy of Ohio Chief Justice Thomas J. Moyer, the  Access to Justice Task Force appointed by Ohio's Supreme Court Chief  Justice, and the Ohio Legal Assistance Foundation.   He continues to be committed to higher education and has remained an  active contributor to the University of Michigan Law School, which  honored him as the inaugural recipient of the Michigan Law School  Distinguished Alumni Award. He has served as a trustee of Case Western  Reserve University, University of Akron, and the Cleveland Institute of  Music.   As he approaches his 90th birthday, Mr. Pogue is known to rise early  each morning, work long days, and engage with community leaders and  citizens in a wide variety of endeavors. He is a dedicated and loving  husband, father, and grandfather to his wife, Patricia; their three  children, Mark, Tracy and David; and their eight grandchildren. He is  modest and quietly effective. His kind nature, integrity,  professionalism, and dedication to community service has touched the  lives of so many and has truly made a difference for greater Cleveland,  our State, and Nation. It is my pleasure to recognize Richard W. Pogue  and offer my best wishes as his family, friends, and the community he  loves gather to celebrate his 90th birthday.                            ____________________
