 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, House Republicans have revived their  efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   As a reminder, the original effort to repeal the Affordable Care  Act--characterized by some as the TrumpCare bill--was so unpopular that  it had to be withdrawn from the floor of the U.S. House of  Representatives. That is because, after the Congressional Budget Office  took a look, it would have taken away health insurance from 24 million  Americans.   Think about that for a moment. The Republican answer to ObamaCare-- the Affordable Care Act--was to remove health insurance protection and  coverage from 24 million Americans. It would have devastated the  Medicaid Program. The Medicaid Program, of course, is one that is  easily characterized as a health insurance program for those who are in  low-income categories, but that statement doesn't tell the real story.   For example, in my State, half of the children who are born in  Illinois are covered by Medicaid. Their mothers and the kids are  covered by Medicaid. So when it comes to new babies, particularly in  low-income families, Medicaid provides the prenatal care, delivery, and  care after the child is born, but the most expensive part of the  Medicaid Program is the help it gives to senior citizens--mothers and  grandmothers who are in nursing homes who have only a little bit of  savings, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid cover their medical  expenses. The Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act would  have decimated the Medicaid Program across the United States. It would  have increased costs for the average person for health insurance by  $3,000, and particularly for people in upper ages--I guess I fit in  that category--these folks would have seen a change in the calculation  of premiums.   The Affordable Care Act protects premiums so they cannot be more than  three times the lowest premium for any individual. The Republican  approach said: Let's make that five times. If it goes up to five times,  it can mean almost doubling the premiums paid by many senior citizens-- those approaching, I should say, being senior citizens, from 50 to age  65.   It also would have cut off funding for women's health centers, all  while providing a massive tax cut for upper income, wealthy people and  big businesses, including tax cuts for drug companies. What a deal--to  eliminate health insurance for 24 million Americans, to devastate the  Medicaid Program, to increase the cost of health insurance for the  average individual, to cut off funding for women's health centers in  order to give a tax cut to wealthy people and drug companies.   The new bill does all those things as well--and then something I  didn't think was possible. The new version of the Affordable Care Act  repeal Republicans are now considering in the House allows insurance  companies to impose--get this--an age tax and charge seniors  significantly higher premiums than younger people. It says that  insurance plans do not have to cover hospital visits, prescription  drugs, maternity care, substance abuse treatment, or mental health  services.   The Affordable Care Act defined these as essential services so, if  you are buying health insurance, you know you are buying that kind of  protection. Well, Republicans have said: That is too much insurance for  people. We ought to let them buy stripped-down versions of health  insurance that may be cheaper. The obvious question, What happens to  those people when they need coverage for substance abuse treatment?  What if that son or daughter in high school begins an addiction to  opioids, leading to heroin, and now your health insurance plan saved  you money by not covering it or didn't cover mental health counseling?   It guts protections for people with preexisting conditions. Is there  a person alive who doesn't know someone or have someone in their family  with a preexisting condition? That used to be grounds for denying  insurance coverage or charging outrageous premiums. We did away with it  with the Affordable Care Act.   It is back, my friends, with the new Republican approach to the  repeal of affordable care. It allows insurance companies to once again  charge unaffordable premiums if someone in your family has a history of  asthma, cancer, high blood pressure, or diabetes.   Republicans made these changes to win the votes of the most extreme  conservative Members of the U.S. House, the so-called Freedom Caucus.  What they are fighting for is for freedom from individuals getting  protection when it comes to healthcare. These changes may appeal to a  handful of extreme people who conveniently see their health insurance  policies--their personal policies--protected under their bill, but  these sorts of approaches don't appeal to anyone in the medical  community.   Who opposes the new Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act? The  American Medical Association--that would be the doctors--the American  Heart Association, the American Nurses Association, the American  Association of Retired Persons, as well as every major medical and  patient group out there. Every one of them opposes the changes proposed  by the Republicans in the House to our healthcare system.   Of course, we have a bottom line that we measure proposals against.  We go to the Congressional Budget Office, and we say to them: What  impact will this have?   No one has sent this bill to the Congressional Budget Office, and no  report has been given. So we don't know the impact on premiums of this  new version. What is going to happen to seniors, to middle-income  families?   Ramming through a bad bill that will harm Americans just because the  President wants to have something to say on the 100th day of his  Presidency is a bad idea. It is time to stop this  [[Page S2594]]  madness. It is time for Democrats and Republicans to sit down and talk  seriously about improving our current system.   The Presiding Officer is from the State of Louisiana and is a medical  doctor. He has joined on the Republican side with Senator Collins of  Maine to open this conversation. Thank you. We should have this  bipartisan conversation--not about repeal but repair, what we can do to  make this better and fairer and more affordable while preserving  quality healthcare for Americans. Thank you for your leadership in  this. We have talked about it, and I want to continue the conversation.   This notion coming over from the House is unacceptable. I hope that  many people will tell the President and tell those who support it that  this is no way to celebrate 100 days--by taking health insurance away  from 24 million people.    Mr. President, we know what open season means when it  comes to these students. Gilbert Caro of Chicago can tell us. He was  profiled in the Chicago Tribune article that I mentioned. Gilbert  received his master of business administration degree from DeVry  University. It is possibly the second largest for-profit college in the  United States.  [[Page S2596]]    He took on nearly $100,000 in debt for his master of business  administration degree. He believed that debt was worth it because it  was going to unlock the door to a high-paying job and financial  security.   Do you have any idea what Gilbert Caro is doing now with his DeVry  master of business administration degree? He is a prison guard in  Joliet, IL.   While Gilbert has a good job, he certainly didn't need $100,000 in  debt to be a prison guard. It is far from what he was promised by DeVry  when he signed up. Gilbert, like so many other students who go to for- profit colleges, was lured in by an amazing marketing campaign, flashy  advertisements and empty promises.   In 2016, DeVry University, a for-profit school, agreed to a $100  million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission for misleading  ``prospective students with ads that touted high employment success  rates and income levels upon graduation.''   DeVry is not alone. For-profit college giants like Corinthian and ITT  Tech collapsed after they were caught engaging in similar deceptive,  disgusting practices. The predatory practices of these and other for- profit colleges have left tens of thousands of students across the  country, just like Gilbert Caro, with worthless degrees and a mountain  of debt.   In fact, during the early part of this century, when for-profit  colleges acted with near impunity, just the students from the for- profit colleges and universities accounted for 47 percent of all  student loan defaults. Ten percent of the students coming out of high  school went to for-profit colleges, and 47 percent of the student loan  defaults were those same students--10 and 47. Why? Because they were  overcharged for worthless degrees. That is why.   The University of Phoenix students held almost $35 billion in  cumulative debt. When I look at their flashy advertising and the  commercials about how life is going to be perfect if you sign up at the  University of Phoenix, it is hard for me to imagine how many of those  students are burdened with debt they will never be able to repay.   We also know what open season means for the for-profit college  industry and its executives and investors. Between 1998 and 2008,  enrollment at for-profit colleges exploded by 225 percent--a lot of  advertising, a lot of marketing, a lot of recruiting. With it came  exploding profits for these schools.   By 2009, the seven largest publicly traded for-profit college  companies were worth a combined $51 billion--2009, $51 billion.   In 2010, the University of Phoenix alone enrolled nearly half a  million students, more than the combined enrollment of all the Big Ten  universities.   When former Senate HELP Committee Chairman Tom Harkin released his  seminal report on the industry in 2012, for-profit colleges had grown  to take in an incredible $32 billion a year in Federal taxpayer  dollars, 25 percent of all Federal aid in education, despite enrolling  only 10 percent of the students that went to college after high school.   For-profit colleges and universities are the most heavily subsidized  private businesses in America that exist. No one rivals them. No other  industry is even close, and 80, 85, 90, 95 percent of the revenue of  these so-called private, for-profit universities ends up coming out of  the Federal Treasury.   John Murphy, the cofounder of the University of Phoenix, talks about  those days by saying that what started off as a serious venture to  educate students soon became too focused on ``chasing stock prices.''   To pump up those stock prices, companies needed students and they  needed Federal student aid dollars. They proved that they would do and  promise nearly anything to get ``the juice,'' as Mr. Murphy, the  cofounder of the University of Phoenix, called it.   Boy, is this industry itching for the Trump administration to return  to those bad old days. The Chicago Tribune reports that since the  November 8 election, the stock prices of DeVry University, a for-profit  college, have increased 52 percent.   In a recent New York Times article by Patricia Cohen entitled ``For- Profit Schools, an Obama Target, See New Day Under Trump,'' the paid  spokesman for the for-profit college industry, former Congressman Steve  Gunderson, said he ``has repeatedly spoken with members of Trump's  transition team . . . White House domestic policy advisers . . . and  congressional Republicans.''   He is truly an insider. Mr. Gunderson promised: ``We're going to get  some regulatory relief.''   Sadly, it looks like he is right. Take for example the delay of the  gainful employment regulation. The Obama administration spent years  writing and rewriting regulations to ensure that career training  programs meet the statutory requirement to prepare students for  ``gainful employment.''   Is that a radical idea--that if the Federal Government is going to  provide grants and loans for a student to go to a school, the school  should provide education and training that would lead to ``gainful  employment''?   My colleague from Oklahoma was on the floor a little while ago  talking about overregulation, too many rules, and the impacts on small  business. I would say that I am prepared to stand up and defend what  the Obama administration did in saying that if you were going to lure a  young man like Gilbert Caro into a school and put him $100,000 in debt  for a master's of business administration, he ought to at least end up  with a job that is consistent with his education.   Today, Mr. Caro is a prison guard with $100,000 of debt and a  business administration degree of no value to him.   The gainful employment rule cuts off title IV funding for programs  where graduates' ratio of student debt to earnings is too high.  Literally, the students are too deeply in debt.   Prior to leaving office, the Obama Department of Education released  the first set of gainful employment data. It showed that the graduates  of public undergraduate certificate programs, like community colleges,  earn $9,000 more than their for-profit counterparts on average.   Think about that. You go to the virtually free community college, get  a certificate, and you are going to earn $9,000 more than if you get  deeply in debt at one of the for-profit schools seeking the same  degree. Of the programs that saddle students with too much debt  compared to the income its students receive after their program, 98  percent of the violators were for-profit colleges.   This is not just a chance occurrence. It is a pattern. The rule is  meant to protect students from taking on debt to attend programs that  don't lead to a good-paying job. The rule is also meant to prevent  billions in taxpayers' dollars on worthless programs.   Many for-profit colleges receive more than 90 percent of the revenue  straight from Federal taxpayers. My Republican colleagues are committed  to the free market system. So am I. I am committed to capitalism. I  believe in it. Though, I think there is need for us to have regulation  when it gets out of hand. That is why we have an antitrust division,  for example.   In this circumstance, to argue that these are just private companies  that are doing what ordinary people do when they start a business is to  ignore the obvious. These for-profit colleges could not exist if they  weren't receiving 80, 85, 90, and 95 percent of their revenue directly  from the Federal Treasury.   In recent testimony before a House subcommittee, the Department of  Education inspector general agreed that the gainful employment  regulation ``is a good rule in terms of protecting [students] and  protecting taxpayers.''   I sent a letter--along with Senators Patty Murray, Elizabeth Warren,  and nine other colleagues--expressing our concerns to Secretary DeVos  about her delaying this rule. In our letter, we made clear that these  delays undermine the rule and are going to be a danger to students and  taxpayers.   It is also a betrayal of students not to ensure that they are treated  fairly after they have been taken advantage of by for-profit schools.   Today, POLITICO reported that the Trump administration has  dramatically slowed, if not stopped, processing applications from tens  of thousands of students seeking to have their Federal student loans  discharged after they have been defrauded by for-profit colleges.   Think about that. A student is about to sign up for a for-profit  school.  [[Page S2597]]  Maybe he doesn't know much about higher education. His parents say:  Listen, if you can get a Pell grant and a Federal student loan, this  must be a really good school.   He is defrauded into signing up for a school that is too expensive  and offers a worthless degree, and then they turn around and that  school goes bankrupt. Now the student has the debt, no degree, and we  are left holding the bag. What has happened in previous cases is the  Federal Government stepped in and discharged the students from the debt  if they were defrauded into signing up for the college.    Secretary Betsy DeVos has decided to slow that down--to slow down the  discharge of these students' debt. Students who were misled or  defrauded by their schools are eligible for discharge of their Federal  student loans under the Higher Education Act--the law as it now exists.  Yet during her confirmation process, Secretary DeVos would not commit  to providing this relief to students--relief already specified in law-- and has now effectively stopped processing the claims.   On the day before President Trump took office, more than 3,200  Illinois students applied to the Department of Education for relief.  While the Department fails to process these claims, these students are  left in the lurch. It adds insult to injury that students taken  advantage of by for-profit colleges, nominally supervised and regulated  by the Federal Government, are now being ignored by the Federal  Government's Department of Education. That is unacceptable. It is  unfair, and the Trump administration should change it.   We've started to see the true colors of the administration and  Secretary DeVos when it comes to these students who have been  victimized. As feared, the Department has thus far put for-profit and  other commercial interests ahead of students and taxpayers.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
