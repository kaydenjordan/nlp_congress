 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to  speak for up to 15 minutes prior to the scheduled rollcall vote.    Mr. President, ``our experts believe and the data shows  that most of the price increases we've seen . . . [are] expected to be  temporary''--that is what President Biden said 1 year ago this month,  something his administration has repeatedly echoed.   Unfortunately, it long ago became clear that was wishful thinking on  the President's part. Far from being temporary, inflation has become a  fact of life in the Biden economy.   Last month, inflation hit its highest level yet under President  Biden, climbing to 9.1 percent, the worst inflation in more than 40  years. The impact of inflation is being felt in every corner of our  economy. Businesses of every size are dealing with the effects of  inflation. Small businesses, of course, are being hit particularly  hard. And 75 percent of small business owners report inflation has had  a negative effect on the financial health of their business over the  past 6 months. And 75 percent report that inflation pressures are  getting worse.   It is not surprising. Everything from inputs to transportation to  electricity has become more expensive in the Biden economy, and that  has a huge impact on businesses' ability to pay their expenses and run  their operations.   As one South Dakota business owner who wrote to me noted:         It makes it hard for me to grow my USA-made business when I       don't have the funds to pay my employees more, add more       benefits, purchase more machinery, and buy more material in       buck as inflation continues to rise.    Farmers and ranchers in my State are also struggling. As of March,  the price of fertilizer had risen to an astounding 162 percent since  January 2021. The prices of two common herbicides have risen more than  50 percent since last year. And the price of diesel, which powers a lot  of farming and ranching equipment, has doubled since President Biden  took office. Farming and ranching are tough jobs already, often with  tight margins and a lot of weather-related risks. Inflation is making  things exponentially hard.    The list of inflation's impacts goes on. For example, last week I  talked about how inflation is affecting our military, which is able to  do less with the funds appropriated for it, thanks to soaring prices  across the economy. That, in turn, can affect troop readiness and the  military's ability to keep up with needed programs and purchases from  weapons to vehicles to aircraft, and ships.   Of course, I haven't even yet mentioned the most basic impact of  inflation and that is the misery faced by hard-working Americans who  confront sky-high prices at the grocery store and the gas pump and  wonder how they are going to feed their family this month or whether  they will be able to afford to get to work.   Bloomberg reported last week that nearly 6 in 10 American workers are  concerned that their paychecks won't stretch far enough to support  themselves and their families. Another recent poll reported that 70  percent of Americans have had to cut back on other spending to afford  necessities.   Life in the Biden economy is grim. At this point, how we got here is  well-established. One of the main reasons we are in the midst of this  inflation crisis is Democrats' decision to pass a massive partisan $1.9  trillion spending bill last March under the guise of COVID relief,  despite the fact that Congress had just passed a fifth bipartisan COVID  bill that met essentially all current pressing COVID needs. Democrats  were warned that their bill would cause inflation; and they proceeded  anyway. The so-called American Rescue Plan flooded the economy with  unnecessary government money, and the economy overheated as a result.   So here we are with Americans struggling under the weight of the  worst inflation in 40 years, and Democrats want to double down on the  spending strategy that helped get us into this mess in the first place.  That is right. Despite the fact that even Democrat economists have  stated that the American Rescue Plan helped create our current  inflation crisis, Democrats want to pass another massive government  spending bill filled with excessive spending and tax hikes--a trillion  dollars in tax hikes in recent discussions.   Apparently, Democrats are not content with spending us into an  inflation crisis, they would also like to tax us into a recession.  There is already reason to worry about the negative economic impacts of  new climate measures the President is contemplating imposing, but on  top of that, Democrats want to spend even more government money and  impose a trillion dollars in tax hikes, a substantial part of which  would fall on small businesses.   At this rate, there is no telling when our inflation crisis will end.  Democrats are so committed to big spending that even if their  legislation fails this time around, they are already planning to run on  their big spending agenda in November.   I am not sure I would want to try to convince voters to elect me by  touting the same spending strategy that helped land our country in this  inflation crisis in the first place. But Democrats' belief in big  spending is so deeply ingrained that it apparently can't be swayed even  when they see the negative consequences.   It is incomprehensible that Democrats are contemplating doubling down  on the spending strategy that helped get us in this mess in the first  place. The first spending spree has been a disaster for our country,  and I can only imagine how much Americans would suffer from their next  one.   I yield the floor.
