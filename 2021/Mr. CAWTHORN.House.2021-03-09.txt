 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the PRO Act.   You see, when I came to Washington, D.C., I believed that I had one  duty, one purpose, that I was elected to serve my district, my people,  and to answer to nobody else except my constituents.   But since arriving in Congress, I have learned that not everyone  shares the same philosophy. You see, I have come to realize that this  body is oftentimes more interested in self-service than in public  service, that corporate donors come before constituents, and that a  union boss is more important than an American worker.   The right to work is as intrinsically American as the right to vote.  No man or woman should be denied the fruits of his labor simply because  they refuse to toe a partisan line. Each man and woman ought to be  granted the dignity and respect to decide his own destiny.   This bill strips the right of self-determination away from the people  and places it directly into the hands of the powerful. It is a shameful  display of the very type of self-service that disgusts nearly every  American outside of Washington, D.C.   This vote will reveal much about who we are elected to serve. Are we,  as representatives of the people, elected to serve union management or  our constituents?    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  682, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from behind screens  and back into the classroom.
