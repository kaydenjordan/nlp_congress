 Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Pete  Gagne of Conway as June's Granite Stater of the Month. Pete is the  owner of the Saco River Tubing Center, and this summer, he is  spearheading the second Paddle for a Cause campaign to raise money for  and lift up local Mount Washington Valley organizations.   Every Wednesday during the 11-week campaign, a portion of every tube,  kayak, and rental sale from that day is donated to that week's chosen  nonprofit. This year's organizations work on issues such as nature  conservation, food insecurity, affordable housing, and service dogs for  people with disabilities. Visitors can also pay extra to bring their  dogs with them on river expeditions, with all proceeds going to the  Conway Area Humane Society. Last year, Saco River Tubing donated over  $3,500.   The Paddle for a Cause program provides much-needed funds to local  organizations that are a vital part of the Mount Washington Valley  community and helps Granite Staters and tourists alike learn more about  all that the vibrant Mount Washington Valley community has to offer.   In addition to fundraising and raising awareness about local  organizations, the campaign has an educational component on nature  conservation. This is especially important in New Hampshire, since the  Granite State is home to many beautiful natural treasures. During every  trip on the river, Saco River Tubing employees speak to guests about  respecting wildlife and minimizing any negative impact to the  ecosystems while on the water. This is particularly important given the  influx in visitors that started when Granite Staters and tourists alike  were looking for more outdoor activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   Pete's Paddle for a Cause not only gives back to the community  through fundraising, but also educates people on taking care of our  natural resources. Pete exemplifies the Granite State spirit of  dedication to community, and I commend him for bringing people together  to support critical causes. I know that his initiative will have  lasting, positive effects for the Mount Washington Valley and the  entire State.                            ____________________
