 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Pleasantdale Middle  School in Burr Ridge, Illinois, and, specifically, Jennifer Lauermann's  fifth grade science class.   Mrs. Lauermann is an educator, but more importantly, she is a rock  star. Her students spent this semester studying rocks, interviewing  geologists and other scientists across Illinois. They learned a lot,  but something troubling emerged: Illinois does not have a State rock.  Iowa has the geode, Wisconsin has red granite, but Illinois has got  nothing.   So as good citizens do, the class held an election. Sandstone,  limestone, and dolostone emerged from a heated primary, and 1,200  Illinoisans then voted in the general election, including me. I voted  for limestone.   My candidate didn't win, but it was a free and fair election, and it  is now my privilege to introduce the winner of the Pleasantdale Middle  School 2021 State rock election.   Mr. Speaker, dolostone. I hope my colleagues in the Illinois  delegation will join me in supporting the effort to make dolostone  Illinois' State rock, but, more importantly, I couldn't be prouder to  represent such great teachers and students committed to science and to  democracy.                            ____________________
