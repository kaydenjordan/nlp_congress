 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 140, the Frank  LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act. No institution is more critical  to our national defense and homeland security than the United States  Coast Guard, and every day, the men and women of the Coast Guard carry  out vital, life-saving missions, including drug interdiction and search  and rescue. On November 9, I had the opportunity to tour the Coast  Guard's District 11 facilities in Alameda, California. I was deeply  impressed by the dedication and professionalism of the Coast Guard  officials I met. However, I was also troubled by the state of some of  Coast Guard's equipment. Resources for the Coast Guard are clearly  needed, now more than ever, so it is deeply unfortunate that the Trump  administration has sought to cut the Coast Guard's budget by as much as  14 percent and has transferred millions of dollars in Coast Guard  funding to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Congress should not  allow the Trump administration to raid the Coast Guard budget to  implement its anti-immigrant policies. But today, I urge all my  colleagues to support S. 140, and I applaud the Chairman and Ranking  Member for their hard work bringing this important measure to the  floor. Likewise, it is vitally important that, as negotiations  regarding the Fiscal Year 2019 Department of Homeland Security  Appropriations Act continue, Congress include sufficient funding for  the Coast Guard so that it has the resources it needs to carry out its  vital missions.
