 Mr. Speaker, since 2013 I have flown the pride flag  outside my D.C. office in solidarity with the LGBT community. According  to the House historian, I was the first to do so, a fact that I am very  proud of.   Yesterday, outside my office in Washington, D.C., a man took that  flag out of its holder, threw it on the ground, and stomped on it. He  called the flag disgusting and immoral.   This flag is a symbol of pride for the LGBT community--an  international symbol of love, understanding, equality, and hope.   The shadows of intolerance have grown longer in recent days: bomb  threats called into Jewish community centers, desecrations of Jewish  cemeteries, hate crimes against minorities and the transgender  community, horrifically racist statements from a Member of this body.   To all our brothers and sisters who endure through these hateful  acts, we stand with you, and we will continue to fight for your rights  and your equality.                            ____________________
