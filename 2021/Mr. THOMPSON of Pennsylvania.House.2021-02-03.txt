 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor my  dear friend, Bill Cline, of Bradford, Pennsylvania, who passed away on  December 29 at the age of 95.   Bill is survived by his loving wife, Joyce, who he spent nearly 50  years with; and by daughters Terri Anne, Susan, and Mary Jo; and sons  Willard and Mark.   After serving in the United States Navy during World War II, Bill  returned home to chase his dream of one day owning his own oil  production company. He would go on to serve as the sole proprietor of  Cline Oil, Incorporated for more than 60 years and remained the  president of the company until his death.   In 1859, Edwin Drake drilled the world's first commercial oil well in  my district, making history in the energy industry. About 7 years ago,  I had the pleasure of presenting Bill with the Colonel Edwin L. Drake  Legendary Oilman Award to celebrate his contributions to the industry  as well.   Bill will be missed, and Penny and I wish his family the very best as  they honor his life while mourning his loss.   Rest in peace.                            ____________________
