 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to yet  another shameful effort to erode the founding principles of our  democracy.   This resolution is a pitiful attempt to continue the politicization  of our government's ability to function once those who are duly elected  to serve seek to govern.   Impeachment is not a punishment, sought to be inflicted when one  branch of government merely disagrees with or dislikes what a  coordinate branch has done.   It is a serious remedy designed to prevent abuses of power and is  designed to ensure that ours remains a government of, by, and for the  people.   This is about the duty of the President of the United States--you do  not impeach people because you disagree with their approach to their  service to the country or to the provisions on their policy. We do not  impeach people on that basis.   No, this resolution does not provide any meaningful or sincere effort  to protect the American people.   Rather, this resolution sets forth nothing more than a partisan  fishing expedition and should be rebuked as such.   Impeachment is serious, yet here we are engaged in a baseless  political stunt to impeach our current President.   The U.S. Constitution governs the order of our nation, and it  dictates the work of the Congress.   Article I details the powers of the House and the exercising of these  powers as they relate to the coordinate, coequal branches of  government, codified in Articles II and Articles III: three equal  branches of government coexisting and cohesively working to provide  oversight to the respective actions of the Congress, the Executive and  Judiciary.   Specifically, Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 indicates that the  ``House of Representatives . . . shall have the sole power of  impeachment.'' Article II states that the ``The President . . . shall  be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason,  Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Article II also  requires that the ``President take care that the laws are faithfully  executed.''   That language is stark and clear--and throughout our history it has  been used in varying periods where the assessment was that the law has  been breached.   Sometimes Congresses are concerned that the weight and view of the  American people should be considered. Sometimes they are moved by the  urgency of the matter.   This has worked, with challenges of course, since 1789, yet the  outright abuse of our constitution to use impeachment as a political  tool is an abomination of our congressional duties.   As constitutional scholars have long laid out the historical  guardrails and mandates upon which must heed, I would like to point to  a few salient remarks from the September 28, 2023, Committee on  Oversight and Accountability hearing entitled ``The Basis for the  Impeachment Inquiry of President Joseph R. Biden'' as reminders for us  all here today.   In the testimony of Michael J. Gerhardt, Burton Craige Distinguished  Professor of Jurisprudence, University of North Carolina at Chapel  Hill, he highlighted the clear warning from Alexander Hamilton in the  Federalist Papers, and what he foresaw in the dangers of trivializing  impeachment through petty partisanship.   As quoted in Alexander Hamilton, No. 65, the Federalist Papers  (1961), he states that impeachment may ``agitate the passions of the  whole community , and to divide it into parties more or less friendly  or inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with  pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities,  partialities, influence, and interest on one side or on the other; and  in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the  decision will be regulated more by the relative strength of the  parties, than by the demonstrations of innocence or guilt.''   As Professor Gerhardt noted, ``in other words, an impeachment  proceeding, including the initiation of an impeachment inquiry, must  rise above petty partisanship in order to ensure its legitimacy.   And as aptly stated in the testimony of Johnathon Turley, Shapiro  Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University School  of Law, in highlighting the carefully crafted powers vested in the  House of Representatives pursuant to Art. I, Sec. 2, cl. 5. is that:   ``The Framers debated and crafted this standard and process to avoid  an `anything goes' mentality. That was the reason our Framers opposed  the `maladministration' standards as too malleable and indeterminate.  While we continue to have passionate and good-faith debates over the  meaning of the high crimes and misdemeanors standard, it is not  intended to give the House carte blanche for any impulsive impeachment  theory.''   Nearly fifty years ago, my predecessor Barbara Jordan of Texas's 18th  Congressional District, declared, in the first presidential impeachment  inquiry in more than a century, that:   ``My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete, it is total.  I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution,  the subversion, the destruction of the Constitution.'' She noted  ``those are impeachable `who behave amiss or betray their public  trust'' (quoting from the North Carolina ratification convention).   In this vein, we should not be here today in efforts to betray and  diminish our Constitution and rule of law.   The unsubstantiated accusations, that the President of the United  States has abused his powers and that his conduct is in dereliction of  his duties as President, flatly outrageous.   When the Framers of our Constitution designed our government, they  bifurcated power between the federal and state governments, and divided  among the branches.   They vested in Congress the capacity to make the laws, and in the  Executive the power to faithfully execute those laws.   Because the House enjoyed a natural superiority, as most  representative of the passions of the populace, the Framers vested in  the House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment and made the  Senate the judges.   Yet, entirely unlike the incredulous and now confirmed illegality of  President Trump's behavior while in office, President Biden has  certainly not earned the same stain of impeachment from the House of  Representatives and his conduct absolutely does not merit conviction  and removal from office by the Senate.   When the Founders inserted the Impeachment Clause in Article I,  Section 2, Clause 5, they did so to preserve our democracy, protect the  American people, and to prevent the abuses and excesses of the Chief  Executive.   The Constitution has served our nation well for over two hundred  years.   Yes, in order to keep faith with the Framers and with our future, we  must preserve, protect and defend that Constitution and all its  provisions.   This impeachment resolution, however, is not one that is within the  national interest but a disgrace to our government and its entrusted  duties.   My Republican colleagues are sadly focused on the wrong priorities.   The American people want us to focus on helping their families, not  attacking the President and his family.   This so-called ``impeachment inquiry'' is just an extreme political  stunt.   President Biden is a good and honorable man who has spent his life  serving the American people.   Extreme House Republicans are pushing these lies to try to smear him  for political purposes.   They have been investigating President Biden all year--obtaining tens  of thousands of pages of documents and dozens of hours of witness  testimony--but have found no evidence of wrongdoing by the President.   In fact, over and over again, Republicans' own witnesses and  documents have embarrassed them by debunking their ridiculous  allegations.   They now want to waste time on the House floor voting on this extreme  stunt, instead of focusing on advancing important priorities like  Ukraine aid or doing their job to avoid a government shutdown in a few  weeks.   No vote will make this baseless fishing expedition legitimate.   They have proven all year just how illegitimate this impeachment  stunt is.   All a vote would do is put every Republican who supports it on record  pushing an extreme agenda.  [[Page H6889]]    This is not what Congress should be focused on.   Democrats and President Biden will stay focused on putting people  over politics.   As such, I ask my colleagues to vote no on this shameful resolution.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:    An amendment to H. Res. 918 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 7. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 12) to protect a person's ability to determine       whether to continue or end a pregnancy, and to protect a       health care provider's ability to provide abortion services.       All points of order against consideration of the bill are       waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All points of       order against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on       any amendment thereto, to final passage without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Energy and Commerce or their respective       designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 8. C1ause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 12.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition and join with  the opposition to H. Res. 918 directing certain committees to proceed  with an impeachment inquiry of President Biden.   As we all know how serious this is, Madam Speaker, let me remind you  that Article II of the Constitution says that a President shall be  removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason,  bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors. Article II says it  also requires that the President take care that the laws are faithfully  executed.   There is no charge or challenge of facts that the President has not  executed his job carefully, that he has committed high crimes,  misdemeanors and treason. In fact, out of 35,000 pages of financial  records, 2,000 pages of Treasury records, 36 hours of testimony, and a  number of witnesses, tens of thousands of VP area emails, there is  nothing.   This is extreme, a political stunt, and there is no evidence worthy  of putting forward this impeachment.   In the words of an outstanding scholar, Professor Michael Gerhardt,  in other words, an impeachment proceeding, including the initiation of  an impeachment inquiry must rise above petty partisanship.   We cannot do this under the circumstances of petty partisanship. Mr.  Biden should not be impeached.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, during the 118th Congress, Democrats  have worked persistently to advance legislation and policies that  support the American people.   This Congress, Democrats have been met with fighting and incompetency  from Republicans, an unwillingness to work together, and one of the  most unproductive sessions in the history of Congress.   Despite the chaos, we have kept the government from defaulting on its  debts and made sure that the government stayed open to do the work of  the people.   I have worked with my colleagues to fight for the 18th Congressional  District of Texas and my constituents, ensuring that the work of the  federal government continues despite the chaos from Republicans.   House Democrats stand firm in our commitments to protect essential  safety net programs and vital services, deliver for our districts, and  prevent further cuts that would threaten the wellbeing of our  constituents.   Democrats are united in putting People Over Politics to lower costs  and grow the middle class.   As we wrap up the 1st session of the 118th Congress and look forward  to the 2nd session, it is the job of Congress to fund our government,  pass legislation that betters the lives of the American people, and  ensure that we advocate for our constItuents.   Extreme MAGA Republicans have had a difficult time coming to a  consensus on how to pass their wildly unpopular and harmful  legislation.   Instead of working in a bipartisan matter, they are wasting time and  taxpayer dollars by bringing legislation to the floor that has no  chance of passing the Senate and being signed by President Biden.   Congress should be working to lower costs and protect of national  security instead of focusing on partisan politics.   As we go home for the holidays to our constituents and families, we  bring with us a looming government shutdown, a result of incompetency  and disfunction from extreme MAGA Republicans.   When we come back in January we must get back to our work.   The American people deserve a Congress that is serious in manner and  functions to the best of its ability.   My friends across the aisle have not been willing to compromise  during any of the most time-sensitive and dire moments in the 118th  Congress.   While they have been focused on division and fear, House Democrats  have worked to advocate for their communities while simultaneously  offering to collaborate on the most crucial legislation on a bipartisan  basis.   In this Congress, I have worked tirelessly to improve the lives of my  constituents in Houston.   I have worked to fight against sex trafficking and introduced  legislation to stop human trafficking in school zones, introduced gun  safety legislation as well as legislation to stop the trafficking of  fentanyl, and have brought over $200 million in grants to my district.   While I am proud of the work that I have done for the 18th  congressional district of Texas, there is still much work that we need  to do.   We have been kicking the can down the road for months, and rather  than address the main duty as members of Congress--funding the  government--House Republicans instead are launching baseless  accusations against our President to score cheap political points.   Under Republican leadership we have just barely avoided two  government shutdowns by the skin of our teeth and have been unable to  pass meaningful legislation that would improve the lives of Americans.   This is not to say Democrats have not tried to reach across the  aisle.   We indicated we would be open to negotiation to avert the first  shutdown, and we were  [[Page H6936]]  rebuffed until the situation was at its most critical point.   We indicated we would be open to negotiation to avert the second  shutdown, and our friends across the aisle took to the media to express  countless times that they would refuse to work with Democrats to find a  solution.   By trying to suppress Democratic voices, Republican leadership is  silencing half of the country simply because they have a different  worldview.   Moreover, by not passing serious legislation, Republicans are  stifling the very constituents who put them in office.   To serve the people who elected us to Congress, we all must work  together to enact positive change born from compromise and a combined  desire to serve as a voice for our constituents.   The performance of Republican leadership in this Congress has been  utterly disappointing, and I urge my colleagues across the aisle to  remember that to serve the people, we must work together to provide  comprehensive and meaningful legislation.                            ____________________
