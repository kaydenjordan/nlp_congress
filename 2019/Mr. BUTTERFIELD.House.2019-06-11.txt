 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  achievements of a great public servant, a father, a dedicated man of  faith, a friend to many, and the longest-serving elected official in  Wilson, North Carolina, city government, the Honorable Avant Patrick  Coleman.  [[Page H4394]]    Avant Coleman, Mr. Speaker, better known as A.P., is a native of  Edgecombe County, but he has resided in Wilson County for many decades.  He received his formal education, earning his bachelor of science  degree in agriculture and biology from historic North Carolina A&T  State University. He went on to earn a master of science degree in  adult education with a minor in sociology from North Carolina State  University and a graduate of the Extension Executive Development  Institute.   Professionally, A.P. used the full potential of his education and  passion in his career, which began with teaching vocational agriculture  in Lenoir and Greene Counties. His desire to pour into our youth a  conviction for community engagement led him to join the North Carolina  Cooperative Extension Service, where he worked for 31 long years,  retiring in March 1994. In this role, Mr. Speaker, he was responsible  for countywide 4-H programs, a national initiative that embraces young  people of all beliefs and all backgrounds and empowers them with  leadership skills training for the betterment of their lives and their  communities.   A.P. Coleman has earned numerous distinctions, honors, and  achievements. Elected in 1975, A.P. Coleman has served for 38 long  years as a member of the Wilson City Council. He served as mayor pro  tempore from 1989 to 1995.   His campaign slogan embodied his mantra of service to the community  to improve the lives of its people. He would say, ``A new way for a new  day.'' His early platform for service included economic and business  development, balanced growth, housing, crime and violence, and most  importantly, contact with citizens.   His retirement from elected office was effective a few days ago on 31  May 2019.   A.P. Coleman has served on several council-appointed boards and  committees throughout the State and the city, such as president of the  North Carolina League of Municipalities, 1991 to 1992; chairman of  Region L Council of Governments, 1990 to 1992, 2006 to 2007; a member  of the Small Cities Council and National League of Cities, 1988 to  1995.   He has served on the board of directors for Carolina Family Health  Centers, Incorporated. That is our FQHC in the city. He served as  director since 1999 and even served as chairman.   Mr. Coleman previously served as a board member for the local and  regional Nations Bank and was the recipient of many leadership awards,  including the Extension Service Superior Leadership Award. He received  a certificate of appreciation after completing a 4-H caravan 6-week  study tour of the United Kingdom, honoring his leadership roles in the  States of Maryland and North Carolina.   He has served, Mr. Speaker, as finance committee chair for Carolina  Smart Choices for Youth and as a chairman of the Wilson Preparatory  Academy charter school.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Coleman has been a very engaged individual for  decades. Throughout his years of public service, A.P. Coleman has been  active with his local church, civic affairs, and other charitable  organizations. He is a member of Calvary Presbyterian Church, U.S.A.,  where he serves as an elder. He is a past member of the board of  directors for United Way, president of the Wilson County chapter of the  North Carolina A&T State University Alumni Association, vice president  of Crime Stoppers, past member of the Eastern North Carolina School for  the Deaf's human rights committee, member of the Presbytery of the New  Hope disaster committee, and recipient of prestigious accomplishments  and awards.   Coleman is also a proud member of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity and a  life member of the NAACP.   The most important thing to Avant Coleman has always been his family.  He was married to the late Willa Monroe Coleman and is the proud father  of three, Elliotte, Wanda, and Jacqueline, and a proud grandfather of  one grandson, Juan.   Avant is a family man, dear friend, and colleague to so many others.  Mr. Speaker, he is also my neighbor, my next-door neighbor for the past  25 years. A man of principle and conviction to the importance of  brotherly kindness, A.P.'s motto in life is the golden rule: ``Do unto  others as you would have them do unto you.''   Finally, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Coleman has lived an incredible life that,  by the grace of God, has impacted the lives of so many. His selfless  and lifelong dedication to public service and community are beyond  remarkable, and he is truly a role model. His love for his family,  friends, church, and community know no bounds.   I am honored today to pay tribute to such a dedicated and honorable  public servant. I am proud to have A.P. Coleman as a constituent and  friend. I thank him for his dedication, service, and continued role as  an inspiration to all of us. God continue to bless A.P. Coleman and his  family.                            ____________________
