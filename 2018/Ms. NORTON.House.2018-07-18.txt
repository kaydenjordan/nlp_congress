 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in strong opposition to  this amendment interfering in the local affairs of the District of  Columbia.    Mr. Chairman, you wouldn't know it from hearing the  Member on the other side speak, but in 1973, Congress passed the  bipartisan District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which created a locally  elected government. According to the Home Rule Act, a central purpose  of the act was to ``relieve Congress of the burden of legislating upon  essentially local District matters.''   In his signing statement of the Home Rule Act, President Nixon wrote,  ``It will give the people of the District of Columbia the right . . .  to govern themselves in local affairs. . . . `'   Yet the bill before us would either repeal or block the District of  Columbia from carrying out or enacting five local laws.   I filed amendments to strike all of these undemocratic riders, but  the Rules Committee has blocked me from offering any of them on the  floor, even though they all complied with House rules. I have gotten  some of these amendments off in the past, and I intend to do so again,  because this matter has to go to the Senate as well, Mr. Chairman.   Adding insult to injury, the Rules Committee allowed this and one  other undemocratic amendment to be offered.   Republicans were not satisfied with sabotaging the Affordable Care  Act by, among other things, reducing the penalty for failure to comply  with the individual responsibility requirement to $0 in the recently  enacted GOP tax scam. The ACA remains standing and popular,  nevertheless, throughout the country.   Mr. Palmer has moved to sabotage, therefore, the District of  Columbia's local health insurance market, too, and deny the 700,000  Federal taxpaying Americans who live in the District of Columbia access  to quality, affordable health insurance coverage.   This antidemocratic healthcare amendment is offered by Mr. Palmer of  Alabama, who doesn't live in and is not responsible to the people of  the District of Columbia, but answers to another district. I doubt that  Representative Palmer's constituents want him taking time from their  business to meddle in the business of another Member's district.   This amendment would prohibit the District from spending its own  local funds, consisting solely of local taxes and fees, to carry out a  local District of Columbia bill that requires individuals to maintain  health coverage or to pay a penalty for failure to do so.   I remind the House that three States have adopted this same approach.   In response to Republican efforts to sabotage the ACA, the District  of Columbia, like States across the country, decided to do what they  could and, in our case, convened a working group that consisted of  businesses, providers, consumers, and insurers on how to preserve  quality, affordable coverage locally.   In February, the working group unanimously recommended creating a  local individual responsibility requirement--and I thought the other  side was all about localism--and the District of Columbia Health  Benefit Exchange Authority Executive Board unanimously supported the  recommendation.                                time  2100    The District of Columbia Mayor then included an individual  responsibility of requirement in her budget, and the D.C. Council  debated and unanimously passed the Health Insurance Requirement  Amendment Act of 2018, as required by Congress. Thus, D.C. will join  three States in requiring residents to maintain health insurance  coverage, and more States are considering doing the very same thing.   I urge Members to vote ``no'' on this undemocratic, offensive, and  harmful amendment that would reduce enrollment in the D.C. individual  insurance market by 15 percent, and increase premiums. I ask the  gentleman to stay out of the business of my district.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in strong opposition to yet  another amendment that interferes with another Member's district,  indicating that there is more than one Member in this body that does  not have enough to do at home.    A few minutes ago, we debated an amendment offered by  Representative Gary Palmer of Alabama that would prohibit the District  from spending its own local funds, consisting solely of taxes and fees,  to carry out a local D.C. bill, the Health Insurance Requirement  Amendment Act of 2018, that requires individuals to maintain health  insurance coverage or pay a tax penalty for failure to do so.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 18, 2018, on page H6539, the following appeared: A few  minutes ago, we debated an amendment offered by Representative  Gary Palmer of Alabama that would prohibit the District from  spending its own local funds,      The online version has been corrected to read:  A few  minutes ago, we debated an amendment offered by Representative  Gary Palmer of Alabama that would prohibit the District from  spending its own local funds,    ========================= END NOTE =========================     This amendment before us now offered by this Member, Mr. Rothfus of  Pennsylvania, seeks to weaken the coverage requirement by prohibiting  D.C. from spending its local funds to carry out a method of tax  collection in existing D.C. law to enforce the penalty.   Mr. Rothfus has plenty to do representing his own district, but is  now venturing far afield into a district represented by another Member  of the House of Representatives.   In particular, D.C. would be prohibited from using its local funds to  collect the tax penalty by distraint, or the seizure of property to  obtain payment, for failure to pay.   The District is not unique in authorizing distraint, and it is seldom  used. I can't think of when it has been used. The seizure of property  to settle tax debt is standard practice for the Federal Government,  States, and cities across the country, including, would you believe,  Representative Rothfus' State of Pennsylvania.   Under title 53 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, section  16031, Pennsylvania jurisdictions are allowed to collect taxes by  distraint. I wonder if the sponsor has asked his own legislature to  repeal that statute. Let him start at home before he tries to repeal  something passed unanimously by the council of the District of  Columbia.   It is true that the Affordable Care Act prohibited the Internal  Revenue Service from seizing property to collect the individual  responsibility requirement tax penalty, although it did authorize the  IRS to withhold the penalty amount from future tax refunds, which  amounts to the very same thing. However, each State and the District is  free to authorize distraint to collect the local individual  responsibility requirement tax penalty.   However, it is important to note, and I emphasize, that the District  rarely seizes property to collect taxes owed. When it does, it does so  only as a last resort. I can't think of when this has even happened. If  a payment plan or settlement could not be established with a taxpayer,  the District would first turn to remedies like withholding tax refunds  or garnishing wages, not seizing a house or a car.   I am sure that is what happens in Mr. Rothfus' State of Pennsylvania  as well.   I will not tolerate Republicans, this Member or any other, using the  District of Columbia to score points with opponents of the ACA. They  haven't been able to beat the ACA.   This amendment is one of several that constitute the most significant  abuse of Federal power over the District of Columbia since Republicans  took control in 2011.   So the ACA remains popular throughout the United States. They just  can't bear that. So Mr. Rothfus moves on to the District, to see if he  can do to the District what his side has not been able to do in the  country for the ACA.   We found greater respect for democratic self-rule in the Senate in  getting such riders removed. We intend to do so again.   Mr. Chair, I say to the gentleman, mind your own business.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this abuse of power, and I  urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
