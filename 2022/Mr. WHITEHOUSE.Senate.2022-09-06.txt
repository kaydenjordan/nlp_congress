 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 50th  anniversary of Project ZAP, or ZAP the Blackstone.   The Blackstone River was once called ``the hardest-working river in  America.'' In the mid-1800s, more than a hundred textile mills and  manufacturers busily operated along the Blackstone's banks and  tributaries, where a steady flow of water provided reliable  hydroelectric power. Development and industrialization carried on for  decades, with lasting consequences for the health of the river, long  after the mills closed up or moved elsewhere. The Blackstone became one  of the most polluted in the country. However, on September 1972, Rhode  Island made history by hosting the largest single-day environmental  clean-up in American history. David Rosser, a conservation leader and  dedicated community organizer, recruited over 10,000 volunteers to  clean up the pollution that littered the water and the banks. The  cleanup effort came to be known as Project ZAP--Zero Away Pollution.   The Blackstone has come a long way over the past five decades. In  1985, the  [[Page S4439]]  Blackstone Valley Tourism Council was started, followed by the Friends  of the Blackstone and the Blackstone River Watershed Council. In 1986,  the Blackstone River Valley became a National Heritage Corridor, and  the river was designated as an American Heritage River in 1998. I was  proud to work with my colleagues in Rhode Island's congressional  delegation to have the river's corridor designated as a National  Historical Park in 2014. The river is now home to fish, aquatic  mammals, turtles, and a variety of birds that have returned to what was  once a highly polluted habitat. Unfortunately though, pollutants,  litter, debris, erosion, and invasive species still plague the river,  which is why, this year, a 50-year anniversary ZAP clean-up is planned.   On August 27, Rhode Islanders were at it again, cleaning and greening  up the Blackstone River Watershed. With a goal of holding the largest  Blackstone Valley clean-up since 1972, the ZAP 50 steering team  organized a 27-town, watershed wide, clean up. One hundred and twenty  teams showed up to, pick up trash and clear the river of aquatic  invasive species.   I am happy to recognize the 50th anniversary of Project ZAP and the  hard work of the many Rhode Islanders who serve as stewards of our  environment. It is thanks to their efforts that the once hardest  working river in America may be enjoyed peacefully.                            ____________________
