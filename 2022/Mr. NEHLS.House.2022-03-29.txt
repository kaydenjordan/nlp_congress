 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the Congressman for  all of Alaska, the 45th Dean of the House, and my mentor and friend-- Representative Don Young.   Don was a soldier, a riverboat captain, and a teacher--but his true  calling was serving and representing the good people of Alaska.   Throughout his 49 years in Congress, he was an icon and mentor to  countless Members. When I first arrived here, Don was one of the first  Members I met. In the short time I had with him, he taught me so much  about the House and about being a true servant.   Don's love of his family and the people of Alaska was rivaled only by  his love of the land itself. He took countless members and staff to his  beloved state to show them the pristine natural wonder of his state.   This summer he was going to take me on a working trip to Alaska--and  one of my great regrets in this body will forever be never getting to  go with him.   Rest in peace, my friend.                            ____________________
