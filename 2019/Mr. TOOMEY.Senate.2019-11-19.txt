 Mr. President, I want to join my colleague from Tennessee  in explaining why we ought to allow this deal to stand--the deal that  was struck some years ago to phase out these incredibly inefficient  subsidies.   I thank my colleague from Tennessee for his leadership on this issue.  As you know, this is a very large tax subsidy. The government is  already set to spend about $67 billion in energy tax subsidies just  over the next 5 years, and we should be very clear about this: These  subsidies lead to a lower standard of living. When we choose to take an  inefficient form of energy and throw a lot of money at it, it just  lowers the standard of living. We have less resources available for all  the other things we could be doing with that money.   As my colleague from Tennessee mentioned, the wind production tax  credit began in 1992 for the very straightforward, simple reason that  it couldn't compete. It is completely economically uncompetitive. The  idea is, we will have this temporary subsidy to enable the wind  production to reach an economy of scale, reach a maturity in the  industry that would allow it to compete, and the consensus at the time  was that ought to be achieved by about 1999. After about 7 years of  taxpayer subsidies, the industry should be on its feet, should be  competitive, and there would be technological improvements and  everything would be fine. That was 20 years ago. We have been  subsidizing it ever since.   We extended this program 11 times. The wind component of all of our  energy subsidies is about $25 billion over a 5-year period, and they  still can't compete. The reason it can't compete is because it is just  extremely expensive to build the electricity-generating capacity if it  is a windmill. It is much more expensive than alternative forms of  energy. The cost of building wind capacity versus natural gas, for  instance, is pretty stark. It costs less than $1,000 per kilowatt of  capacity for a natural gas-fired powerplant. It costs over $1,600 per  kilowatt for wind production.   Obviously, after the production is done, windmills don't require  ongoing fuel. Amazingly enough, that savings is not enough to ever  recoup the huge amount of capital you have to lay out upfront to build  this very, very expensive technology. You don't have to take my word  for it. Warren Buffett had something to say about this. He knows  something about investments. He knows something about economic  efficiency. Warren Buffett said:         We get a tax credit if we build a lot of wind farms. That       is the only reason to build them. They don't make sense       without the tax credit.    That is the reality we have. It is compounded by the fact, of course,  that wind energy is inherently unreliable. This will come as no  surprise to my colleagues. You don't generate electricity from a  windmill unless the wind is blowing. Unfortunately, it is just a fact  of nature that wind generation tends to peak in the middle of the night  and early morning hours when our energy needs are at their lowest.   It is very hard to store electricity, so we end up with this bizarre  situation that the Senator from Tennessee alluded to, where sometimes  the wind farms are generating tremendous amounts of electricity, when  no one needs electricity, because there is a wind storm in the middle  of the night, but because they are so heavily subsidized by taxpayers,  the wind farm companies are willing to pay the electric grid operator  to take their electricity. Normally, you sell your electricity. They  actually will pay money to have the electrical grid take their  electricity. This is extremely disruptive for the conventional sources  of electricity, whether it is nuclear or gas or coal, because they have  to be there all the time to adjust for the wild fluctuations that come  from wind-generated electricity. It is very hard for them to have a  vehicle business model when occasionally the product they produce has a  negative value. It is just bizarre.   I want to stress another element of this, which is the original  rationale. The original rationale was that this was a new industry. It  was going to need some help getting on its feet and getting  established, and after some period of time, it would be able to compete  on its own. This is no longer even remotely the case. In fact, there is  a tremendous amount of wind-generated electricity in America because  these subsidies have been so big for so long.   In 1999, we had only 4\1/2\ billion kilowatt hours of electricity  generated from wind. In 2018, we had 275 billion kilowatt hours--a  6,000-percent increase in two decades. It is now 7 percent of all U.S.  electricity generation because these subsidies are so expensive.   I think it was, in part, because of the enormous growth of this  industry and the maturity of it--the decades-long history--that  Congress finally decided back in 2015 that we would phase out these  subsidies. We wouldn't do it immediately, but we would phase them  [[Page S6640]]  out by 2019. So 20 years after the subsidies were supposed to end, we  are now on a glide path to phasing this out and having these taxpayer  subsidies expire at the end of this year.   At the time the Wind Energy Association looked at this in 2015, they  said: ``Growth in the wind industry is expected to remain strong when  the PTC is fully phased out.'' PTC is the production tax credit. That  is what we are talking about. Lo and behold, we get to the end of 2019,  or nearly so, and, sure enough, some folks in Congress are saying:  Well, let's not stick to that deal. Let's continue this subsidy even  longer. So we had a markup in the Ways and Means Committee of the other  Chamber to add yet another year's extension to the wind tax credit that  will cost another $2 billion.    I just don't think we should break the deal that we had in 2015. This  is an inefficient use of taxpayers' money. This makes our economy less  efficient. This lowers our standard of living and is disruptive to the  ongoing base sources of electricity that we need across the country.   The last point I want to make is that it is not as though we have an  energy shortage in this country. It is not as though we are going to  have to turn to hostile foreign sources to get the energy to replace if  we don't continue heavily subsidizing wind production. The fact is we  have staggering amounts of natural gas--enough natural gas to serve our  electricity generation needs for the indefinite future. In 2017, the  United States became a net exporter of natural gas. It is a huge,  growing source of electricity generation that is clean, that is  reliable, and that is incredibly abundant. We came to the right  conclusion some years ago. Now is our opportunity to stick to it.   I yield the floor.
