 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Donald A.  Stott of Monticello, Iowa, who lost his life aboard the USS Oklahoma  during the attack on Pearl Harbor.   His remains were only recently identified due to the significant  advancements in DNA testing. Stott's family has been working to  identify his remains for over a decade until the Navy called, offering  DNA tests to identify the remains of 35 soldiers who were previously  labeled as unrecoverable.   As of last week, Stott's remains have been returned home to  Monticello where his life and military service will be celebrated with  a special burial service.   Donald Stott enlisted in the Navy at age 17 and spent the early parts  of his career training in Great Lakes, Illinois, before being stationed  aboard the USS Oklahoma in June of 1940. Stott served as a Seaman First  Class, carrying out important duties such as steering, signaling, and  standing watch.   We appreciate the Stott family's patience, and we also recognize and  honor their family member.        Congratulating the University of Iowa Women's Basketball Team     Madam Speaker, I congratulate the University of  Iowa women's basketball team and Coach Bluder on making it to the Final  Four. Good luck and go Hawks.                     Recognizing Vietnam War Veterans Day     Madam Speaker, today is Vietnam War Veterans Day.  As a Vietnam-era veteran and having a brother who served in Vietnam, I  wish to recognize and acknowledge this day and the honorable service of  those who served in Vietnam.                     Wishing My Daughter a Happy Birthday     Madam Speaker, 33 years ago today, I was blessed  with the most incredible of gifts, with the birth of our daughter,  Taylor.   Happy birthday, Taylor. You are a blessing to both your father and  me.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, polluters over people act. They would  rather put people stopping traffic to prevent you from getting to work  and people throwing mashed potatoes at art than they would the American  people.   I could not disagree with my colleagues more. Oil is a global  commodity. Prices went up when the President constrained supply.   How do we know that? His own actions.   What did the President do?   He went to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to ask them to produce more  oil,  [[Page H1548]]  and then released oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve so prices  could go down just in time for the elections.   Among the 20 bills that make up this package, I draw attention to a  suite of bills focused on refining and processing critical minerals as  well as development of new mines for critical minerals on Federal land.   The critical minerals provisions in the E&C and Natural Resources  titles are helpful for Iowa wind, which produces 58 percent of the  electricity in the State. This allows Iowa to be a net exporter of  electricity and supports 230 blade manufacturing jobs in Fort Madison.  Ensuring we mine critical minerals in the U.S. and process those  minerals domestically is critical to securing our Nation's global  competitiveness and supporting many clean energy technologies as well  as supporting a cleaner environment from China.   Madam Chair, I also commend the significant strides we have made on  NEPA reform with the package combining measures to streamline  permitting reviews for energy products and mines. Importantly, H.R. 1  places clear timelines on environmental reviews, clarifies the scope of  environmental reviews, and puts sidebars on judicial reviews under  NEPA.   According to a recent poll from Citizens for Responsible Energy  Solutions Forum, 80 percent of people support policies that expedite  government review of infrastructure projects, which is why these issues  are at the heart of H.R. 1. As fiscal conservatives, we also take pride  in the fact that responsible permitting reform has the opportunity to  lower emissions while also costing zero taxpayer dollars and lowering  the costs of energy for consumers.   I am proud of the legislative wins in H.R. 1 to reduce energy costs.  We all want a cleaner, healthier planet for our children and  grandchildren and also affordable, abundant energy. H.R. 1 is a step in  the right direction. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''                                time  1315
