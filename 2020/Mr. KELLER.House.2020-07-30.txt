 Madam Speaker, I rise today to share a remarkable story  of heroism by our first responders in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional  District.   On the evening of Saturday, February 15, 2020, in Jersey Shore,  Pennsylvania, a multiple alarm fire was reported at the Broadway Hotel  and Restaurant, quickly engulfing the building and the multiple  residential apartments in the upper levels of the structure.   The situation quickly escalated as reports indicated that a man was  trapped on the third floor.   With complete disregard for their own well-being, Chief Howard Fausey  and Assistant Chief Ethan Goodbrod of Citizen's Hose Company Station  45, Jason Clarke, and Ron Daley of Independent Hose Company, and  Patrolman Shawn Hummer took decisive action knowing life was at stake.   Under thick smoke and extreme heat, the firefighters breached the  structure, retrieved and extracted the victim while sharing their  oxygen with the man due to overwhelming conditions.   I am happy to report that the victim has recovered from his injuries  and is undoubtedly alive today because of the bravery of these men.   We can all sleep safer knowing that there are dedicated and selfless  first responders that stand ready to give their lives for ours.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chief Fausey, Assistant Chief Goodbrod,  firefighters Jason Clarke and Ron Daley, Patrolman Shawn Hummer, the  police department, and the responding companies for their service and  heroism in the line of duty.                            ____________________
