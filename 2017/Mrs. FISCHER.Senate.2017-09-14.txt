 Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Defense  authorization bill.   Congress has passed this bipartisan legislation every year for the  past 55 years. Once again, this year, the Senate is debating this  critical legislation to provide our men and women in uniform with the  resources they need to keep America safe.   This is a bipartisan bill. It represents the combined efforts of  Members from both sides of the aisle. It was approved unanimously by  the Senate Armed Services Committee. All 27 of our members voted for  it. That is more than a quarter of this body.   The distinguished chairman, the senior Senator from Arizona, spoke on  the Senate floor on Monday about the geopolitical challenges we are  facing and the need for this legislation. He is absolutely right.   The number and the complexity of the threats we face today are  unprecedented. North Korea is relentlessly pursuing long-range  ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to our shores.  Americans are informed about the sobering threat from the Kim regime  because it has dominated much of the recent news, but it is by no means  the only significant challenge we face. We remain a nation at war, with  thousands of men and women in uniform still deployed to the Middle East  and Afghanistan. Russia and China continue to undermine rules-based  international order by developing advanced military capabilities  designed specifically to counter U.S. defense systems. Iran continues  to pursue regional dominance and regularly harasses U.S. ships and  planes operating in that region.   These are needlessly provocative acts that carry risks of an accident  or a miscalculation that could spiral into serious confrontation.  Additional low-intensity conflicts continue to smolder across the  globe, particularly in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Arabian  Peninsula, and each one has the potential to impact U.S. national  security.   The global turmoil of today highlights why the bill before us is so  very important. It will provide the resources necessary to defend our  Nation in the face of those challenges. But the NDAA is about more than  just answering these threats; it is about helping us here at home as  well.   Last Friday, I visited Naval Station Norfolk and had an opportunity  to meet with some of our Nation's best--the sailors and officers of the  U.S. Navy. As we stood on the pier, we watched the USS Abraham Lincoln  aircraft carrier depart and head out into the Atlantic and join other  U.S. Navy ships responding to the damage caused by Hurricane Irma.   Fighting and winning wars is the primary mission of our military, but  the American people depend on it for so much more. The destruction and  the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma have  brought this point home.   This bill authorizes the resources our men and women in uniform need  to respond to these crises and to do the job the Nation asks of them.  It also begins to address the readiness gaps that have emerged in  recent years as the Department has been asked to do more with less.   Upon returning to the Department of Defense 4 years after retiring  from military service, Secretary Mattis testified before the Senate  Armed Services Committee about this very issue. He said: ``I have been  shocked by what I have seen about our readiness to fight.'' Additional  testimony from other military leaders has borne this assessment out as  well.   Only 3 of the Army's 58 brigade combat teams are ready to ``fight  tonight.'' Sixty-two percent of the Navy's F-18 fighters cannot fly.  Approximately 80 percent of our Marine aviation units lack the minimum  number of ready basic aircraft for training, and flight-hour averages  are below the minimum standards required to achieve and to maintain  adequate levels of readiness.   Following the direction by President Trump to rebuild the military  and prioritization by Secretary Mattis to improve readiness, this bill  authorizes $30 billion to address unmet requirements identified by the  military services and our combatant commanders, and it provides  additional resources to address emerging threats.   In the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, which I chair, we provided  [[Page S5733]]  over $500 million in additional funding for cooperative missile defense  programs with Israel to fully meet the needs of our ally.   We also authorized an additional $200 million to approve the Ground- based Midcourse Defense, or the GMD, system. These increases include  funds for the development of more capable boosters and funds to improve  what our military calls ``discrimination,'' or the ability of the  system to distinguish between hostile warheads and decoys and other  debris in space. The GMD is our only missile defense system capable of  defending the homeland from intercontinental ballistic missiles, and  the smart, targeted increases made by the subcommittee have only become  more necessary as North Korea continues to demonstrate increased  capabilities.   The subcommittee's mark also fully supports the modernization of our  nuclear forces and the Department of Energy's nuclear enterprise and  the sustainment activities. As part of this effort, the subcommittee  added almost $200 million to help address the backlog of deferred  maintenance activities at our nuclear facilities. More than half of  these facilities are over 40 years old, and roughly 30 percent date  back to the era of the Manhattan Project. Dilapidated structures at  these facilities pose safety risks to our workers and jeopardize  essential operations.   This additional funding will enhance the administration's efforts to  address the highest priority requirements and begin reducing the  immense maintenance backlog, but more work will be required in future  years to resolve this very longstanding issue.   The jurisdiction of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee also includes  outer space. In the subcommittee's mark, we added over $700 million to  address unfunded needs for space operations. This includes over $100  million to expand the development and testing of advanced prototypes in  response to the urgent operational needs of our warfighters and an  additional $35 million to expedite the development of advanced jam- resistant GPS receivers.   Our forces rely heavily on the capabilities provided by our  satellites, and our adversaries know it. They are developing  capabilities to target our space assets, and these investments are  critical if we want to ensure our forces never have to face a day  without space.   I am proud of the strong provisions the Strategic Forces Subcommittee  contributed to the bill before us today. In addition to the steps taken  in this bill to address current threats, it makes important investments  in advanced technologies to stay ahead of the challenges we might face  tomorrow. For example, the bill authorizes over $500 million in  additional funding to support the Department's Third Offset Strategy  and improve the U.S. military's technological superiority. It also  prioritizes cyber security--an area of growing risk and opportunity as  technology becomes more and more sophisticated.   I serve on the Cybersecurity Subcommittee, and last Congress I served  as chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee,  which then had jurisdiction over our cyber capabilities. In this year's  bill, we are adding to those efforts that I worked on in past years to  improve how we man, train, and equip our military's cyber forces. The  committee added over $700 million for cyber-related requirements and  included a number of policy provisions in this area, such as a  requirement for the Department of Defense to undertake the first-ever  cyber posture review, which will evaluate the military's policy and  capabilities in the cyber domain.   Before concluding my remarks, I would like to reply to an argument  that was made earlier today by the Senator from Massachusetts against a  provision in this bill responding to Russia's violation of the INF  Treaty.   The bill before us today authorizes $65 million for researching a  ground-launched cruise missile system. The committee's report on the  bill explains this in greater detail, but I would like to make a few  quick points, if I may.   First, the senior Senator from Massachusetts described this provision  as a ``knee-jerk reaction.'' I would like to remind my colleagues that  Russia's violation of the INF Treaty reportedly began in 2008. That was  almost a decade ago. The United States formally raised it with Russian  officials in May of 2013--4\1/2\ years ago.   This issue has been with us for some time and the provisions of this  bill are anything but a knee-jerk reaction, which leads to my second  point. The Senator argues that further study is needed and has proposed  an amendment preventing any action from being taken before a report is  complete.   In the last three Defense authorization bills, Congress has required  some sort of study on this issue. The solution to this problem is not  to require further studies. Costs must be imposed on Russia for  violation, and that is what this provision does.   Finally, there was some discussion of the views of our military  leaders, and the Senator quoted heavily from Gen. Paul Selva, the Vice  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The General and I have discussed  this issue, and we have discussed it when he appeared before the Senate  Armed Services Committee in July. He specifically identified using  research and development programs, within the limits of the treaty, to  increase pressure on the Russians.   That is exactly what this provision does. It does not violate the INF  Treaty. It takes the first step to impose costs on Russia for its  violation of this agreement.   Years have gone by, no action has been taken, and Russia has only  increased its violation of the treaty. Waiting for more studies to be  complete only ensures that Russia's actions will continue to go  unanswered. Failing to hold Russia accountable risks undermining this  agreement and our broader nonproliferation agenda.   In the words of President Obama:         Rules must be binding. Violations must be punished. Words       must mean something.    In closing, I want to express my thanks to the bill's managers for  their hard work. I have truly appreciated all they have done to bring  this bill to the floor. This legislation upholds the bipartisan  tradition that has characterized the National Defense Authorization  Act, which has enabled it to pass for 55 years in a row. This is a  strong bill that will strengthen our military. It will help ensure the  military can protect our Nation in a world full of challenges. From  North Korea's belligerence to severe storms damaging our coasts, our  military has a tough job to do. They must be prepared to do it. I hope  my colleagues will join me in swiftly passing this bill.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
