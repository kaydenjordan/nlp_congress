 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the 73 police  officers who lost their lives in the line of duty last year across our  Nation.   Law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day to  keep our communities safe and protect those who cannot protect  themselves. Supporting our brave men and women in law enforcement  should not be a polarizing issue, but unfortunately, activist groups  and politicians have called to defund the police and, in some cases,  inspired and encouraged violence against the thin blue line.   Already in 2022, shootings of police officers have spiked 43 percent  across our country. Sadly, we will only see more officers killed from  antipolice rhetoric spewed by the radical left.   The absence of law enforcement means our communities are less safe  and enables crime to surge, and thugs will roam the streets freely  without consequence.   I stand here tonight to say, without reservation, that I back the  blue, and I will continue to do everything I can to get them the  resources they need to do their jobs and make America safe again.                            ____________________
