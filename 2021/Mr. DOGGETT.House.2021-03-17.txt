 Madam Speaker, a movement led by the Texas Council on  Family Violence, and so many other advocates, first won passage of the  Violence Against Women Act and brought the National Domestic Violence  Hotline to Austin, which has now offered 5 million lifesaving  responses. This act brought much-needed funding and hope to women  across America who led coalitions.   Yet, the scourge of violence has continued. In San Antonio, a  Collaborative led by Judges Monique Diaz and Peter Sakai has  supplemented incredible Family Services led by Marta Peleaz and  Patricia Castillo's PEACE initiative. I have joined them for two town  halls to listen, learn, and respond.   In Austin, Kelly White and Julia Spann continue the Safe Alliance, as  Maria Johnson expands the Hays-Caldwell Center. But too many violent  beatings have turned into killings. Because this reauthorization would  close ``the boyfriend loophole,'' denying a gun to an abusive partner,  the NRA and its Congressional Republican allies have been blocking  renewal.   Today, we call on them to choose life, to recommit to VAWA, and  foster a society where every person is treated with dignity.
