 Madam Speaker, I rise in  support of my amendment to H.R. 7617, Division F--of the Defense,  Commerce, Justice, Science, Energy and Water Development, Financial  Services and General Government, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and  Human Services, Education, Transportation, Housing, and Urban  Development Appropriations Act of 2021. My amendment, included in the  bipartisan en bloc, will increase funding for the Institute of Museum  and Library Services account by $10 million to support technological  advancements in libraries. This amendment highlights the need for  technology, like Wi-Fi and computers, in libraries, especially in  communities that are economically distressed. With uncertainty around  school openings in the fall, many students may not have the technology  or internet available at home to succeed. Libraries are a great place  to offer these types of free community services in a safe environment.  My amendment would support the bolstering of these resources. I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation.
