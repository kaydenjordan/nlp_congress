 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act, also known as the ``Trick Trick Trick Act.''   This bill, Mr. Speaker, includes a $1.5 trillion cut to Medicare and  Medicaid, raises taxes on middle-income families, and gives the biggest  tax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest Americans.   This bill eliminates personal deductions for medical expenses,  creating further hardship for people facing illnesses; eliminates  deductions for State and local income taxes, resulting in higher taxes  for people who can't afford it; and eliminates deductions for interest  paid on student loans, making quality education less accessible.   Proponents of the bill, Mr. Speaker, will have you believe that these  tax cuts will benefit working families, grow our economy, and decrease  the Federal deficit. That is fake news. This bill does nothing more  than destroy the hopes and dreams of middle Americans seeking a stable  career, a fulfilled life, and a brighter future.   The American people deserve better. I remain willing and able to work  across party lines to achieve responsible tax reform.   I say to my Republican colleagues: Do not pass this bill as a  Republican bill. It must be bipartisan. If you do it, you will regret  it.                            ____________________
