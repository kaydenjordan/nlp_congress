 Madam Speaker, there is going to be a lot of talk  around this building as far as what goes on with the future funding of  Ukraine. I have voted for funding for Ukraine in the past. I think it  is important that the United States appear united as we work towards  peace in Ukraine.   The thing that concerns me, and I wish more people would mention it,  is the degree to which I believe we are not working towards a  settlement there.   Every war must end sooner or later. The other day I spoke a little  bit about the Korean war in which tens of thousands of people died.  Ultimately, the United States negotiated with two of the most horrific  governments in existence in the last century: the Communist Chinese  Government and the Government of North Korea.   Nevertheless, a resolution was reached. Tens of thousands of lives  were saved, and we still have the same border that the negotiation  reached in 1953.   I would remind the belligerents that ultimately the war will end. If  we do not want to drive Russia closer and closer with China and Iran,  it would probably be better if the war ends sooner rather than later.    Sadly, I haven't seen a lot of commentary showing that at this point  anybody is working towards peace, at least not the Biden  administration.                            ____________________
