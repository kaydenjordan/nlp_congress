 Mr. Pisesident, I have fought for years to protect our  Nation's seniors from abuse and exploitation, initially, as former  Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, former Chairman of the Senate  Finance Committee, and more recently, as Chairman of the Senate  Judiciary Committee.   This past June, I chaired a Judiciary Committee hearing on Protecting  Older Americans from Financial Exploitation. At the hearing, we heard  about numerous scams in which seniors were targeted time after time,  resulting in their being defrauded, often with devastating  consequences. We also heard that many older Americans don't report  instances of elder abuse or exploitation due to embarrassment, a  refusal to acknowledge that they were victimized, or reliance on the  perpetrator as their caretaker.   Sadly, these accounts of elder abuse are nothing new. What has  changed is that the scams targeting seniors are becoming increasingly  sophisticated. That is one of the reasons why elder financial  exploitation has been dubbed ``the crime of the 21st century.''   I have made it a top priority to get the Federal Government to step  up its efforts to fight the abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation  of our Nation's seniors.   Last year, I called on the Justice Department to outline its efforts  to prevent and respond to instances of elder abuse. First, I sent a  letter to the Department to find out what it's doing to protect seniors  from a new and particularly troubling form of exploitation: the  photographing and online publication of nursing home residents in  embarrassing and compromising situations.   I also sent a letter to inquire about the Department's efforts to  fight imposter scams, in which fraudsters pose as employees of the IRS  or another government agency, in order to deprive ordinary Americans of  millions of dollars of their hard earned money. And as tax season  approaches once again, it's critical that folks watch out for these  deceitful scams.   I also asked about the data the Department is collecting on financial  exploitation, as well as how this data is being used to support Federal  efforts to protect America's seniors.   In its response to my inquiries, the Justice Department effectively  admitted that it falls short in several respects. The Department said  that it ``does not collect data on the prevalence of elder financial  exploitation nationwide.'' Further, the Department said that it can't  provide statistical information on the number of cases it has  prosecuted for elder financial exploitation.   What all this means is that we are not getting the full picture of  elder financial exploitation.   We do know that some older Americans' trusting and polite nature,  combined with their hard-earned retirement savings, make them  particularly attractive targets for fraudsters. We also know that the  abuse and exploitation of older Americans is on the rise and it can  take many forms.   Financial exploitation is the most widespread form of elder abuse,  costing America's seniors between an estimated $2.9 billion and $36  billion annually. But, sadly, its costs aren't limited to the negative  effect on seniors' bank accounts. Victims suffer all sorts of negative  effects, including diminished health, loss of independence, and  psychological distress.   It is estimated that up to 37 percent of seniors in the United States  are affected by some form of financial exploitation in any 5-year  period.   In my home State of Iowa, so-called grandparent scams are on the  rise. In these scams, fraudsters present themselves to an older  American as a grandchild in distress, hoping to convince the  grandparent to send cash or give out a credit card number.   Con artists are also using sweepstakes scams to steal money from  seniors. A senior is called and told they have won a prize or sum of  money. But before they can claim the supposed prize, the victim is  required to pay taxes or processing fees. Once the money is paid to  cover the taxes and fees, however, no prize ever materializes.   Other instances of elder financial exploitation are more personal in  nature and have especially devastating effects. Some victims are  pressured into signing over a deed, modifying a will, or giving a power  of attorney. Americans have lost their farms, homes, and life savings  to this form of fraud.   In short, elder abuse and exploitation is a serious problem, and it  demands a strong response. It requires all of us to work together in a  collaborative way.   So, today I am proud to introduce the Elder Abuse Prevention and  Prosecution Act. I thank my colleagues--Senators Blumenthal, Tillis,  Klobuchar, and Cornyn for collaborating with me on this comprehensive  and bipartisan bill's development and for joining as original  cosponsors. It takes a multi-pronged approach to combating the abuse  and financial exploitation of our nation's senior citizens.   We have heard a need for specialized prosecutors and more focused  efforts to combat abuse and exploitation. That is why the bill directs  the Attorney General to designate at least one federal prosecutor in  each U.S. Attorney's Office to serve as an Elder Justice Coordinator  for that district.   To ensure that elder abuse is a priority for the Federal Trade  Commission and the Justice Department, the bill also calls for each  agency to have an Elder Justice Coordinator.   We also need to send a strong message that efforts to target our  Nation's seniors won't be tolerated. That is why the bill enhances  elder victims' access to restitution and increases penalties for  criminals who use telemarketing or email in their schemes to defraud  seniors.   The bill also requires that the Justice Department partner with the  Department of Health and Human Services to provide training and  technical assistance to State and local governments on the  investigation, prevention, prosecution, and mitigation of elder abuse  and neglect.   Finally we have heard about the need for more data on financial  exploitation  [[Page S362]]  and the government's response. Gathering accurate information about  elder abuse is not only crucial to understanding the scope of the  problem, but it is also essential in determining where resources should  be allocated. So, the bill helps to accomplish that.   It requires that data be collected from federal prosecutors and law  enforcement in cases where an older American was the target of abuse or  exploitation.   These and other reforms included in the bill are the product of a  truly bipartisan effort, as well as insight from key stakeholders and  those who've been battling elder financial exploitation on the front  lines.   This 21st century crime requires a 21st century response. The Elder  Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act takes a strong step toward  protecting our Nation's seniors, and I urge my colleagues to support  this bill.                            ____________________
