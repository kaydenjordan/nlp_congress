 Madam Speaker, this bill is something I have been working  on for 10 years and have introduced in every Congress since I came to  Congress. It provides $25 million a year for 5 years.   Over the last 200 years, 90 percent of the bay wetlands have  disappeared. They are gone. What is even worse is that in less than 9  years, sea level rise in that region will effectively drown out all of  the marshes. The damage will be irreversible.   Over the last 8 years the EPA has invested only $45 million in San  Francisco Bay. However, even though it is the largest estuary on the  West Coast, Puget Sound received more than $260 million and the  Chesapeake Bay received $490 million. That is an unbelievable  difference in funding opportunities.   We can't afford to keep pushing this off. The San Francisco Bay  supports 4 million jobs and provides 20 million Californians with clean  drinking water.   It is the lifeblood of the region and a worthy investment of taxpayer  dollars. Every dollar spent on restoration efforts generates $2.10 in  economic activity. More funding for the bay is a win-win. It would, in  fact, be the right thing to do, the only fair thing to do considering  how much more has been spent on other estuaries.
