 Mr. President, the Senate Budget Committee is charged  with the enforcement of budgetary levels and associated budgetary laws.  This duty entails the review of measures through all stages of the  legislative process. Consistent with the practice of previous chairs  and ranking members of the committee, I have instructed my staff to  review all bills and resolutions for which unanimous consent for  passage is requested for any budgetary and programmatic effects.   To help my staff perform their duties and avoid unnecessary delays  during the unanimous consent process, Members are encouraged to provide  Budget Committee staff with legislative text and corresponding  budgetary information from either the Congressional Budget Office or  the Joint Committee on Taxation. I will use this information to weigh  the budgetary and policy implications of each matter.   If after considering this information I decide to object to  legislation, I will file notice of that decision publicly.                            ____________________
