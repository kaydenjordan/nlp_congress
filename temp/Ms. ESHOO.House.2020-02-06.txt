 Madam Speaker, this is National Gun Violence Survivors  Week, and I rise today to honor the many courageous survivors of gun  violence across our country who are fighting for change.   Over 70 percent of the American people, including a majority of gun  owners, support universal background  [[Page H859]]  checks. They know this policy will help keep guns out of the hands of  criminals.   The current system has already stopped 3 million gun sales to  convicted felons and others who are prohibited by law from owning a  firearm, but we can and must do more.   The good news is that, a year ago this month, the new majority in the  Congress took up two bills to establish universal background checks,  including H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. Sadly, the  Senate refuses to take up these bills, and with every day that passes,  96 Americans are killed by guns.   Today, we remember the over 100,000 survivors who have been injured  by guns and are every day, those that we have lost, and the countless  other Americans who are affected by gun violence in our country. We  should never rest until Congress takes every action to address this.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the committee for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. I do so for the  following reasons: We have heard from our friends on the other side of  the aisle about process issues. They are always appropriate to bring  up. But that really is an obfuscation of why we are on the floor today  with this resolution. This is about healthcare. This is about the  Democrats looking to protect the healthcare that the American people  have today.   Now, from the outset of this administration, Medicaid coverage for  low-income and disabled Americans, medically complex children, and our  Nation's most vulnerable communities have been under attack.   After failing to repeal Medicaid coverage for 17 million Americans in  the last Congress, the Trump administration is now taking a hatchet to  Medicaid. They are ripping coverage away from families, through onerous  paperwork--saying: ``Oh, no, that really doesn't matter,'' but it  does--onerous paperwork requirements, discriminatory policies against  documented immigrants, and funding cuts through proposed block grants.                                time  1445    Block grants are not exactly tidy. It is not the way they are being  represented. They use the word ``flexible.''   Whom is it flexible for? It is flexible for the States that can't  stand it and allow them to cut, and they are the States that have some  of the poorest people in them.   The administration's actions have already taken a terrible toll. They  are directly responsible for 818,000 fewer children being enrolled in  Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program and 750,000 fewer  adults being enrolled in Medicaid since 2017.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to hear the Republicans today  stand up on the floor and say: We object to the administration being in  the court to eviscerate, remove, undo, and get rid of the entirety of  the Affordable Care Act, and I don't think this can stand.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it. I think a vote  against this resolution is a vote to throw millions of Americans with  preexisting conditions overboard.
