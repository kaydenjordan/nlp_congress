 Madam Speaker, this country faces an energy crisis of  all types: fuel, gas, electricity. But what is the issue we are  pursuing? It seems to be all about this little sliver right here on  this chart: carbon dioxide.   Most people are surprised when told 0.04 percent composes the carbon  dioxide part of our atmosphere. You see 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent  oxygen, trace gases. I had to break this out of trace gases so you can  see it on the chart.   Yet, in my home State of California--where we had CO2-free  power plants, two nuclear plants; the second one will be gone in 3  years--they want to remove hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River in  my district that make zero CO2.   So, is this really about CO2, or is it about some other  political agenda? Because in my district, when the wind blows, they  have to shut the power off because the trees the Forest Service are not  managing might blow into the power lines coming from a hydroelectric  dam.   I do not understand what the energy policy of this country is because  I don't think there is one anymore. We need to get back to doing what  we do well and not pursue this fruitless agenda.                            ____________________
