 Madam Speaker, I want to thank Ranking Member Cole for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question so that we can consider H.R. 336, the Strengthening America's  Security in the Middle East Act, under a rule that would allow an  amendment to add a section recognizing the dangers of a precipitous  withdrawal from Syria and Afghanistan. This amendment would change H.R.  336 to mirror the text of the Senate companion bill S. 1.   S. 1 passed the Senate just last week by an overwhelming bipartisan  vote of 77-23.   I introduced this House companion in January.   This package of bipartisan bills from last Congress bolsters the  security of America and our allies in the Middle East.   This bill authorizes U.S. security assistance to Israel over a 10- year period and updates key elements of our security cooperation to  ensure that Israel can respond to the significant threats it faces from  its neighbors.   It also reauthorizes the United States-Jordan Defense Cooperation  Act, allowing Jordan to remain eligible to receive special treatment  for the transfer of U.S. defense articles and services.   Jordan is a critical ally in the fight against ISIS and other  extremist groups. We need to make sure that they are adequately  equipped to help maintain stability in the Middle East.   H.R. 336 also contains the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act. This  bill passed the House earlier this year. It should have been law a long  time ago.  [[Page H1539]]    This act will impose long-overdue sanctions against Syria's Assad  regime and its backers, including Iran and Russia, for their egregious  human rights abuses.   Finally, this bill empowers State and local governments in the United  States to counter the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions,  otherwise known as BDS, movement's discriminatory economic warfare  against Israel.   These provisions have already passed the Senate with bipartisan  support. I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting ``no'' on the  previous question in order to consider this important bill to shore up  U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East and take action against  Assad's murderous regime.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just begin by extending my appreciation for the chairman. I  know his arguments are well-intentioned, as are mine. I believe that we  both completely agree and completely support Congress' solemn duty  under Article I of the Constitution, to authorize the commitment of  U.S. troops to foreign hostilities; and perhaps there will be another  example where we can join forces in that. But that is not the issue  here.   Allow me to quote the actual War Powers Act, from Title 50 of the  United States Code. This procedure applies to ``the removal of United  States Armed Forces engaged in hostilities outside the territory of the  United States.''   This has always meant, historically, and today, U.S. troops being  directly involved in live-fire combat. As the Department of Defense has  repeatedly confirmed, U.S. Armed Forces are not engaged in hostilities  against the Houthi forces in Yemen.   This resolution is directing us to remove troops that simply, Madam  Chair, are not there. Even the aerial refueling of coalition jets,  which does not constitute traditional hostilities, ended last November.   This resolution, in my judgment, misuses the tool to try to get at  the different issue of security assistance to third countries. It  provides no clear decisions on which forms of assistance are cut off.  It does not address the humanitarian catastrophe inside Yemen and,  alarmingly, it completely ignores the destabilization role that Iran is  playing in Yemen and the region.   This irresponsible measure is trying to hammer a square peg in a  round hole.   This resolution really stretches the definition of ``hostilities'' to  cover non-U.S. military operations by other countries. It reinterprets  U.S. support to those countries as ``engagement in hostilities.''   This overreach has dangerous implications far beyond Saudi Arabia.  This approach will now allow any single Member to use this privileged  mechanism to second-guess U.S. security cooperation relationships with  more than 100 countries throughout the world.   Under this model, if one Member doesn't like something that any of  our security partners does overseas, that Member can force quick  consideration of a resolution directing the removal of U.S. forces from  hostilities ``in or affecting'' that situation. It no longer matters  that U.S. forces are not actually conducting those hostilities.   This could impact our assistance to Israel. It could affect our  cooperation with our NATO allies. It could impact counterterrorism  cooperation with African nations in the Sahel. We could recklessly undo  critical security relationships that we have spent decades building.   That is not what the War Powers Resolution has ever meant, and I  don't think that is what Congress designed it to do, and it should not  be used in this way now.   No one is saying that U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia, or  anyone else, is beyond congressional scrutiny. Congress has many tools  at its disposal. Our committee receives regular arms sales  notifications. Congress can condition or cut off security assistance  through targeted legislation or the annual appropriations process.   But this resolution is the wrong tool. It is vague and irresponsible.  It will create new doubts for our partners and allies around the world.   For those reasons, Madam Chair, I strongly oppose this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry), ranking member of the House  Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), the ranking member on the  Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Yoho), the ranking member on the Asia, the Pacific, and  Nonproliferation Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), a member of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Zeldin), the ranking member of the Oversight and  Investigations Subcommittee of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Watkins), a member of the House Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I have no further speakers, so I am prepared  to close, and I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, let me state a few points.   We all condemn the murder of Khashoggi. I have condemned it publicly,  very strongly, what happened with the Saudis killing Khashoggi,  executing him.   We are talking about the situation in Yemen.   Who started this humanitarian crisis in the first place? The Houthis  tried to take over the Yemeni Government--the Houthis, backed by Iran.   This is about the geopolitics of Iran, Houthis in Yemen, Iran and the  Shia crescent in Iraq and Syria, and a direct threat to Israel by the  largest state-sponsored terror, Iran, that is a mortal sworn enemy to  Israel, as they chant ``death to Israel,'' ``death to America.''   So let's put this all in proper context of what we are really talking  about here. Are we defending Iran and the Houthis here today?   So I would like to close by putting two documents in the Record. The  first is a letter sent by the Department of Defense Office of General  Counsel stating that ``DOD opposes the resolution because the  resolution's fundamental premise is flawed'' because the United States  support to the Saudi-led coalition ``does not involve any introduction  of U.S. forces into hostilities.''   Are we going to go around and second-guess every security cooperation  agreement we have with 117 countries, including Israel and NATO and  other partners?   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record this letter from the General  Counsel of the Department of Defense.                                              General Counsel of the                                           Department of Defense,                                      Washington, DC, Feb. 27, 2018.      Hon. Mitchell ``Mitch'' McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Majority Leader: On February 22, 2018, the       Department of Defense (DoD) briefed your staff concerning DoD       support to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's (KSA) operations in       Yemen. Subsequently, you requested an unclassified letter       reflecting DoD's views on a draft joint resolution that would       ``direct[] the President to remove United States Armed Forces       from hostilities in or affecting the Republic of Yemen,       except United States Armed Forces engaged in operations       directed at al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula or associated       forces. . . .'' DoD opposes this Joint Resolution. Even if       enacted into law, the Joint Resolution would not achieve its       apparent purpose of restricting U.S. support to the KSA-led       coalition, because, as described below, that support does not       constitute ``hostilities.'' In addition to the potential       constitutional concerns raised by such a proposal, the draft       resolution's restrictions on U.S. military support to our       partners could undermine our ability to foster long-term       relationships, increase interoperability, promote burden       sharing, and build strong security architectures throughout       the world. The KSA is a key U.S. partner in the Middle East       and we rely on our strong military partnership to promote       regional security.        DoD opposes the resolution because the resolution's       fundamental premise is flawed. Specifically, the draft       resolution incorrectly asserts that U.S. forces have been       ``introduced into hostilities between the [KSA-led] coalition       and the Houthis. . . .'' The limited military and       intelligence support that the United States is providing to       the KSA-led coalition does not involve any introduction of       U.S. forces into hostilities for purposes of the War Powers       Resolution or of section 1013 of the Department of State       Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1984 and 1985 (50 USC 1546a).        Since 2015, the United States has provided limited support       to KSA-led coalition military operations against Houthi and       Saleh-aligned forces in Yemen. With the exception of a       defensive strike in October 2016, U.S. forces are not taking       direct military action in this Saudi-led effort in Yemen.       Instead, the United States provides the KSA-led coalition       defense articles and services, including air-to-air       refueling; certain intelligence support; and military advice,       including advice regarding compliance with the law of armed       conflict and best practices for reducing the risk of civilian       casualties.        The draft resolution incorrectly describes United States       support to the KSA-led coalition as an operation that       introduces U.S. forces into hostilities or imminent       involvement in hostilities for purposes of the War Powers       Resolution. It has been the longstanding view of the       Executive Branch that ``hostilities'' refers to ``a situation       in which units of U.S. armed forces are actively engaged in       exchanges of fire with opposing units of hostile forces.''       U.S. personnel providing support to the KSA-led coalition are       not engaged in any such exchanges of fire. Further, the       limited U.S. support to the KSA-led coalition does not       implicate the activities identified in section 8(c) of the       War Powers Resolution. Section 8(c) defines the term       ``introduction of United States Armed Forces'' but does not       address the term ``hostilities.'' ``[W]hen applying section       8(c), the  [[Page H1550]]       relevant question remains whether U.S. forces--not the       foreign forces they are accompanying--are introduced into       hostilities or situations involving the imminent threat       thereof.'' With respect to U.S. support to the KSA-led       coalition, U.S. forces do not currently command, coordinate,       accompany, or participate in the movement of coalition forces       in counter-Houthi operations. Thus, no U.S. forces are       accompanying the KSA-led coalition when its military forces       are engaged, or an imminent threat exists that they will       become engaged, in hostilities. Accordingly, U.S. forces       supporting the KSA-led coalition have not been introduced       into hostilities or situations where hostilities are       imminent.        Although the resolution's requirement to remove U.S. forces       from hostilities would not implicate U.S. support to the KSA-      led coalition, this requirement could call into question the       statutory authority for ongoing U.S. counterterrorism       operations in Yemen. Pursuant to the 2001 Authorization to       Use Military Force (AUMF) (Public Law 107-40), U.S. armed       forces are currently engaged in hostilities against both al       Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State       of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in Yemen. Hostilities against AQAP       and associated forces are explicitly exempted from the       resolution's termination requirement, but hostilities against       ISIS are not similarly exempted.        The resolution also asserts incorrectly that there is no       authorization for U.S. participation in a Joint Combined       Planning Cell with the KSA and mid-air refueling of KSA-led       coalition aircraft. President Obama directed such military       and intelligence support pursuant to his authority under       Article II of the Constitution as Commander in Chief and       Chief Executive and his authority to conduct U.S. foreign       relations. See Fleming v. Page, 50 U.S. (9 How.) 603, 615       (1850) (explaining that the President ``is authorized to       direct the movements of the naval and military forces placed       by law at his command''); Training of British Flying Students       in the United States, 40 Op. Att'y Gen. 58, 62 (1941)       (``[T]he President's authority has long been recognized as       extending to the dispatch of armed forces outside the United       States, either on missions of goodwill or rescue, or for the       purpose of protecting American lives or property or American       interests.''). Because, as discussed above, this limited       support to the KSA does not involve the introduction of U.S.       forces into hostilities or into situations where imminent       involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated, it does       not implicate section 4(a)(l) of the War Powers       Resolution. See 50 U.S.C. Sec. 1543(a)(l). The Obama       Administration published its summary of that limited       support to the KSA-led coalition as part of the December       2016 ``Report of the Legal and Policy Framework Guiding       the United States Use of Military Force and Related       National Security Operations.'' As discussed further       below, DoD and the Department of State have implemented       the President's direction through statutory authorities       available to the respective Secretaries.        Article II of the Constitution likewise supplied the legal       authority for the October 2016 strikes against radar       facilities in Houthi-controlled territory in defense of U.S.       Navy ships in international waters. The President has       authority pursuant to Article II to take military action that       furthers sufficiently important national interests. The       limited October 2016 strikes were taken to protect U.S.       vessels and personnel. Consistent with the War Powers       Resolution, President Obama notified Congress of these       strikes on October 14, 2016. The Obama Administration also       published a summary of its legal analysis for the strike in       its December 2016 report.        In late July 2017, President Trump completed a review of       the Obama Administration's policy of limited support to the       Saudi-led coalition. President Trump decided to continue that       support, adjusting the priorities in light of the       recommendations of Secretary of Defense James Mattis and       intervening developments in Yemen. President Trump's policy       guidance for support to the KSA-led coalition's operations in       Yemen is to focus on ending the war and avoiding a regional       conflict, mitigating the humanitarian crisis, and defending       Saudi Arabia's territorial integrity and commerce in the Red       Sea. Authorized types of support continue to include       intelligence, logistics, and advisory support to the KSA-led       coalition.        DoD and the Department of State have implemented the       President's policy guidance to provide limited support to the       Saudi-led coalition pursuant to legal authorities available       to the respective Secretaries. The most prominent forms of       support to the KSA and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), as       well as the corresponding legal authorities, are detailed       below.        Arms and Other Defense Articles: The Arms Export Control       Act (AECA) is the underlying authority through which the       United States provides or licenses defense articles and       defense services to the KSA, UAE, and other members of the       KSA-led coalition; many of these defense articles and defense       services have been used in the conflict in Yemen. The AECA       and associated delegations of authority provide the Secretary       of State with the authority to approve the transfer of arms       and other defense articles and defense services, primarily       through the Foreign Military Sales program (which is overseen       by the State Department and implemented through DoD) and       through the State Department's licensing of Direct Commercial       Sales to foreign partners. The authority to approve such       transfers or licenses is not contingent upon whether the       foreign recipient is engaged in an ongoing armed conflict,       although the existence of such a conflict clearly increases       demand and can be a policy factor in approval decisions.       Transfers and licenses made pursuant to the AECA are subject       to various requirements (such as notifications to Congress       when transfers are above certain monetary thresholds) as well       as restrictions on end-use (including no further transfer by       the end-user without U.S. consent and that proposed uses must       be consistent with the law of armed conflict).        Logistics: Pursuant to licenses issued by the State       Department under the AECA, U.S. contractors provide defense       services in the form of essential maintenance and sustainment       for KSA and UAE combat aircraft engaged in hostilities in       Yemen. The in-flight refueling of KSA and UAE aircraft,       including combat aircraft, and certain other support, may       also be provided pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2341 et       seq., which authorizes DoD to provide logistic support,       supplies, and services to the military forces of a country       with which DoD has an Acquisition and Cross-Servicing       Agreement (ACSA) in force. DoD must first obtain State       Department approval to conclude an ACSA; DoD has ACSAs with       the Ministry of Defense of the KSA (applied provisionally       pending its formal entry into force) and with the Armed       Forces General Headquarters of the UAE.        I trust that this response will be helpful to your       understanding of U.S. support to the KSA's operations in       Yemen, and the reason for the DoD's opposition to this       proposed Joint Resolution. Thank you for your continued       support of the Department of Defense.            Sincerely,                                                 William S. Castle,                                                            Acting.     Mr. Chair, I include in the Record this second document,  which is a Statement of Administration Policy on this point.                     Statement of Administration Policy   S.J. Res. 54--To Direct the Removal of United States Armed Forces from   Hostilities in the Republic of Yemen that Have Not Been Authorized by             the Congress--Sen. Sanders, I-VT and 16 cosponsors         The Administration strongly opposes passage of S.J. Res.       54, a joint resolution that purports to direct the removal of       United States Armed Forces that have not been authorized by       the Congress from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen. The       fundamental premise of S.J. Res. 54 is flawed--United States       forces are not engaged in hostilities between the Saudi-led       coalition and Houthi forces in Yemen. Since 2015, the United       States has provided limited support to member countries of       the Emirati and Saudi-led coalition, including intelligence       sharing, logistics, and, until recently, aerial refueling.       This support is provided in accordance with licenses and       approvals under the Arms Export Control Act, statutory       authorities to provide logistics support, and the President's       constitutional powers. United States counterterrorism       operations and an October 2016 strike on radar facilities in       Houthi-controlled territory, which was the subject of a prior       report consistent with the War Powers Resolution of 1973, are       separate matters. Other than those engagements, no United       States forces have been introduced into hostilities, or into       situations where hostilities are clearly imminent, in       connection with ongoing support to the Saudi-led coalition.       As a result, this United States support does not implicate       the War Powers Resolution.        In addition to its erroneous premise, the joint resolution       would harm bilateral relationships in the region and       negatively impact the ability of the United States to prevent       the spread of violent extremist organizations such as al-      Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS in Yemen. The       continued cooperation of the United States allows the       Administration to support diplomatic negotiations to end the       war, ensure humanitarian access, enhance efforts to recover       United States hostages in Yemen, and defeat terrorists that       seek to harm the United States.        Accordingly, if S.J. Res. 54 were presented to the       President in its current form, his advisors would recommend       that he veto the joint resolution.     Mr. Chair, I am deeply troubled by the one-sided nature  of this resolution and what is missing from this resolution, which I  just stated earlier, and that is Iran, the world's leading state  sponsor of terror and the Houthis' benefactor. By staying silent on  Iran and by not condemning the Houthis in this resolution, it sends a  green light to the Houthis and to the Iranian backers to press on.   This resolution is counterproductive, also, to the efforts that are  ongoing right now to negotiate peace in Yemen between the Houthi rebels  and the Government of the Yemen Republic.   As we speak, the U.N. envoy is working with the full support of the  United States to negotiate a political resolution to this conflict.  Getting to these talks has required placing substantial pressure on all  parties involved.   The U.N. is encouraging the Houthis to uphold these agreements and to  make further agreements with the Yemini Government and the Saudi-led  [[Page H1551]]  coalition. But this resolution might cut the U.N. efforts off at its  knees.   The Democrats can't tell specifically what assistance this resolution  cuts off, but what I can say for sure is that what this resolution says  to the Houthis and to Iran is: You have got a green light. Keep going  on. You can gain more ground and cause more destruction and  humanitarian crisis and cause more problems for Israel and our Saudi  ally.   Advancing this pro-Houthi, pro-Iran, anti-Israel resolution does not  help to end this war. In Yemen, it only emboldens the rebels in Iran  who violently overthrew Yemen's Government and the radical regime that  backs them, Iran.   So I would say, Mr. Chairman, in closing, this resolution is not only  a dangerous precedent legally--it violates the construction of the War  Powers Act--but it is damaging and very bad policy, and I urge my  colleagues to vote against it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
