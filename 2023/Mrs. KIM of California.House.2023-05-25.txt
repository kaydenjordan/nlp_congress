 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of U.S.  Marine Corps Major Megan McClung from Mission Viejo in my district. She  was the first female Marine Corps officer to be killed in the Iraq war.  She was also the first woman graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy to be  killed in action.   Major McClung's headstone reads: ``Be brief. Be bold. Be gone.''   While she left us too soon, she had a life well lived and made a  lasting impact.   If marines didn't know her, they knew of her. She was an avid  marathon runner and triathlete. Her contagious personality, tenacity,  and fiery red hair are remembered by all.   This week, I introduced a bipartisan bill to rename the Mission Viejo  Post Office in her honor.   We can never fully repay our fallen heroes and their families, but I  hope this will help preserve her story for future generations.                            ____________________
