 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see President Biden has  acknowledged that we are having a lot of inflation right now in this  country affecting prices for everybody. He even went so far as to tell  some restaurant owners that you are going to be in a bind for a while  because it is going to still be hard to get workers.   When people are paid not to show up because of overgenerous benefits,  all our small businesses will continue to be in a bind. When you pay  people not to work, you get inflation. So for a few maybe getting a  wage increase because the restaurants are in a bind, everybody receives  higher prices. Prices are up, we know, on food, on fuel, lumber, many  things. This is what happens when the government spends too much, puts  too much money into the economy all based on debt.   So what are we going to do about that? Are we going to set a course  here to put people back in business, or do we want to have, like we saw  just this last month, another 5.4 percent of inflation, which is really  a tax on every American.                            ____________________
