 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Senior Master Sergeant  Mark Lett, an American hero who retired after 26 faithful years of  service from the United States Air Force in 2011.   Senior Master Sergeant Lett was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, and  attended Carter High School. He joined the Air Force in 1985.   Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Lett served as an in-flight refueling  specialist on a KC-135 aircraft in addition to serving as a flight  instructor and flight engineer.   During his long career, he was stationed in five States across the  United States. While serving as a flight engineer, he deployed to  Uzbekistan and Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. He  received numerous awards during his Air Force career, including the  Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, the Afghanistan  Campaign Medal, and many more.   After retiring from the Air Force in 2011, he returned to Knoxville.  In July 2014, I was pleased to note that he joined the Knox County  Veterans Services as the deputy veterans service officer.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize American hero Senior Master  Sergeant Lett as Tennessee Second District's Veteran of the Month.                            ____________________
