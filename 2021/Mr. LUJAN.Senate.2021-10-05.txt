 Mr. President, it is an honor to speak in support of the  John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to protect the voting rights  of all Americans.   Our democracy is at its strongest when every American can participate  and make their voice heard--something that our friend, our colleague, a  mentor to many of us, the late John Lewis--it is what he fought for his  entire life. But in too many communities across America, voter  suppression efforts are making it harder for Americans to vote,  especially Native Americans, who continue to experience geographic,  linguistic, and legal barriers.   That is why I am proud that the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement  Act includes the Native American Voting Rights Act, which I was proud  to introduce in August in the Senate and spent years fighting for in  the House, developing this legislation with voting rights advocates  across America. This much needed legislation would protect the sacred  right to vote and reduce barriers to the ballot box for voters living  on Tribal lands--vital progress to protect the sacred right to vote for  all Americans.   This past year, America has seen unprecedented efforts to restrict  access to the ballot box, to make it harder to vote, and silence our  voices, especially Native voices. It is unacceptable, and it is all the  more reason why the Senate must pass robust voting rights legislation  that empowers Tribes and Native American voters, because our democracy  is strongest when everyone participates.   It is our moral imperative to protect the right to vote, to combat  the discrimination that has long kept Americans from exercising this  right. With millions of Americans calling on this body to deliver on  voting rights legislation, I strongly support the John Lewis Voting  Rights Advancement Act. It is  [[Page S6920]]  the right thing to do. It is the time to get this done.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr.          Kaine, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Markey, Ms. Rosen, Mrs. Murray, Mr.          Peters, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Padilla, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Lujan, and          Mr. Sanders):   S. 2937. A bill to authorize humanitarian assistance and civil  society support, promote democracy and human rights, and impose  targeted sanctions with respect to human rights abuses in Burma, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.   Mr. CARDIN, Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Burma  Unified through Rigorous Military Accountability Act of 2021, BURMA,  which is cosponsored by Senators Durbin, Markey, Merkley, Feinstein,  Kaine, Rosen, Murray, Peters, Klobuchar, Padilla, Wyden, and Lujan,   We are doing so in tandem with simultaneous introduction of a  companion bill today in the House of Representatives by House Foreign  Affairs Committee Chairman Meeks, along with Representatives Chabot and  McCaul and others. The purpose in short is to provide a legislative  foundation to certain steps the Biden administration has undertaken by  Executive order and to push the executive branch to be even more  forward-leaning in addressing the February 1 coup d'etat and the  ongoing human rights being committed by the Burmese military, the  Tatmadaw. The legislation includes authorization to impose sanctions on  individuals and entities who helped stage the February 1 coup d'etat  and are responsible for the subsequent repression of fundamental  freedoms, human rights abuses, use of indiscriminate violence towards  civilians, and other gross atrocities; authorization to prohibit the  import of precious and semi-precious gemstones from Burma into the  United States; authorization for a new position at the State  Department, a Special Coordinator for Burmese Democracy, to promote an  international effort to impose and enforce multilateral sanctions on  Burma and coordinate U.S. Government interagency efforts on Burma;  authorization for support to civil society and for humanitarian  assistance in Burma, Bangladesh, Thailand, and the surrounding region;  requires the Secretary of State to make a determination whether the  persecution of the Rohingya in Burma constitutes genocide; and a call  for the United States to take more decisive action with regard to Burma  at the United Nations.   Throughout its independence, Burma's history has suffered decades of  repressive military rule and civil war with ethnic minority groups, and  what we are seeing today in Burma is no different.   In 1988, thousands of people took the streets to protest the  government. Under the leadership of then-General Ne Win, who ruled for  26 years following a coup, security forces cracked down on protestors,  killing thousands of citizens. During these uprisings, Aung San Suu Kyi  emerged as a charismatic national icon, preaching democracy and  nonviolence as she highlighted the political situation in Burma.   In 1990, the military junta agreed to hold the first multiparty  elections in 30 years in which Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National  League for Democracy, won 81 percent of the seats in the government  with over 70 percent voter turnout. However, the ray of hope in Burma  was quickly diminished when the military refused to recognize the  results and hand over power. Aung San Suu Kyi was detained and remained  under house arrest for nearly 15 years--until her release in 2010 as  the country continued to be ruled by the military.   In 2011, President Thein Sein agreed to a series of reforms,  including granting amnesty to political prisoners, relaxing media  censorship, and implementing economic policies to encourage foreign  investment. Aung San Suu Kyi became a member of Parliament when her  party won 43 of the 45 vacant seats in the 2012 by-elections, as  ongoing negotiations between civilians and military officials  continued.   In 2015, Myanmar held its first nationwide, multiparty elections-- considered to be the freest and fairest elections in decades--since the  country's transition away from military rule. Her party boycotted the  2010 elections, resulting in a decisive victory for the military-backed  Union Solidarity and Development Party. In the 2015 elections, Aung San  Suu Kyi's party won a landslide victory, taking 86 percent of the seats  in the Assembly of the Union. Although she was prohibited from becoming  the President due to a clause the military demanded be inserted in the  constitution specifically to keep her from office, she assumed the role  of State Counsellor of Myanmar. Yet, despite the facade of civilian  governance that had been established in Burma, the real political power  continued to rest in the hands of the military.   Three years on, following decades of ongoing persecution, including  confinement to ghettos, stripping away of citizenship rights,  restrictions on healthcare and fertility, military unleashed a  horrifying display of state-sanctioned violence in Rakhine state in  August 2017, which resulted in wide-scale human rights violation,  including tens of thousands of deaths, sexual violence, torture,  unlawful arrest and detention, and widespread destruction of the  Rohingya people's homes and communities. Over 736,000 survivors fled to  refugee camps in Bangladesh, where they remain to this day, in urgent  need of humanitarian aid, increased support--and justice.   Since 2019, I joined my colleagues in the Senate in calling on  directing the State Department to determine whether attacks by the  Burmese military and security forces against the Rohingya constitutes  genocide. The United States has still not issued a determination on  whether the atrocities committed against the Rohingya constitute  genocide, even though human rights investigators funded by the State  Department concluded in 2018 that ``there are reasonable grounds to  believe that genocide was committed.'' U.N. investigators have also  found evidence that infers genocidal intent. This is something my  colleagues and I address in our BURMA bill. The United States should  lead in calling what happened what it is: a genocide.   On February 1, 2021, the Burmese military led a coup against the  democratically elected legislature, just hours before the Parliament  was scheduled to be seated terrifying setback for the emerging  potential for democracy and rule-of-law in Burma.   Since seizing control, the military forces have killed over a  thousand people across the country as they crack down on civilian  protestors who have mobilized to oppose the ongoing assault on the  country's nascent political institutions and traditions. Rather than  follow the outcome of the parliamentary elections held last November,  the Burmese military has detained Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win  Myint, and other civilians, including other government officials. The  military has also cut internet and telephone communication, and it has  stopped flights in the country.   For years, the Burmese military has been responsible for much of the  violence against minority groups in Burma, including the Rohingya. More  than 1 million Rohingya have fled the country and become refugees as a  result of the military's atrocities against them. This coup d'etat  further damages democratic institutions in Burma and makes the entire  region less stable.   As the death toll in Myanmar continues to rise, the United States  must not be indifferent to Burma's fate. The Burmese military has also  been responsible for horrible atrocities committed against minority  groups in Burma, including the Rohingya, which has led more than 1  million to flee the country and become refugees. In recent months, the  Tatmadaw, the country's military, escalated its brutal campaign, using  COVID-19 like a biological weapon to terrorize and control the people  of Burma. The military has arrested government officials, doctors,  nurses, and journalist, including U.S. citizen Danny Fester.   The bill aims to authorize sanctions on individuals and entities who  helped stage the February 1 coup d'etat and are responsible for the  subsequent repression of fundamental freedoms, human rights abuses, use  of indiscriminate violence towards civilians, and other gross  atrocities; authorizes increased humanitarian assistance for Rohingya  refugees and provides support for civil society and independent media;  prohibits the import of  [[Page S6921]]  gemstones from Burma into the United States; calls for the United  States to pressure the United Nations to take more decisive action with  regards to Burma; and requests a genocide determination regarding the  persecution of the Rohingya.   It is important for the international community to continue to  pressure the military junta to restore democracy for the people of  Burma. The behavior of the Tatmadaw has not and will not change--thus  the need for additional & forceful actions by the United States and  international community to bring justice, accountability, and restore  democracy.   I remain committed to continuing to work with the Biden  administration and my colleagues in Congress to ensure that the United  States and international response to the military coup is coordinated  and targeted to have a strong impact on those responsible, while also  encouraging a peaceful transition of power back to the civilian  government. I continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Burma  and condemn the ongoing violence against them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is an honor to speak in support of the  John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to protect the voting rights  of all Americans.
