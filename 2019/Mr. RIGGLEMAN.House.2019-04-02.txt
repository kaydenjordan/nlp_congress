 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  University of Virginia Cavaliers, who advanced to the Final Four of the  NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament last Saturday night.   Down three points with less than 6 seconds left, the Cavaliers, with  what was one of the most exciting plays I have seen--because I am an  alum--scored to tie the game and force overtime. This gave them an  extra 5 minutes of life, an opportunity they seized, on the way to a  historic victory.   It is as a proud alum that I congratulate Coach Tony Bennett and the  team on reaching the program's first Final Four since 1984. A  tremendous accomplishment for sure, but there is still business to  attend to on the court.   I also wish the Cavaliers the best of luck this weekend. For sure, I  will be here again in short order after they beat Auburn and win the  National Championship game.   Go Hoos, and Wahoowa.                            ____________________
