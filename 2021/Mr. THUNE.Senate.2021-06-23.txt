 Mr. President, today I recognize Isaiah Lee, an  intern in my Rapid City, SD, office, for all of the hard work he has  done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota over the past  several weeks.   Isaiah is a graduate of Roosevelt High School in Sioux Falls, SD.  Currently, he is attending Northwestern College in Orange City, IA,  where he is majoring in political science. He is a hard worker who has  been dedicated to getting the most out of his internship experience.   I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Isaiah for all of the  fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the years to  come.                            ____________________
