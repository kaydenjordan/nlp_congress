 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania, a  great member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.   I want to express my disappointment with the inclusion of a partisan  auto safety title in this legislation before us today. I hope the  Senate is listening and sees that this does not represent a consensus,  since this product completely bypassed the Energy and Commerce  Committee.   We even agreed in April to circulate a draft safety title to  stakeholders with our majority counterparts; drafts, I would add, that  were largely written by them. But, sadly, they walked away from their  own proposals, completely ignoring minority and stakeholder concerns,  and bypassed regular order altogether.   One could only surmise that the directive came straight from the  majority leadership.   And for what? To snatch defeat from the jaws of a bipartisan victory?   The National Federation of the Blind even supported an amendment I  drafted, with their input, to increase transportation access and  benefits for Americans with disabilities. The Rules Committee voted not  to make it in order. It is truly puzzling that a vote for this  previously bipartisan initiative would fall victim to such partisan  politics.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this legislation. We need to get  back to the table and deliver for those who are left behind by this  partisan bill.
