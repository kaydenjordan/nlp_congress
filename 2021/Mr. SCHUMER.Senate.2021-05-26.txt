 Mr. President, we were greeted this morning by some very  sad news, that our former colleague Senator John Warner of Virginia had  passed away at the age of 94.   A five-term Senator, he was a consummate public servant, a consensus  builder, an authority on military affairs--one of the last World War II  veterans to serve in this Chamber. And he actually interrupted his law  school studies to join the Marine Corps during the Korean war. The kind  of stature that he had, his great, great reaching across the aisle in  bipartisanship is something this Chamber misses, and we miss him.   At my request, the flags around the Senate side of the U.S. Capitol  will be lowered to half-staff in his honor.   On behalf of the Senate, I want to express our condolences to his  family and his friends and our gratitude for his amazing service to  America throughout his life.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on the competition act, the Senate  today will continue work on the bipartisan U.S. Innovation and  Competition Act, legislation that will supercharge American innovation  and preserve our competitive edge, not just for the next few years but  for generations to come. It will be true that our children and even our  grandchildren will benefit from this legislation.   Right now, this legislation doesn't get the big focus of the press-- A, because it is bipartisan; there aren't too many clashes; B, because  it is positive; and, C, because it is long term. It won't have an  immediate effect tomorrow, but it will have a profound effect 3, 4, 5  years from now and generations after.   So it is really important legislation. I think it is one of the most  important things this Chamber has done in a very long time. And the  hallmark of the bill has been its bipartisanship. It pulls together  bipartisan legislation from no  [[Page S3468]]  fewer than six Senate committees and includes the input of nearly every  Member of the Senate. The vote tallies you are seeing on this bill are  from another era, maybe the John Warner era--24 to 4 in the Commerce  Committee, 21 to 1 in Foreign Relations. The Senate, as a whole, voted  to proceed to the bill by 86 to 11.   And the process here on the floor is no less bipartisan. I have heard  it from Members on both sides of the aisle: Let's try to do regular  order. Let's get on the floor and do amendments the way we used to.   Well, we are doing just that. We have already considered 10  amendments--more than I can remember in a long time--8 of which were  led by Republicans. So it is hardly that the Democratic majority is  only doing what we want. Three Republican amendments were adopted by  voice vote last night. I mean, who would have ever thought that the  Senate would adopt an amendment from Senator Rand Paul by voice vote?  We did it.   So, look, we are moving forward in a very bipartisan way. We will  consider at least another three amendments of the bill today, and if  both sides continue in good faith to schedule amendment votes and  debate, and there are no eleventh-hour decisions to delay or obstruct,  there is no reason we can't finish this bill by the end of the week.  That is my intention.   Taking a step back, the depth of bipartisanship on this bill reveals  two things. One, Members want to work together if given a chance. This  bill came through the regular order. Senate committees drove the  process, and here on the floor, Members have participated in robust  debate and a robust amendment process. But, second, and maybe even more  importantly, it reveals that Democrats and Republicans are united in  our efforts to preserve and maintain American leadership on the world  stage.   We all know that investing in sciences, innovation, and technology  holds the key to our future--the key. It has been one of the great  hallmarks of America from 1950 on, maybe even earlier, from Thomas  Edison on, maybe even earlier than that. But today--today--we have let  that lag. We became far too complacent. The United States commits less  than 1 percent of its GDP toward basic science research--1 percent.  That is the fault of government, but it is also the fault of the  private sector. The world is so competitive, and global competition is  so severe. Companies feel they can't invest as much in the kind of  research that might payoff profits 5 or 10 years down the road.   So while all this is happening, the Chinese Communist Party spends  nearly 2.5 percent on research and has pledged to the world that they  will increase scientific investments by 10 percent in the future. If  that happens unchallenged, the days of America leading the world in  science and innovation, the days of America being the leading economic  power of the world will be over, and we will regret it and look back 10  or 20 years from now and say: Why the heck didn't we do this? It was so  simple and easy.   But we have to.   I heard my friend from Illinois, Senator Durbin, say that in 1990,  the United States produced 37 percent of the world's semiconductors--a  technology we invented. Today, we produce less than 12 percent, and it  is going down. Some have predicted--many have predicted--that at this  rate, we will produce less than 6 percent of them a few years from now.  If we don't step up our game right now, we will fall behind the rest of  the world.   That is what this legislation is ultimately about--righting the ship,  investing in science and tech, so we can outinnovate, outproduce, and  outcompete the world in the industries of the future, some of which we  know and some of which we don't even know, but we know that scientific  investment will produce them. And if we are at the forefront of this,  we will have America continue to be the leader in these new  technologies yet unimagined.   Around the globe, authoritarian governments smell blood in the water.  They believe that squabbling democracies like ours can't come together  and invest in national priorities the way a top-down, centralized, and  authoritarian government can. They are rooting for us to fail so they  can grab the mantle of global economic leadership and own innovations  that will define the next century. We cannot--we cannot--we must not  let that happen. I do not believe we will let it happen.   The bipartisan--the strongly bipartisan--work on this competition  bill has revealed that in this Chamber we still believe--Democrats and  Republicans alike, united and moving forward--that another American  century lies on the horizon.   Let's move forward. Let's finish our work and pass the U.S.  Innovation and Competition Act as soon as possible, certainly before  the end of the month this week.                            ____________________     On another matter, the January 6 Commission. Last night,  I filed cloture on the House-passed legislation to create an  independent Commission and report on the events of January 6.   There is an obvious and urgent need to establish such a Commission.  What happened on January 6 was a travesty, the culmination of months of  deliberate lies about our elections, propagated by the former  President, a dishonest man, and his allies.   The Capitol was breached for the first time since the War of 1812.  Capitol Police officers were brutalized. One was killed in the attack.  I shouldn't need to remind this Chamber of the scene on January 6. We  were all there. At one point, I was within 20 feet of these White  supremacist hooligans.   That day continues to haunt us. Faith in our elections, in our  democracy has nosedived. Listen to this. In a variety of polls, more  than half of the Republican Party believes the election was rigged and  Joe Biden isn't the real President. That is a flashing red warning sign  for our democracy. If the American people, if a large chunk of them  believe the Big Lie, if the majority of Americans believe that our  elections are not on the level, we are on the road to ruin. This grand,  beautiful, wonderful, several-century-old democracy could teeter when  people don't believe it is fair, when people don't believe the  elections are on the level.   All the fighting in the past, all the internecine fighting--I can't  remember a moment in history where people doubted the veracity of our  elections. They may not have liked the outcome, but they believed they  were on the level. We stop believing that and, believe me, it will  spread. One side will feel that way one day and then the other side  will feel that way the next day, and then nobody will believe in this  democracy.   But right now, unfortunately, there is a lack of courage from the  other side when it comes to defeating these lies. Down the hall, House  Republicans have started to make ridiculous claims about January 6-- defending the mob, blaming antifa for the attack, pretending the entire  event was just a peaceful protest.   Congresswoman Cheney, a brave woman, was literally fired for saying  that Joe Biden is President--for just saying the simple fact that Joe  Biden is President.   We need an independent, trusted, bipartisan Commission now more than  ever. It is critically important to establish a trusted record of  events and begin to restore faith in our democracy. And I think our  Republican colleagues know it or at least they used to because over the  last few months, a funny thing has happened. Our Senate Republican  colleagues have gone from mostly supporting the idea of an independent  Commission to mostly opposing one. And they can't seem to get their  story straight.   Over the weekend, one Senate Republican told a national news program  that it was ``too early'' to establish a Commission on January 6, even  though more than 5 months have gone by. Another Republican Senator  worried the Commission's work would end up ``dragging on  indefinitely.''   Which is it, too early, too late? Of course, both concerns are silly.  There is no justification for a waiting period, and the legislation  itself includes a firm deadline for the Commission to issue a report no  later than December 31 of this year.   One Republican said that he wouldn't vote for a January 6 Commission  ``until it was bipartisan.'' Of course, the legislation we are talking  about  [[Page S3469]]  was negotiated by the Republican ranking member on the House Homeland  Security Committee, the committee of jurisdiction; House Democrats  accepted every change requested by the House Republican leadership; and  the bill received 35 votes in the House and, likely, a lot more if  House leadership didn't flip their position at the last minute.   Despite the pressure of Donald Trump to go along with his Big Lie,  35--35--House Republicans voted to go forward. They are brave, should  be commended, and it shows that this truly is a national need, a  bipartisan national need.   Another Republican Senator, in worried tones, said the January 6  Commission should be more like the 9/11 Commission and be chaired by  outside independent investigators appointed by both parties. Hello. I  hate to break it to my Republican colleagues, but the legislation  passed by the House is modeled after the 9/11 Commission and, you  guessed it, would be chaired by outside independent personnel appointed  by both parties. They say they want that in the bill. It is in the  bill.   So what is really going on here? Why the various, shifting reasons  why Republicans can't support a simple bipartisan, down-the-middle, 50- 50 Commission to report on a very serious event in our Nation's  history?   Well, it seems the real reason has nothing to do with the structure  of the Commission, nothing to do with the details of the bill. It all  has to do with politics. According to POLITICO this morning, the  Republican leader, Senator McConnell, told his Members behind closed  doors that ``regardless of tweaks to the bill . . . approving the  Commission could hurt the party's midterm election message.''    Again, that is a quote from a report in POLITICO magazine or POLITICO  newsletter--whatever POLITICO is. Let me repeat that. According to this  report, the Republican leader of the Senate opposes any independent  inquiry into the January 6 insurrection because he is worried the truth  could hurt the Republicans politically.   Look, I am sorry if an independent Commission to study an attack on  our democracy isn't the Republican ad maker's idea of a good time. This  is too important--too important.   We cannot let the Big Lie fester. We cannot let faith in our  elections continue to erode. We must get at the truth and restore  Americans' confidence in this beautiful, noble, ongoing experiment in  democracy.   The Senate will vote on the Commission. I hope our Republican  colleagues rise to the occasion.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     As if in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that  the Senate vitiate the previous action on Executive Calendar No. 135.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res 245, submitted earlier  today.    I further ask that the resolution be agreed to, the  preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, May 27; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that upon the conclusion  of morning business, the Senate resume consideration of Calendar No.  58, S. 1260.    Madam President, let me just say that we are making very  good progress. We had a whole bunch of amendments again tonight. We  have had more amendments on this bill than on any bill I can recall in  a very long  [[Page S3546]]  time. We have cooperated with the minority and given them many  different amendments, and we have had good debate. This is how the  Senate can function when we work in a bipartisan way and agree to work  together, and I hope we can have an amiable conclusion tomorrow.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the filing  deadline for second-degree amendments be 10:30 a.m. with respect to the  cloture motions filed on S. 1260.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the provisions of S. Res. 245 as a further mark of respect to the  late David Gambrell, former Senator from Georgia.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 11:01 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, May 27, 2021, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
