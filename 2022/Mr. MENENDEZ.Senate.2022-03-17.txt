 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION       United Kingdom--Ballistic Missile Defense Radar (BMDR) and           Command and Control Battle Management and Communications           (C2BMC)        The Government of the United Kingdom (UK) has requested to       buy one (1) Ballistic Missile Defense Radar (BMDR); and two       (2) Command and Control Battle Management and Communications       (C2BMC) user nodes (with network capability required to       connect to the C2BMC System to support radar operations).       Also included are design and construction of a combined       radar-equipment shelter; encryption devices, secure       communication equipment, and other required COMSEC equipment       to support radar operations; spare and repair parts, support       and testing equipment, publications and technical       documentation, personnel training and training equipment,       U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical and       logistics support services, and other related elements of       logistical and program support. The total estimated program       cost is $700 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals       and national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a NATO Ally that is a force for       political stability and economic progress in Europe.        The proposed sale will improve UK's ability to meet current       and future ballistic missile threats to the UK and NATO by       improving the effectiveness of NATO BMD systems. The United       Kingdom will have no difficulty absorbing the BMD Radar into       its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin,       Moorestown, NJ. There are no known offset agreements proposed       in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale may require the       assignment of approximately 15 U.S. Government and up to 100       contractor representatives to the UK, at any given time,       during the construction, installation, integration and       testing of the BMDR and C2BMC capability.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 22-10       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The United Kingdom (UK) Ballistic Missile Defense Radar       (BMDR) is a scaled version of the U.S. Long Range       Discrimination Radar. It will provide continuous and precise       tracking and discrimination of missile threats, persistent       long-range midcourse discrimination, precision tracking and       hit assessment. Discrimination is a critical capability of       missile defense, which will provide data to distinguish       lethal objects from debris and decoys around the lethal       object. The UK will use the Command and Control, Battle       Management, and Communications (C2BMC) system to integrate       the UK BMDR. This will improve the effectiveness of North       Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) missile defenses.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems, which might reduce system effectiveness       or be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that the United Kingdom       can provide substantially the same degree of protection for       the sensitive technology being released as the U.S.       Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S.       foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in       the Policy Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of the United Kingdom.                            ____________________
