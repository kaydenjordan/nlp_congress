 Mr. Speaker, think of this: Doesn't it feel like it  was just yesterday the Federal Reserve Chairman was telling us we were  in the Goldilocks economy? The wage growth for the working poor was the  best in modern economic times.   I will argue we need to find a path back to that. That economic  growth was moral. It was an amazing thing. Good things were happening.  And then we hit this black swan.   This is ripping my heart out because there are things in this bill  that just don't belong there. I consider them--well, I can't say that  word in front of a microphone. We all have these moments in our  political lives where we walk up in front of this microphone and we are  going to say: I am going to have to vote for something that has things  in it that break my heart.   But we must do the right thing. We must get back to that economic  growth. We must get back to that prosperity that was enveloping this  country. And, hopefully, we will look back, do a great postmortem,  understand the things we did wrong, and fix them in the future.                                time  1120
