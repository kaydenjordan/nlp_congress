 Mr. Speaker, my, my, my. My colleagues  across the aisle say we have a short memory. We don't have a short  memory. This has seemed like an eternity over the last 2 years. We had  no idea, as a nation, that this much injury could be brought upon our  country in this short period of time.   H.R. 2 is the strongest border security package that has ever been  brought to the floor in this body. Why has the majority party, the  Republicans that were elected to power by the American people last  year, drafted this bill over the course of the last year carefully and  strategically? Because we are responding to the total collapse of our  sovereignty at the southern border brought upon America by my  colleagues across the aisle.   If you want more of what you see on the TV today, then by all means  America can support my Democratic colleagues and their policies because  those are the policies that have brought this disaster upon our Nation.  H.R. 2 addresses it aggressively.   Our southern border is no longer a sovereign border wherein America  controls the northern portion and Mexico controls the southern. It is  now a theater of engagement controlled by the cartels. H.R. 2 corrects  it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand  in support of H.R. 2 because it addresses aggressively the injury that  our Nation suffers brought upon us by weak, disastrous policies out of  the Democratic executive branch, the White House, and Democratic  majority control for the last 4 years.   Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support of H.R. 2.
