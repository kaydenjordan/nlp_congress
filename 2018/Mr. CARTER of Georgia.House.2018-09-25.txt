Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the  bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, as the only pharmacist in Congress and a practicing  pharmacist for over 30 years, this issue of an industry forcing the  American people at the pharmacy counter hits incredibly close to home  for me.   Pharmacy benefit managers, also known as PBMs, have put forth  restrictions that debase the drug supply chain in the United States.   PBMs have existed for decades, but they have grown through mergers  and acquisitions to be the middlemen for much drug coverage on  formularies.   The hope was that PBMs would reduce administrative burdens and be  able to negotiate drug prices, yet here we are today voting on two  bills to stop them from intentionally defrauding patients. It is  unfortunate that we have even reached the point where there needs to be  a law passed that prohibits this type of behavior.   I appreciate that we are here today voting to sign these two Senate  bills banning gag clauses into law; however, I think these bills could  go further.   My bill, the Prescription Transparency Act, which was introduced  earlier this year, deemed any contract containing gag clauses null and  void. Furthermore, it applied to every single insured patient. And it  not only ensured that patients were notified of the lowest price, but  also of any less expensive generic equivalents that might be available  to the patient.   My other piece of legislation, the Know the Cost Act, not only bans  gag clauses in prescription drug plans for Medicare Advantage, Medicare  part D, and individual and group insurance plans, but also informs  beneficiaries about the consequences of paying out of pocket.   My bill received letters of support from the American Medical  Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the Global Healthy  Living Foundation, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, and  Rite Aid, a clearly diverse group of stakeholders all hoping to lower  the price of prescription drugs.   States around the country have taken action to address gag clauses,  with over 20 States having banned them and countless more considering  it.   While we have worked through these bills, we have seen the wide- ranging impact it has had. We have even heard in a committee hearing  from colleagues like Congresswoman Dingell, who was initially told that  her prescription would be $1,300 but then talked to her pharmacist and  got an equivalent for $40.   I want to repeat that.   We have even heard in a committee hearing from colleagues like  Congresswoman Dingell, who was initially told that her prescription  would be $1,300 but then talked to her pharmacist and got an equivalent  for $40.   The discrepancy in costs should really be a wake-up call for how  formularies are being impacted. Let's get this legislation passed so we  can take on the other issues in this space.   While I am pleased that we are taking these important steps toward  reining in PBMs and drug costs, I think there is still far more work  ahead.   Again, Madam Speaker, I want to thank you for including these bills  on the legislative calendar for today. I sincerely hope that you take  the resounding national support for banning gag clauses in  consideration in the future and allow patients to regain control of  their medical decisions back from multibillion-dollar middlemen.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), the honorable  chairman of the full Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle, and I want to assure them that this is only the beginning of  what we intend to do and what I intend to do to help to lower  prescription drug prices here in America.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank also my colleagues on this side of the  aisle for all of their help. I ask for support of this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I want to mark this as an important day for this  Congress taking real steps to lower the cost of drugs for Americans.   I am proud to have been the lead sponsor for H.R. 6733, the Know the  Cost Act of 2018, a bill that includes the core elements of this bill  and expands patient protections.   Currently, pharmacists are prevented from telling their patients  about a lower cost out-of-pocket option rather than utilizing insurance  coverage. These gag clause provisions are included in provider manuals  and contracts that require broad confidentiality agreements for  pharmacists.   Often, these contracts offered by the pharmacy benefit manager, the  PBM, are a take-it-or-leave-it situation where the pharmacist doesn't  have any other options. If they opt not to take the contract, they are  often left out of servicing large segments of the patient market.   Gag clauses can come in many forms, such as confidentiality  agreements between pharmacists and plan sponsors, nondisparagement  clauses, and even prohibitions on contacting sponsors, the media, and  elected officials. As a result, pharmacists cannot have a transparent  relationship with their patients or provide them necessary information  that could help guide their best treatment options.   Senator Stabenow's bill, the Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018, bans  these types of gag clauses in Medicare Advantage drug plans. Although  this bill does not contain requirements for beneficiary notification  that my bill, the Know the Cost Act of 2018, included, it is still an  important step forward.   Banning gag clauses has received national support from State  legislatures, both Chambers of Congress, HHS, and the President.   As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I know all too  well about the constraints placed on pharmacists as part of the take- it-or-leave-it contracts, where the pharmacist has no other option if  they want to continue providing care for their patients in their  community.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  for their help in bringing this legislation forward. I particularly  thank Chairman Burgess. Also, a shout-out to our staff, who has done an  outstanding job of bringing this all together.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.
