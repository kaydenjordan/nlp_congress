 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of  Walter Turnbow, who passed away on September 9 at the age of 95. Walter  was a longtime leader in northwest Arkansas and truly represented what  it meant to put the needs of others above one's own.   Walter Turnbow served on the Springdale Industrial Commission,  Springdale Public Facilities board, Beaver Water District board, and  the Springdale Water and Sewer Commission. In addition to these  positions, he also served on the Springdale School Board, Northwest  Arkansas Community Care Foundation, and the Arkansas State Board of  Education.   He dedicated his life to public service and the education system in  Springdale. While serving on the water and sewer commission, he oversaw  the construction of what was, at that time, the State's largest water  tank. This proved to be a forward-thinking decision since the city's  continued growth would require greater infrastructure investment.  Because of Walter's leadership, Springdale was prepared for the changes  and completed the project without having to borrow money.   Walter saw education as the gateway to a better future for his  community. In 2006, the Springdale School District honored his  contributions to the community and the school board by naming an  elementary school after him. He often visited the school to meet with  students and read to them. In addition to the elementary school, other  sites and meeting spaces in the Springdale community have also been  named in his honor, a testament to his very real impact and incredible  legacy.   As one of Springdale's most well-known public servants, he touched  the lives of everyone in the community. From overseeing economic  development to ensuring a quality education for everyone, Walter  Turnbow left a mark on the community of Springdale that no one will  soon forget. I extend my condolences to his loved ones and the entire  Springdale community and pray that future leaders will follow his  remarkable example.                            ____________________
