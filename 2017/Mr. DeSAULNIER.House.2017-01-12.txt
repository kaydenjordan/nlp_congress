 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment to the SEC  Regulatory Accountability Act in a spirit of cooperation. It is most  important for the integrity of the SEC, for the investor community, for  the entire U.S. population, and indeed for the economic benefit of the  United States that integrity and transparency are paramount. So this  amendment strengthens the bill, I believe, on behalf of the American  investor as well as industry by reaffirming transparency as a core  principle of efficient markets and places public service ahead of  personal gain.   By requiring the head of the SEC and his immediate family members to  divest themselves of all securities connected to the financial  institutions regulated by the agency, we reinforce investor confidence  that agency decisions are driven by market forces, not the portfolio of  the Chair.   Mr. Chairman, the power and stability of U.S. markets rely on the  fundamental belief that the system is transparent and fair. Anything  that causes investors to question the integrity of the U.S. markets,  including lack of information or opaqueness of information, will  necessarily hurt our markets and make capital formation more difficult.   The SEC plays a critical role in promoting adequate transparency.  Requiring the SEC Chairperson to cut financial ties with institutions  that the SEC oversees is a commonsense protection of the agency's  credibility and improvement to the underlying bill in my belief.   I hope my Republican colleagues agree and will support this amendment  that puts public service ahead of potential personal gain.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I honestly respect the tutorial, but,  with all due respect, I do think that this amendment complements the  existing rules and protects the investors.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Mr. Chairman, with all due respect, I really think  this is, as intended, a commonsense amendment. I do think it  complements rather than adds on to the existing requirements to protect  investors. And I really think this House, with all due respect, would  want to see the markets work efficiently. We also want to ensure that  the integrity of those markets and the investors are also strengthened.  So I think transparency in this case with the acknowledgment that there  are other already existing regulations and the belief that this  amendment complements those, I would ask for the House's support.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
