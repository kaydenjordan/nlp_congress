 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage all of us to stay  committed to reforming the Federal budget and appropriations process.   Here we are, operating under a continuing resolution and scrambling  to adopt another, our third of fiscal year 2019 alone. Despite good  work being done to fund 5 of the 12 annual appropriations bills, after  2\1/2\ months and two continuing resolutions, our work remains  unfinished.   Mr. Speaker, the power of the purse is the most important  constitutional responsibility granted to Congress, yet we have  regularly and repeatedly ceded our duty to fulfill this essential role.  It is unacceptable, and it is clear that the Federal budget and  appropriations process is broken. The American people deserve better.   As you know, the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations  Process Reform laid the groundwork for bipartisan, bicameral reform  this past year. Our proposal began taking steps in the right direction  to improve the process. While our efforts were unsuccessful, where we  stand today highlights just how desperately our work was needed. It,  Mr. Speaker, is now more necessary than ever.   I will continue to champion budget process reform and the ideas put  forth by the joint select committee next year. Today, I sent a Dear  Colleague letter outlining our year of work, which I include in the  Record.   I encourage all Members to review it and join me in this essential  effort. We owe the American people this process. Let's fix this.        Dear Colleague: In the Second Session of the 115th       Congress, I was honored to Co-Chair the Joint Select       Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform. As       members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Article I       entrusts in each of us the power of the purse. This is an       awesome responsibility that I, and I know each of you, take       very seriously. We owe it to the American people to have a       process that works, and that was the goal of the Joint Select       Committee--to produce recommendations to reform the federal       budget and appropriations process.        As you know, our Joint Select Committee produced a       bipartisan, bicameral consensus package of reforms in advance       of our statutory deadline of November 30, 2018. During our       markup, amendments were subjected to a supermajority       threshold to ensure those that passed reflected a true       consensus of the panel. Some amendments passed unanimously.       During the final debate on the bill, many members indicated       that they had no objection to the package's underlying       reforms. However, the bill and report developed over many       months of hard work failed to secure the necessary       supermajority of votes to pass under our Joint Select       Committee's rules.        Despite the unfortunate outcome of the Joint Select       Committee's work, there is no refuting that the federal       budget process is broken. It is vital that Congress continues       these efforts to reform the budget and appropriations process       this year, next year, and in the years beyond. I have       assembled in this Budget Committee print all the relevant       materials to this year's work. I urge all Members to review       this information. In this Committee print, you will find:        The report of the Joint Select Committee on Budget and       Appropriations Process Reform;        The Co-chair's mark, as amended, and voted on, by the Joint       Select Committee;        The votes of the Joint Select Committee;        Hearing transcripts of the Joint Select Committee's five       public hearings; Congressional Budget Office briefing       materials prepared for the Joint Select Committee;        Congressional Research Service briefing materials prepared       for the Joint Select Committee;        H.R. 7191--a bill introduced in the House by myself and       Representative Yarmuth, a Joint Select Committee Member and       Ranking Member of the House Budget Committee; and        The press release to accompany the introduction of H.R.       7191.        It is my sincere hope that this important work will       continue in the 116th Congress on a bipartisan and bicameral       basis. I believe Members of Congress, Executive Branch       officials, outside budget experts and academics, as well as       engaged citizens, will find this material useful for future       reform efforts.        I would like to thank the Members of the Joint Select       Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform, our       hardworking staffs, particularly Dan Keniry, David Reich, and       Mary Popadiuk, as well as the House Rules Committee staff,       Bob Weinhagen and Tom Cassidy in the Office of Legislative       Counsel, budget experts at the Congressional Research Service       and the Congressional Budget Office--particularly Mark Hadley       and Teri Gullo--and House Parliamentarian Tom Wickham and his       office, for the year of dedication.        If you have any questions or would like additional       information, please contact Dan Keniry, Staff Director of the       House Budget  [[Page H10322]]       Committee or Mary Popadiuk, General Counsel of the House       Budget Committee.                                                      Steve Womack,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget.                            ____________________
