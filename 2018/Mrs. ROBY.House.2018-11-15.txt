 Mr. Speaker, just over a month ago, Hurricane Michael, the  third most powerful hurricane to ever make landfall on the United  States mainland, ravaged areas of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia.  Hundreds of Americans lost everything, and more than 30 people were  killed.   Hurricane Michael appears to have done its worst in Panama City,  Florida, and nearby areas, but Alabama's Second District was also badly  impacted in several counties in the Wiregrass Region. In fact,  Hurricane Michael is the most powerful storm to ever hit Houston  County, according to recorded history.   In my district, the agricultural community faces the most significant  devastation. While the full scale of the damage to local agriculture is  still being assessed, Hurricane Michael dealt a terrible blow to our  cotton, timber, and peanut farmers.   In the aftermath of the storm, I traveled to the Wiregrass several  times to be with our farmers and to see firsthand what they were  experiencing. The devastation is heartbreaking, to say the least. The  farmers in southeast Alabama are in the midst of a very real crisis.    In Alabama's Second District, agriculture is the backbone of our  economy. Throughout my time in Congress, I have made it a priority to  fight for our farmers of all commodities. Their work to provide the  food and fiber we depend on is vitally important. I will continue to  advocate for them, especially during this time of uncertainty, as we  work to put the pieces back together for these hardworking men and  women who have suffered tremendous loss to their livelihoods.   Mr. Speaker, I want the people I represent to know that my office  stands ready to help during this challenging time. I will work with my  colleagues here in Congress to provide the proper resources and  assistance to our farmers. We must get this right, and we must ensure  Alabama's farmers are included in all recovery efforts.   I encourage anyone in Alabama's Second District who needs assistance  in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael to contact one of my offices  today. My staff and I work for you, and we are committed to ensuring  that the folks impacted know the options available to them.   As we work through this season of rebuilding, I have been encouraged  to see and hear about so many acts of kindness and charity in our  district and throughout the Southeast. This time of recovery will not  be easy, but if we continue to help each other in whatever ways we are  able, we will get through this together.                            ____________________
