 I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleague from  Maine, whose amazing work as chair of the Aging Committee continues to  inspire me.   I also rise to share a story that is very personal to me. It is a  story about one of the smartest people whom I have known, my  grandmother Katherine, whom I was named after. She was the daughter of  an Italian immigrant and his Italian-American wife. She was exactly the  kind of person you think of when you think of an Italian grandmother.  If you have ever had one, you know that she loves to feed people and  invite the whole family--aunts, uncles, cousins, everyone--over to her  house for dinner on Sunday nights. The other 6 days of the week, she  worked on volunteer projects throughout Las Vegas with her sorority,  Beta Sigma Phi.   She never graduated from college, but she was a leader in our  community, and she was always reading. If you walked into her house, it  was full of books. In fact, the first thing that you saw when you  walked into her house was, on one wall, floor to ceiling, a bookcase  with all of the books that she had read.   She was brilliant. She was one of my greatest inspirations. Her work  in our community in Las Vegas is one of the reasons that I decided to  pursue a career in public service.   Unfortunately, in the 1990s, my grandmother was diagnosed with  Alzheimer's disease. At first, you could barely notice a difference.  There were small things, things that could happen to anyone--lost keys,  mismatched socks, books left in odd places. Then a woman who had spent  her entire life loving to cook for her family and grandchildren had  suddenly stopped cooking.   Over the next 10 years, she got progressively worse. We could see the  changes in her every single day, but our lives changed too. My  grandfather became her caregiver. My mother became her caregiver. My  aunt became her caregiver. My cousins and I and my sister all became  caregivers. That is what happens when someone is diagnosed. It does not  affect just one person; it affects an entire family.   There is a common misconception that people who are suffering from  Alzheimer's are not aware of what they are losing, that their memories  are gone but not missed. That was not the case for my grandmother. I do  not think it is the case for anyone who is struggling with this  disease. My grandmother frequently had these moments of clarity when it  was clear that the losses were just as painful for her as they were for  all of us.   One thing that happens to many people with Alzheimer's is that they  tend to wander. They wander away from home or they get lost. She had  had one of those moments of clarity after she had wandered away from  home one day, and the entire family had spent an afternoon looking for  her in our neighborhood. My aunt and I had found her and had gone to  pick her up in a car. I will never forget it, as I sat in the back seat  while my aunt drove.   My grandmother, who had been seated on the front passenger's side,  asked my aunt: Why am I doing this? Why am I in my housecoat and  slippers? Why am I doing this?   My aunt looked at her and she said: Mom, you are sick. You have  something they call Alzheimer's, and that means that it is impacting  your brain and your memories, and you are forgetting.   We were so powerless. We couldn't do anything but make her  comfortable and bring her home.   For many, many families who are dealing with Alzheimer's, they have  gone through those same moments--those moments when they are dealing  with their loved ones either trying to explain to them what is  happening or giving them comfort because they know their memories are  gone, and they want to make sure they are giving them the comfort they  need and they deserve.   We know, unfortunately, that there is no cure for Alzheimer's. My  grandmother passed away, as many people with Alzheimer's do, when her  illness got so bad that she lost the ability to eat or drink, but the  experience of caring for my grandmother opened my eyes to the true  impact of this disease. I saw that when one person is diagnosed, whole  families' lives are transformed too. I think about my grandmother every  day. Every day, I return to some piece of wisdom or guidance that she  shared with me. I am committed now to honoring her memory by fighting  to prevent Alzheimer's and to provide caregivers with the support they  need and deserve.   When my grandmother was first diagnosed, we did not understand  Alzheimer's like we do today. We did not have enough healthcare  programs for it or support for the caregivers. It was seen as an  individual disease that struck at random, with no cure and no hope.  Although there is still no cure, we know now that there are things that  we can do to help to keep the brain healthy longer and possibly reduce  the risk of Alzheimer's and that there are things that we can do now to  promote prevention.   For those who are already living with Alzheimer's and for their  caregivers, like my family was for my grandmother, there are things  that we can do to dramatically improve their experiences and to help  lessen some of that burden. Today there are things we can do to invest  in finding that cure for Alzheimer's. It is just a petri dish away, but  we have to believe that it is there and that we can continue and  support that investment. I have visited the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain  Health in Las Vegas and met with its director, Dr. Jeffrey Cummings. I  have seen the incredible work they have done, including their methods  for the early detection of Alzheimer's, which simply did not exist only  a few years ago. Yet education in the community and the spreading of  best practices still lag behind.   There is no longer any doubt that this is a public health crisis.  That is why I am so grateful and proud to be sitting on a committee and  working with a chairwoman, my colleague from Maine, who has made an  effort here in Congress to really bring attention to Alzheimer's  disease and to help to fight for funding and investment in a cure.   I am proud to join my colleagues from Maine, West Virginia, and  Virginia in introducing legislation that is known as the BOLD  Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act. This bill will create Centers of  Excellence that will be dedicated to promoting effective interventions  and educating the public on Alzheimer's disease, cognitive decline, and  brain health. It will provide grants to State and local health  departments to build the infrastructure that is necessary to address  this public health crisis, and it will collect the data that is  necessary to keep pushing the frontiers of what we know about this  disease.   I urge my colleagues to support this vital, bipartisan piece of  legislation that has the potential of having a positive impact on  millions of Americans across this country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleague from  Maine, whose amazing work as chair of the Aging Committee continues to  inspire me.
