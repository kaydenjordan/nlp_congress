 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the tireless  dedication of one of New Jersey's greatest Alzheimer's awareness  advocates, Jeannie Castells of Lambertville, Hunterdon County.   Jeannie has served as a congressional ambassador for the Alzheimer's  Association since 2014, meeting with Members of Congress here on  Capitol Hill, holding educational events in which I have participated  in Congressional District Seven, and organizing fundraisers like the  Walk to End Alzheimer's.   Unfortunately, Jeannie's advocacy does not come without tragedy  because the disease has claimed the lives of both her mother and her  husband.   And Jeannie's family is not alone, Mr. Speaker. Alzheimer's is the  Nation's sixth leading cause of death. More than 5 million Americans  are currently living with Alzheimer's, and as many as 16 million  Americans are estimated to have Alzheimer's by 2050.   That is why in June, Alzheimer's Awareness Month, I urge advocates  around the country, like Jeannie, to continue to fight for Alzheimer's  research funding. We are on the verge of a breakthrough, and with your  help, we will certainly find one.  [[Page H5058]]                                ____________________
