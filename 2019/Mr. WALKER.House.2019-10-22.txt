 Before they identified the crime, Madam Speaker, the  Democrats organized the firing squad. Before anyone was talking about  Ukraine, over half of the Democratic majority was in favor of  impeachment.   In fact, this process didn't begin with Ukraine or a whistleblower,  this sham impeachment process started year one of President Trump's  administration when a Democrat colleague stated, ``. . . if we don't  impeach this President he will get reelected.''   Hatred for President Trump has become the new religion of the radical  left, creating an irrational behavior, not rooted in good judgment, but  rather in emotion.   The Democrats are protecting Adam Schiff, as seen by yesterday's  censure vote. This was not, and is not, about the facts. Facing your  accusers and ``innocent until proven guilty'' used to be the American  way.   It is the basic standard that every American should expect, including  the President. Being targeted by an angry mob, a willing media machine,  and a twisted version of democracy.   The President calls this a witch hunt. Unfortunately, it looks like  that is exactly what it is.                            ____________________
