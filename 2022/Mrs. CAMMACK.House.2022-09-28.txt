 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the previous  question so that we can immediately consider H.R. 6184, the HALT  Fentanyl Act.   Before I begin, I have to address something that was said just now. I  am the wife of a first responder. My husband sees these overdoses every  single day.   In my community, in just this year, we have apprehended bricks of  fentanyl stamped with border cartels' stamps on them. We know it is  coming from the border. We know it is being trafficked across, both in  trucks at ports of entry but also illegally. We know this to be a fact,  and if we do not secure the border this will continue to happen.   I will say, as the wife of a first responder, someone whose husband  has continually responded to these calls and is reviving people who  have been poisoned by fentanyl, it is not a matter of if he, himself,  overdoses, it is when. And that is going to be a very bad day because I  think that Members of this Chamber need to be held responsible for the  open border policies that this administration continues to allow. But I  digress.   Mr. Speaker, 108,000. That is the number of Americans who died from  drug overdoses last year. Of those, more than 80,000 were connected to  opioids. The lion's share of those opioid deaths were linked to  fentanyl.   Now, it is important that we remember that these numbers are actually  people. They are mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters,  aunts, uncles. They are people. Not statistics. They are humans. They  represent millions of families who will never see their son, daughter,  husband, wife, brother, sister, father ever again. Millions of people  whose families have been shattered and feel helpless, broken, and angry  as these horrific substances destroyed their communities and their  family.   These thousands of victims represent communities crushed by this  epidemic, swept away by the flood of lethal substances that are ripping  apart the fabric of our society. These thousands of people lost lay  bare the denial, the weakness, and the lack of compassion that this  administration and my colleagues across the aisle have shown through  their ambivalence toward border security, our Nation's security, as  literally tons of fentanyl is trucked and walked across the southern  border and into our communities.   A few months ago, a mother from my district cried in my office as she  talked about her beautiful daughter, Mackenzie, who died from fentanyl  poisoning, not overdosing, poisoning, after taking what she thought was  a Xanax. She was 28 years old.   Now, unfortunately, Mackenzie's story is not unique. It is not rare.  Her mother, Rebecca, is now dedicating her life to saving mothers  across the country from the pain that she has endured from a  preventable loss and their daughters from Mackenzie's fate.                                time  1830    To my colleagues on the left, you control this Chamber, so it is up  to you to decide. How many more Mackenzies have to die before you will  take action?   You can pretend that there is no crisis at the border. We see that.  That is evidenced in your remarks. But we know that is a lie. You visit  any community in this country, and you will see that it has been  ravaged by the death and destruction wrought by fentanyl. You cannot  deny it. Your constituents know it. The American people know it.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for our colleagues across the aisle to wake  up. So I stand here once again, as I did back in March, fighting  against the horrors of the opioid epidemic that have a stranglehold on  our communities. We once again have an opportunity to take a stand  today, not as Republicans or Democrats but as Americans and concerned  citizens, for those that have lost their lives, but also for those  potentially in the future. The families of those who lost deserve this.   Today is an opportunity to act. Today is an opportunity to put people  above politics. I commend my friend,  [[Page H8177]]  the gentleman from Virginia, for his great work and for sticking with  this bill and seeing it across the finish line.   I urge my colleagues, please, think with your hearts, perhaps in vain  but with hope, to defeat the previous question so that we can  immediately consider this bill, the HALT Fentanyl Act.
