 Mr. Speaker, to Elijah's wonderful wife and my  friend, and to his children and family, we have said over and over  again how much we will miss him, but we realize how much you will miss  him.   Elijah Cummings was my classmate. He came in during a special  election, but we always viewed each other as classmates coming in the  mid-1990s.   His spirit was so strong that he was able to provide his own internal  strength and also to provide strength for others.   I think we knew about Elijah's parents more than anyone else. He  talked about Robert and Ruth Cummings not only as sharecroppers but as  preachers, and he talked about how they poured into his life.   Elijah was a successful man though he started with a designation that  he was slow in school. He was a Phi Beta Kappa, becoming Maryland's  first African American speaker pro temp.                                time  2015    But what I know most about him is that Elijah would not want us to  talk about all of those successes. He probably wouldn't even want us to  talk about his being the powerful chairman of the Oversight and Reform  Committee or talk about his work in criminal justice and ban the box  that we worked together on, or even when he took a whole group of  Members over to Baltimore when he first got elected because of the  scourge of HIV/AIDS. He wanted us to see it; he wanted us to stand with  him; and he wanted to show his community that he was going to fight on  their behalf.   What I love most about Elijah was that he mentored people anywhere he  could find them on the floor of the House. We joined each other in  wanting to mentor to young interns, and every time the Congressional  Black Caucus Foundation called him to speak to the interns--I remember  a time when John, Elijah, and I spoke to the class, and Elijah lifted  them beyond anyone's expression or belief.   Elijah Cummings gave his maiden speech, and I want to give his words  when he first came to the United States Congress. When I saw these, I  said how powerful and potent.   Elijah Cummings said:       I only have a minute,      60 seconds in it.      Forced upon me, I did not choose it,      But I know that I must use it.      Give account if I abuse it,      Suffer, if I lose it.      Only a tiny little minute,      But eternity is in it.    So, as I close my remarks, being reminded that Elijah would not want  us to give his whole litany of success, I began to think of the speech  of Dr. Martin Luther King on the night before his death, when he  reminded people that he wanted to be known as someone who tried to help  someone. He said he feared no man.   When Elijah spoke and worked, and when he worked with Republicans, he  did not fear them, but he brought them to him. He made peace, while he  also fought for justice.   In the words of Dr. King in that last speech, he said: ``When people  get caught up with that which is right and they are willing to  sacrifice for it, there is no stopping point short of victory.''   I believe in this life our dear friend secured real victory for his  people and his constituents, a victory for those who believe in justice  and equality, and a victory for the people of the United States of  America.   So, Elijah, the minute you had, the minute that was given to you, you  did  [[Page H8288]]  not waste it, and you have gained eternity. As Dr. King said, you were  the orchestrator of letting justice roll down like waters and  righteousness like a mighty stream. You were part of that justice and  part of that victory. You didn't stop short. You only had a minute, but  boy what you did do with that.   May God bless your soul, may you be in peace, may you R.I.P., and may  we love you until we meet again.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congressman Horsford of Nevada for  anchoring this Special Order in remembrance of Chairman Elijah  Cummings, the indefatigable champion of justice and equality, the  Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight, the Member of Congress  from the Seventh Congressional District of Maryland since April 16,  1996, and above all, the devoted and beloved son of Baltimore.   Chairman Elijah Cummings died Thursday, October 17, 2019 at Johns  Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland; he was 68 years old.   On behalf of my family and the constituents of the 18th Congressional  District of Texas, I offer my deepest sympathy and prayers to his  family and friends. Mr. Speaker, our friend Elijah Cummings was in  every sense of the word a statesman and a gentleman who believed in  bipartisanship and treated everyone equally and respectfully.   Born January 18, 1951 in Baltimore, Maryland, to Robert and Ruth  Cummings, South Carolina, sharecroppers who followed the Great  Migration north to factory jobs in Baltimore, Elijah Eugene Cummings  was the third of seven children.   After graduating from Baltimore City College High School in 1969,  Elijah Cummings attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., where  he was elected President of the student government and graduated in  1973 with a degree in political science, earning honors as Phi Beta  Kappa.   Mr. Speaker, you may be interested to know that Elijah Cummings went  on to earn a law degree from the University of Maryland School of Law.   Elijah Cummings' matriculation and graduation from the University of  Maryland School of Law was poetic justice because a generation before  it had denied admission to another son of Baltimore, the legendary  Thurgood Marshall, who then went to the Howard University School of Law  and later became the greatest social engineer and the architect and  instrument of the strategy that defeated Jim Crow and toppled de jure  segregation at the University of Maryland School of Law.   Elijah Cummings practiced law for 14 years in Baltimore and in 1982  he was elected to the House of Delegates of the Maryland General  Assembly where he served for 14 years.   In the Maryland General Assembly, he served as Chairman of the  Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and was the first African American  in Maryland history to be named Speaker Pro Tempore, the second highest  position in the House of Delegates, earning a reputation as a champion  of progressive and liberal causes and constituencies and as a skilled  census-builder.   Mr. Speaker, in 1996 when Congressman Kweisi Mfume resigned to assume  the presidency of the United Negro College Fund, Elijah Cummings ran in  and easily won the special election created by the vacancy with 80  percent of the popular vote.   Elijah Cummings was re-elected to the 105th Congress and each of the  succeeding Congresses until his untimely death, never winning with less  than 70 percent of the vote.   In Elijah Cummings' maiden address as a member of Congress he vowed  that he would make use of his limited time in Congress:       I only have a minute.      Sixty seconds in it.      Forced upon me, I did not choose it,      But I know that I must use it.      Give account if I abuse it.      Suffer, if I lose it.      Only a tiny little minute,      But eternity is in it.    Mr. Speaker, Elijah Cummings made good on that prophetic promise from  the start.   As a Member of Congress, Elijah Cummings served on the Committees on  Transportation and Infrastructure and on Oversight and Government  Reform.   As a freshman member, Elijah Cummings championed and supported health  care and labor legislation.   In 2003, Elijah Cummings was elected as Chairman of the Congressional  Black Caucus.   In the 112th Congress, Elijah Cummings was elected by his colleagues  to be Ranking Member of what is now known as the Committee on Oversight  and Reform and in the 115th Congress was appointed by the Democratic  Leader Nancy Pelosi to the Benghazi Committee.   One of my proudest moments was working with Elijah Cummings to secure  passage of H.R. 1076, the Fair Chance Act, which would ``ban the box''  in federal hiring by restricting federal employers and contractors from  asking about the criminal histories of applicants until the conditional  offer stage.   The Fair Chance Act would give formerly incarcerated people a fair  chance at a job and a piece of the American dream.   I was proud to have been able to work with Chairman Elijah Cummings  in support of this legislation and other legislative goals of mutual  interest and concern like reducing gun violence and eliminating unfair  policing in communities of color.   Mr. Speaker, Elijah Cummings dedicated his life to serving and  uplifting others and empowering the people he was sworn to represent;  he was a man for and of the people, going to the streets and ensuring  that their voices were heard.   Elijah Cummings received national attention in 2015 when he walked  the streets of Baltimore, his notable bullhorn in hand, and pleaded for  calm after riots erupted in his neighborhood after the funeral of  Freddie Gray, a young black man who died in police custody.   Elijah Cummings took the issues of his constituents to heart; many of  us recall how he fought for meaning in the death of young Deamonte  Driver, a 12-year-old Maryland boy who died from an untreated tooth  infection.   Elijah Cummings often said that ``our children are the living  messages that we send to a future we will never see'' and was committed  to ensuring that the next generation had access to quality healthcare  and education, clean air and water, and a strong economy defined by  fiscal responsibility.   Elijah Cummings had a servant's heart and was imbued with an ethic of  service and inspired countless numbers of persons fight for their  beliefs.   Unsurpassed was this native of Baltimore's love for his hometown.   That could also be seen by his response to the current President's  belittling Baltimore and his congressional district as a ``disgusting,  rat and rodent infested mess'' to which Elijah Cummings invited the  President to join him in the important work of ensuring that all  Americans had accessible, affordable, high quality health care.   Elijah Cummings' passion was not reserved for his district and the  city of Baltimore; he also deeply loved his country.   As Ranking Member and the Chairman of the House Committee on  Oversight and Reform, Elijah Cummings brought his intellect to what he  called ``the fight for the soul of our democracy.''   Elijah Cummings deeply believed in our democratic system and values  and worked tirelessly to preserve them and exhorted everyone to the  same:   ``When we're dancing with the angels, the question will be asked, in  2019, what did we do to make sure we kept our democracy intact? Did we  stand on the sidelines and say nothing?''   In the words of his widow, Dr. Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, Elijah  Cummings ``worked until his last breath because he believed our  democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective  humanity and that our nation's diversity was our promise, not our  problem.''   Mr. Speaker, the life of Elijah Cummings is a testament to what a  person of goodwill can accomplish with a servant's heart and the  understanding that in the passion play of life you only have a minute,  but all eternity is in it.   Elijah Cummings did not waste his minute of eternity.   Elijah Cummings will live forever in the hearts of the people of his  hometown Baltimore, his state of Maryland, and the United States.   To his widow Maya, his children, and family and friends he loved and  who loved him so dearly, my deepest sympathies go out to and I hope you  find consolation in the certain knowledge that our beloved Elijah is  now dancing with the angels.
