 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the legacy of a  local Houston legend, the late Lupe Fraga.   Lupe Fraga, known affectionately as ``Champ'' was a community legend  who grew up in Houston's East End in my district.   Over the decades, Champ became known as a pioneer in the Latino  business community, a dedicated public servant, and an honorable  veteran who served in the United States Army.   Champ founded Tejas Office Products in 1962 to provide Houstonians  with high-quality and affordable office supplies.   As a businessowner, he also supported local school supply drives and  helped support minority-owned businesses in our region.   He eventually served on the Houston branch of the Federal Reserve  Bank, was a regent at the Texas A&M University, and a member and  director of the Houston Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.   Champ was one of Houston's best. He was a true leader. Champ and his  friendly smile will be missed by everyone. My condolences and best  wishes to his family as they put him to rest in Houston today.                            ____________________
