 Madam Speaker, after a canceled 7 a.m. flight and not  getting standby on a 9:30 flight, I am back in D.C. this afternoon to  encourage support for the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in  American Aviation Act, otherwise known as H.R. 3935.   This bill invests in critical airport infrastructure, encourages  innovation, and improves efficiency through restructuring the FAA.   I also want to encourage my colleagues to support my amendment, H.R.  1818, which expands the qualified tuition program, otherwise known as  the 529 plan, to include aviation mechanic and commercial pilot  courses. This is a long-term solution for the aviation industry. It has  137 cosponsors and tons of aviation industry and labor group support.                            ____________________
