 Mr. President, I had just spoken about this, but it is  imperative that we take up and pass H.R. 6617; that is the Further  Additional Extending Government Funding Act. Of course, we call it the  CR.   I say this because the bill will keep the Federal Government funded  and fully operating through March 11, while we work out and are working  out the details of full-year appropriations bills to meet the needs of  the American people.   And I want to compliment the Appropriations Committee staff who have  been meeting with me and others weekends, evenings, for weeks and  months now, actually, to get this done.   In a few moments we will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to  proceed to the continuing resolution. As chairman of the Appropriations  Committee, I strongly urge all Members, Republicans and Democrats  alike, to vote aye.   A government shutdown would be useless, senseless. Imagine how that  would look to the Russians?   I am pleased to report that last week the four corners of the Senate  House Appropriations Committee reached a framework agreement that will  allow us to negotiate an omnibus appropriations bill. And that  framework was the result of weeks of careful negotiations between  myself, Vice Chairman Shelby, Chair DeLauro and Ranking Member Granger,  and I want to thank them. I especially want to thank all their staffs  who worked late nights and weekends that it took us to get to this  point.   I don't know how many nights I probably turned in about 11 o'clock at  night and I still was getting emails from them working on this.   Now, it is like any compromise. I have been here 48 years. I know you  have to work these things out. I don't believe any of us walked away  from these negotiations with everything we wanted. There is still much  work to do. But on the good part, this framework sets the stage for us  to make significant investments to the American people and communities  across our country.   It provides the biggest increase in nondefense programs in 4 years.  Under this framework, we can direct new resources. We can improve  healthcare in rural communities. We can expand the middle class. We can  protect our national security. And we look forward to presenting our  final agreement to Members to review in the coming weeks.   But by passing this continuing resolution, we remove the unnecessary  threat of yet another government shutdown and allow the Appropriations  Committee to continue to work right through the upcoming recess.  Because think of the alternative: a full year continuing resolution?  That is untenable. It is far too onerous on the American people. Our  government is not meant to run on autopilot; and American taxpayer  dollars should not be spent on outdated priorities. We have the  responsibility to make the hard choices about how to invest in the  American people.   I will give you an example. A full-year continuing resolution would  freeze funding at the National Institutes of Health. Think what that  does. Think what that does when it brings  [[Page S765]]  groundbreaking medical research to a halt at the time of a pandemic. It  would once again pass on new investments that begin to acknowledge the  climate crisis after 4 years of setting it on the back burner.   The continuing resolution would fail to increase investments in the  education of our Nation's children or to build and renovate affordable  housing or expand the middle class.   It would also--and this, people overlook--it would substantially  reduce infrastructure spending that was in that bipartisan  infrastructure law. We passed this bipartisan infrastructure law with  an overwhelming vote, but we also have to fund it. A full-year,  continuing resolution would lead to delays and, frankly, worse, a loss  of service to veterans.   To draft the full-year appropriations bill allows us to make smart  decisions on how to invest in each of these areas on behalf of the  American people.    In December, the Secretary of Defense warned that a full-year CR  would be unprecedented. It would cause irreparable damage to a wide  range of bipartisan priorities from defense modernization to public  health. Well, Secretary Austin is absolutely right.   A full-year continuing resolution would actually cut defense spending  below last year's level. Some programs would be underfunded; others  would be overfunded. And the Department of Defense would lack the  transfer authority to correct the imbalance, yet the worst of all  possible worlds.   To give an example, a continuing resolution would provide $3.3  billion for training and arming the Afghan security forces. If anybody  has been watching the press, the Afghan security forces aren't there  anymore, but continuing the resolution would provide them $3.3 billion  more. Another example is the Department of Defense might have to lay  off some of the men and women in the Armed Forces so they can afford a  2.7 percent pay raise which they rightly deserve that went into effect  last month. So they would say: OK. Here is the pay raise, but we have  to fire you all to pay for it because we have a continuing resolution.  In other words, the continuing resolution would be paying to train a  military force that doesn't even exist anymore, while laying off our  own troops and civilian workforce in order to pay them.   Well, my talking points say this would not make sense. It is actually  baloney to try to do this.   Funding the priorities of yesterday in the world of today would be  irresponsible and is no way to govern.   Our four-corners framework provides a path for reaching a bipartisan,  bicameral omnibus agreement by March 11. Vice Chairman Shelby, Chairman  DeLauro and Ranking Member Granger and I are committed to completing  this work. We and our staffs are willing to work straight through until  that day. So I urge Members to support the continuing resolution that  passed the House with strong bipartisan--Republican and Democrats  alike--support so we can finish our negotiation.   And I might say, Mr. President, the continuing resolution--and I was  here at a time when something like this was typically passed by a voice  vote. But it has to pass in its current form. The House is out of  session. We don't have time for a long and protracted debate. The  government will shut down at midnight tomorrow if we do not sign the  continuing resolution in its current form to the President for his  signature.   So I would urge all Members to oppose any amendments--whether they  come from Republicans or Democrats--oppose any amendments to the bill  and vote yes on the final passage. Be responsible. If we have to be in  tonight and tomorrow to finish it, fine. But let's get it done. Come  on.   If you took a poll of the American people, 95 percent of them would  say: What is taking so long? Let's get it done.                              Order of Business    Mr. President, if there is nobody else seeking recognition, I ask the  previously scheduled vote begin now.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I think  my friend from Florida knows I will. This entire issue is a misnomer.  There have been a few online things to try to make a big deal out of  it, and I am sorry that some have fallen for it, but the Biden  administration produced a letter this week clarifying this  misunderstanding.   The administration stated clearly they never authorized use of  Federal funding for smoke pipes and will not in the future. In fact, I  don't think any administration has.   Of course, the bill that the Senator from Florida is proposing goes  much further than Republicans say it would. It would severely cripple  our ability to respond to addiction, which has taken 100,000 lives a  year right now, including lives in his State and mine.   We offered an alternative; but that was rejected.  [[Page S774]]    We actually have to go to the CR now. The House is gone. We have to  pass it--the CR and send it to the President without amendments or our  government funding runs out.   And I might just say--I mean, everybody has the right to speak about  anything they want. Everybody has the right to make any kind of  political point for any group they want, but let's talk about being  U.S. Senators.   A war is about to start in Ukraine, in all likelihood. And what we  are saying is we will start putting all of these things in, slow up a  continuing resolution so the United States Government will have to shut  down tomorrow night.   And we can stand there and Putin can say: Why should I listen to  them? Three or four people can go on their Senate floor and shut down  the government. Why should I listen to them?   So I object.    Mr. President, the suggestion is many people aren't here  to vote. Well, let's bring up the continuing resolution. Let's vote it  up or down. Let's say to the rest of the world, including Russia, the  most powerful nation on Earth can stay open or a few Senators can say:  No, golly, we got to get something on television. We ought to close  down the government.   The Senator from Florida is welcome to bring up his bill sometime in  regular order. Let's not slow up things now. So let's vote on the  continuing resolution. Let's show the United States of America and the  rest of the world that we can stay open and that we are not afraid to  stay open. We will stay open, and we all--I think we could probably say  unanimously, I would hope--oppose what Russia apparently is planning to  do in Ukraine.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 267, H.R. 6617;  that the only amendments in order be the Lee amendment No. 4929, Braun  amendment No. 4930, Cruz amendment No. 4927; that at 5:15 p.m., the  Senate vote in relation to the amendments in the order listed; that  upon disposition of the Cruz amendment, the bill be considered read a  third time and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended, if  amended, with 60 affirmative votes required for adoption of the Braun  amendment and on passage of the bill; and that there be 2 minutes for  debate equally divided in the usual form prior to each vote, all  without further intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from  Indiana would mandate extreme, across the board cuts to Federal  programs that the American people rely on.   Under this amendment, Congress would need to callously slash $1.4  trillion in a vain effort to close the budget deficit through spending  cuts in the 10th year of a budget resolution. Spread evenly across all  Federal programs, this would result in a $350 billion cut to Medicare,  a $180 billion cut to Medicaid, and an $82 billion cut to veterans'  programs, in just 1 year.   Nutrition programs that help families make ends meet by putting food  on the table would be slashed by a quarter. Affordable housing,  healthcare, education, name the Federal program that people in your  communities rely on, and it will be cut by a quarter.   The Senator's amendment would require a two-thirds vote to pass any  budget resolution that does not balance the budget in the 10th year.  The last two budget resolutions written by Senate Republicans would  have violated this rule.   Being responsible stewards of Americans' hard-earned tax dollars is a  bipartisan priority, but this is not responsible stewardship. I urge a  no vote.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore.
