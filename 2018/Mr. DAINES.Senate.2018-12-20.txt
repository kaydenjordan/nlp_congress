 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, my Montana colleagues, Congressman  Gianforte and Senator Tester, and I have worked for years to bring  Federal recognition to the Little Shell Tribe, and for the first time,  we are just one vote away from making it happen.   Congressman Gianforte championed his bill through the House with  unanimous votes in the committee and on the floor. When it came to the  Senate, Senator Tester and I pressed it, also by unanimous consent,  through the Indian Affairs Committee. Now, with just hours left in the  115th Congress, we need to pass this important bill out of the Senate  and get it on the President's desk.   The Little Shell Tribe has waited for lifetimes. It should not have  to wait another year to get this done. Therefore, in the fashion of all  of the previous votes on this bill that have had strong bipartisan  support, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Calendar No. 574, H.R. 3764. I ask unanimous  consent that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Mr. President, I have great respect for the objection by  my friend and my colleague from Utah.   I do feel the need to point out that the Little Shell Tribe meets all  of the necessary qualifications for recognition, including its having a  long history that predates 1940. Let me enumerate on this.   Little Shell is the only Tribe in the country that has funds held in  trust by the Department of the Interior but yet lacks Federal  recognition. The Little Shell Tribe is the only Tribe that has had a  favorable determination by the Department of the Interior and has had  it reversed by a bureaucrat with zero negative comments. That decision,  however, was remanded by the previous Secretary, and Secretary Zinke  strongly supports our efforts here today. The Little Shell has, indeed,  existed as a distinct community--recorded as early as 1863 in the  Pembina Treaty with the U.S. Government.   I ask unanimous consent that this treaty, with Chief Little Shell's  name on it, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:             Treaty With the Chippewa Indians--October 2, 1868   Treaty between the United States and the Red Lake and Pembina Bands of  Chippewa Indians; concluded in Minnesota, October 2, 1868; ratified by    the Senate with Amendments, March 1, 1864; amendments assented to,   April 12, 1864; proclaimed by the President of the United States, May                                  5, 1864.             BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.                               A Proclamation       To All and Singular to Whom There Presents Shall Come,           Greeting:        Whereas a treaty was made and concluded at the Old Crossing       of Red Lake River, in the State of Minnesota, on the second       day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight       hundred and sixty-three, by and between Alexander Ramsey and       Ashley C. Morrill, Commissioners on the part of the United       States, and the hereinafter named Chiefs, Headmen, and       Warriors of the Red Lake and Pembina Bands of Chippewa       Indians, on the part of said Bands, and duly authorized       thereto by them, which treaty is in the words and figures       following, to wit:--        Articles of A Treaty made and concluded at the Old Crossing       of Red Lake River, in the State of Minnesota, on the second       day of October, in the year eighteen hundred and sixty-three,       between the United States of America, by their Commissioners,       Alexander Ramsey and Ashley C. Morrill, agent for the       Chippewa Indians, and the Red Lake and Pembina Bands of       Chippewas, by their Chiefs, Headmen, and Warriors.        Article I. The peace and friendship now existing between       the United States and the Red Lake and Pembina bands of       Chippewa Indians shall be perpetual.        Article II. The said Red Lake and Pembina bands of Chippewa       Indians do hereby cede, sell, and convey to the United States       all their right, title, and interest in and to all the lands       now owned and claimed by them in the State of Minnesota and       in the Territory of Dakota within the following described       boundaries, to wit: Beginning at the point where the       international boundary between the United States and the       British possessions intersects the shore of the Lake of the       Woods; thence in a direct line south-westwardly to the head       of Thief River; thence down the main channel of said Thief       River to its mouth on the Red Lake River; thence in a south-      easterly direction, in a direct line towards the head of Wild       Rice River, to the point where such line would intersect the       northwestern boundary of a tract ceded to the United States       by a treaty concluded at Washington on the twenty-second day       of February, in the year eighteen hundred and fifty-five,       with the Mississippi, Pillager, and Lake Winnebigoshish bands       of Chippewa Indians; thence along the said boundary line of       the said cession to the mouth of Wild Rice River; thence up       the main channel of the Red River to the mouth of the       Shayenne; thence up the main channel of the Shayenne River to       Poplar Grove; thence in a direct line to the Place of Stumps,       otherwise called Lake Chicot; thence in a direct line to the       head of the main branch of Salt River; thence in a direct       line due north to the point where such line would intersect,       the international boundary aforesaid; thence eastwardly along       said boundary to the place of beginning.        Article III. In consideration of the foregoing cession, the       United States agree to pay to the said Red Lake and Pembina       bands of Chippewa Indians the following sums, to wit: Twenty       thousand dollars per annum for twenty years; the said sum to       be distributed among the Chippewa Indians of the said bands       in equal amounts per capita, and for this purpose an accurate       enumeration and enrollment of the members of the respective       bands and families shall be made by the officers of the       United States: Provided, That so much of this sum as the       President of the United States shall direct, not exceeding       five thousand dollars per year, may be reserved from the       above sum, and applied to agriculture, education, the       purchase of goods, powder, lead, doc., for their use, and to       such other beneficial purposes, calculated to promote the       prosperity and happiness of the said Chippewa Indians, as he       may prescribe.        Article IV. And in further consideration of the foregoing       cession, and of their promise to abstain from such acts in       future, the United States agree that the said Red Lake and       Pembina bands of Chippewa Indians shall not be held liable to       punishment for past offences. And in order to make       compensation to the injured parties for the depredations       committed by the said Indians on the goods of certain British       and American traders at the mouth of Red Lake River, and for       exactions forcibly levied by them on the proprietors of the       steamboat plying on the Red River, and to enable them to pay       their just debts, the United States agree to appropriate the       sum of one hundred thousand dollars; it being understood and       agreed that the claims of individuals for damages or debt       under this article shall be ascertained and audited, in       consultation with the chiefs of said bands, by a commissioner       or commissioners appointed by the President of the United       States, and that after such damages and debts shall have been       paid, the residue of the above sum shall be distributed among       the chiefs. Furthermore, the sum of two thousand dollars       shall be expended for powder, lead, twine, or such other       beneficial purposes as the chiefs may request, to be       equitably distributed among the said bands at the first       payment.        Article V. To encourage and aid the chiefs of said bands in       preserving order and inducing, by their example and advice,       the members of their respective bands to adopt the habits and       pursuits of civilized life, there shall be paid to each of       the said chiefs annually, out of the annuities of the said       bands, a sum not exceeding one hundred and fifty dollars, to       be determined by their agents according to their respective       merits. And for the better promotion of the above objects, a       further sum of five hundred dollars shall be paid at the       first payment to each of the said chiefs to enable him to       build for himself a house. Also, the sum of five thousand       dollars shall be appropriated by the United States for       cutting out a road from Leech Lake to Red Lake.        Article VI. The President shall appoint a board of       visitors, to consist of not less than two nor more than three       persons, to be selected from such Christian denominations as       he may designate, whose duty it shall be to attend at all       annuity payments of the said Chippewa Indians, to inspect       their fields and other improvements, and to report annually       thereon on or before the first day of November, and also as       to the qualifications and moral deportment of all persons       residing upon the reservation under the authority of law; and       they shall receive for their services five dollars a day for       the time actually employed, and ten cents per mile for       travelling expenses: Provided, That no one shall be paid in       any one year for more then twenty days' service, or for more       than three hundred miles' travel.        Article VII. The laws of the United States now in force, or       that may hereafter be enacted, prohibiting the introduction       and sale of spirituous liquors in the Indian country, shall       be in fall force and effect throughout the country hereby       ceded, until otherwise directed by congress or the       President of the United States.        Article VIII. In further consideration of the foregoing       cession, it is hereby agreed that the United States shall       grant to each male adult half-breed or mixed-blood who is       related by blood to the said Chippewas of the said Red Lake       or Pembina bands who has adopted the habits and customs of       civilized life, and who is a citizen of the United States, a       homestead of one hundred and sixty acres of land, to be       selected at his option, within the limits of the tract of       country hereby ceded to the United States, on any land not       previously occupied by actual settlers or covered by prior       grants, the boundaries thereof to be adjusted in conformity       with the lines of the official surveys when the same shall be       made, and with the laws and regulations of the United States       affecting the location and entry of the same.        Article IX. Upon the urgent request of the Indians, parties       to this treaty, there shall be set apart from the tract       hereby ceded a reservation of (640) six hundred and forty       acres near the mouth of Thief River for the chief ``Moose       Dung,'' and a like reservation of (640) six hundred and forty       acres for the chief ``Red Bear,'' on the north side of       Pembina River.        In witness whereof, the said Alexander Ramsey and Ashley C.       Morrill, commissioners on the part of the United States, and       the chiefs, headmen, and warriors of the Red Lake and Pembina       bands of Chippewa Indians, have hereunto set their bands, at       the Old Crossing of Red Lake River, in the State of       Minnesota, this second day of October, in the year of our       Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three.                                                    Alex Ramsey,                                                  Ashley C. Morrill,                                                     Commissioners.

The Little Shell entered this treaty with other bands of  the Chippewa Cree. As well, they all support Little Shell's  recognition.   I ask unanimous consent that these letters of support be printed in  the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Turtle Mountain,                                        Band of Chippewa Indians,                                       Belcourt, ND, March 17, 2015.      Re Support for S. 35 the Little Shell Restoration Act of           2015.       Chairman John Barrasso,      Senate Committee on Indian Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Vice Chair Jon Tester,      Senate Committee on Indian Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Chairman Barrasso & Vice Chair Tester: The Turtle Mountain       Band of Chippewa Indians (``Turtle Mountain Band'') supports       S. 35 the Little Shell Restoration Act of 2015. The Little       Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana, along with the       Turtle Mountain Band and the Chippewa-Cree Tribe of the Rocky       Boy's Reservation (``Rocky Boy''), are political successors       in interest to the Pembina Treaty of 1863. Unfortunately,       unlike Turtle Mountain and Rocky Boy, the Little Shell Tribe       has lacked formal federal recognition. This is an historical       injustice that must be remedied. S.35 would restore federal       recognition to the Little Shell Tribe so that it may take its       rightful place next to its sister tribal nations.        We urge the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs to support       S. 35 and the federal recognition of the Little Shell Tribe.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard McCloud,      Chairman.                                   ____                                                         White Earth                                      Reservation Tribal Council,                                     White Earth, MN, April 2, 2015.      Re Support for S. 35 the Little Shell Tribe Restoration Act           of 2015.       Hon. Amy Klobuchar,      United States Senator,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Al Franken,      United States Senator,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Klobuchar & Senator Franken: The White Earth       Nation offers its strong support for S. 35, the Little Shell       Tribe Restoration Act of 2015. This bipartisan legislation       offered by Senator Jon Tester (D-MT) and Senator Steve Daines       (R-MT) would restore federal recognition to the Little Shell       Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana (``Little Shell Tribe''       or ``Tribe'').        The White Earth Nation and the Little Shell Tribe are       related, and as Anishinaabe, our stories are intertwined. The       Little Shell Tribe is one of several recognized political       successors to the Pembina Treaty of 1863. After the treaty       the Little Shell Tribe moved west eventually settling in the       Territory of Montana. Once in Montana, the Tribe remained       landless and unrecognized. However, the White Earth Nation       knows the Little Shell Tribe and the merits of their cause       and that is why we fully support the Tribe.        I urge you to vote in favor of S. 35 and restore the long-      awaited federal recognition to the Little Shell people.            Sincerely,                                                   Erma J. Vizenor,      Chairwoman.                                   ____                                            The Chippewa Cree Tribe,                                  of the Rocky Boy's Reservation,                                   Box Elder, MT, November 27, 2018.      Re Support for H.R. 3764, the Little Shell Restoration Act.       Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. John Hoeven,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Senate Minority Leader,      Washington DC.      Hon. Tom Udall,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs,           Washington, DC.        Leader McConnell, Leader Schumer, Chairman Hoeven, &       Ranking Member Udall: I write on behalf of the Chippewa Cree       Tribe of Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation (``Chippewa Cree       Tribe'') in support of our sister tribal nation the Little       Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians and to urge the Senate to       pass H.R. 3764, the Little Shell Restoration Act.        The Chippewa Cree Tribe and the Little Shell Tribe share a       common history where the United States continually sought to       remove us from our lands and push us ever westward. The       Little Shell Tribe and the Chippewa Cree Tribe along with the       Turtle Mountain Band and White Earth Nation are the political       successors in interest to the Pembina Treaty of 1863. This       was our first experience with land cessations and westward       expansion but it was not our last. Unlike Little Shell, the       Chippewa Cree Tribe was fortunate to eventually obtain       reservation lands. Unfortunately, for Little Shell there was       no money in Washington for similar treatment, which has led       them to continue to be unrecognized to this day.        I urge the Senate to finally make right with the Little       Shell Tribe and its tribal citizens by passing H.R. 3764. The       Little Shell Tribe has waited long enough.            Sincerely,                                                      Harlan Baker,      Chairman.                                   ____                                                   Attorney General,                                                State of Montana,                                      Helena, MT, November 27, 2018.      Re Urging passage of H.R. 3764, the Little Shell Restoration           Act.       Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. John Hoeven,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Senate Minority Leader,      Washington DC.      Hon. Tom Udall,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Leader McConnell, Leader Schumer, Chairman Hoeven, &       Ranking Member Udall: I write to urge the Senate to pass       Congressman Greg Gianforte's H.R. 3764, the Little Shell       Restoration Act. I have long called on Congress to pass       legislation to restore the federal recognition of the Little       Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians and it appears this year       presents the best opportunity to finally achieve this goal.        The Little Shell Tribe enjoys broad support in the State of       Montana because Montanans, like me, understand the Little       Shell Tribe's history and its legitimacy. The Little Shell       are an integral part of Montana's history, and an important       part of Montana's future. I was encouraged when the House of       Representatives passed H.R. 3764 by unanimous consent in       September because it shows that Congress is finally listening       to the people of Montana when it comes to the Little Shell. I       hope the Senate will follow suit and pass H.R. 3764       expeditiously.        Again, I fully support the federal recognition of the       Little Shell Tribe and call on Congress to pass H.R. 3764 in       its current form.            Sincerely,                                                           Tim Fox,      Attorney General.                                   ____                                             Office of the Governor,                                                State of Montana,                                       Helena, MT, November 27, 2018      Re Support for passage of H.R. 3764, the Little Shell           Restoration Act.       Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. John Hoeven,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Senate Minority Leader,      Washington DC.      Hon. Tom Udall,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell, Leader Schumer, Chairman Hoeven, and       Ranking Member Udall:        I urge the United States Senate to pass Montana       Representative Greg Gianforte's H.R. 3764, the Little Shell       Tribe Restoration Act. This bipartisan bill will finally       right the historical injustice perpetrated against the Little       Shell Tribe.        As Governor of Montana, I have continued the government-to-      government relationship with the Little Shell Chippewa Tribe       as a state recognized tribe. In 2015, I supported the Montana       State Legislature's passage of  [[Page S7974]]       House Joint Resolution No. 15 in the 64th Legislative Session       calling on the ``federal government to restore federal       recognition to the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians''       and asking Congress to pass legislation to accomplish this.       If the Senate passes H.R. 3764, Montanans' calls to restore       federal recognition to the Little Shell Tribe will finally be       answered.        The Little Shell Tribe of Montana enjoys immense support in       the State of Montana because tribe's history and culture are       the fabric of Montana. The Little Shell deserves the passage       of this legislation. It has been long overdue for this       recognition and I call on the United States Senate to respect       the State of Montana's voice in this debate and move to pass       H.R. 3764 in its current form. The Tribe has waited long       enough for this action.            Sincerely,                                                     Steve Bullock,                                                          Governor.    The Little Shell is also unique, and all 12 of Montana's  Indian Tribes on our seven Indian reservations also support its  recognition. The Little Shell also has the support of the entire  Montana delegation. It has the support of our Governor, and it has the  support of our Attorney General.   Here are their letters.   In fact, Federal recognition of the Little Shell has enjoyed support  from the congressional delegation and our State's Governors since the  1930s and 1940s when our country first began to federally recognize  Indian Tribes. The American Indian Policy Review Commission, from later  in 1977, also recognized its plight as a distinct entity.   There are more documents for the Record. Clearly, the record has  existed in support of this Tribe's Federal recognition. I remember,  during my time in the House, looking at what it had been going  through--literally, stacks and stacks of paperwork--in following a  process. There is, indeed, longstanding evidence supporting its  recognition, and I strongly disagree with my colleague's objection.   The Little Shell Tribe has seen lifetimes--not a lifetime but  lifetimes--of neglect from our Federal Government. I had hoped we could  finally deliver its recognition here today. We are just one vote short  in the Senate. I will not stop pushing for our government to rectify  this injustice.   I thank the Presiding Officer.    Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Mary Lincoln of Liberty County for her 100 years of  determination, joy, and service for others.   At 107, Mary Lincoln has lived through 19 Presidents, two World Wars,  the Great Depression, and was born before women could vote. Ms. Lincoln  was born in 1911, just north of Rudyard, MT, in a small homestead  shack. As an infant, she was placed in a cardboard box with blankets  and laid atop of the home's oven to keep warm. From then on, Mary  Lincoln has embodied the true spirit of Montana, keeping a light heart  and always staying busy.   Mary Lincoln graduated from Havre High School at 16, where she then  went  [[Page S7986]]  on to get a teaching degree from a small college in Illinois. After  college, Ms. Lincoln came back to teach at Juanita County School in  Montana. She has out lived all of her students, except for one who, at  91, still visits her. Ms. Lincoln and her husband Donald were married  for 60 years and had three children together.   Mary Lincoln is an inspiration to all, she has seized all that life  has to offer and at 107 still says that her best years are yet to come.  I congratulate Ms. Lincoln for her exemplary Montanan spirit and  continual support towards small Montana communities.                            ____________________
