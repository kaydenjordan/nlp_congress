 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5247  because it actually creates a dangerous back door around the Food and  Drug Administration approval process and it ignores that there is a  safe pathway for terminally ill patients to get the treatment that they  need.   This bill denies patients what they really need, which is safe and  effective treatments.   This bill strips away important safeguards in the name of helping  patients. It is not patient friendly. That is why 78 patients and  doctor groups are all opposed to this legislation, like the American  Cancer Society, the National Brain Tumor Society, the Leukemia and  Lymphoma Society, and the Vietnam Veterans of America.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this 5-page list of the opposing  groups.

Mr. Speaker, it opens the door for bad actors to take  advantage of terminally ill patients. It is the FDA's job to ensure  that drugs are safe and effective. We can't trust manufacturers to act  as a gatekeeper.   The important thing to know is there is already a safe process for  terminally ill patients to access experimental treatments. Under the  Expanded Access Program, 99 percent of applications are approved, and  they are done in a speedy way.   This process is not merely a rubber stamp. The FDA plays a vital role  in ensuring these experimental treatments are safe.   Even more important, in 19 States that have passed right-to-try laws,  patients using an investigational drug can lose their hospice care; and  in 6 States, they can be denied home healthcare. These are the very  people who depend on hospice and home care, and they could lose those  services.   This is not a humane, patient-centered bill for people who are facing  death. It is just a dangerous pathway for bad actors to exist.   Let's go with the positive ability right now that we have. Ninety- nine percent of those desperate people looking for hope will get it  from the Food and Drug Administration. So I urge my colleagues to  oppose H.R. 5247.
