 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of marriage  equality.   The bills we write and pass regularly affect millions of lives.  Rarely is the legislation we vote on so personal as the bill we are  voting on today, the Respect for Marriage Act.   My daughter and her wife are two of the estimated 26 million  Americans whose freedom to marry will be protected by this bill. Their  son, my 1-year-old grandson, Reza, can now grow up without risk to his  family. Love is a precious thing.   Madam Speaker, I know my daughters will now know our Nation respects  their marriage. You cannot legislate love, but you can give love the  protection of our laws. I thank the gentleman and I urge my colleagues  to vote for this.                                time 1000     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member  Rogers for what they have done in ushering this through.   The Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee portion of this year's  NDAA manages our Nation's security risk and keeps America's land and  air forces the best in the world.   I especially thank our ranking member, Mrs. Hartzler--this will be  her last NDAA--for her partnership and always putting America above all  others.   Certainly, this is an issue before us. It is a bipartisan bill, and  we have the oversight of many programs, including the F-35, while  reducing risks to the industrial base, particularly when it comes to  munitions.                                time  1230    I can't adequately express my frustrations once again that the buy  American provisions that would have strengthened our industrial base  have been left out.   Finally, I thank the professional staff who made it possible for what  we do here each and every day, and I thank the men and women who built  and maintain this great industrial base, the finest military in the  world.   Certainly, without my professional staff--Bill, Liz, Heath, Carla,  Mike, and Payson--and my personal staff of Katie and Kevin, it wouldn't  be possible.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote for this bill.
