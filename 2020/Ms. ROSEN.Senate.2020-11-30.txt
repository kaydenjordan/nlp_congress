 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and  service of my friend and a great Nevadan, Dennis ``Denny'' Russell  Weddle, who passed away on August 2, 2020. Denny served our country in  the U.S. Air Force for over 20 years and retired as lieutenant colonel  with a distinguished military career, serving in Vietnam and as the  information officer on the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds Demonstration  Team from 1969 to 1971.   In 1969 Denny was first stationed at Nellis Air Force Base in  Nevada--the proud home of the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds Demonstration  Team--and after retiring from the Air Force, he stayed in Las Vegas and  became the director of corporate public affairs at Summa Corporation,  which is where I had the pleasure of working with him. Later, Denny  founded his own full-service marketing, public relations, and  government affairs agency, called Denny Weddle & Associates.   Denny was a dedicated public servant with an exceptional history of  community engagement, serving as the president of the Military Officers  Association, a member of the Vietnam Veterans Association and the  American Legion, and the founder of the Nellis Support Team. Denny also  was the chair of the board of the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce and  served as the president or the chair of over 30 major nonprofits in our  community.   I am so pleased to have known Denny Weddle, and I am so thankful for  his engagement and commitment to Nevadans. Denny's contributions to  both the Las Vegas and the Nellis Air Force Base communities will be  missed.                            ____________________
