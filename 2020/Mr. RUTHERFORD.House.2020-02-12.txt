 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Kristen  Musgrove from Nassau County, Florida, for having earned the Milken  Educator Award.   This distinguished award recognizes teachers, principals, and  educational specialists who have made a profound impact on their  students and school communities.   Ms. Musgrove teaches math to the sixth grade students at Hilliard  Middle-Senior High School and was the only teacher in the State of  Florida chosen for this very prestigious award.   Our educators are tasked with teaching and inspiring the next  generation of Americans and Ms. Musgrove has gone above and beyond as  demonstrated by preparing and guiding her students in the development  of valuable problem-solving skills.   In fact, under Ms. Musgrove's instruction, her classes lead the  Nassau County School District with a 97 percent math proficiency. Ms.  Musgrove's dedication to her students extends beyond the classroom, as  she also offers tutoring at a weekly after school math camp.   On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Florida and the  grateful students and parents of Hilliard Middle-Senior High School, I  thank Ms. Musgrove for her lifelong dedication to excellence in the  classroom and congratulate her on receiving the recognition she so well  deserves.                          Honoring the HIDTA Program     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 30 years of the  High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program known as HIDTA. This  program has played a vital role in helping keep our communities safe  and drugs off our streets.   For the last several years, law enforcement officers have been on the  front line of the opioid crisis that our country is facing, and now for  the first time in decades, the CDC has indicated that the overdose  death rates are expected to decline. This is thanks to the HIDTA  program and our local, State, and Federal partners taking down the drug  smugglers and traffickers.   I would like to highlight some of the incredible officers from the  north Florida HIDTA who received recognition on February 6 at the 2020  National HIDTA Conference and Awards banquet.   Winning the team award for Outstanding Investigative Support Center  were: Kim Jones, Louis Ceragioli, Joe Delaney, Robert Hoisington, Ralph  Little, Kevin Miller, Stefanie Miller, Paul Pilliod, Jared Padilla, and  John Watson.   Winning an award for Outstanding Task Force Commander was Florida's  own Corey M. Taylor of the Ocala Police Department.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate each and every one of them. These awards  are well deserved, and I thank them for helping to keep our communities  safe.                            ____________________
