 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, and I thank the  ranking member for his support, longtime friends.   Let me quickly indicate that as I have embraced the NDAA over the  years, it has always been my focus to deal with the military personnel  and to make us the best, the strongest, and the most well respected and  appreciated.   I want to thank this committee and the Rules Committee for allowing  my amendments Nos. 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, and 198. Many of  them speak for themselves.   Let me clearly say that I have worked year after year as a breast  cancer survivor to ensure that triple-negative breast cancer, which is  one of the most deadly forms of cancer--that women in the military have  the services that they need.   Let me just share with you that triple-negative breast cancer has a  survival rate of 5 years. The key to beating this cancer is early  detection. There is $10 million to enhance research and to help these  women. In addition, I have asked for $2 million for post-traumatic  stress disorder. I even, under then-Colonel Murtha, organized a center  in my district.   But the most important point for supporting this amendment is that it  still exists--Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, 11 to 20  out of 100; Gulf war, 12 out of 100; Vietnam war, 30 out of 100. It is  still needed, and we appreciate this amendment.   I also want to thank you for recognizing that we are going into  space. My amendment says that we should have a bill that studies the  risks proposed by man-made space debris in lower orbit, including  recommendations and remediation of such risks. It is extremely  important.   Finally, I want to speak to a very important amendment dealing with  the longstanding history of African Americans in the United States  military, to create a task force that respects the fact that Crispus  Attucks, a runaway slave who escaped--during the Boston Massacre to the  present day--an escaped slave who fought in the Revolutionary War with  George Washington.   This story is a long-story story. The United States Army and others  have a very long history. This task force will determine the impact of  slavery and the impact of our soldiers from the very early years, who  happened to be ex-slaves fighting all the way through the many  different wars.   I believe we will find that those who are descendants of enslaved  Africans have fought in wars from the very beginning. It is an  important story. It should be told. I am very pleased that this  particular amendment is included.    Mr. Speaker, I will just conclude that this task  force, which will be a very significant historical study, will be very  much appreciated.   But let me quickly say that having worked with our various nominees  to the military academies, one in particular was an individual who  stuttered. By the time he finished, they said he could not have his  command. They never assessed him in the academy while he was there.   I believe this is an important assessment, to assess that vital  $250,000 student, so that when he graduates, he will have a command  even if he is a stutterer because he made it into the academy; he was  successful academically; and he should be allowed to serve his country.   I thank you for considering my amendments and for them to stay in to  become law.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my Amendments in the En Bloc  Amendment No. 2 to H.R. 4350, the National Defense Authorization Act  for FY 2022, which incorporates Jackson Lee Amendments Nos. 191, 192,  193, 194, 195, 196, 197, and 198.   I thank the Rules Committee for making these amendments in order.   I also thank Chairman Smith of the House Armed Services Committee and  his staff for working with me and my staff to include the Jackson Lee  Amendments in this En Bloc, and for his great work in shepherding the  bill to the floor.   The amendments included in En Bloc No. 2 are as follows:   1. Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No. 191--Provides  authorization for a $10 million increase in funding for increased  collaboration with NIH to combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer.   2. Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No. 192--Provides  authorization for $2.5 million increase in funding to combat  posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).   3. Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No. 193--Directs the Secretary  of Defense to  [[Page H4986]]  promulgate regulations to ensure that candidates granted admission to  attend a military academy undergo screening for speech disorders and be  provided the results of the screening test and a list of warfare  unrestricted line (URL) Officer positions and occupation specialists  that require successful performance on the speech test. Academy  students shall have the option of undergoing speech therapy to reduce  speech disorders or impediments.   4. Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No. 194 recognizes that Black  men and women have played an integral role in the defense of the nation  from the bravery of Crispus Attucks, an escaped slave, during the  Boston Massacre to the present day, and seeks to determine how to  address the historical and current barriers to their participation and  equal treatment in the Armed Services.   5. Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No. 195--Requires report on  Maternity Mortality Rates for military members and their dependents.   6. Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No. 196--Requires a report to  be submitted to Congress within 240 days following enactment on the  risks posed by debris in low earth orbit and to make recommendations on  remediation of risks and outline plans to reduce the incident of space  debris.   7. Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No. 197--Requires the  Secretary of Defense to report to Congress programs and procedures  employed to ensure students studying abroad through Department of  Defense National Security Education Programs are trained to recognize,  resist, and report against recruitment efforts by agents of foreign  governments.   8. Jackson Lee Amendment designated as No. 198--Directs the Secretary  to submit to Congress within 180 days a report on the recognition of  African Americans who have served in the Armed Forces in DOD naming  practices and conventions for military installations, infrastructure,  vessels, and weapon systems.   Jackson Lee Amendment 191 provides authorization for a $10 million  increase in funding for increased collaboration with NIH to combat  Triple Negative Breast Cancer.   As a Member of Congress, a mother, a sister, a spouse, and a breast  cancer survivor, I feel a special responsibility to do all I can to  ensure every American can win in the fight against all types of breast  cancer but especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).                    What is triple negative breast cancer?    The term triple negative breast cancer refers to the fact that this  form of breast cancer will test negative, which means that each of the  tests will return negative results for the presence of breast cancer  for three types of breast cancer tests:   Estrogen receptor;   Progesterone receptor; and   Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 or the HER2 test will be  negative.   In addition, triple-negative breast cancer:   Tends to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer;   Five-year survival rates also tend to be lower for triple-negative  breast cancer; and   Triple Negative Breast Cancer tends to be higher grade than other  types of breast cancer.   Studies have shown that triple-negative breast cancer is more likely  to spread beyond the breast and more likely to recur (come back) after  treatment.   For example, a study of more than 1,600 women in Canada published in  2007 found that women with triple-negative breast cancer were at higher  risk of having the cancer recur outside the breast--but only for the  first 3 years.   As years go by, the risks of the triple-negative breast cancer  recurring become similar to those risk levels for other types of breast  cancer.   The key to beating this cancer is not just early detection--but  detection period.   A 2007 study of more than 50,000 women with all stages of breast  cancer found that 77 percent of women with triple-negative breast  cancer survived at least 5 years, versus 93 percent of women with other  types of breast cancer.   Another study of more than 1,600 women published in 2007 found that  women with triple-negative breast cancer had a higher risk of death  within 5 years of diagnosis, but not after that time period.   The recurrence and survival figures in these and other studies are  averages for all women with triple-negative breast cancer.   Factors such as the grade and stage of the breast cancer will  influence an individual woman's prognosis.   About 15-20 percent of breast cancers are triple negative.   Triple Negative tumors tend to occur more often in younger women and  African-American women.   In studies of U.S. and British women, triple negative breast cancer  appears to be more common among black women (especially before  menopause) compared to white women.   Triple negative breast cancer may also be more common among Hispanic  women compared to white women.   Although the reasons for racial/ethnic differences in rates of triple  negative breast cancer are not clear, lifestyle factors may play a  role.   For example, some findings show African-American women tend to have  lower rates of breastfeeding compared to other women, which may  increase the chances of having triple negative breast cancer.   For these individuals and the tens of thousands of survivors and  their daughters this amendment is needed.   Jackson Lee Amendment 192 provides authorization for $2.5 million  increase in funding to combat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).   PTSD was first brought to public attention in relation to war  veterans, but it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents, such  as torture, being kidnapped or held captive, bombings, or natural  disasters such as floods or earthquakes.   People with PTSD may startle easily, become emotionally numb  (especially in relation to people with whom they used to be close),  lose interest in things they used to enjoy, have trouble feeling  affectionate, be irritable, become more aggressive, or even become  violent.   They avoid situations that remind them of the original incident, and  anniversaries of the incident are often very difficult.   Most people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in their thoughts  during the day and in nightmares when they sleep. These are called  flashbacks. A person having a flashback may lose touch with reality and  believe that the traumatic incident is happening all over again.   My amendment recognizes that these soldiers are, first and foremost,  human. They carry their experiences with them.   Ask a veteran of Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan about the frequency of  nightmares they experience, and one will realize that serving in the  Armed Forces leaves a lasting impression, whether good or bad.   According to the National Center for PTSD, the number of Veterans  with PTSD varies by service era:   Operations Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Enduring Freedom (OEF): About 11- 20 out of every 100 Veterans (or between 11-20 percent) who served in  OIF or OEF have PTSD in a given year.   Gulf War (Desert Storm): About 12 out of every 100 Gulf War Veterans  (or 12 percent) have PTSD in a given year.   Vietnam War: It is estimated that about 30 out of every 100 (or 30  percent) of Vietnam Veterans have had PTSD in their lifetime.   Another cause of PTSD in the military can be military sexual trauma  (MST). This is any sexual harassment or sexual assault that occurs  while you are in the military.   MST can happen to both men and women and can occur during peacetime,  training, or war.   Among Veterans who use VA health care, about:   23 out of 100 women (or 23 percent) reported sexual assault when in  the military.   55 out of 100 women (or 55 percent) and 38 out of 100 men (or 38  percent) have experienced sexual harassment when in the military.   My amendment will help ensure that ``no soldier is left behind'' by  addressing the urgent need for more outreach toward hard-to-reach  veterans suffering from PTSD, especially those who are homeless or  reside in underserved urban and rural areas of our country.   Jackson Lee Amendment 194 recognizes that Black men and  women have played an integral role in the defense of the nation, from  the bravery of Crispus Attucks, an escaped slave, during the Boston  Massacre to the present day, and seeks to determine how to address the  historical and current barriers to their participation and equal  treatment in the Armed Services.   Black Americans became pilots, nurses, Marines, and West Point  graduates, but it was not until President Harry S. Truman issued an  executive order in 1948 that the armed services were integrated; and  even then, some units refused to do so for several more years.   In 1777, when George Washington faced a dearth of white soldiers  willing to fight on behalf of the colonies, he allowed Black men to  fight in the continental army and during the harsh winter of 1778 the  Rhode Island Assembly, therefore, passed a law in 1778 allowing ``every  able-bodied negro, mulatto, or Indian man slave in this state to  enlist.''   100 black soldiers signed up in exchange for their freedom.   During the Civil War, around 179,000 Black men served in the Union  army, either in the Army, Navy, or non-combat positions and more than  40,000 gave the last full measure of devotion to their country.   Over 125,000 Black soldiers served overseas in the segregated  military during World  [[Page H4987]]  War II, but the U.S. military remained segregated.   When Black veterans came home, many found it difficult to get housing  or jobs because White veterans were given preference.   The racial inequality and mistreatment of Black men and women that  has historically permeated our military continues to this day, with  more than 750 complaints of discrimination by race or ethnicity from  service members in the fiscal year 2020 alone.   But discrimination doesn't exist just within the military rank-and- file, as in that same fiscal year, civilians working in the financial,  technical, and support sectors of the Army, Air Force; and Navy also  filed 900 complaints of racial discrimination and over 350 complaints  of discrimination by skin color, data from the U.S. Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission shows.   According to a report by the Defense Department's Diversity and  Inclusion Board, while the enlisted ranks of the active and reserve  military were ``slightly more racially and ethnically diverse than its  U.S. civilian counterparts,'' the opposite was true for the officer  corps.   With the rise and normalization of white supremacist expression  during the Trump administration, the concept of restorative justice has  gained more urgency, garnering the attention of mainstream  commentators, and illustrating the need for a national reckoning.   We owe it to those brave men and women who have proven time and time  again to be an integral part of our military to examine the Armed  Services' history of discrimination and to determine the necessary  steps to repair the harm caused by these inequities.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 96 directs that the Secretary of DoD  provide a report 240 days from enactment of this bill on the risks  posed by man-made space debris in low-earth orbit, including  recommendations on remediation of such risks, and outlines of plans to  reduce the incident of space debris.   Space debris encompasses both natural and artificial particles.   This Jackson Lee Amendment would address the risk of man-made space  debris.   Man-made objects in Earth's orbit that may no longer serve a useful  function can include nonfunctional spacecraft, abandoned launch vehicle  stages, mission-related debris and fragmentation debris.   Space debris travels at speeds up to 17,500 miles per hour is fast  enough for a small piece of man-made debris to damage a satellite or a  spacecraft.   There are more than 20,000 pieces of debris larger than a softball  orbiting the Earth.   There are 500,000 pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger.   There are many millions of pieces of debris that are so small they  can't be tracked.   NASA tracks more than 500,000 pieces of man-made space debris in  Earth's orbit.   This amendment seeks a report from the Secretary of Defense on the  risks posed by man-made space debris, solutions for reducing risks and  strategies for reducing the incidence of more man-made space debris  being introduced into space.   I urge all members to vote for En Bloc Amendment No. 2 and the  underlying legislation, H.R. 4350, the National Defense Authorization  Act for FY 2022                                time  1745
