 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Sonny  Melton.   Sonny was lucky to find the love of his life while working at the  Henry County Medical Center in Paris, Tennessee. As a certified nurse,  Sonny would often assist his wife, Dr. Heather Melton, during  surgeries.   Sonny and Heather had planned to move into a lake house together.  They were in the process of building it in Big Sandy, Tennessee.   They traveled to Las Vegas together to celebrate their 1-year  anniversary at the Route 91 festival. When gunfire erupted, Sonny died  when he was trying to get his wife out of harm's way.   Sonny's wife and all those who knew him remember Sonny as an  enthusiastic man who had an infectious positive attitude.   I would like to extend my condolences to Sonny Melton's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the entire country mourn with you.                            ____________________
