 Mr. Speaker, my grandfather spent 4 years in jail during  Gandhi's independence movement standing for human rights. One of his  crimes was expressing unpopular views in a political newspaper.   Similar human rights abuses are occurring today in Vietnam. I speak  out, today, for those who have been silenced. In many cases, the  victims are the brother, the sister, the friend, or acquaintance of  someone living in my district.   Over 100 activists and religious leaders are currently imprisoned in  Vietnam for expressing their opinions and beliefs. For example, social  activist and blogger Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh was recently sentenced to 10  years in prison for highlighting social injustices on her blog.   In California's 17th District, I am proud of organizations like The  Good Will Brother-Sister Group that stand in solidarity for their  oppressed friends and family in Vietnam.   The Vietnamese Government must release every political prisoner, stop  harassing religious groups, and have the confidence in allowing a free  press. Until they do that, we must do no business deals with Vietnam  and make it clear that we expect them to honor human rights.                            ____________________
