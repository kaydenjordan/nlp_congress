 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1177) to direct the Secretary of  Agriculture to release on behalf of the United States the condition  that certain lands conveyed to the City of Old Town, Maine, be used for  a municipal airport, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1177         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Removing Outdated       Restrictions to Allow for Job Growth Act''.       SEC. 2. RELEASE OF REVERSIONARY INTEREST.         (a) Release.--Notwithstanding section 32(c) of the       Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act (7 U.S.C. 1011(c)), if the       City of Old Town, Maine, makes a written request to the       Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary shall release,       convey, and quitclaim, without monetary consideration, all       rights, title, and interest of the United States in and to       the lands specified in subsection (b).        (b) Lands Specified.--The lands subject to subsection (a)       include only the lands--        (1) conveyed by the United States to the City of Old Town,       Maine, under section 32(c) of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant       Act (7 U.S.C. 1011(c)) by the deed dated June 5, 1941;        (2) proposed for conveyance by the City of Old Town, Maine,       for the purpose of economic development; and        (3) described in the written request submitted by the City       of Old Town, Maine, to the Secretary of Agriculture pursuant       to subsection (a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1177, Removing Outdated  Restrictions to Allow for Job Growth Act.   In the early 1980s, the city of Old Town, Maine, purchased land from  the Federal Government to be part of the Old Town airport. The deed  included a use restriction, as required by a 1941 amendment to the  Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937, limiting use of the land to a  municipal airport or other public use.   Old Town has invested heavily in this land in order to attract  businesses, but the outdated deed restriction needs to be lifted before  further economic development can occur.   H.R. 1177 provides for the removal of the deed restriction on the  parcel of land around the Old Town airport to allow for business  development. The bill allows the City of Old Town to send a letter to  the Secretary of Agriculture detailing which lands it would like  released from the deed restriction and directs the Secretary to release  that land to the city of Old Town.   Passage of this commonsense provision will allow economic development  in Old Town to move forward, creating as many as 200 much-needed jobs.  This legislation will provide certainty to private investors in the  community and help the local economy thrive.   I would like to thank the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin) for  addressing this issue, and our chairman on the  [[Page H4274]]  House Agriculture Committee, Chairman Conaway, for moving this bill  forward.   This is a good government bill that eliminates red tape to unleash  private investment. At a time when rural America is struggling--it is  people like Representative Poliquin and all of us--we must do all we  can to encourage growth and development in rural communities, many that  we all serve, but also the one that Representative Poliquin serves in  Old Town, Maine. I urge all of my colleagues to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Peterson) for supporting this legislation.   I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), who  actually was the one who brought this bill to the attention of the  House Agriculture Committee and to the floor here today. It is his hard  work, and there are not many in this institution who work harder than  Representative Poliquin in addressing the needs of rural America.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to  support passage of this commonsense legislation, H.R. 1177.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2154) to rename the Red River Valley  Agricultural Research Center in Fargo, North Dakota, as the Edward T.  Schafer Agricultural Research Center, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2154         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. RENAMING OF THE RED RIVER VALLEY AGRICULTURAL                     RESEARCH CENTER IN FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA AS THE                     EDWARD T. SCHAFER AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CENTER.         (a) Renaming.--The Red River Valley Agricultural Research       Center in Fargo, North Dakota, shall hereafter be known and       designated as the ``Edward T. Schafer Agricultural Research       Center''.        (b) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be considered to       be a reference to the Edward T. Schafer Agricultural Research       Center.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 2154, to rename the Red River Valley  Agricultural Research Center in Fargo, North Dakota, as the Edward T.  Schafer Agricultural Research Center. And this, Mr. Speaker, is in  spite of the fact that it is located at North Dakota State University,  which, in January of 2015, beat my Illinois State Red Birds for the FCS  football championship and caused me to have to bring cupcakes from  Normal, Illinois, to pay a bet with my colleague who is the author of  this bill, Congressman Kevin Cramer. So I still support this bill in  spite of those actions because it is a good bill, Mr. Speaker.   Ed Schafer served as North Dakota's Governor from 1992 to 2000, and  as our Nation's Secretary of Agriculture from 2008 to 2009. Renaming  the Red River Valley Agricultural Research Center in Fargo, North  Dakota, to honor Secretary Schafer is a fitting tribute to his  distinguished career in public service.   Located in Secretary Schafer's home State and at one of the Nation's  premier land grant universities, this research center continues to  advance its vital work on improving crops to strengthen our Nation's  food security. I greatly appreciate the work--in spite  [[Page H4275]]  of the cupcakes--that Congressman Kevin Cramer has put forth on this  bill, his leadership, and I urge my colleagues to join me today in  supporting this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson) for supporting this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from North Dakota  (Mr. Cramer), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleagues  from Minnesota and North Dakota. I urge all Members to support this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
