 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, on September 30, the Children's Health  Insurance Program expired. It has now been 25 days since the Congress  has put our children's health and well-being on the back burner. My  colleagues and I do not think that children's health belongs on the  back burner. So we have come to the floor of the Senate to spend the  afternoon speaking up for kids.   Thank you to everyone who joins me today to say that we should not  wait any longer to make sure that children, community health centers,  and new mothers have access to the healthcare programs that they need.   Republicans control Congress. It is up to them what we vote on and  when we do it. So what was more important to the Republican leadership  than the health of little kids? Republican leaders blew through the  days before the children's healthcare deadline by trying to repeal  healthcare for millions of Americans.   Once the Children's Health Insurance Program had already expired,  Republican leaders burned through more time by holding a series of  votes on a budget with giant tax cuts for billionaires and giant  corporations that would also gut Medicare, Medicaid, and a bunch of  programs that help working families. Republicans jammed through their  terrible budget without a single Democratic vote last week, 19 days  after blowing past the deadline to fund healthcare for kids.   Last night, 24 days past the deadline to make sure the kids had  healthcare coverage, what were Republican leaders doing? Republican  leaders stayed up late into the night holding a vote to make it easier  for financial institutions to cheat people.   The days continue to tick by--24, 25. Tomorrow Members of Congress  will leave for the weekend, 26 days past the deadline, and still there  will be no vote to fund this critical program.   Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Orrin Hatch, a Democrat and  Republican, wrote this legislation together back in the late 1990s. The  Children's Health Insurance Program, also called CHIP, provides health  insurance to low-income children and to pregnant women. Senator Kennedy  and Senator Hatch created this program because they knew that providing  healthcare coverage for children would make them healthier as children  and healthier even after they grew up. They knew that some children  were slipping through the cracks, and this was their solution. The  children covered by CHIP didn't qualify for Medicaid, they weren't  covered by employers, and they couldn't afford to buy private  insurance.   In 1997, 15 percent of all the children in this country lacked any  form of health insurance coverage. Today, because of the CHIP program  and the Affordable Care Act, that number has shrunk to 5 percent of  children. CHIP works with Medicaid to provide health insurance for one  out of every three kids in this country.   States choose whether or not they want a CHIP program. Here is the  deal. Every single State has chosen one because every single State  recognizes the value of providing their children with healthcare  coverage. In Massachusetts, the percentage of children with healthcare  coverage is even higher than the national average. It is at 99 percent.  We are doing something right here.   The original program was set for 10 years, and since then, every few  years, Congress has had to act to reauthorize the program so that  children can continue to get healthcare coverage. The CHIP program has  been reauthorized four times since 1997, and not one of those times has  Congress missed the deadline--not one--until now. In fact, in past  years, Congress has made sure to reauthorize the program many months  ahead of its expiration in order to give States the time they need to  plan their budget. It sounds like a pretty sensible thing to do--but  not this year. We are 25 days past the deadline for reauthorizing  CHIP--25 days and counting. This isn't fair to States, to kids, or to  their families.   So what actually happens now?   Well, the money runs out. Eleven States are set to run out of their  CHIP funding by the end of 2017, and the others, soon after. Our  Republican Governor in Massachusetts sent me a letter on day 3 past the  CHIP deadline, and he wrote:         Parents are already afraid that their children's insurance       may be lost in the near future. With each passing week, their       fears continue to grow.    My Governor is right. States have to start making tough decisions.  They may have to decrease enrollment, turning away sick little kids who  qualify for coverage but don't make it through the door on time. They  could start kicking kids off of their insurance saying: Sorry, we just  can't help anymore. Or they could be forced to make tough calls on  benefits: We can't cover the wheelchair you need to get around. There  is no physical therapy or no prenatal care until the funding comes  through again.   That is just flat out immoral. Tax cuts for billionaires shouldn't  come before making sure that a sick kid gets the help he or she needs.  Mothers are lying awake at night. Fathers are tossing and turning,  worrying about their healthcare coverage. What is the Republican  leadership doing? Tomorrow they will be heading home for the weekend  without lifting a finger to fund a bipartisan program that has been  reauthorized four times over the past 20 years.   If that isn't bad enough, September 30 wasn't just the deadline for  Congress to reauthorize CHIP. We also blew past the deadline on several  other healthcare programs to help children, to help pregnant women, to  help older Americans, and to help the chronically ill. We blew past the  deadline to reauthorize the Community Health Center Fund and the  National Health Service Corps, which funds health centers and supports  healthcare workers that provide children with high-quality primary  care. We blew past the deadline to reauthorize the Maternal, Infant,  and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, which funds home visits to  new and expectant parents to give them help keeping a new baby healthy  and safe. We blew past the deadline to reauthorize the Special Diabetes  Program, which funds diabetes research that could offer hope to many  children living with diabetes.   When a kid is sick, moms and dads move Heaven and Earth to get them  the care they need. They don't wait 25 days to go to the doctor and  check to see if something is wrong. They stay up all night to make sure  their little ones are all right. They wait outside the hospital room,  pacing until they get an answer, but Republican leaders in Congress  just don't seem to care. They don't seem to care if these families have  the health insurance coverage they need so they can get an x ray or pay  for an antibiotic or run some tests.   Twenty-five days, 26 days, 27 days--it just doesn't seem to matter to  Republican leaders, but it sure matters to moms and dads and kids in  Massachusetts and all over this country.   Senator Kennedy used to say: ``The test of greatness for a nation is  how it cares for its children.'' Right now Republican leaders in  Congress are failing that test. My colleagues have come to the floor  today to say that time is up. We are here to fight for kids.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.  [[Page S6806]]
