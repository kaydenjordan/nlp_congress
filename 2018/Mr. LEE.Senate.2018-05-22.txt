 Madam President, I come before you today to recognize  seven exemplary young men and women from the great State of Utah who  have answered the call of service to our country. It is a great  privilege to represent these exceptional Utahns in the U.S. Senate, who  will attend the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Military Academy, and  the U.S. Naval Academy.   Each year Members of Congress, under title 10 of the U.S. Code, are  authorized to nominate a number of young men and women from their  district or State to attend the country's service academies. I am proud  to honor these Utahns as they undertake this calling.   Each of these students is of sound mind and body, which will serve  them well in Colorado Springs, West Point, and Annapolis, but to  succeed, they will need more than this.   In addition to mental and physical aptitude, the journey upon which  these young men and women will soon embark demands strong moral  character: leadership, courage, honesty, prudence, and self-discipline.  It calls for a commitment to service and love of country.   These students have already displayed these qualities of character  and standards of excellence upon which America's service academies are  built. Today, I would like to recognize and congratulate these  dedicated and generous young men and women.   Delia Margene Cheney will be attending the Air Force Academy after  graduating from the Utah Military Academy, where she served as  commander of the largest Air Force JROTC program in the western United  States. She was captain of both her school's academic team and  volleyball team and served as a member of their State champion drill  team. Delia was also a delegate to Girls State and served as an intern  for two sessions of the Utah State Senate. She stayed active in her  community through service with the National Honor Society, as well as  her choir and church youth group.   Daniel Scott Dwyer, from Bingham High School, accepted an appointment  to the U.S. Naval Academy. Daniel serves in the Boy Scouts as a senior  patrol leader and earned the rank of Eagle Scout with a project that  entailed sending care packages to marines serving in the Middle East.  He ran with both the Bingham Miners' track and cross-country teams and  was a member of the JROTC. He also served his peers as a volunteer with  special needs youth, all while taking rigorous classes and maintaining  a high GPA.   Talmage Cragun Gaisford will be attending the U.S. Military Academy.  As a graduate of Orem High School, Talmage was a member of the National  Honor Society and received high honor roll awards. He earned the rank  of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts and served as a volunteer in Accra,  Ghana, where he worked to build an orphanage. In addition to serving as  a leader in his church's youth organization, he served on the Orem City  Youth Council and is an avid mountain biker and hiker.   Gage Geoffrey Maki attended the New Mexico Military Institute after  graduating from Park City High School. He worked hard and earned an  appointment to the U.S. Air Force Academy. Gage, whose parents are both  graduates of the U.S. Air Force Academy, was a leader in both the Air  Force JROTC and the Civil Air Patrol. He attended Boys State and earned  the rank of Eagle Scout, where his ambitious project led to the  replanting of hundreds of trees in an area devasted by a forest fire.  Gage has trained as a skeleton athlete with the Junior Development USA  Bobsled/Skeleton Team.   Malachi Kay Ruf will be joining his brother at the Air Force Academy.  Malachi graduated from North Summit High School and has been attending  Utah Valley University. He served as drumline bass captain and the  congress debate captain, as well as vice president of the debate team  and the Leos. He was honored to attend Boys State and was a member of  his school's State champion swim team. Malachi sought opportunities to  serve others as a volunteer for Primary Children's Festival of Trees,  collecting prescription glasses with the Lions Club, volunteering for  local triathlons and races, and playing cello at church and community  events.   Tasia Stevens accepted an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at  West Point. She graduated from Murray High School where she was captain  of both the soccer team and basketball team, where she was named MVP. A  model student-athlete, Tasia maintained a 4.0 GPA while excelling in  sports and volunteering hundreds of hours at the Loveland Living Planet  Aquarium. She provided additional community service with the National  Honor Society and was a member of high school German club.   Sariah Kim Watchalotone will be attending the Air Force Academy. A  graduate of West High School, Sariah was president of both the DECA and  horticultural clubs and vice president of Panther Pals. She captained  both her high school volleyball team and the High Country Volleyball  National Team. Sariah volunteered with the Rescue Mission of Salt Lake  City, Community Animal Welfare Society, and with University of Utah  Health Care. Her grandfather, who served in the South Korean Army, has  instilled in her a love of country, and inspired her to enter the  military and live a life of service.   It has been my distinct honor to speak to and nominate each of these  admirable young men and women. These Utahns give me great hope for the  future of our great Nation and the future of our Armed Services.   To these seven students and to all their future classmates from  around the country, I commend your achievements. I urge you to remember  the foundation of your success thus far: hard work and sacrifice.   Strive to continue on the path of strong moral character and to keep  love of country as a guiding principle. If you stay this course, your  future will hold great things in store. I wish you all the best as you  embark on this journey.   Thank you.  [[Page S2830]]                                ____________________
