 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, having Scott Pruitt in charge of the EPA  is bad for the air we breathe and the water we drink, and it is bad for  American leadership on climate. It is not just that I have a different  view from Mr. Pruitt on the Environmental Protection Agency, it is that  he has made a career out of undermining the Clean Air and Clean Water  Acts. It is not just that he is a Republican or that he doesn't share  my views about clean energy.   Look, I understand that when a Republican administration comes in,  their EPA nominee is going to have a different view of what the Agency  ought to be doing. I am not suggesting that we are going to get Henry  Waxman or Jeff Merkley to run the EPA. That is not what is going on  here. Here is what it is, and I want people to listen carefully.   Scott Pruitt is a professional climate denier. That is his job. He  has made his political bones trying to shred the EPA's ability to  enforce the laws that protect clean air and clean water. The core  mission of the EPA is to safeguard public health by enforcing the laws  on the books, and the cornerstones of the EPA's authorities are the  Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. These laws were passed over 40  years ago with huge bipartisan majorities, and they have been extremely  successful.   It is especially important for the dozens of young people watching C- SPAN right now to understand that the state of the environment in the  late 1960s was catastrophic, like out of a science fiction movie. Even  for those of us who were around, it is a good reminder of what the EPA  has accomplished over the decades.   The Cuyahoga River in Ohio was so polluted that it caught on fire.  Lake Erie was so polluted that almost nothing could live in it.  Bacteria levels in the Hudson River were 170 times above levels that  could be considered safe. Raw sewage was directly discharged into  rivers and streams where children swam. The FDA found that 87 percent  of U.S. swordfish contained so much mercury that they were unfit for  human consumption. Then the Clean Water Act was passed. We made  incredible progress in the last 44 years. We still have a long way to  go, as about one-third of our waterways are not yet fishable and  swimmable, as the law requires.   Scott Pruitt's opposition to the Clean Water Act and EPA makes me  terrified that we could go back to the bad old days of water pollution.  EPA's enforcement of the Clean Air Act is an even bigger success story.  This law has saved millions of lives and improved the health of  millions of others. EPA's enforcement of the law has reduced air  pollution by 70 percent since 1970. Smog levels in L.A. have fallen  two-thirds since their peak. Lead in the air is down 98 percent, carbon  monoxide down 85 percent, sulfur dioxide down 80 percent. Acid rain is  down over 50 percent and at a fraction of the anticipated cost. But  this progress is in real jeopardy.    As the Oklahoma attorney general and as the head of the Republican  Attorneys General Association, he dismantled the unit in his office  charged with enforcing Federal environmental laws and stood up a unit  to undermine Federal environmental law. He led the opposition to the  Clean Power Plan. He sued the Federal Government over a dozen times to  prevent the implementation of rules that would protect our health and  our environment. What he does is fight the EPA. That is his thing.   As Oklahoma attorney general, he literally--I am not making this up-- he literally copied and pasted a letter from a major oil company onto  his official State attorney general letterhead and then sent it to the  EPA as though it were his own.   I have never met Mr. Pruitt--and I assume he is personally a good  guy--so I will say it like this: A person who works so closely with  industries that  [[Page S336]]  pollute our air and water is an unusually bad fit to run the EPA. Never  before in the history of the EPA has a President nominated someone so  opposed to the EPA to run it, and on the most significant environmental  challenge of our generation, he is aggressively wrong. He has said that  the climate debate is ``far from settled'' and that ``scientists  continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and  its connections to the actions of mankind.'' This, of course, is nuts.  The climate debate is settled and has been for some time. More than 97  percent of climate scientists agree that the climate is changing and  that humans are responsible. Ask a scientist, ask a farmer, ask a  fisherman, ask a skier or snowboarder. If you don't believe 97 percent  of scientists, will you at least believe your own eyes?   His position even puts him at odds with the Department of Defense,  which has called climate change a ``threat multiplier.'' Here is the  good news. We are actually making a lot of progress in clean energy,  almost all of it in the private sector. The cost of solar power has  dropped by 60 percent in the last 10 years and more new solar capacity  was added in 2016 than any other energy source. Wind power was by far  the largest source added to the grid in 2015. Clean energy generation  grew by about 20 percent in the last year, and the long-term extensions  of the renewable energy tax credits give us hope to think that kind of  trajectory can be sustained. This comes at a time when public concern  about climate change is at an alltime high, and with three-quarters of  Americans, including half of Republicans, supporting Federal efforts to  reduce carbon pollution.   This progress is fragile, and confirming Scott Pruitt can undermine  our momentum. Again, here is Mr. Pruitt in his own words about the  Clean Power Plan: ``The EPA does not possess the authority under the  Clean Air Act to accomplish what it proposes in the unlawful Clean  Power Plant.'' This is flat wrong.   Let me quickly explain a lawsuit called Massachusetts v. EPA. The  Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to regulate  air pollution and carbon pollution as a pollutant so it is not only  that the EPA may regulate greenhouse gas emissions, under the Clean Air  Act they are actually required to do so. Mr. Pruitt has bragged that he  ``led the charge with repeated notices and subsequent lawsuits against  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.''   On climate change, he has said:         Is it truly manmade or is it just simply another period of       time when the Earth is cooling, increasing in heat? Is it       just typical, natural type of occurrences as opposed [to]       what the administration says?    I cannot think of a person more ill-suited to run this Agency.   On clean energy, the Chinese are leading. Mexico is leading. Europe  is leading, Germany, Africa. The question isn't whether the clean  energy revolution will occur, the question is whether we will lead it  or get left in the dust.   This is where we are. A nominee who does not understand the vital  role of clean air, clean water, and protecting the environment has been  nominated to lead the EPA, who denies decades of scientific research.   To my Republican colleagues, I have had many encouraging, rational  conversations about climate with you but almost exclusively in private.  I say this. This vote is the litmus test, the one your grandkids will  ask you about. I know being in the Senate is about making choices--and  lots of times it is great--but this issue, this vote is absolutely  simple: Don't vote for a climate denier. You cannot dabble in  conservation or energy efficiency or vote for a budget amendment  recognizing the scientific consensus on climate change and then vote  yes on this nominee. If you say you are not a climate denier, this is  the point in your career when you get to prove it. If we find another  nominee, even one who hates the Clean Power Plan, who shares your view  on federalism, who shares your view about the United Nations, about  President Obama, that is fair, that is fine, but this nominee is out of  bounds.   Please, consult your voters, your university experts, talk to your  kids. It is their planet. It is their future--or consult with your own  conscience.   I know sometimes politics is complicated and the right thing to do is  not that easy to determine in the fog of the battle. This is not one of  those times. For future generations, for the planet, for the future of  the Republican Party, you have to get this one right. If you are not a  climate denier, do not put one in charge of the Environmental  Protection Agency.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.
