 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize New Freedom Farm in  Buchanan, Virginia.   Founded in 2016 by Lois Fritz, New Freedom Farm is a nonprofit  community that aids veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress  disorder, substance abuse, and traumatic brain injury.   Through animal therapy, farming, and peer-to-peer support, this  tremendous organization strives to empower veterans and help them heal  through the realization of their own efforts and contributions. The  farm says its mission is to heal heroes through horses.   At the facility, veterans often develop deep friendships through  equine activity and gentling, fostering, physical, emotional, and  spiritual health, which helps with reintegration into civilian life.   They offer their services to veterans entirely free of charge and say  they are able to operate through donations and faith.   I applaud the entire team at New Freedom Farm for their passion and  commitment to serving those who serve our Nation. I wish them continued  success moving forward and thank them for their incredible work.                            ____________________
