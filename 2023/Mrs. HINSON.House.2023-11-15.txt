 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize two  outstanding Iowans: John Ockenfels and Peter Teahen.   Between May 5 and July 30, these two lifelong friends embarked on a  journey to fly around the world. Taking off from Cedar Rapids in a  single-engine plane, John and Peter flew more than 25,000 miles to  complete one mission: eradicating polio.   Only 700 pilots have ever flown around the world, and fewer than 300  of them are alive today. I am so proud to say that John and Peter are  among their ranks, having accomplished this feat to help save children  all over the world.   Iowans are so proud of John and Peter for this accomplishment and for  their service to such a worthy cause.                            ____________________
