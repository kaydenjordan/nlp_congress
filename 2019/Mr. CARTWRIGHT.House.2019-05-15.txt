 Madam Speaker, for nearly a decade, the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act has helped millions of Americans get  the care that they need. It has allowed parents to keep their kids on  their own insurance plans, and it has protected millions and millions  of Americans who are living with preexisting conditions, and that piece  is so important.   It means that Americans living with cancer, living with heart  disease, and living with diabetes can no longer be thrown off their  plans or denied coverage simply because of their medical history.   In my own State of Pennsylvania, more than 5.4 million people depend  on these protections to treat their asthma, to afford their insulin,  and to receive treatments for other preexisting illnesses.   Madam Speaker, I promise these families that I will keep fighting to  keep them healthy, which is why this week I am voting for the  Strengthening Health Care and Lowering Prescription Drugs Costs Act  which will ban junk insurance plans that don't offer sufficient  coverage, bring lower-priced generic prescription drugs to market more  quickly, and invest in helping Americans sign up for healthcare.   That is what Democrats are focused on, moving forward, making sure  seniors, veterans, and working families across our Nation have the  healthcare they need. I hope the current administration will see this  as an opportunity to work with our House majority in order to lower the  cost of prescription medications, and I hope Republicans in Congress  will join us in our mission to keep working for the people and to make  sure that every American can afford their prescription medications and  their healthcare.
