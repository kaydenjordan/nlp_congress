 Mr. Speaker, I rise unscripted and sober in  respectful support for my brothers and sisters of the thin blue line  from sea to shining sea. These men and women behind the badge rise each  day and serve each night as we work and as we slumber, sure to face  dangers unknown, certain to face enemies unseen, and sometimes to be  completely unappreciated. This week, we recognize them and we celebrate  them.   To my brothers and sisters of the thin blue line, please hear that  your support within this body is unwavering and shall not falter.   God bless you, one and all.                            ____________________
