 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Transportation Assistance for Olympic Cities Act and the LA28 Olympic  and Paralympic Games Commemorative Coin Act, which I introduced today.   While the eyes of the world will be on the Olympic and Paralympic  Games in Los Angeles in 2028, the work preparing our region for this  grand stage is already starting. That is why I am proud to introduce  these bills that will help carry out the Games and make investments in  the region and across our Nation.   The Transportation Assistance for Olympic Cities Act would ensure the  Federal Government provides critical assistance for surface  transportation projects and plans relating to international Olympic,  Paralympic, and Special Olympics events. The transportation plans made  in the coming years will not only make the Olympics and Paralympics run  smoothly but will also be an investment in infrastructure that will  benefit commuters and the region for years to come.   This bill would also allow the Department of Transportation to  prioritize Federal transportation grants for projects relating to an  Olympic, Paralympic, or Special Olympics International event and to  provide funding for temporary facilities, equipment, operations, and  maintenance that meet the extraordinary needs associated with hosting  such events.   The LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games Commemorative Coin Act would  direct the Treasury Department to mint coins in commemoration of the  ninth time that the United States will host the modern Olympics and the  third time that our Nation will host the Paralympics. This bill would  come at no cost to the Federal Government. Any surcharges from the sale  of the coins would support the hosting of the 2028 Games and aid in the  execution of legacy programs, including the promotion of youth sports  in the United States.   I want to thank Representative Brownley and Representative Sherman  for co-leading these bills with me, and I hope our colleagues will join  us in support of these bills that will help Los Angeles, California,  and our entire Nation prepare for the successful administration of the  2028 Olympics and Paralympics.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Transportation Assistance for Olympic Cities Act and the LA28 Olympic  and Paralympic Games Commemorative Coin Act, which I introduced today.
