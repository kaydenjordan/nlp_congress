 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the distinguished  service of Michael ``Mike'' Sprayberry who will be retiring as director  of North Carolina Emergency Management on August 1, 2021. Every citizen  of North Carolina is indebted to Mike for his tireless efforts over the  last 16 years to respond and rebuild following the countless disasters  big and small that the State has faced.   Since his appointment as deputy director for North Carolina Emergency  Management in 2005 and subsequent elevation to director in 2013, his  department has been called upon to respond to 32 Federal emergency and  disaster declarations, ranging from hurricanes and tornadoes to fuel  shortages and a global pandemic. Throughout his time, he has served  under four Governors and provided steady leadership to ensure that the  State of North Carolina is prepared to respond to any crisis at all  times.   While being charged with running emergency management operations for  a large State is never easy, the last 5 years would have been an  insurmountable challenge to almost anyone except to Mike Sprayberry. In  2016, Hurricane Matthew slowly crawled up the southeastern coast  bringing record setting rain across nearly half of the State. While  many had termed Hurricane Matthew a once in a generation event, less  than 2 years later Hurricane Florence stalled along the coast once  again bringing historical rains. In some areas of southeastern North  Carolina over 30 inches of rain fell, cutting off Wilmington, NC, and  other communities from the outside world for days. Through it all, Mike  oversaw the rescue and sheltering of thousands of displaced North  Carolinians while also ensuring that information continued to flow to  Senator Tillis, myself, and other Federal agencies to allow for better  federal coordination.   While communities across the State are thankful for North Carolina  Emergency Management's quick response at the height of the storms to  rescue hundreds trapped in their homes due to flood waters, Mike  Sprayberry's lasting legacy will be his dogged effort to rebuild North  Carolina better and more resilient than before. Understanding that  billions of Federal aid would be coming to support recovery, Mike  advocated for the creation of the North Carolina Office of Recovery and  Resiliency, including the establishment of the State's chief resilience  officer, one of the first such positions in the country. He is a fierce  proponent of the development of affordable housing and challenges his  team daily to think about the long-term impacts they can make in storm  preparation, storm recovery, and everything in between.   Mike Sprayberry has lived a life of service first as a U.S. marine,  then 25 years in the North Carolina National Guard as a field artillery  and infantry officer, and finally serving as director of North Carolina  Emergency Management. While he will be missed, his reputation and the  culture of preparedness he has built in the organization and across the  State will live on.                            ____________________
