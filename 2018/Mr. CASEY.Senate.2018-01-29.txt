 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, tonight I rise to speak about two matters.  The first is the issue of community health centers, which, of course,  is a major issue for States across the country.  [[Page S555]]    Millions of Americans get their healthcare through community health  centers. I will mention it more than once--800,000 of them are in the  State of Pennsylvania. As we come closer to working out bipartisan  agreements on a whole range of issues that are ahead of us literally in  the next 2 to 3 weeks, I hope there will be a strong consensus to  provide a funding plan and funding certainty to community health  centers across the country.   These community health centers provide access to healthcare through  education, rehabilitation, preventive services, and direct care. These  centers focus on meeting the very basic healthcare needs in a  community. They provide critical services, especially for people in  both urban areas and rural areas, where there are often limited options  for primary care and prevention clinics.   Despite the critical importance of these health centers, Congress  failed to act to extend the majority of funding for community health  centers before it ran out on September 30, 2017. After funds expired,  the health centers were facing a funding reduction of between 60  percent and 70 percent of their funding.   Last December, Congress passed a continuing resolution that included  $550 million in funding for community health centers. That is nowhere  near what they need to get through even 1 year. While this funding  patch will provide some short-term relief, the funds do not provide the  long-term funding stability for health centers that they need and that  the patients who depend upon them should have a right to expect.   It is time for Congress to end the delays and get a long-term funding  plan in place for these community health centers by the next deadline  for the continuing resolution for funding, which is, of course,  February 8. Because there is a deadline, it does give us the chance to  work toward that date, to get funding in place by the 8th.   Across the United States, health centers serve more than 25 million  patients per year. That is about 1 in 13 Americans overall. Consider  this: I live in a State where we have 67 counties, but 48 of the 67 are  so-called rural counties. That is the way they are categorized. There  are a lot of healthcare needs in those rural communities and rural  counties. Health centers provide care to one in four rural Americans.  If that ratio were applied to Pennsylvania--we have at least 3 million  people who live in rural communities. You can see the numbers. Hundreds  of thousands of Pennsylvanians in rural areas depend upon healthcare  from these community health centers.   In terms of the centers themselves, in 2016, Pennsylvania had 264,  and that meant there were thousands of people working in those health  centers. There are close to 5,000--above 4,900 Pennsylvanians who work  in these centers. These health centers provide quality care and vital  services, as I said before, to a total of 800,000 Pennsylvanians-- rural, urban, and otherwise.   To give you a sense of some of the testimony I received from people  in our State, one story came from Emily, who works at the Family  Practice and Counseling Network, a location I just visited today in  Philadelphia. She wrote this letter to me a number of weeks ago. I  won't read the whole excerpt, but this is what she said in pertinent  part about the people who are served by these community health centers:         They have lives filled with trauma and in turn suffer from       social, physical, and behavioral issues that will go       untreated if funding for [community health centers] goes away       . . . our services are so needed.    The words I want people to remember are ``lives filled with trauma.''  That is, unfortunately, a good description of the lives led by a lot of  Americans when healthcare--in this case, a community health care  center--is not there for them or when healthcare itself is threatened.  ``Lives filled with trauma.''   Another person who works at the same place and who has been the  leader of this particular institution, the Family Practice and  Counseling Network in Philadelphia, is the executive director, Donna  Torrisi. I met her just today. She sent me a letter prior to today  about her concerns. She is concerned about the funding cliff resulting  in a barrier to care for people who need mental health services that  are critically important. Donna said in pertinent part:         The impact on our community will be devastating. Our health       center provides behavioral health services that are already       limited in Philadelphia. Without funding, we'll need to close       a site and cut jobs, causing patients to go without the care       they desperately need.    For purposes of this debate, I would consider that expert testimony  on community health centers because I know that in Donna's case, she  has worked in this field something on the order of 25 years. We  appreciate her weighing in on this.   I know there is concern on both sides of the aisle on this issue. I  hope that concern results in a bipartisan agreement to fund community  health centers to at least--and I would like to do a lot more, but at  least give some funding certainty for the next year, meaning from now  until the end of the fiscal year. I hope we can get an agreement that  would give funding certainty for 2 years or more. That would be ideal.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to spend a couple of moments  tonight--I know the hour is late for the Senate and people working  here, but I want to end the night with a message about a law  enforcement official in Pennsylvania whose memorial service I attended  on Friday. This individual was a deputy marshal. His name is  Christopher David Hill. He lost his life on January 18. He was living  at the time in York, PA. He was killed in the line of duty in  Harrisburg--not far from York--while attempting to apprehend a  fugitive.   I commend Deputy Marshal Hill for his service to the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania and his service to our Nation. He happened to be working  in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, which meant he had  responsibility for work through counties from the bottom of the State  all the way up to Northeastern Pennsylvania, which is my home area.   I offer our deepest condolences to his family. Law enforcement  officers like Christopher Hill accept the special duty of protecting  the rest of us and keeping our communities safe. I have to say that we  often don't think about that in the context of Federal marshals who do  critically important work every day of the week and are often in  horrifically dangerous circumstances.   In this case with Deputy Marshal Hill, the murderer was shooting from  a higher position in a house. They didn't know this individual was in  the house. He was shooting down at him. He had protective gear on. I  won't give a full description because I am not qualified to do that,  but the problem is the bullet came from a direction like this and  entered his body from above and killed him even though he had  protection on and all the proper protocols were followed. It was, in  essence, a one-man ambush because they were trying to apprehend another  individual on the floor below where the assailant was. That is the kind  of danger Federal marshals face every day of the week, and sometimes we  don't realize it.   Chris and his loving family made the ultimate sacrifice for the  Nation and for the people in Pennsylvania. For his bravery and the  contribution of his family, who supported him, we are eternally  grateful for that commitment to law enforcement and the country.   Christopher David Hill was born in Sacramento, CA, but he was raised  in Central Pennsylvania. He graduated from Warrior Run High School. He  served his country as a Ranger in the U.S. Army, where he was assigned  to the prestigious 3rd Battalion. While in the Army, Chris earned many  awards, including the Army Commendation Medal.   For the last 11 years, he served as a deputy U.S. marshal. He was a  member of the agency's Special Operations Group, so-called SOG.   At the memorial service, there were lots of references to that  Special Operations Group because members of that group were there to  not only pay tribute to him but to speak about his life, to speak about  his service and to speak about his character and his bravery in very  moving testimonials. The Special Operations Group is a specially  trained and highly disciplined tactical unit.  [[Page S556]]    In 2012, Chris served on a SOG assignment in Afghanistan, for which  he was recognized with a Director's Distinguished Group Award.   In 2014, he was instrumental in the capture of notorious cop killer  Eric Frein. Eric Frein was the individual who killed a State police  officer and also injured another State police officer. In this case,  Chris commanded U.S. marshals, FBI agents, and State troopers in one of  the largest rural manhunts in recent American history.   Chris was known as a dedicated and extremely capable law enforcement  officer, and his numerous awards are proof of that.   During his time at the Marshals Service, he received the FLETC  Director's Leadership Award, a Special Act Award for Distinguished 300  Shooter, and a Special Act Award for achieving 95 percent weapons  proficiency.   Christopher was described as the person you wanted to go through the  door with, someone on whom you could completely rely. He was also known  for his sense of humor and his positive outlook on life.   Outside of work, he enjoyed hunting and golfing with his friends and  family, but most of all, Chris is known for his devotion to his family.  Chris is survived by his devoted wife Sylvia, his loving son and  daughter Travis and Ashlynn, his father John, his brother Joey, his  sister-in-law Michala, and his sister Melinda. He was preceded in death  by his mother Katherine.   As I mentioned before, on January 18, he was shot and killed in the  line of duty. The U.S. Marshals Service apprehends approximately  100,000 fugitives every year--100,000 every year--including the worst  of the worst, violent felons whose capture makes our communities safer.   Also shot in this altercation were Kyle Pitts, a New York City police  officer, and a Harrisburg police officer who took a bullet to his  ballistic vest but was not injured. We are praying for Kyle Pitts' full  recovery.   Last week, I joined law enforcement officers from around the country  for the memorial service, as I mentioned. You could tell how Chris was  loved and respected by the testimonials from those law enforcement  officials. You can't see it from a distance, but this is a program from  the memorial service. It has a list of those who spoke--I will not read  all of them--and then it has Chris's biography, with a picture of him  on the back.   I could go through virtually every name of the ones who spoke in  tribute to Chris--friends of his who worked with him. I am not sure I  have ever been to a more emotional and moving ceremony in my life,  where you had speak from the podium, one after another, these dedicated  law enforcement professionals who are as tough and as determined as any  man can be. Each person was very, very emotional, overcome with emotion  in some cases. I am not sure I will ever be at a ceremony that is as  moving.   On a night like tonight, when we have a lot of debates and a lot of  arguments on a range of issues, these are times we can come together to  express not only condolences, not only tribute and appreciation but  express, I think, what is the solidarity of our State and the Nation in  paying tribute to a fallen law enforcement official.   My colleague Senator Toomey and I were there together. There were  also people from across the State who were there and Federal judges who  serve in that district and Federal employees who worked with  Christopher Hill. For so many reasons, we want to pay tribute to him  tonight and express gratitude for his life of service and the  commitment he made to the country, that he made to the Marshals  Service, and that he made to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   We want to express our condolences to his wife Sylvia, to his family,  and his children because of the dedicated way they supported him  through all his years as a Federal marshal and as a law enforcement  official.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
