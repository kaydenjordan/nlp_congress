 Mr. Speaker, on May 31, the Department of Homeland  Security's Office of Inspector General published an alarming report  that confirms the terrible consequences of the Trump administration's  failure to truly address the humanitarian challenges we face at our  southern border.   Instead of working with Congress and leaders in our hemisphere on  addressing root causes and policy that represents America's values of  compassion, the administration, instead, chooses cruelty.   As a result, agents and officers are overworked, exhausted, and  frustrated. Communities like mine are stretched beyond capacity, and  migrants are in inhumane conditions.   The photos and description of the conditions at the Paso Del Norte  Processing Center in my district are beyond disturbing:   Migrants standing on toilets to make room and gain breathing space;   A cell with a maximum capacity of 35 holding 155 migrants;   Detainees wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks;   The list goes on.   I visited the PDN Processing Center when I was home this weekend, and  one thing is clear: Congress must establish, and DHS must abide by,  humanitarian standards. Not doing so is immoral and un-American.                            ____________________
