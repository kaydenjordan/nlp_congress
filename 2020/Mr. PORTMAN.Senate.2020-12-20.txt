 Mr. President, first, I am delighted that we are finally  at the point at which we are passing legislation to deal with the  COVID-19 crisis that has gripped my State and our country. We have a  healthcare pandemic, and we have an economic crisis. I am pleased to  say that, on a bipartisan basis, we are now coming together as we did 9  months ago with the CARES Act. It shouldn't have been 9 months, but we  now have a targeted bill that focuses on providing a bridge between now  and the time at which the vaccines will be widely available. We need  the help. The economy is faltering, as was just said, but also the  healthcare crisis in my home State and in so many other places has  gotten worse. So it is past time.   I am told I have given 21 speeches on the floor about the bipartisan  nature of this. There are so many areas of common ground, and I was  pleased to be part of the 10-person bipartisan group who put together  our own package over the last month. I think that helped to encourage  leaders on both sides to see that there was a lot of common ground,  that there were ways for us to come together.   One of my colleagues is on the floor with me now, Senator Stabenow of  Michigan. She is one of those Democrats whom I spoke to over a month  ago about this bipartisan process, and we talked about the common  ground and the ability for us to find ways to move ahead to help those  small businesses that truly are struggling; individuals who, through no  fault of their own, lost their jobs because of the economic crisis that  was precipitated by the pandemic; and to help our schools and to help  our healthcare providers and to help ensure that we are doing what we  can here to help at the local level to respond to this crisis.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am on the floor tonight to join my  colleague Senator Stabenow of Michigan to ask our colleagues to support  legislation that has to do with the Great Lakes. It is called the Great  Lakes Restoration Initiative. We are asking to reauthorize that  legislation.   This is one of those public-private partnerships that work. It is not  only public, like Federal public, and private; it is Federal, State,  local, and private individuals coming together to figure out how to  keep our Great Lakes the amazing treasure that they are.   I represent Lake Erie. It is on the north coast of Ohio. It is the  most shallow and also the most fertile of the Great Lakes. It has  incredible fishing. There is a gigantic, $7 billion fishing industry in  the Great Lakes. A lot of it is recreational fishing--$7 billion. It is  being threatened right now, really, by a few different things. One is  these Asian carp, so-called ``bighead carp,'' that are coming up into  the lake. We are doing all we can to keep them out, but this funding,  the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, focuses on that issue to keep  the carp from ruining Lake Erie as they have ruined other  [[Page S7865]]  bodies of water for recreational and commercial fishing.   Second, we have to deal with our toxic algae blooms. You have  probably heard about this. We have these blooms that are increasingly  forming in Lake Erie, particularly in the western basin of the Toledo  area. What they do is they keep people from being able to use the lake.  You don't want to swim in it. By the way, you don't even want your dog  to swim in it because the dogs can actually be injured by this. You  don't want to fish in it, of course, and you really can't.   I have gone fishing in the Great Lakes every year for the past many  years. I love the Great Lakes. Part of my childhood was on the Great  Lakes. When I was a little kid, with my dad, I went fishing on the  Great Lakes. You really can't fish when the algae blooms come in  because they are so thick, you literally can't get a lure or bait  through the algae blooms, and your boat has a tough time getting  through them.   This is a serious issue. At one point, it got so serious in the  western basin that it actually affected the water supply for the city  of Toledo. So several years ago, we had to stop the city water in  Toledo. I remember going there, with my pickup truck full of bottles of  water, to help hand out water because people--particularly moms with  babies--couldn't use the water. They were told: Don't allow your babies  to have formula made from the water in the faucet because it is too  dangerous, too toxic, because these algae blooms had gotten into the  water system.   That is how scary this is if we don't ensure that we are taking  efforts at every level--State, local, in the private sector, and at the  Federal. Lake Erie and the other Great Lakes now provide drinking water  for 40 million people. You want to be sure that treasure continues, not  just for recreation and fishing and swimming and so on but also for the  water supply for so many Americans.   The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is a downpayment, really, to  ensure that we can deal with these invasive species like the Asian carp  and others. It is to ensure that we can deal with the toxic algae  blooms and the erosion that is occurring as the water level has gone up  and also some pollution issues that remain in Lake Erie and in all the  Great Lakes.   The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative works. I have been to about 10  of these sights all around Ohio, and I have gone often with people from  the private sector and the local community and sometimes the State  government, and we talk about how, again, this is a model partnership.   As an example, I was at a farm in northwest Ohio, where, instead of  telling them, ``Hey, you have to stop farming because you are putting  nitrogen and phosphorus into the creek that goes by your farm, and that  is going into the Maumee River, and that is going into Lake Erie and  causing these algae blooms to grow,'' I asked, ``Hey, how can we work  with you as a farmer to try to reduce your runoff?''   We have had great success in that, but there is some expense in it.  Often, you have to provide for filters and pumps and so on to keep this  from going into the water supply and dealing with these upstream issues  with regard to algae blooms and phosphorus nitrogen.   So I am pleased to say that, as of tonight, it appears that we have  passed this on both sides of the Chamber through a so-called hotline.  We had to work with some of our colleagues to resolve some remaining  questions that they had for which we had answers because this is a  program that works, and I have seen it work.   I am really pleased to have partnered with Senator Stabenow. We are  cochairs of the Great Lakes Task Force. She is the Democratic cochair,  and I am the Republican cochair, and tonight I have partnered with her  on this legislation. I thank her for her friendship, her work on this  issue, and her passion for the Great Lakes.   I would like, if I could, to now turn to Senator Stabenow.    Mr. President, one other point from Senator Stabenow and  myself, and that is that we want to congratulate and thank our  colleagues in the House for working with us on this Great Lakes  Restoration Initiative and, in particular, the two cochairs in the  House from the Great Lakes Task Force and the two coauthors of the  Great Lakes Restoration Initiative legislation.   That would be Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and Representative    David Joyce from Ohio. We would like to thank them for their good work  and  [[Page S7866]]  congratulate them on tonight's passage as well                                 Coronavirus     First of all, I want to agree with my colleague from  Michigan and thank her for her work concerning behavioral health and  working with us in a bipartisan group on both behavioral health and  addiction because, unfortunately, during this pandemic, the epidemic of  drug addiction and drug overdose and overdose deaths has increased  dramatically, and it is a heartbreaking reality because we were making  progress, thanks to work here in this Chamber and in the States. Around  the country, we were actually reducing not just the number of people  addicted but the number of people who were suffering from overdose and  overdose deaths.   Unfortunately, this year we are now going to see the largest overdose  death rate in the history of our country, we believe. That is a sad  reality, and we need to address it--that is part of the COVID-19  package--along with the behavioral health issues that are also,  unfortunately, being exacerbated by the isolation that comes with the  COVID-19 issue and the helpless, probably, and the joblessness that we  have been seeing.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
