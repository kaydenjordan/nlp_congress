 Mr. President, I rise today to talk about my dear friend  and native Iowan, GEN Randy A. George, before we vote on his nomination  to be the next Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army.   As I said in the Armed Services Committee, I believe General George  is the right man for this critical job. General George grew up in  Alden, IA, a town with just over 700 residents. He joined the Army  straight out of high school and was later commissioned at the United  States Military Academy at West Point.   General George is a decorated war fighter with extensive combat  service, including in the Gulf War, the Iraq War, and the war in  Afghanistan.   He has been instrumental in leading our great Army, and I am excited  to see him confirmed to be the Chief of Staff of the Army.   As an Army veteran myself, I have full confidence that he will  continue to modernize the Army and maintain our highly trained and  lethal force to fight and win our Nation's wars.   General George is a hard-working public servant who knows the needs  of our soldiers and their families. He, too, is a great family man. And  I would like to thank his wife and his West Point classmate Patty and  their two children, Grant and Andy, for their selfless commitment and  support over the years.   I firmly believe that General George's qualifications, record, and  character--and, of course, his great home State of Iowa--make him the  right nominee to serve in this important role.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Katherine  James, a defense fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges for  the remainder of the Congress.
