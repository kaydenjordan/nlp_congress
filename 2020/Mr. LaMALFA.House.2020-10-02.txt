 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the beginning  of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.   One in eight women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime. Other  than skin cancer, this is the most common cancer among American women.  Over 42,000 of affected women are expected to die in 2020 in the United  States alone.   Rates have been declining since 2007, but there is more to be done to  make sure they continue to decrease.   As our Nation battles COVID-19, many people have delayed their annual  doctor's appointments. For women, delayed screening, most of all, can  be dangerous if breast cancer goes undiagnosed. Early detection is key  for those affected by the disease.   As a husband and a father to three girls, raising awareness for  breast cancer and encouraging them to be proactive with their health is  of the utmost importance.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to memorialize and remember  a friend that I first got to know when I got into the elective office  realm. His name is Rod Lindsay, a gentleman from Shasta County.   Early on, when I was a brand-new legislator and I didn't know a lot  of people in other parts of our vast district that we have in rural  northern California, it could be a little intimidating to get out and  learn these new places and meet new people. And so for that brand-new  legislator, this man here was one that embraced me fairly early on and  wanted me to be successful in that interaction that we had.   Mr. Rod Lindsay was many things, but during our overlap of time, he  was mayor of Shasta Lake and I was a board member of Shasta Lake for  several terms. More than that, he was a community leader that everybody  knew and gravitated towards.   Rod's heritage goes back as a member of the Miwok Nation Tribe in  more central California. Northern California is very rich and steeped  in Native American culture and history.    Rod was one to always help make sure that that culture was part of  the proceedings, part of what was going on in our communities for  different community events. Rod would lead prayer. Rod would lead  dance. Rod would lead in many ways that helped make sure the culture of  northern California had diversity.   We lost Rod recently, on August 27, after many years of service and  many years of leading. I always thought of Rod as kind of everybody's  elder, as kind of a Tribal elder for everybody in that Shasta Lake  area.   Rod did so much to help his community as an elected official, but  also as an advocate for education, advocating for children for over 40  years, including as an executive director of a group known as LIFE,  which is Local Indians For Education. He served on that until he passed  away.   Rod was a friend to many, a friend to me, a leader who just cared so  much about his community, his friends, his neighbors, his family, and  making things right for Tribes in northern California, as well.   You don't get many people like this in your lifetime in your path  that you cross, but I was proud to have walked that path and common  ground with Rod Lindsay.   I appreciate the time to be able to commemorate him here and  acknowledge him. Indeed, a beautiful ceremony was had for him in his  community just a few days ago, with a great outpouring of love and of  shared stories and participation by local Tribes in northern California  to have that heritage celebrated, as well.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the time that I was able to share with  you about him here today.                           Honoring Bruce Sessions     Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate a man who was  known as a voice in not only Butte County, where he had lived  previously, but a voice of mainstream media, he called himself, Bruce  Sessions. This was a surprise to me. I just got word of his passing  last night.   Anybody in Butte County who listens to the radio knows who he is.  Bruce spent many years on KRIJ radio, broadcasting from Paradise,  California, and then he was a news director at KNVR in Chico. But  finally, he was hired, where he really came into his own, on KPAY  radio, in 1991, as a talk show host.   All those afternoons Bruce hosted the KPAY Liveline. For 10 years, he  hosted that show, a 3-hour show each afternoon. And for me, way before  I got into the political realm, I was listening to it out in the fields  as I drove the tractor and helped plant a crop or harvest a crop or  irrigate in between.   Bruce was the voice of the Liveline all those afternoons bringing  largely conservative radio content to all of us in a several-county  area there, and doing it with a lot of fun and doing it with a lot of  humor--and a lot of self-deprecation, too.   Bruce was quite humorous, but also very pointed and very direct, too.  When I finally became an elected official, you would find yourself on  the end of: ``Are you doing it right? Are you doing what you said you  would do?'' So I appreciate that about him.   Before being in Butte County, before moving to Magalia, California,  Bruce spent 8 years as a reporter for radio stations down in the Las  Vegas area. I can see Bruce fitting in pretty good down in Las Vegas,  as well.   Bruce Sessions, indeed, was a treasure for our area, and I always  enjoyed him at community events and political events, where he would  bring that wry humor and his Navy humor, because he did spend many  years in the U.S. Navy.   One of Bruce's sayings as he signed off was, ``Always keep a zero  bubble,'' keep yourself level.   So, when Bruce finally retired from doing the talk show host every  day for those 3 hours, he backed off a little bit, but decided to still  keep his fingers on the pulse, so he would have a twice-daily feature  on KPAY radio called ``Tidbits from the B.S. Notebook,'' being his  initials. But there you get that wry humor again because that might  have a double meaning. Bruce would talk about the news events of the  day in that format and just still keep that voice out there, keep that  lively way of looking at things for those listeners in Butte County.   I always enjoyed Bruce and his commentary and his discussion on the  radio. It kind of helped me to understand things about life and about  politics, as well, from a guy who had been around the block and was  paying attention to a lot of things while I was paying attention to  farming.   Madam Speaker, I will miss Bruce. I thank him for his service.   To his family, to those who go on, we all appreciated Bruce in Butte  County, by and large. Maybe not so much on the other side of the  political spectrum, but that is okay. We accept Bruce for who he was.  But I enjoyed Bruce, and I am grateful to have been a friend and a  listener for those many years in Butte County.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
