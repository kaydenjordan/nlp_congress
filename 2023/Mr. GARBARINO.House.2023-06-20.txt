 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a former  teacher on her retirement. Sue Hart was one of the best teachers I ever  had. As you can imagine, I probably wasn't the best student she ever  had, but I hope I made the top 100.   It wasn't just history that she taught me. It was a lot about life  and being a good person. I can honestly say I wouldn't be standing here  today if it wasn't for the impact that Mrs. Hart had on me when I was  growing up.   I wish her the best in retirement. I am happy that I can still call  her a friend, but I think the biggest shame about her retirement is  that future Sayville students won't be able to have her as a teacher,  including my children.   That being said, I do want to congratulate her and wish her the best.  So congratulations, Mrs. Hart. You deserve it.                            ____________________
