 Mr. Chairman, first and foremost, I thank Congressman Greg  Steube of Florida for introducing this important piece of legislation,  and Chairwoman Foxx for managing this afternoon's floor debate.   The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2023 will  safeguard the ability of female athletes to participate freely in an  athletic space that for decades has been specifically carved out for  these athletes to compete safely.   When biological males infiltrate these spaces, opportunities are  taken away from these biological females.   Earlier this month, the Biden administration proposed a new Title IX  rule prohibiting public schools from banning transgender male athletes  from competing in sporting events with girls and women and eliminating  the State's policy to promote integrity in sports.   The Biden administration is attempting to change the playing field,  but there is nothing equal or level about allowing biological men to  compete in women and girls' sports.   Coaches in East Texas that I represent understand the biological  differences between men and women, and they understand that there is  nothing equal about allowing men to compete in women's sports.   This legislation will ensure that schools who receive Federal funding  can still protect biological women's and girls' rights to freely and  fairly participate in sports. As a father of two boys and two girls,  this is important to me. This will safeguard and uphold the integrity  of women's sports and the true intention of Title IX.   Mr. Chair, I am proud to stand here on the House floor today in  support of this legislation.
