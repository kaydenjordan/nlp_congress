 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the continuing resolution  before us today.   I think we can all agree that continuing resolutions aren't the ideal  solution to funding our government. In fact, most of the people on the  Appropriations Committee hate continuing resolutions.                                time  1430    Ideally, all of our 12 appropriations bills would be enacted by  October 1. Last year, we were able to complete several bills on time,  including the energy and water bill.   But sometimes we need more time to complete our negotiations.  Considering that a budget deal was not enacted before last month, there  simply isn't enough time to complete work on these bills before the new  fiscal year.   So while continuing resolutions aren't ideal, supporting a short-term  CR to keep our government functioning is the only responsible vote  today--I will say that again. It is the only responsible vote today,  for our national security, for our economy, and for the general welfare  of the American people.   For instance, this bill will ensure the Department of Energy can  maintain our nuclear weapons stockpile and the Corps of Engineers can  dredge our ports and waterways so goods and materials can move freely.   I also appreciate that this bill recognizes our farmers. Agriculture  faces uncertain times and the temporary relief provisions, while not a  solution, do help.   I would also like to applaud the inclusion of a provision related to  the specialty crop initiative. This program is vital to the success of  potato farmers in Idaho.   We must avoid disruptions to these vital activities by passing this  continuing resolution before us today and then working towards  completing our work on the final appropriations bills, as the majority  leader said, by November 21.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this continuing  resolution.
