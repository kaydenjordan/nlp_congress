 Mr. Speaker, over this August break, my family and I  left our house, not because it was vacation season but because it was  wildfire season, and we were some of the thousands of people that were  evacuated from our homes. Now, thanks to the amazing work of  firefighters and first responders, we had a house to come home to, but  as we know, many others were not as lucky.   You see, the American West, including my district on the Central  Coast of California, is experiencing destructive wildfires where we are  not just victims of these conflagrations, but we are also witnesses to  the climate crisis.   Our climate is hotter. Our countrysides are drier, and our  communities are more vulnerable to this type of devastation. We can't  ignore it. We can't deny it, but we can pass the Climate Action Rebate  plan to reduce our carbon output. We can pass the bipartisan Emergency  Wildfire and Public Safety Act, and we can pass the bipartisan REPLANT  Act.   This is not a binary choice. We can do both. If we don't act, our  fire seasons will turn into fire years. But if we do act with  commonsense legislation in Congress, we will save not just our homes,  we will save this planet.                            ____________________
