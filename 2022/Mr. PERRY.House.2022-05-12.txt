 Madam Speaker, I am joined by my friends here this evening  to talk about the impending decision of the Supreme Court and, of  course, the things surrounding it, including the unfortunate,  unprecedented leak of the information from the Court, as well as the, I  think, heretofore unprecedented protesting at the homes of the Justices  that can only legitimately be described as an attempt to influence and  change their decision. We are going to get into all that.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Bishop), for some comments on this subject.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and those are indeed  inspiring and hopeful words as we stand ready to hear the Court's final  decision, not trying to leak it, not trying to persuade it unduly,  doing the work of democracy, of the representative Republic, speaking  on behalf of the people that we represent, our bosses, so that they can  decide, not just a few folks across the street here in robes, making  decisions for the whole country.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the good gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Norman).                                time  1845     Mr. Speaker, I am being joined by some of my other  colleagues here. Mr. Norman, Congressman Norman, mentioned the baby  formula. We are here to talk about the stain of abortion on our  country. But we are watching what is happening, talking about children  that need their formula.   Mothers need to feed their babies. They can't get it at the store,  yet we see the shelves are full down on the southern border, full of  baby formula.   What about America's babies, ladies and gentlemen? What about  America's babies?   Look, you don't have to take our word for it. We are here to talk  about the stain of all the lost lives of the innocent over these 49  years. But don't take our word for it. Don't take Republicans' word for  it.   How about Democrats? How about Governor Bob Casey in the Abortion  Control Act of 1982, where he had to go to the Supreme Court and fight  against Planned Parenthood for things like parental consent prior to a  minor undergoing an abortion? What a novel concept. Oh, so striking.   How about, just yesterday, The Washington Post, not known as a  bastion of conservatism, saying that yes, experts say protests at  SCOTUS Justice homes appear to be illegal, appear to be illegal because  title 18, section 1507 of the U.S. Code, says it is: cannot try and  influence the decision of the Court.   But the left doesn't care. Every single day when you wake up, you say  to yourself, I don't know how it could get much worse. I can't believe  what is happening, and I don't know what else could get worse than it  is. But then, every single day, something else unprecedented happens.  Today, that is occurring yet again.   If you don't believe me or The Washington Post or Bob Casey, Governor  Bob Casey v. Planned Parenthood--by the way, I am not sure how Governor  Casey would feel about his son's actions in the U.S. Senate when they  voted for the most extreme position, which would make abortion legal at  any point during the pregnancy, including up until the minute of  birth--voted for that. His father fought the good fight.   But what about Ruth Bader Ginsburg, celebrated leftist on the Court,  celebrated believer in abortion and protector of abortion, who said  that the 1973 law did too much too fast, said that ``doctrinal limbs  too swiftly shaped . . . may prove unstable.'' She knew this was a  stain on our humanity. She knew.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Hice).    Mr. Speaker, the good gentleman from Georgia reminded me,  as I said, you don't have to believe us Republicans. He reminded me  that President Biden said this is a child, what we have known all our  lives. But don't believe us if you don't want to. Believe your  President. He said it is a child. So we know, right? And we are so  grateful.   As people who love life, love the protection of life guaranteed in  the Constitution, we have suffered and prayed for 49 years. We didn't  like the decision 49 years ago, in 1973. We didn't like it, but we  didn't do the wrong thing. We used the system appropriately, as it was  designed by the Founders and the Framers of our great country, to  remove the stain of the loss of innocent life from our laws. We are on  the edge of that.   But the point is that there is a right way to do things. Even though  we disagree on occasion, we are a country of laws. If it is going to be  okay to break the law just because you disagree with a decision, well,  that is not a country that is going to endure very long.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Rosendale).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Indeed, life is  precious. It is a blessing. It is a gift. As a parent there is nothing  like it. We have lamented these last 49 years in the loss of these  innocent lives, and that our country could stand for that and support  that; not only just support it, but go out and campaign for it with our  tax dollars, with our rhetoric, with our policies around the globe.   Ladies and gentlemen, this is the United States of America where you  are guaranteed by our Creator, and ordained in the Constitution, the  gift of life, the blessing of life, the first gift, the first blessing.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Madam Speaker, I thank the good gentleman and all my  colleagues. Our time is almost over, but I just want to reiterate that  we--these Members here and many others on this side of the aisle, in  particular--stand for life.   We stand for the Constitution which guarantees that life. We stand  for the rights enumerated in the Constitution that are given to us by  God--granted to us by God. As my friend said: Can't be taken away--even  though some will try. When God gives them to you, they can't be taken  away. That is all by design.   We stand for the rule of law enshrined in the Constitution that folks  that would wish to subvert the rule of law--try and color the Court's  decision--they should be held accountable. All men are created equal  under the law. Apparently, under this administration some are more  equal than others.    Madam Speaker, that is the recipe for anarchy. We are thankful for  this opportunity to speak to our bosses, our employers, the ones who  rule over us, the good Lord, and our constituents this evening.   Madam Speaker, we are thankful for the time to speak on this very  important issue, stand for the Constitution, stand for the law, and  importantly, stand for life.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H4918]]                                ____________________
