 Mr. President, we are one day closer to Thursday's  government funding deadline. I am pleased to report that our bipartisan  talks are continuing to progress toward an agreement on spending caps  and important priorities all of us are eager to address. But as we  continue the negotiations, we have the opportunity to make real  progress with an immediate step that every Senator in the Chamber  should support; that is, passing a fiscal year 2018 Defense  appropriations bill.   We can vote to remove the uncertainty that is hanging over our Armed  Forces and secure the current year funding that our servicemembers  deserve. Funding cuts have fallen disproportionately on our men and  women in uniform. Current funding levels are not adequate to support  Secretary Mattis's new national defense strategy, and our military  leaders have made clear that short-term continuing resolutions are  hardly the optimal way for Congress to fund our warfighters.   Senators on both sides of the aisle say they agree that our  warfighters deserve sufficient, stable funding to fulfill the missions  and tasks their country assigns them. Today, each of us will have a  chance to back that up with our vote. The Senate will take up a  noncontroversial measure that passed the House with a comfortable  bipartisan majority. It presents an opportunity for us to unite and  give our all-volunteer military a full fiscal year of funding while we  finalize our talks on other subjects.    We should seize the opportunity and not delay any longer securing  current-year funding for the men and women who bravely keep us safe.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we have been talking for weeks about  the millions of Americans who are already benefiting from tax reform.  Already, millions of workers have received a tax reform bonus, pay  increase, or other benefit.   I understand that a $1,000, $2,000, or $3,000 bonus might not seem  like much to our colleagues from New York or San Francisco. I  understand why people who are already very wealthy might agree with my  friends the House and Senate Democratic leaders who said these bonuses  and benefits are merely ``crumbs.'' But, look, I can assure them that  the working families I represent do not see a permanent raise or a  multithousand-dollar bonus as a crumb to sweep off the table. In  millions of households, thanks to tax reform, paying the bills has  already gotten a little less painful and planning for the future has  already gotten a little easier. And this is just the beginning.   Soon, millions and millions more Americans will see the impact of tax  reform in their paychecks. IRS withholding is going down, take-home pay  is going up, and families everywhere will be keeping more of their  hard-earned money. This is great news for middle-class Americans. So  why are our Democratic friends afraid to acknowledge it? The reason is  simple. Every single one of them voted against tax reform.   Every Democrat in the House and in the Senate voted against these new  benefits for American workers. Every one of them voted against a pay  raise for the 90 percent of American workers who, according to a  Treasury Department estimate, are about to see their take-home pay go  up. I don't envy their position. I don't envy having to explain why  they voted to keep more money in Washington rather than give their  constituents a raise.  [[Page S618]]    Tax reform bonuses and more take-home pay aren't the only ways tax  reform will help American workers. The law also includes a creative new  solution to directly help the communities that are struggling the most.  We all know that too few new jobs were created during the Obama years.  Through heavy taxing and excessive regulation, Washington had its foot  on the brake of the U.S. economy. Job creation and wage growth were  weaker than they should have been, but another aspect of this often  goes overlooked.   Of the new jobs that were created from 2010 to 2016, according to one  estimate, three-quarters went to major metropolitan areas. Let me say  that again. Of the new jobs that were created between 2010 and 2016,  three-quarters went to major metropolitan areas. Only 3 percent of  those new jobs went to rural America. Across the Nation--including my  home State of Kentucky, particularly in Eastern Kentucky--many rural  areas, small cities, and suburbs were left behind in the Obama economy.  It is time to change that.   That is why my colleague the junior Senator from South Carolina made  sure that tax reform included a provision to create ``opportunity  zones'' across the United States. My Republican colleagues and I were  proud to support this policy. It allows State Governors to designate  economically depressed areas for special tax incentives that will make  them more attractive places to invest and create jobs. It will empower  communities that have been passed over time and again to put up, in  effect, big neon signs that say: ``We are open for business.'' It will  help these struggling communities reach their full potential.   This Congress is determined to reignite an economy that works for  everyone. That is why tax reform lets families across the country keep  more of what they earn. That is why tax reform makes America a more  attractive place to create jobs, and it gives our businesses a fairer  fight with foreign competitors. That is why tax reform includes this  ``opportunity zones'' provision, which will help deliver targeted  relief to communities that need it the most.   To most Americans, all this sounds like common sense. Republicans in  Congress thought so too. We came together to deliver these historic  achievements for the American people. It is too bad that not one single  Democrat got on board with any of this.   But at least the bigger paychecks, new bonuses, and new investments  will continue to roll in, and our constituents know exactly who stood  up for them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand that there are three bills  at the desk due for a second reading en bloc.
