 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 327,  I call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 39) disapproving the rule  submitted by the Department of Commerce relating to ``Procedures  Covering Suspension of Liquidation, Duties and Estimated Duties in  Accord With Presidential Proclamation 10414'', and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, we take a bipartisan step toward holding China  accountable for its trade abuses.   These trade abuses are well known to all of us in this Chamber. Most  recently, this past December, President Biden's Department of Commerce  found that China is circumventing tariffs on imports into the U.S. by  shipping solar products through, not one country, not two countries,  not even three countries, but in fact, four countries in Southeast  Asia.   These tariffs were put in place by President Obama since 2012 to  provide a level playing field for American manufacturers who were  facing unfair competition in the U.S. market from solar products that  China was subsidizing and selling at unfairly low prices. By  circumventing these tariffs by shipping its products through Cambodia,  Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, China has set up a solar panel export  scheme that cheats American workers and consumers.   So we know there is wrongdoing going on. We know China is cheating.  That is precisely why Members from both parties were stunned and  disappointed when the White House made the misguided decision to halt  for 2 years additional tariffs on Chinese solar products being sent  through these four countries.   At a time when China has a dominant position in solar production,  despite longstanding American innovation in this sector, should we  really be telling the world that there will be less accountability for  unfair trade practices?   The answer is not just no. Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely no.   But the President's proclamation to halt any new countervailing  duties and tariffs does just that. What is worse, it establishes a  lesser standard of accountability for China than the rest of the world.   The legislation before us today, H.J. Res. 39, Congressional Review  Act legislation on solar tariffs, will stop President Biden's  proclamation that has given a free pass for 2 years to unfair solar  imports from China that circumvent our trade laws.   The United States must maintain crucial protections for American  workers and our economy as a whole. We cannot surrender to China or any  other country and put American workers at a disadvantage.   This resolution has bipartisan support. I thank Representative Posey  for leading this initiative, and Committee on Ways and Means members   Dan Kildee of Michigan, Greg Murphy of North Carolina, Bill Pascrell of  New Jersey, Nicole Malliotakis of New York, and Claudia Tenney of New  York. The fact that Democrats and Republicans on our committee are  original cosponsors of this resolution shows just how bipartisan the  issue is.   We have to confront the Chinese Communist Party's bad behavior. We  have to hold it accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I urge votes in favor of this legislation, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to highlight another member of the House  Committee on Ways and Means that is a cosponsor and a supporter of this  resolution, Ms. Terri Sewell from Alabama.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Auxin Solar  founder and CEO thanking Speaker McCarthy and House Republicans for  bringing this resolution to the House floor. Auxin is a small  California company with 37 full-time employees that filed a petition  last year asking the Department of Commerce to investigate whether  Chinese firms were circumventing existing tariffs. Auxin strongly  supports this resolution so that the company and its workers can get  relief from unfair Chinese competition and end what it calls the get- out-of-jail-free card that President Biden gave to duty evaders.                                                    Auxin Solar,                                       San Jose, CA, April 27, 2023.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker: I'm writing to you on behalf of myself,       my business partner Sherry Tai, the 37 full-time employees of       Auxin Solar, and our families to thank you for bringing to       the floor for a vote H.J. Res.39, the Congressional Review       Act resolution.        By just bringing this resolution to the floor for a vote,       you are sending a strong signal that the United States       Congress will stand up against the Chinese Communist Party       and their unfair trade practices on behalf of American       manufacturers and our workers. More importantly, when we see       Congress vote on this resolution, you will be giving me and       Sherry the strength to continue our fight against unfairly       traded solar imports and the confidence to continue to       reinvest our personal finances into making Auxin Solar a       leader in U.S. solar manufacturing.        Sherry and I co-founded Auxin Solar in 2008 and, since that       time, we have been providing high-paying jobs to our       employees in Silicon Valley, California. In 2008, we       forecasted that solar cells and solar modules would       eventually become commodity products that could compete on a       cost basis with traditional energy sources. That has come       true. Solar deployment is reaching year-over-year all-time       highs because of the cost parity with traditional energy       sources. With our low overhead, competitive costs, and high       employee retention rates, we should have been printing money       in a growing demand environment. But what we didn't forecast       when we started Auxin Solar was the anticompetitive behavior       of China and the success that China would have in dominating       the solar supply chain.        In the early 2010s, China was so far behind the United       States in solar technology and know-how. To catch up, CCP       agents stole our intellectual property. Then the CCP used       draconian duties to effectively prohibit U.S. polysilicon       companies from selling into the Chinese market. When the U.S.       imposed duties to offset predatory pricing in solar, China       used its industrial policies to assist major Chinese CCP-      connected solar companies in their move out of China to       circumvent U.S. trade laws. It took just ten years but now,       China dominates the entire solar supply chain. They use       forced labor practices to mine polysilicon. They use coal-      fired energy to power ingot and wafer-making. And they use       Southeast Asia as screw-driver operations to circumvent trade       laws.        In the face of predatory Chinese pricing in the United       States, and when our domestic competitors closed, Auxin       continued to operate. Sadly, what we've learned in the last       five years is that the trade remedy laws are not designed for       medium-sized enterprises like Auxin. Take for example what       happened during the initial solar safeguard. Although demand       continued to grow with duties in place in 2018, major energy       companies complained and lobbied to attain an exclusion for       bifacial panels. Bifacial panels are solar modules that       generate electricity using both sides of the panel. Since       2016--well before the safeguard even started--Auxin Solar was       one of the only companies to produce bifacial panels in       America. Our bifacial panels were used in major utility-scale       projects in Lumberton, New Jersey and by Georgia Power at the       Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. They were also       used in Columbus, Ohio on the largest ever commercial rooftop       solar array ever installed. Since an exclusion for bifacial       panels was granted, bifacial panel pricing premiums collapsed       and bifacials quickly became the majority of imports. In       fact, just to avoid duties, companies will go so far as to       put bifacial panels on residential homes even though only one       side of the panel is used. This is done simply to avoid       duties and has the direct result of undermining Auxin's       business.        The same thing happened again when Auxin tried to stand up       and combat the surge in panels from Southeast Asia, which       consist almost entirely of Chinese content. Had these exact       same panels come directly from China, they would have been       subject to duties put in place by the U.S. International       Trade Commission. Although others in the domestic industry       wanted this circumvention loophole closed, we were the only       ones willing to publicly put our name on a filing. We were       immediately subjected to online harassment, cyber intrusion,       and attempted physical break-ins to our facility. Our stellar       Google reviews, which we use to pitch to potential employees,       became single star reviews accompanied by hateful language. A       website called ``ExposeAuxin.com'' was created to spread lies       and disinformation about us.        Against it all, we continued to have faith that the       Commerce Department's quasi-judicial process would work to       instill price discipline in the market and close the duty       evasion loophole. But President Biden mistakenly intervened       in our circumvention case because of a loud misinformation       campaign lead by Chinese special interests. The resulting       tariff-free holiday for all imports from Southeast Asia is       bad policy because it acts as a ``get out of jail free'' card       to duty evaders and sends a signal to law-abiding importers       that it doesn't pay to follow the law and pay a fair price       for a solar panel.        Today at Auxin Solar, we're operating at a fraction of our       capacity utilization because of the concerted effort to       silence us and scare us into withdrawing our trade fight. Our       ability to raise capital, hire new employees for expansion,       and secure new sales opportunities continue to be hampered.       Sherry and I are first generation immigrants. We are a       minority- and woman-owned medium sized business. When       politicians talk about how Washington should work better for       middleclass Americans, the ``tariff holiday'' does not do       that. Instead, it provides a windfall for Wall Street and       doesn't give a fighting chance to American workers to compete       against Chinese solar.        On broad policy, we must counteract the Chinese dominance       of the solar supply chain for our energy security. We should       be asking ourselves whether we want the Chinese Communist       Party to control our electricity grid. We should be asking       ourselves if the Chinese Communist Party will stifle our       ability to meet our carbon-neutral goals by imposing  [[Page H2095]]       export restraints on key technology or halting sales of solar       to the U.S. And we should be asking if we are okay with       meeting our carbon objectives on the back of forced labor,       from massive expansions in coal-fired power plants, and from       intellectual property theft. I've been in the solar business       for 15 years and solar deployment is good for business. But       there are bigger issues here than quarterly profits and       investor returns. This is why I strongly support your       creation of the bipartisan Select Committee on the Chinese       Communist Party, which should continue to shed light on these       issues for the American people to understand.        At Auxin Solar we've withstood Chinese predatory behavior       for 15 years. I refuse to let the Chinese prevail and put       Auxin Solar out of business. Right now we're in the midst of       a major capacity expansion at Auxin Solar funded by me,       Sherry, and our families. Once we have our expansion online,       we would be pleased to welcome you to visit so that we can       thank you in person for bringing H.J. Res. 39 to the floor       for an up-or-down vote.            Sincerely,                                                 Mamun Rashid, CEO.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey), the original sponsor of this  resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an  article from Politico called ``Trio of Democratic senators back  resolution to undue Biden's solar tariff pause.''                     [From POLITICO PRO, Apr. 26, 2023]     Trio of Democratic Senators Back Resolution To Undo Biden's Solar                                Tariff Pause                           (By Kelsey Tamborrino)         Three Democratic senators said Wednesday they'd vote to       rescind President Joe Biden's two-year pause on new solar       import tariffs from four Southeast Asian countries--raising       the stakes on the measure that is set to force Democrats to       weigh both trade and climate considerations.        Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) announced Wednesday that he'd       sign on to the resolution, marking another rebuke of the       Biden  [[Page H2098]]       administration's energy agenda from the West Virginia       Democrat. Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio)       separately also said Wednesday they'd support the measure       should it get a vote on the Senate floor.        The House is poised to vote this week on the measure, which       Biden has promised to veto should it reach his desk.        The resolution would undo the president's 24-month pause on       new import tariffs on solar cells and modules from Malaysia,       Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam following the start of a       Commerce Department probe that roiled the solar industry.        Commerce released initial results in December that found       companies were circumventing tariffs on Chinese solar       equipment by routing them through the four nations. A final       determination is expected next month.        Lawmakers, led by Reps. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) and Bill Posey       (R-Fla.) in the House and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) in the Senate,       introduced a resolution to rescind the rule enacting Biden's       two-year moratorium.        Manchin said Wednesday he would join the Senate resolution       as a co-sponsor, Scott's office and a Manchin spokesperson       confirmed.        While the Congressional Review Act resolution has       bipartisan support in the House, it so far had only       Republican cosponsors in the Senate.        ``The United States relies on foreign nations, like China,       for far too many of our energy needs, and failing to enforce       our existing trade laws undermines the goals of the       Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act to       onshore our energy supply chains, including solar,'' Manchin       said in a statement. ``I cannot fathom why the Administration       and Congress would consider extending that reliance any       longer and am proud to join this CRA to rescind the rule.''        Manchin on Wednesday also joined all 49 Republicans in       support of a separate CRA resolution that would overturn       EPA's recent rule limiting emissions of nitrogen oxides.        Wyden, the chair of the Finance Committee, told reporters       that he too would vote in favor of the solar resolution,       should it come to a vote on the floor.        ``I have told the administration that over the 10-year       period, when I was writing the clean energy bill, it was       always about manufacturing. Red, white and blue. Got to get       the jobs here.'' he said. ``So I'm going to be supporting the       manufacturing proposal.''        Brown shortly after released a statement that he was in       favor of the resolution.        ``My whole career--I don't care what presidents think about       this--I've taken on presidents of both parties, starting with       Clinton on [North American Free Trade Agreement]. And when       they're wrong on trade, it costs American jobs, and this is       the right decision,'' he said in an interview.        The solar tariff resolution is expected to put Democrats in       a tricky position, given supporters' argument that the       resolution is meant to enforce U.S. trade laws and combat       Chinese influence, while those opposing it argue it will       undercut solar energy progress.        Brown and Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania previously called       on the president to terminate the two-year suspension, and       Casey told POLITICO last month that he was inclined to       support the resolution should it come to the floor.        Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, who has previously       voted to undo another Biden rule, told POLITICO he has not       yet made a decision on the solar resolution.        The resolution advanced out of the House Ways and Means       Committee last week with Democratic support and is poised for       a floor vote later this week in the House.     Mr. Speaker, this article notes that three  Democratic Senators, including the chairman of the Senate Finance  Committee, Senator Wyden, Senator Manchin from West Virginia, and  Senator Brown from Ohio, have publicly supported rescinding President  Biden's action to pause tariffs on Chinese solar panels, even before  the CRA has even passed the House.   Mr. Speaker, I understand that at least one more Democratic Senator  has also expressed support. I thank my Democratic colleagues in the  House and in the Senate for joining me in standing up for American  workers by supporting consistent enforcement of our trade laws against  China's unfair trade practices.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Latta).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a  statement from the Uyghur Human Rights Project in support of H.J. Res.  39.                                    Uyghur Human Rights Project,                                                     April 18, 2023.        To the Members of the Committee: I write in strong support       of H.J. Res. 39. This bipartisan bill would repeal the Biden       Administration's Solar Emergency Declaration, a harmful rule       issued in June 2022 that protects Chinese solar manufacturers       that the Department of Commerce has determined are illegally       avoiding U.S. tariffs.        As you know, both the President Biden and President Trump       administrations have determined that the government of the       People's Republic of China (PRC) is committing genocide and       crimes against humanity against the Uyghurs and other Turkic       peoples, including state-imposed forced labor, mass forced       sterilization, and mass enforced disappearance and arbitrary       detention. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner       for Human Rights (OHCHR) found in its authoritative August       31, 2022 report (the ``Bachelet Report'') that the PRC is       responsible for ``serious human rights violations'' that       ``may constitute crimes against humanity.''        In response to the Uyghur human-rights crisis, the U.S.       government has taken action to ban products made with forced       labor from China, including solar equipment, among 100+       human-rights sanctions including export bans, investment       bans, visa bans, and Global Magnitsky targeted human rights       OFAC SDN designations. Under the Uyghur Forced Labor       Prevention Act, which came into force on June 21, 2022, no       products are exempt from the ``rebuttable presumption'' that       all products mined, grown, or manufactured in the Uyghur       Region are banned under Section 307 of the U.S. Tariff Act.       The law is applicable regardless of the needs of particular       industries or the scarcity of alternative supplies.        No economic or environmental imperative can justify profits       from the genocidal state-imposed forced labor of Uyghurs.        The reality is that the Chinese polysilicon and solar-      component industries are highly dependent on mining and       manufacturing in the Uyghur homeland, using central       government subsidies and incentives, and under the auspices       of the government of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.        In our view, it is clear that an increase in solar imports       from Chinese solar manufacturers--regardless of whether these       imports are from China or Chinese controlled factories in       Southeast Asia--directly supports the Chinese solar       industry's use of Uyghur forced labor. According to       government data, imports of solar cells and modules from       Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam have risen 69       percent since 2019.        It is unconscionable to believe that the U.S. should build       a clean-energy future that  [[Page H2099]]       relies on products made under the combination of dirty coal       plants and China's genocidal forced-labor inputs. As the AFL-      CIO pointed out in a major statement in October 2021, the       ``solar industry and its entire value chain, should exemplify       how the United States meets the climate, equity and economic       challenges of the 21st century.'' It's a false choice to       think we can achieve climate goals by abandoning our core       values.        As H.J. Res. 39 comes before the Ways and Means Committee,       we urge you to support this bipartisan, common-sense measure.       It is indefensible to allow Chinese solar manufacturers that       profit from Uyghur forced labor to be exempted from       compliance with U.S. trade law.                                                       Louisa Greve,                                       Director of Global Advocacy.    Mr. Speaker, the statement highlights the  close connection between the CCP solar industry and the ongoing human  rights abuses and forced labor being perpetrated against the Uyghurs.  This is bipartisan consensus that these practices are unacceptable and  must be stopped.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Tenney).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a press  release from President Biden's Department of Commerce that states the  Department determined in December 2022, after a thorough investigation,  that Chinese solar companies are circumventing U.S. tariffs on solar  products.              [From U.S. Department of Commerce, Dec. 2, 2022]        Department of Commerce Issues Preliminary Determination of    Circumvention Inquiries of Solar Cells and Modules Produced in China                         (Office of Public Affairs)         Today, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced its       prelimiary determinations in the circumvention inquiries of       solar cells and modules from the People's Republic of China       (PRC). Commerce examined a complaint alleging that eight       solar companies that manufacture solar cells and modules are       manufactured the components in the PRC, then sending those       cells and modules to Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and/or       Vietnam for minor processing before being exported to the       United States. Such actions amount to an effort to evade the       existing antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD)       orders on solar cells and modules from the PRC. Today's       preliminary determination underscores Commerce's commitment       to holding the PRC accountable for its trade distorting       actions, which undermine American industries.        Under U.S. law, Commerce may conduct a circumvention       inquiry when evidence suggests that merchandise subject to an       existing AD/CVD order is completed or assembled in third       countries from parts and components imported from the country       subject to the order. AD/CVD orders are designed to provide       relief to the U.S. domestic industries when they are facing       unfair competition. Circumvention of these duties threatens       to undermine American industries, workers, and businesses.        After a thorough, transparent, and data-driven       investigation of eight companies across the four countries,       Commerce preliminarily found that four of the eight companies  [[Page H2100]]       being investigated are attempting to bypass U.S. duties by       doing minor processing in one of the Southeast Asian       countries before shipping to the United States.        The preliminary findings are as follows:        Third Country, Company, Finding:        Cambodia: BYD Hong Kong, Circumventing; New East Solar, Not       Circumventing.        Malaysia: Hanwha, Not Circumventing; Jinko, Not       Circumventing.        Thailand: Canadian Solar, Circumventing; Trina,       Circumventing.        Vietnam: Boviet, Not Circumventing; Vina Solar,       Circumventing.        Further, some companies in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam       did not respond to Commerce's request for information in this       investigation, and consistent with longstanding practice,       will be found to be circumventing.        Because Commerce preliminarily found that circumvention was       occurring through each of the four Southeast Asian countries,       Commerce is making a ``country-wide'' circumvention finding,       which simply designates the country as one through which       solar cells and modules are being circumvented from the PRC.       This does not constitute a ban on imports from those       countries. Companies in these countries will be permitted to       certify that they are not circumventing the AD/CVD orders, in       which case the circumvention findings will not apply. With       regard to the companies under investigation that were not       circumventing the AD/CVD duties, no action will be taken as       long as their production process and supply chain do not       change.        These findings are preliminary, and as a next step,       Commerce will conduct in-person audits in the coming months       to verify the information that was the basis of its finding.       Furthermore, all parties will have an opportunity to comment       on Commerce's finding, which Commerce will fully consider       before issuing its final determination, which is currently       scheduled for May 1, 2023.        Independent of Commerce's final determination, the       Presidential Proclamation issued on June 6, 2022, provides       that duties will not be collected on any solar module and       cell imports from these four countries until June 2024, as       long as the imports are consumed in the U.S. market within       six months of the termination of the President's       Proclamation. This provides U.S. solar importers with       sufficient time to adjust supply chains and ensure that       sourcing isn't occurring from companies found to be violating       U.S. law. Solar cells made in one of the four Southeast Asian       countries, even if made from wafers from China, that are then       exported to a non-inquiry country and further assembled into       modules or other products there, are not subject to       Commerce's preliminary circumvention findings.    Mr. Speaker, the evidence is clear. Chinese  companies have set up shop in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam  to get around U.S. tariffs that were put in place in 2012 by President  Obama, yet the Biden administration is turning a blind eye on American  workers and American manufacturers by waiving additional tariffs while  it acknowledges cheating by Chinese companies.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, my grandfather always told me that actions speak louder  than words. We have heard a lot of words about people standing up to  China. This resolution will give every Member in this body the  opportunity to stand up to China, and this is the way to do it.   Mr. Speaker, I am so thankful that we have Democratic Senators-- including my counterpart, Senator Wyden--on the other side of the aisle  who are willing to do the right thing for the American worker and to do  what President Obama did in 2012 to make sure that the solar industry  works for America and does not become beholden to China.   Today, the U.S. Congress has the opportunity to send a direct message  to China, and really any country that thinks about violating trade  policies or attempts to cheat American workers, that the U.S. will not  tolerate such behavior. I appreciate the fact that this can be a  bipartisan message.   The White House made a very misguided decision when it chose to lift  additional tariffs from China for 2 years. That action, in my view,  sends the wrong message to the world, particularly when we know, based  on findings by the President's own Commerce Department, that China is  cheating American workers and consumers by circumventing tariffs right  now.   We have the opportunity today to act on bipartisan legislation that  will turn out the lights on that decision and hold China accountable.   To be clear, U.S. purchasers of fairly traded solar products will not  pay a single penny of additional tariffs if this resolution is enacted.  This is about protecting American workers and American jobs and holding  China accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  introducing this resolution and fighting to protect American workers  and American jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
