 Mr. President, these are among the most somber and  sorrowful remarks that I have had to make as President pro tempore and  also my several decades of service in this body.   What an unthinkable event it is that we are marking today--an  attempted coup incited not against a President but by a President, who  promoted and still promotes a litany of lies to overturn the results of  the election in order for him to hold on to power that he no longer  possesses. We are in the business of words, but there are none to  adequately capture the damage that he and his henchmen have done and  are doing to our country.   I am certain that no one serving here ever thought such an attack on  our democracy by a violent insurrectionist mob who stormed the  Capitol--the very citadel of our democracy--could ever happen in our  beloved country, the world's most enduring democracy.  [[Page S59]]    This very Chamber where we are gathered today was breached. It was  desecrated as was the rest of the Capitol.   This morning, in my capacity as President pro tempore, I called the  Senate into session. As I looked around the Chamber, so many memories  came to mind. I first saw this Senate Chamber as a teenager, visiting  from our home in Montpelier, VT, with my parents and my sister, coming  to this Capitol.   And then later as a Georgetown law student, I would sit in the  Visitors' Gallery and just watch. I saw the Members of the Senate in  both parties speaking to the conscience of our Nation--the conscience  of our Nation--and trying to protect our Constitution.   In 1975, I came onto the floor of the Senate as the junior-most  Member of this body. I was in awe of the Senate then. I never expected  to become the dean of the Senate.   But a year ago, I sat on the floor of the Senate as Vice President  Pence was announcing the certification of ballots. I saw him doing this  in a straightforward and honest way, even though he knew that, at the  end of the count, he would soon no longer be Vice President nor would  Donald Trump be President.   We were all in the Senate paying attention when suddenly officers  came rushing onto the floor, and they took the Vice President off the  dais and out the door. Chuck Grassley, the then-President pro tem, went  to the dais and prepared to recess the Senate.   As for most of us, I remember looking around here. We were wondering  what was happening, until I saw 2 feet from me a man wearing a vest  that said ``police'' on the Senate floor. He was carrying a submachine  gun. I had never seen anything like this in the U.S. Senate. And you  recall the police rushed us to the back door to the basement of the  Capitol, and they shuttled us off to a secure location. I was still  trying to sort through my mind what was happening.   Officers were going through the halls. And one officer came along,  took my arm, and said: ``We're going to watch out for you, Shamrock.''   So many memories flooded back because Shamrock was the police code  name for me when I was a recipient of a deadly anthrax letter addressed  to me that killed and maimed others. Ahead of me I could see the brave  Parliamentarians, and others had grabbed the cases with the  certification of ballots. They also grabbed an ivory gavel that is  right in front of you now, the same gavel I used today to call the  Senate into session.   And when we were in the secure room and were starting to see the  television, we saw a mob, Americans who turned into a mob and turned  their back on our Nation's constitutional history. They were rejecting  everything that made America great. They were ignoring our laws, our  customs, and, most of all, they were ignoring our history.   The destruction and rampage was something you would see in a movie. I  never expected to see it in the Capitol, a building that has always  been a symbol of our democracy.   A suggestion was made when we were in the secure room that we use our  authority under the law to vote and make the secure room the Senate  Chamber. I said: No, we should not be hiding here. As soon as we are  safe to go back to the Senate, whenever it is, we should go back there,  all of us, and have the American people see us there.   I said: It may take an hour, it may take 10 hours, but we should be  there carrying out the Constitution and saying no criminals can destroy  our history, our Constitution, our America.   And I was relieved when virtually all of the Republicans and  Democrats who were in that room stood and said loudly that they agreed  with me and that we would wait until we went back.   I was standing next to the Parliamentarian and the leather boxes  carrying the certification of election. We both looked at them, and I  am sure we were both thinking the same thing: We will protect our  Constitution. We will protect the Senate. We will protect America.   To the credit of the Members of the Senate and the House, we  reconvened after the siege. We fulfilled our constitutional duties to  certify the confirmed results of the election--results that every State  and Federal court has upheld in the face of blatantly frivolous  challenges.   So my thoughts today are not only about how fragile our democracy is  but about the heroes of the day: the Capitol Police officers, some of  whom lost their lives or suffered grievous and enduring injuries; and  those who joined in the Capitol's defense, especially from the  Metropolitan Police Department.   That day, 1 year ago, was such a sad and wrenching day. So disturbing  was it to see such hatred--hatred and anger--to see the Confederate  battle flag paraded in the Capitol, where it never was brought, even  during the Civil War, and to see Nazi emblems and other symbols of hate  and violence carried by some of those in the mob.   It was so horrifying to see our brave police officers, many of them  war veterans who defended America in Iraq and Afghanistan, not just  disregarded and disrespected but brutally attacked, even by the  wielding of poles bearing the American flag used as bludgeons and  spears.   In the aftermath, the National Guard from several of our States were  called in to protect the Capitol. I visited with members of the Vermont  National Guard. I know that many other Senators did that with their  States' Guard troops.    In the moment, that night, and the next day, Senators on both sides  of the aisle called this out for the travesty that it was, but amnesia  has set in since then in some quarters. There has been a concerted  effort to downplay or grossly mischaracterize the terrible events of  that day by some Members in both Chambers of Congress. It was not, as  has been said, ``just another day in January''--what an insult to those  who lost their lives and to those who suffered injuries from which they  still struggle to recover.   The question begs and answers itself: What are we in the Senate here  for, if not to defend the Republic and our Constitution?   There is a clear need for justice, and the courts are doing their  essential work. There is a clear need to know the truth, and even some  of the former President's closest supporters are heeding their duty to  respond to the bipartisan congressional investigation into what  happened that day.   There will be a clear need to learn the lessons, to safeguard and  strengthen our democracy, to protect those who serve and protect the  Capitol and those who work here.   The courts are dealing with these crimes, but it is detestable how so  many were so callously used as cannon fodder. Their actions were wrong,  but many believed they were acting as patriots. The former President  told them so and egged them on, and they believed him.   Meanwhile, he and so many of his cronies, unlike many of his  followers who stormed the Capitol, have paid no price for their roles.  They must be held accountable for planning and promoting this travesty  and, in his case, doing nothing to stop the assault, even when appealed  to, repeatedly, by his closest advisers.   The New York Times has observed our Nation faces an existential  threat from a movement that is openly contemptuous of democracy and has  shown a willingness to use violence to achieve its end. No self- governing society can survive such a threat by denying it exists. To  deny it is to be complicit in what happened.   But, more than anything else, today is a day to remember, to feel  sorrow that our great Nation ever suffered such violence and division,  to mourn those who died and were injured and to mark the day as history  will: the first time in 244 years that our exceptional country was  almost prevented from carrying out a peaceful transfer of power, a  sacred principle, a tradition in which we have taken pride for  generations and which we have taken for granted throughout our entire  lives and that we have held up as an example to people everywhere.   Now, our job in Congress is different than the prosecutors' roles.  Democracy needs a foundation, and that foundation is nothing less than  the truth. It has been said that trust in the rule of law is built in  drops and lost in buckets.   Our job is fundamental: Defend and advance the truth. Protect the  rule of law itself. And as dean of this body, that is what I will do  until the day I walk off this floor.  [[Page S60]]    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, several months ago, I spoke of the hope we  all felt that after decades of civil war, famine, and political  turmoil, after millions were killed and millions more became refugees  including thousands of ``lost boys'' and ``lost girls,'' South Sudan's  independence and a peace agreement would be the beginning of a period  of lasting stability and progress.   Regrettably, what has unfolded since then is the antithesis of  stability or  [[Page S79]]  progress. The past decade has been plagued by continued ethnic  violence, widespread hunger, and ongoing disputes between rival  politicians who have been motivated by their own personal ambitions  rather than building a democratic country or improving the lives of the  South Sudanese people. Two individuals, President Salva Kiir and First  Vice President Riek Machar, are primarily to blame for fueling tensions  and mobilizing support along ethnic lines and for failing in their  responsibility to invest in public infrastructure, basic services, and  the institutions of a multi-party democracy. The country remains  divided, violent, and impoverished. The Parliament is nothing more than  a hand-picked rubberstamp.   In S. Res. 380, which passed unanimously on December 9, 2021, we  recounted the failure of leadership that continues to plague South  Sudan. We said:         Whereas despite years of fighting, widespread suffering of       South Sudanese civilians, punitive actions by the       international community, and 2 peace agreements, the leaders       of South Sudan have failed to build sustainable peace, and       critical provisions of the Revitalized Agreement on the       Resolution of the Conflict [R-ARCSS] . . . remain       unimplemented;        Whereas the leaders of South Sudan have consistently failed       to uphold their responsibilities to create the conditions for       peace and prosperity, have prioritized self-preservation and       corruption over the needs of the people they represent, have       acted in bad faith in the implementation of cease fire and       peace agreements, and have betrayed the cause of freedom,       resulting in the loss of millions of lives; and        Whereas South Sudan has not held an election since its       independence and the current leaders of South Sudan were       appointed or installed through transitional arrangements       based on peace agreements.    The people of South Sudan deserve better. Their children are hungry.  They live in constant fear that the country will again erupt into civil  war, and they will be forced to flee their homes yet again. It is a  travesty that, despite billions of dollars in international aid, oil  revenues, and black market loans, so little has been accomplished due  to the whims and greed of two politicians. Where did all that money go,  when the government does not pay teachers, or health workers,  diplomats, or war veterans, or build schools, health clinics, housing,  or roads, or otherwise address the basic needs of the people of South  Sudan? Where did the money go when the government does nothing to  protect its citizens and their livestock from drowning from the yearly  flooding of the Nile River? Does anyone doubt that it ended up in  secret bank accounts or to purchase properties far away from South  Sudan?   I have spoken before of the People's Coalition for Civil Action-- PCCA--a pro-democracy civil rights movement that seeks to mobilize the  people of South Sudan in their pursuit of peaceful political change,  which is their right. The PCCA and similar peaceful organizations  represent a rejection of war, corruption, insecurity, and poverty. They  are calling for new, honest, and capable leadership that is committed  to improving the lives of their people, to providing stability and  security, rather than self-enrichment.   I note that S. Res. 380 calls on the Secretary of State to ``lead a  comprehensive interagency process to develop a revitalized United  States policy toward South Sudan that . . . identifies South Sudanese  political and civilian stakeholders, beyond President Kiir and First  Vice President Machar, with whom the United States may work for the  promotion of peace, democracy, development, accountability,  transparency, and anti-corruption efforts.'' Supporting the PCCA would  be a good place to start.   How has President Kiir responded to this praiseworthy demand for  nothing more than that he and Vice President Machar keep their promise  to lead the country out of poverty? Several of the PCCA's leaders have  been arrested. Others live in exile, fearing that they too would be  jailed if they return home.   I think of Abraham Awolich, one of the lost boys. One of his brothers  was killed fighting for the liberation of South Sudan, and Abraham  nearly died himself for the same cause, but he was fortunate to be  educated in a refugee camp in Kenya and resettled in my State of  Vermont, where he graduated from the university. He is one of the  dedicated leaders of the PCCA who have called for free and fair  elections so the country can finally have new leadership and leave  behind a generation of corruption, violence, and misery. Abraham left  the comfort of living in America and chose to go back to South Sudan to  help build a new democratic society, but he has had to flee his  country, and his assets have been frozen for speaking out and standing  up for democracy and civil rights. This is wrong.   Others who are in jail for their peaceful advocacy are Kuel Aguer  Kuel, Pastor Abraham Chol Maketh, Malik Angok, and Fadhia Ngor. Rajab  Mohandis, Wani Michael, Joseph Akol Makeer, and Jame David Kolok are on  the run for the same reason, their assets also frozen. Other advocacy  organizations the government has targeted besides the PCCA include the  Organization for Responsive Governance, the Okay Africa Foundation, and  the Foundation for Democracy and Accountable Governance.   These individuals and organizations deserve and need our support.   I urge the South Sudanese authorities to release Kuel Aguer Kuel and  all the political prisoners mentioned so they can begin this new year  with their families. The government should also unfreeze the assets of  the individuals and organizations affected and issue a public statement  revoking any further threats against them and their organizations.   The repressive actions of the South Sudanese Government should  outrage each of us, especially considering the billions of dollars  American taxpayers contributed to secure South Sudan's independence and  put the country on a path to a prosperous future. President Kiir and  Vice President Machar have a duty to provide the political and civic  space for their people to exercise their rights of free expression,  association, and assembly and to petition for free and fair elections  and for honest and competent governance.   Ever since independence 10 years ago, the people of South Sudan have  struggled to survive under the suffocating oppression of the same two  disgraced leaders. President Kiir and Vice President Machar have an  opportunity to show real statesmanship, but time is running out. They  should listen to the voices of their people expressed through the  National Dialogue and step aside and give South Sudan a new beginning.  The two could end the unrest in South Sudan with a public declaration  of their intention not to contest the next election. Rather than delay  elections as they have done repeatedly before, President Kiir and Vice  President Machar should set a date for national and Parliamentary  elections, in accordance with the R-ARCSS, and declare their  unconditional commitment to relinquish power as soon as South Sudan's  new leaders are sworn in.   In acting on this advice, President Kiir and Vice President Machar  would receive international support for an honorable exit from power.  Ignoring this advice, however, would result in further condemnation and  consequences from the United States and the rest of the international  community.   The text of S. Res. 380 bears repeating, because it identifies some,  but by no means all, of the consequences that could result. It ``urges  the Secretary of the Treasury--         (A) to prioritize investigations into illicit financial       flows fueling violence in South Sudan;        (B) to work with the Secretary of State to update, on a       regular basis, the list of individuals and entities       designated under the South Sudan sanctions program, including       individuals at the highest levels of leadership in South       Sudan and from within the National Security Service; and        (C) to coordinate, in cooperation with the Secretary of       State, with the United Kingdom and the European Union on       South Sudan-related sanctions designations and enforcement.''    What has befallen the people of South Sudan in the 10 years since  independence is a travesty. Their dreams of a better future have been  crushed. Their rights have been trampled. Many have paid with their  lives or their freedom. Their government has become a subject of  ridicule by the same international donors that staked so much on the  good faith of leaders who have failed them.   Time has run out for President Kiir and Vice President Machar. The  patience of the South Sudanese people  [[Page S80]]  has run out. The tolerance of the international community has run out.  They have squandered and abused their authority for far too long. They  would be well-advised to stand aside so that others, chosen in a free  and fair election, can begin the process of uniting and rebuilding the  country. To that end, the United States can work with regional allies,  Canada, Norway, the UK, other European nations, and church leaders to  achieve a democratic and peaceful solution in South Sudan.                            ____________________
