 Mr. Speaker, listen, the American people expect  and deserve free and fair elections. They deserve to have one legal  vote cast and one legal vote counted, but H.R. 1 turns all of our  election process upside down. It upends our entire election system.   Why are we doing this?   As my friend mentioned, on the Oversight Committee, the entire year  last year in Oversight, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  tried to push H.R. 1 because of COVID, and we saw what that did in our  elections this past year, it totally created chaos. But now we want to  nationalize it.   The worst thing in the world that can happen is for the Federal  Government to nationalize our election system. Part of what is in here  is universal mail-in ballots to everyone on the voter registration  files. What a disaster. We know those files are probably 10 percent  inaccurate. So we are going to have millions of illegal voters receive  live ballots. Then there is zero voter ID associated with this.   Why in the world would we want no voter ID, unless this is some sort  of scheme to give illegal voters the opportunity to vote without any  proof of who they are, that they are legal?   This is an absolute disaster, and ballot harvesting is a part of  this, restricting the right of States to run their own elections.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this.
