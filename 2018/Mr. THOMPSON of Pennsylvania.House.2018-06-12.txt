 Mr. Speaker, I rise on the occasion of  former President George H.W. Bush's 94th birthday. He is the first U.S.  President to turn 94 years old, and he has lived a lot of life in those  years.   President Bush is marking the occasion at his home in Kennebunkport,  Maine. He won't celebrate by skydiving, as he has in past years, but,  rather, with a low-key affair surrounded by family.   President Bush has remained active in public life, and he has  emphasized the importance of volunteerism. In a column in today's USA  Today, his son, Neil Bush, encouraged Americans to follow his dad's  example of volunteer service to make our Nation stronger, kinder, and  more united.   Neil said: ``It's an important lesson Dad instilled in me, the idea  that we have the freedom to serve and that the choice to serve can  define the type of life you live. In my father's words, `Any definition  of a successful life must include serving others.' ''   Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more, and I wish our 41st President a  very happy birthday.                            ____________________
