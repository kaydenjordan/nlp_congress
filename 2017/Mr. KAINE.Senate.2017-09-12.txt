 Mr. President, I rise to speak about the pending NDAA. In  particular, I rise to speak about an amendment that has been previously  discussed on the floor that is being offered by the Senator from  Kentucky, Mr. Paul, that deals with the current authorizations for use  of military force that are justifying American military action in  Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and numerous other countries.   The authorizations that currently support military actions were  passed in 2001 and 2002. About a quarter of us were here and voted on  those. Three-quarters of us have joined either the Senate or the House  since those authorizations have been voted on. What that means is that  we have American troops who are deployed in harm's way, that thousands  have been killed, that thousands have their lives at risk right now,  and that three-quarters of Congress has never voted to support the  military operations that are currently underway. Many of us support  them or support them with recommendations or reservations or  qualifications, but three-quarters of us have never cast a vote.  [[Page S5205]]    These authorizations are, respectively, 15 and 16 years old. The  authorizations have, essentially, been interpreted in a very broad  way--first, by the Bush administration; second, by the Obama  administration; and now by the current Trump administration. I would  argue that the current interpretation of the authorizations would  essentially allow, without any approval from Congress, an American  President to wage war anywhere against any terrorist group for however  long he wants to.   That was not the intention of the authorizations when they were  originally drafted. If you were to go back and talk to those who had  been here and cast their votes in 2001 and 2002, they would say that it  was completely beyond their contemplation that what they were voting  for then, which was going after those who had attacked the Pentagon--9/ 11 was yesterday--and the World Trade Center, would 16 years later  still be used to support military action in a total of 14 countries in  35 separate instances having been declared by the last three  administrations.   Senator Paul has an amendment on the table, and the amendment is  this: to sunset the 2001 and 2002 authorizations in 6 months as a  mechanism for forcing Congress to finally do the job of having a debate  and defining the legal authority of the military mission that we are  currently engaged in and putting a senatorial and congressional  thumbprint on the mission so that those who are risking their lives  know that they are doing so with a political consensus by the American  political leadership here in Congress. I am supporting Senator Paul's  amendment.   I think it is way past time for Congress to take this up and for  everybody to be on the record. I think that our allies need to know  whether Congress supports the American military missions that are  currently underway. I think that our adversary needs to know that there  is a congressional resolve, not just an Executive resolve. Most  importantly, I think that the American troops who are deployed in  harm's way every day deserve an answer to the question of whether  Congress is behind them.   I came to Congress being very focused on this and to the Senate in  January of 2013. I gave my first speech about it on the floor in the  summer of 2013, when President Obama expanded the military action  against al-Qaida to also incorporate military action against ISIS,  which did not form until 2 years after the 9/11 attack. I filed my  first military authorization, seeking to get Congress on board and to  send to the troops the message that we supported them. That was now  almost 3 years ago. I was once able to get a vote on an authorization  in the Foreign Relations Committee. It passed out of committee but died  for lack of any action on the floor.   Since 2015, out of a thought that we should try to be at least as  bipartisan as we could in putting support behind the troops and  carrying out our article I responsibilities, Senator Jeff Flake of  Arizona and I have worked together, first, in introducing in 2015--and  then in reintroducing this year--an authorization for use of military  force. We have a pending authorization that we filed in June, which has  been pending in the Foreign Relations Committee, to set forth a  military authorization with certain conditions to undertake and legally  justify military action against al-Qaida, ISIS, and the Taliban. That  has been pending in the Foreign Relations Committee, but there has been  no particular motive or forcing mechanism that has made the committee  take this up, bat it around, hear from experts, debate it, amend it,  and send it to the floor.   I think, of all of the powers that Congress has, the one that we  should most jealously guard is the power to declare war. James Madison  was the drafter of the Constitution, and he gathered great ideas from  others. The 230th anniversary of the drafting of the Constitution is  this Sunday, September 17--Constitution Day in Philadelphia. The  Constitution was a great collection of wonderful ideas, many that had  been tried out in other nations, but the genius of it was the way in  which we got the best of the best and tried to put them together in the  document.    It has been said by many historians that there were only about two  items in the Constitution circa 1787 that were truly unique and that we  were doing for the first time. One was the protection of the ability of  the people to worship as they pleased without preference or punishment,  which had been drawn from a statute that had been passed in Virginia in  1780, the Statute for Religious Freedom. The second idea that was very  unique to our country and was, really, an effort by the Framers of our  Constitution to change the course of human history was the idea that  war should only be initiated by Congress and not by the Executive.   The Framers of the Constitution knew in 1787 about Executives and  Executive overreach, especially in matters of war. They knew Kings,  Emperors, Monarchs, Sultans, and Popes, and they knew that that was how  war started. Madison decided that we were going to do it differently,  and the Framers and those who voted in Philadelphia agreed with him.  The Constitutional Convention's minutes that were taken by Madison and  others demonstrated what they were trying to do.   Madison explained it in a letter to President Jefferson about 10  years later, when Jefferson was grappling with questions of war.  Madison wrote in the letter that our Constitution supposes what the  history of all governments demonstrate--that it is the Executive that  is most interested in war and, thus, is most prone to war. For this  reason, we have, with studied care, placed the question of war in the  legislature. Madison was trying to change it so that war could not be  initiated without a vote of Congress.   In my view--and I was tough on a President of my own party about  this--when President Obama decided to initiate offensive military  action against ISIS in August of 2014, I said: You must come to  Congress. When President Trump used military might--in this instance,  weapons against Syria--to undertake the laudable step of punishing the  use of chemical weapons against civilians, I said: I will support you  with a vote, but you cannot do that without Congress. That is because  there is nothing in the authorizations that are currently pending that  allow the United States to take military action against the Government  of Syria.   Yet we have gotten so sloppy about this. Frankly, we have been sloppy  about it just about since 1787. If I can be blunt, throughout our  history, regardless of party--Whig or Federalist, Democrat or  Republican--Members of Congress have often concluded that a war vote is  a very difficult vote and that, if we could allow the President to  initiate it without a vote, we might be politically insulated from the  consequences of the vote. That has been a uniform trend, and it has  been a nonpartisan one. That is one of the reasons that we are where we  are right now in Congress's being reluctant to take up war votes. These  are difficult votes.   I have been on the Foreign Relations Committee since January 2013 and  have cast two votes for military action--first, against Syria for using  chemical weapons in the summer of 2013 and, second, in the matter that  I mentioned earlier in voting for a war authorization against ISIS in  December of 2014. I will say that there is no vote that you will ever  cast that is harder.   I come from a State with a great military tradition. More people in  Virginia are connected to the military--either as Active Duty, veteran,  Guard, Reserve, DOD civilian or military contractor or military  family--than in any other State. One of my children is a Marine  infantry commander. Any war vote--if not immediately, then  prospectively--affects him and the people whom he works with and cares  deeply about.   These are very, very hard votes. They are supposed to be hard, but  that is no reason to duck them. Congress is supposed to take this up,  not hand any President of any party a carte blanche to go to war  without a vote of Congress. Even against bad guys like ISIS or even  against a Syrian dictator who is using chemical weapons against  civilians, we are not supposed to be at war without a vote of Congress.   So I am here to support Senator Paul's amendment, which would take  these old and outdated authorizations and sunset them within 6 months.  I view his amendment as being an attempt to force Congress to do what  it should do, which is to have a debate anew after 16 years and come up  with a crafted legal authority and appropriate  [[Page S5206]]  strategy for carrying out military actions against nonstate terrorist  groups.   I applaud my colleague from Arizona, Senator Flake, because he and I  have worked together very hard on this issue. We have a matter that is  pending. If Senator Paul's amendment passes, the result of his  amendment will be that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and this  body will have to grapple with what is an appropriate authorization  circa 2017 to replace the authorizations from 2001 and 2002.   We shouldn't be afraid of that discussion. We should relish it and  protect the power of Congress to decide when we will and will not be at  war. I believe the version that Senator Flake and I have introduced,  that was introduced in June, is a good-faith effort to listen to all  and craft a compromise going forward.   I will close and say what I have said already. I think Congress  should not only do this because we are constitutionally required to-- and waging war without an authorization poses all kinds of legal  challenges that I think are significant; that it is constitutionally  required should be enough--but I actually really like the reason. I  like the reason for the constitutional provision.   Madison and the Framers concluded that we should not order men and  women into combat, where they are risking their lives and their health,  if there is not a political consensus by the elected leadership of the  country that the mission is so worth it that we can fairly ask them to  risk their lives. If we are afraid to cast a vote because, oh, it is  too unpopular or it could be too challenging, how can we stand up and  say we are going to duck that responsibility when the consequence of  war is that volunteers are being deployed and potentially injured and  killed?   I will close and just say it seems to me that the sacrifice of the  millions who serve Active, Guard, and Reserve--of the thousands who are  deployed overseas in theaters of war right now--their sacrifice should  call upon us to have a debate and do the job we are supposed to do.   If the Paul amendment passes, I look forward to working especially  with my colleague from Arizona and my colleagues on the Armed Services  Committee and colleagues on this floor to have a debate, have a vote,  and send a strong message to terrorist groups, to our allies--but  especially to our troops--that the article I branch of the U.S.  Government has a resolve and supports them.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.    Mr. President, sexual assault is a major issue on our  Nation's college campuses. Too many young people are sexually assaulted  while in school. Alarmingly, the majority of these crimes will go  unreported. The consequences of these crimes are often destructive to a  student's mental, physical, and emotional well-being. In addition, the  trauma of the assault and its aftermath drives many survivors to drop  out of school.   Sexual assault survivors deserve access to a safe and supportive  educational environment. I have met with students in Virginia and  across the Country who have expressed the need for someone on campus to  turn to for unbiased advice and guidance following an assault. Given  the prevalence of this issue, it is clear that our federal higher  education policy must do more to prevent sexual assaults and ensure  that survivors have access to and can navigate through a plethora of  resources.   This is why I am pleased to introduce today the Survivor Outreach and  Support Campus Act of 2017 or SOS Campus Act. The SOS Campus Act  requires universities that receive Federal funding to establish an  independent, on-campus advocate for survivors of sexual assault. The  advocate will help students access all of the resources available to  them, both on and off campus, in the wake of a sexual assault and will  guide them through the process of reporting their assault if they  choose to do so, acting always in the interests of the victim, not the  university.   The SOS Campus Act requires that the confidential advocate is  responsible for ensuring that survivors, regardless of whether they  decide to report the crime, have access to emergency and follow-up  medical care, guidance on reporting assaults to law enforcement,  medical forensic or evidentiary exams, crisis intervention, and  information on their legal rights. The advocate will also conduct a  public information campaign on campus to inform students of their  services, and train other university staff to provide information to  students about the advocate.   I am proud to introduce this legislation that would ensure all  college students across our Country have access to a supportive  advocate following a sexual assault on campus. I strongly ertdourage my  colleagues in the Senate to consider this legislation to help protect  our students from sexual violence and its damaging impact.                            ____________________     Mr. President, sexual assault is a major issue on our  Nation's college campuses.
