 And Mr. Kent and Mr. Taylor, the defenders of       the President's behavior, have made a big deal out of the       fact that Vice President Biden encouraged the Ukrainians to       remove a corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutor in 2016, Mr.       Shokin. And, in fact, Senator Rand Paul on Sunday said, and I       quote him, ``They're impeaching President Trump for exactly       the same thing Joe Biden did.'' Is that correct? Is what the       President did in his phone call and what Joe Biden did in       terms of Mr. Shokin, are those exactly the same things? And       if not, how are they different?         So Joe Biden was participating in an open effort       to establish whole of government effort to address corruption       in Ukraine?         Great. So, Mr. Kent, as you look at this whole       mess, Rudy Giuliani, President Trump, in your opinion, was       this a comprehensive and whole government effort to end       corruption in Ukraine?         Exactly.
