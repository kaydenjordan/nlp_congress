 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the communities  affected by the Fairview Fire and thank the first responders who  heroically battled the flames.   The Fairview fire started on September 5, and within a matter of  hours  [[Page H7972]]  residents of Hemet were forced to evacuate their homes.   Since then, the fire has burned over 28,300 acres, caused two deaths,  and destroyed at least 36 homes or commercial structures--proving to be  one of the largest and most destructive fires our local communities  have ever seen.   To the families who have lost a loved one, our neighbors who have had  to leave behind their homes, and the students who had to miss school,  know that my heart is with you, and I stand ready to support you in any  way that I can.   In the last 15 days we have faced much devastation. We have  experienced uncertainty, grief, and fear. We have seen the havoc  wildfires can wreak on our families, environment, and livelihoods. We  have also been moved by the resiliency of our communities.   Through it all, I have been touched by the kindness and strength  exhibited by every neighbor, firefighter, law enforcement officer, and  volunteer who has pitched in to help keep us safe.   To our first responders from: Hemet Fire Department; CAL FIRE  Riverside; CAL FIRE Incident Management Team 6; Riverside County  Sheriff's Department; Cahuilla Fire; U.S. Forest Service; Bureau of  Land Management; Idyllwild Fire Department; and the Bureau of Indian  Affairs, thank you for your immense heroism.   It is because of each and every one of you--the men and women  fighting the fire who have put your lives on the line--that the  Fairview fire is now almost completely contained. There were 856  responders and 22 crews from these departments who stepped up without  hesitation.   For their responsiveness and work to keep local families informed  throughout the Fairview fire, I especially want to acknowledge the  Fairview Fire Unified Command: Hemet Fire Department Chief Eddie Sell;  CAL FIRE Chief Josh Jansen; Riverside County Sheriff's Department  Lieutenant John Shulda; and the U.S. Forest Service Chief Jim Snow.   I also want to thank: CAL FIRE Incident Commander Deputy Chief Jeff  Veik; CAL FIRE Incident Command Team 6 Staff Chief Andy Turner and  Deputy Chief Dave Scheurich; Riverside County Fire Department Chief Dan  Olson; Idyllwild Fire Department Chief Mark LaMont, and Cahuilla Fire  Chief Randy Sandoval.   At the fire's highest point, nearly 38,000 individuals were under  threat and forced to evacuate. I am incredibly grateful to them for  their leadership, as well as every volunteer who pitched in at  evacuation cites from Hemet to Temecula.   To everyone with the Riverside County Emergency Management  Department, Riverside Department of Animal Services, and the American  Red Cross who has contributed to evacuation and prevention efforts,  thank you for all that you have done.   Your actions have helped families know when it was time to evacuate  and helped our most at risk find shelter. In this disaster, there have  been countless heroes, many who will go unnamed--the neighbor who  texted their friend to make sure they saw the evacuation alert, the  mother who pitched in that extra $10 to a local evacuation center, and  the many non-profits, volunteers, and local leaders who did whatever  they could to help without seeking honor or recognition. The list goes  on and on.   As a community, we can never forget the heroes who stepped up  throughout the fire--big or small. As a Nation, I encourage each of us  to follow the example set by the people of Hemet to come together in a  time of crisis and to always lend a helping hand to a neighbor in need.                            ____________________
