 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Fort Knox.   Yesterday, the U.S. Army selected Fort Knox as a new corps  headquarters called V Corps. V Corps will bring over 600 soldiers and  their families to Kentucky.   I like to say that Fort Knox has the assets and the attitude for this  new corps. The assets are the training grounds, housing, schools, and  other resources that V Corps will be able to use when they arrive in  the fall. The attitude is that of Fort Knox and the surrounding  communities.   Kentucky is a great place to be a soldier, and I know that the  Commonwealth will welcome these soldiers and their families with open  arms.   I want to thank Senate Leader McConnell for his steadfast leadership  in helping Fort Knox get selected for the new V Corps. I look forward  to continuing to work with Fort Knox, the Department of Defense, and  the U.S. Army.                            ____________________
