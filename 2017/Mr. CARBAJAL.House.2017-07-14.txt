 Mr. Chair, as we prepare to vote on the final passage  of the National Defense Authorization Act I am extremely concerned  about the lack of discussion and debate on the issue of Russia.   As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have heard from  the leaders of our military and there is no question about the threat  Russia poses to our national security.   It is alarming to me that a number of amendments, which purpose was  to gain better situational awareness on various Russian activities,  were not debated on the floor this week.   Despite the fact that Russia has continuously attacked and interfered  with our country's democratic process, while continuing to threaten the  democracy and sovereignty of other states, this body has decided to  avoid a robust discussion on the concerning actions of Russia.   Mr. Chair, it is obvious that we have not adequately addressed the  threat Russia poses to our nation.   Reasonable amendments like mine that would have assessed Russia's  disinformation and propaganda activities along with its support for  separatist activities were not made in order. Mr. Chair, why would we  not want more information on these concerning activities?   My amendment would have also assessed the suppressive democratic  conditions in Russia. Is this body no longer concerned about human  rights?   I believe it is the responsibility of Congress to fully understand  and assess the threats other countries pose on our national security.   I have no doubt that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  will agree with me that Russia has demonstrated to be a threat to the  security of our nation. As such why aren't we doing more to address  this threat?   Mr. Chair, this Congress needs to have a discussion on how we can  most effectively combat the aggressive actions of Russia, and it is  disappointing that we were unable to do this during the consideration  of the National Defense Authorization Act.
