 Mr. Speaker, I yield 15 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (David Price), and I ask unanimous consent that he be  allowed to control that time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure, and I thank  the Speaker for his words.   I want to start by thanking Chairman Ed Royce, who authored this  resolution. I am proud to be the lead Democratic cosponsor and glad to  say that more than 30 Democrats representing a  [[Page H148]]  broad cross-section of our party have signed on as cosponsors of this  bipartisan legislation.   Ed Royce and I have worked together for the past 4 years, and we  believe that foreign policy should be bipartisan and that partisanship  should stop at the water's edge. Frankly, this is what we are doing  today. We are condemning what happened because we think it is unfair  and unjust.   I want to also mention that I join with my friend from North Carolina  (Mr. Price) in authoring an amendment to this resolution that wasn't  accepted which emphasizes a two-state solution. I want to thank Mr.  Price for his hard work on that approach, and I support it. We talk in  this resolution about a two-state solution as well.   Mr. Speaker, throughout its entire history, the State of Israel has  never gotten a fair shake from the United Nations. Year after year  after year, member states manipulate the U.N. to bully our ally,  Israel, to pile on with one-sided resolutions, placing all of the blame  for the ongoing conflict on Israel.   We saw a resolution like this come before the Security Council a few  weeks ago, and today the House of Representative will go on record  saying that that U.N. resolution is wrong, plain and simple. And  frankly, we should not have voted for that.   The Security Council resolution is highly critical of Israel yet asks  nothing directly of the Palestinians. That is biased, that is unfair,  and that is not balanced. Again, we should have opposed it. We should  have vetoed it.   The language about Jerusalem is not new but it remains deeply  offensive to Jews, whose holiest site lies on the Temple Mount in East  Jerusalem. The Kotel, the Holy Western Wall, is simply nonoccupied  territory. And it is offensive to hear that.   So in the measure the House is considering today, we repudiate this  flawed Security Council resolution. And at the same time, we will say  once again that we support a two-state solution, that the only way to  reach that goal is through direct negotiations between the Israelis and  the Palestinians, and that this shameful Security Council resolution  put that goal further out of reach.   Mr. Speaker, the international community faces the longest  suppressing issues: mass killings in South Sudan, a crisis in Yemen, a  humanitarian disaster in Syria, Russia's illegal occupation of the  Ukraine, and North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Yet, rather than  deal with those critical problems, the member states of the U.N. have  chosen instead to use the international body to embarrass Israel. It is  outrageous. This House Resolution that I am cosponsoring with Mr. Royce  rightfully says that it is outrageous.    I think it was a mistake for the current administration to abstain on  this vote in the U.N. I have been very clear about that, but I want to  be fair. Before anyone turns this into another attack on President  Obama, we should be aware of the history of this issue.   This is the first time in 8 years the Obama administration has  allowed a resolution, opposed by Israel, to go forward. The George Bush  administration allowed it to happen 6 times; the Clinton  administration, 3 times; the first Bush administration, 6 times; and  the Reagan administration, 10 times, including voting for one strongly  condemning Israel for its ``premeditated and unprecedented attack of  aggression'' when it wisely destroyed Iraq's nuclear weapons reactor in  1981.   But regardless of that history, it doesn't justify these latest  abstentions. My mother used to say that two wrongs don't make a right.  And she was right. It was wrong then, and it is wrong now.   I think allowing governments to bully Israel and the U.N. is a  mistake, no matter who is in power. Instead, let's focus on what we  should be doing when it comes to advancing the two-state solution.   This resolution calls for us to get back to the policy that many of  us support: one, standing with Israel and the United Nations; two,  stopping one-sided resolutions; and three, supporting direct  negotiations as the only way to move toward a two-state solution.   This resolution says all that. Every one in this Congress should be  voting for it because it is balanced. I am pleased to support this  resolution, and I urge all Members to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I want to begin by thanking the ranking member, the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Engel). I thank him for working with me in a bipartisan  manner not just on this resolution but on the one that we worked on  late last year--a unanimous vote by this body directing the  administration not to take the steps that the administration has taken.   I appreciate the leader and the Speaker as well working with us to  ensure this resolution was brought quickly to the floor of this House.   Today, we put Congress on record objecting to the recent U.N.  Security Council resolution that hurt our ally, that hurt Israel, and I  believe that puts an enduring peace further out of reach.                                time  1730    Mr. Speaker, the United States has long recognized that a solution to  the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only come about through direct  bilateral negotiations between these two parties, and that is why it is  longstanding U.S. policy to veto the many one-sided, the many anti- Israel resolutions at the United Nations Security Council that violate  that principle.   But just the other week, the Obama administration broke with this  longstanding U.S. policy by failing to veto U.N. Security Council  Resolution 2334. This dangerous resolution effectively states that the  Jewish quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem and the Western Wall,  Judaism's holiest site, are, in the words of the resolution, ``occupied  territory.'' Why would we not veto that?   It also lends legitimacy to efforts by the Palestinian Authority to  put pressure on Israel through the U.N. rather than to go through the  process of engaging in direct negotiations, and it puts wind in the  sails of the shameful boycott divestment and sanctions movement.   Unquestionably, this U.N. Security Council action damages the  prospects for peace. The resolution and the bullying and harassment of  Israel that it will spur only happened for one reason: the Obama  administration let it happen--and that went against the distinct  warnings from this body.   Mr. Engel and I engaged in letters, in conversations with senior  administration officials seeking their assurance that the United States  would veto one-sided, anti-Israel resolutions. In November, the House  unanimously, all of us, passed a resolution which warned the  administration against taking such last-minute action.   With that resolution, H. Con. Res. 165, the House unanimously stated  that the United States Government should continue to oppose and veto  United Nations Security Council resolutions that seek to impose  solutions to final-status issues or are one-sided and anti-Israel. Yet  the administration rejected the call from Congress and chose a course  that will bring harm for years to come by failing to veto U.N. Security  Council Resolution 2334.   If the Palestinians want a lasting peace, they must accept that  Israel, not the U.N., is their negotiating partner; and that means  ending the incitement to violence against Israelis that goes on in so  many of the mosques, that goes on in the schools, that goes on in the  newspapers and on television there. It also means ending--and I think  this is the most important fact, because leaving this out of the  resolution at the U.N. is beyond me--their pay-to-slay scheme.   You talk about a lack of balance. Here we have a situation where,  since 2003, it has been Palestinian law to reward Palestinian  terrorists--terrorists--to go out, and they are given this incitement,  this stipend for life. The more mayhem they create, the more horrific  the number of civilians they attack and, therefore, the longer the  sentence, the more they know: Well, I can serve my time, and then when  I get out, I can get this stipend for the rest of my life--and it is  larger and larger, depending upon the amount of mayhem--and if I don't  make it, or if I am a suicide bomber, my family gets the stipend.   That, by law, is the way the Palestinian Authority has engineered  this, costing the lives--and you can read  [[Page H149]]  about it every month of those civilians attacked on the streets. It is  not just Israelis, of course. Taylor Force, a U.S. Marine, was killed  simply because he was in Israel, but it was by someone responding to  the incitement.   So $300 million per year spent by the Palestinian Authority to do  that. No mention of that, of course, by the United Nations. And that is  why today's action is so important, to demonstrate our united  opposition to U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334, call for its  repeal, to head off any more moves the Obama administration might have  in the next few days with respect to the Paris conference next week as  well, and to provide the foundation for the next administration to move  forcefully to counteract its dangerous impact.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. Engel, for yielding a  portion of his time to opponents of this resolution. I also appreciate  his willingness to work with me and other Members on our alternative  resolution that is more accurate and less divisive, a resolution,  unfortunately, the majority has denied a hearing for on the floor  today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res. 11. The resolution  before us today fails to credibly reaffirm our Nation's support for a  two-state solution. It provides an inaccurate accounting of the United  States' longstanding policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It  includes reckless and divisive charges regarding the recent United  Nations Security Council resolution, designed, it would appear, solely  to embarrass the outgoing administration. It falsely claims, for  example, that the Security Council resolution ``contradicts the Oslo  Accords.'' It goes so far as to link the resolution to the boycott and  divestiture movement.   Mr. Speaker, there is room for honest debate about the U.N.  resolution and about the U.S. decision to abstain, but there is not  room, there shouldn't be room, for this kind of disgraceful distortion.  H. Res. 11 doesn't really engage the issues; it obscures and distorts  them.   I would suggest that both those who support and oppose recent U.S.  actions should oppose this irresponsible and divisive resolution. It  does distort the record. In fact, during the Obama administration,  fewer U.N. Security Council resolutions related to the Israeli- Palestinian conflict have passed than under any other modern  Presidency. In fact, the December resolution is the only one that has  passed under President Obama's leadership; and if you want a fair and  comprehensive account of the thinking that went into that difficult  decision, I commend to every Member Samantha Power's statement at the  United Nations, one of the finest statements of its sort that I have  ever read.   H. Res. 11 also doesn't take into account the fact that Republican  and Democratic administrations alike have allowed Security Council  resolutions addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to pass, many  of which were opposed by Israel. The fact is H. Res. 11 runs a real  risk of undermining the credibility of the United States Congress as a  proactive force working toward a two-state solution.   In this period of great geopolitical turmoil and uncertainty, we must  reaffirm those fundamental aspects of our foreign policy, including our  strong and unwavering support for Israel, while also demonstrating to  the world that we are committed to a diplomacy that defends human  rights and promotes Israeli and Palestinian states that live side by  side in peace and security, a formulation that has characterized our  country's diplomacy for decades.   At best, Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 11 would muddy the waters of our  diplomacy and foreign policy. At worst, it could undermine our decade- long efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and  Palestinians. I can't, in good faith, support the adoption of this  resolution, and I urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, in response briefly, we did  have a substitute from Mr. Price, and we looked at that substitute, but  it did not once mention the United Nations Security Council Resolution  2334.   Mr. Engel and I have worked hard together, in good faith and in a  bipartisan manner, to develop a measure that rejects and repudiates  this dangerous U.N. resolution that was passed; and also, ours warns  the White House against taking additional measures in the last few  weeks of the current administration. I think it is important to remind  the body that this is very concerning, given the backdrop of the Paris  conference on the 15th of this month and the very real concern that the  President could take further steps at the U.N.   Again, Mr. Price's amendment did not include this urgent warning. I  want to say that I am happy to work with Mr. Price in a bipartisan  manner once the Committee on Foreign Affairs organizes, but time is of  the essence. We must act to reject United Nations Security Council  Resolution 2334, not remain silent on it, and we have got to limit the  damage that the administration has caused to prospects for a lasting  peace.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Ros-Lehtinen), chairman emeritus of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank our esteemed chairman for the  time.   This resolution, Mr. Speaker, will not undo the damage that has been  done at the Security Council, but it sends an important message to the  world that the United States Congress resoundingly and in a strong  bipartisan manner disapproves of the vote taken on Resolution 2334, and  it sends a warning to the nations that will gather in Paris next week  to discuss the peace process that there will be repercussions if there  is a move to introduce a parameters resolution before the 20th in an  effort to further isolate Israel.   Our closest friend and ally, the democratic Jewish State of Israel,  has been under constant attack by the United Nations. Abu Mazen and the  Palestinians have pushed a campaign to delegitimize the Jewish state,  to undermine the peace process, to achieve unilateral statehood  recognition. We have seen it this year at UNESCO, where that sham of an  institution voted on several occasions to deny and distance Jewish and  Christian historical and cultural ties to Jerusalem.   We have seen it at the Human Rights Council, where Israel is  constantly demonized and falsely accused of human rights violations  while the real abusers of human rights go unpunished because that body  has utterly failed to uphold its mandate. This is a body that allows  the worst abusers of human rights--like Cuba, Venezuela, and China--to  actually sit in judgment of human rights worldwide. What a pathetic  joke. Yet the only thing they can agree on is to attack Israel, the  only democracy in the Middle East and the only place in the region  where human rights are protected.    We have seen this scheme to delegitimize Israel at the General  Assembly, where, in its closing legislative session, the General  Assembly passed 20--20--anti-Israel resolutions and only 4, combined,  for the entire world.   These institutions have no credibility, and now we have the  unfortunate circumstance of the White House deciding to abstain from  this anti-Israel, one-sided resolution at the Security Council. Our  ally was abandoned, and credibility and momentum were given to the  Palestinian schemes to delegitimize the Jewish state, to undermine the  peace process.   While the damage has been done, Mr. Speaker, by this act of cowardice  at the Security Council, we will have an opportunity to reverse that  damage. In the coming weeks and months, this Congress and the incoming  administration must show unyielding support for our ally Israel and  undo the damage done.   This resolution by the chairman and the ranking member is an all- important first step that signals our intent. I urge my colleagues to  support this measure, and I look forward to working with Chairman Royce  and Ranking Member Engel in further strengthening our U.S.-Israel bond.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), my good friend and senior member of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs.  [[Page H150]]                                     time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Rosen), one of our new Members, who has made support for  Israel part of her entire life and is giving her first speech on the  House floor in support of this resolution and support of Israel.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the  great State of New York (Mr. Suozzi), another new Member of Congress  who is also making his maiden speech about the security of Israel and  the U.S.-Israel partnership.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. David Scott).   Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in great support of the Ross-Engel bill against  this most deceitful and shameful U.N. resolution. That is what we are  here for. This act was shameful and it was deceitful.   When the U.N. voted for this 2334 resolution, it was like cutting  Israel's legs out from under it and then condemning Israel for being a  cripple. Shameful and deceitful because they wanted to put all of the  blame on Israel when it is the Palestinians who refuse to even meet to  discuss or to even talk about a two-nation state. It is the  Palestinians who say Israel doesn't even have a right to exist.   How in the hell are you going to meet with somebody to talk about a  combined future when they will not give you decent recognition?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.   Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. I thank the gentleman because this part  is very important.   Mr. Speaker, this Nation is blessed. We have been blessed with divine  intervention all through our history to be that shining light on the  hill, to let all of our great work show for the world. We have an  opportunity here tonight for this Congress to stand up and show that  light for Israel.   Stand up for Israel and show our great works to this world. That is  what I say, so let it be written and let it be done.   Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Trott).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider). We are pleased that he is back.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my great pleasure to yield 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), the ranking member of  the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), my friend on the Foreign Affairs  Committee and the ranking member of the Middle East Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   When an unfair, one-sided resolution moves forward in the U.N., as  Israel's ally, we have an obligation to say it is wrong. That is what  this resolution does. This resolution also calls for a two-state  solution. So my colleagues who are somehow portraying this resolution  as not being for a two-state resolution, they are absolutely wrong.   I urge my colleagues, especially my Democratic colleagues, to  continue to support the U.S.-Israel alliance, and you continue to  support it by voting for this resolution. This is a fair resolution.   Let's remember, when Israel left Gaza and uprooted settlements, what  did it get in return? Not peace, but terrorism. Stand with the people  of Israel. Vote ``yes'' on this resolution.   I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, in short, United Nations Security Council Resolution  2334 has harmed our ally Israel. It has harmed the prospects for peace.  It is one-sided. It is an anti-Israel resolution, the kind of which it  has been longstanding U.S. policy to veto within the U.N. Security  Council, and it is not hard to see why because this resolution opens  the door for those who want to impose boycott, divestment, or other  sanctions measures against Israel or against Israeli companies. And, in  essence, it declares Judaism's holiest site, the Western Wall, as  occupied territory.   Mr. Speaker, this is reminiscent of another action by the United  Nations, the infamous ``Zionism is racism'' resolution whose damage  took decades to undo.   Fortunately, the bipartisan rejection of the President's U.N.  decision provides an opportunity for the House to rally around a more  constructive policy and renewed U.S. leadership in the region.   I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this resolution so that the bipartisan policy of rejecting this harmful  U.N. Security  [[Page H163]]  Council resolution and encouraging direct negotiation is endorsed loud  and clear. It is far past time for the incitement to stop and the  budgeting of $300 million by the Palestinian Authority to pay people to  slay Israeli civilians be discontinued.   I yield back the balance of my time.
