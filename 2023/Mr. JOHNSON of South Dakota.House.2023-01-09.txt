 Mr. Speaker, quite a little bit of the  national narrative over the last week has been about Republican  disunity, and some have tried to apply that narrative to this rules  package. I get it. I get it. It makes for a good story, but it just  isn't so.   I rise today, Mr. Speaker, with a more accurate assessment. This  rules package is actually about Republican unity. This package, except  for one single change, is the same rules package that was released two  weekends ago.   This is the same rules package, except for one single change that the  Republican Conference had widespread agreement on weeks ago.   There are a tremendous number of conservative wins here:  [[Page H65]]    At least 72 hours for Members and the public to review legislation  before we vote on it.   Requiring every bill to deal with only a single subject.   Getting rid of proxy voting.   Bringing back the Holman rule, which will allow this body to target  specific spending line items.   And then the return of CutGo so that spending increases have to be  offset by spending reductions.   Mr. Speaker, every single one of these big conservative wins, and  many more like them were supported by the Republican Conference long  before the excitement of last week. Today's rules package is actually  proof of Republican unity, and it is proof that we are committed to  bringing increased accountability, transparency, and fiscal  responsibility for this Chamber and for our country.
