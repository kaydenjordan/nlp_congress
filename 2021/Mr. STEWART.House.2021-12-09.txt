 Madam Speaker, there is so much in this bill to be  concerned about.   For the last 5 years, as a member of the House Intelligence  Committee, I lived through the Russian hoax, I lived through  impeachment 1, I lived through impeachment 2, all of which are great  examples of provisions in this bill that harm our democracy. Let me  talk about just one of them.   Tucked into this bill's provisions are elements which will rewrite  the very nature of our democracy, whittling down the meaning of  government for the people and by the people.   The President of the United States is elected by the people to run  the executive branch. The President, by design, is accountable to the  people. But among the many failures in this bill before us today are  new sections which would severely restrict the ability of the President  to remove senior government employees. This will have the effect of  empowering these senior officials with the ability to paralyze a  President whose policies they may not agree with, which we saw again  and again during the Russian hoax, during impeachment 1, and during  impeachment 2. This sets a dangerous precedent that will create a  permanent bureaucratic resistance to the duly elected President.   The danger of these provisions will also set in motion a precedent to  weaponize the entire intelligence community bureaucracy by allowing  anonymous individuals to paralyze a President without any  accountability. If you don't think it is going to happen, I refer you  back to the Russian investigation hoax, to impeachment 1, and to  impeachment 2. This guarantees more of this collusion.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.
