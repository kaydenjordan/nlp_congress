 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R.  5 because it puts the Hyde Amendment and other federal and state laws  that bar taxpayer funding for abortion at serious risk and out of an  abundance of concern for the women and children who flee to the  protection of domestic abuse shelters,.   H.R. 5 weakens conscience protections for health care providers  opposed to being coerced into participating in the killing of unborn  babies.   H.R. 5 defines ``sex'' to include ``pregnancy, childbirth, or a  related medical condition.'' The term ``related medical condition''  means ``abortion.'' In the case Doe v. C.A.R.S., the Third Circuit  stated, ``We now hold that the term ``related medical conditions''  includes an abortion.'' Furthermore, the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission (EEOC), which enforces Title VII, interprets abortion to be  covered as a ``related medical condition.''   To further clarify, H.R. 5 goes on to state:         (b): Rules.--In a covered title referred to in subsection       (a)--''(1) (with respect to sex pregnancy, childbirth, or a       related medical condition shall not receive less favorable       treatment than other physical conditions; . . .    In other words, a provider may not withhold a ``treatment option,''  including dismembering, chemically poisoning or otherwise destroying an  unborn baby girl or boy.   In a legal analysis released this month, the United States Conference  of Catholic Bishops wrote:   Existing prohibitions on the use of government funds for abortion can  be undercut in three ways.   First, federal and state governments are themselves providers of  health care. Therefore, they would themselves be subject to the  constraints that the Equality Act places on all health care providers  and, as such, would likely be required to provide abortions. This  conclusion is reinforced by the bill's expansive definition of  ``establishment,'' which is not limited to physical facilities and  places.   Second, it would seem anomalous to, on the one hand, mandate that  recipients of federal funds provide abortions, as the Equality Act can  be read to do, but, on the other hand, prohibit use of such funds for  abortions. It can (and likely will) be argued that these newly enacted  provisions, which would likely require recipients of federal funding to  perform abortions, would thereby repeal by implication previously  enacted legislation forbidding the use of those very same funds for  abortion.   Third, even if the bill were not construed to require the federal  government to fund abortions, it could still be construed to require  states that receive federal funding to do so with their own funds,  which would be a departure from the longstanding principle that the  federal government not require government funding of abortion even on  the part of state governments.   The possibility that the Equality Act may be used to undercut the  Hyde principle against government funding of abortion has been noted  even by those endorsing the bill including Katelyn Burns, New Congress  Opens Door for Renewed Push for LGBTQ Equality Act (Dec. 5, 2018). But  instead of denying that this problem exists, or (even better) urging an  amendment to avoid it, one supporter of the bill has suggested that the  issue simply ``has to be navigated super carefully.'' In other words,  there is a problem and the suggested ``fix'' is simply to keep it from  becoming politically visible.   In an incisive analysis of H.R. 5, Richard Doerflinger exposes the  risk to unborn children, conscience rights and state all laws  preventing taxpayer funding for abortion:   ``Of especially grave concern is that the Equality Act introduces  this same language on sex and ``pregnancy discrimination'' into Title  VI of the Civil Rights Act, forbidding discrimination in ``federally  assisted programs.'' This applies to a wide range of entities that may  receive federal funds, including state and local government agencies,  educational institutions, organizations providing health care, etc. (42  USC 2000d-4a). All of these would be required to show that they do not  exclude the full range of treatments for the ``condition'' of  pregnancy. Not only the federal government, but all states that receive  federal funds for their health programs, could be required to fund  elective abortions, reversing the longstanding policy of two-thirds of  the states. The same changes to the definition of ``sex'' are made to  Title II, on discrimination in places of ``public accommodation,'' and  that title's definition of a ``public accommodation'' is expanded to  include ``any establishment that provides a good, service, or  program,'' including any provider of ``health care'' (H.R. 5, Sec. 3  (a)(d)).''   I also oppose H.R. 5 out of genuine concern for the women and  children who seek refuge in a domestic abuse shelter.   By granting biological men--who self-identify as women-access to  women's shelters, H.R. 5 removes the hard-fought gains to protect women  and girls from abuse and to provide them with physical, emotional and  psychological security.   In late 2018, nine female victims residing in a women's shelter in  Fresno, California-Naomi's House, operated by Poverello House-filed a  lawsuit against the shelter for admitting a biological man because he  had self-identified as a woman. These victims stated that they had been  sexually harassed by this biological man. They said that he had made  ``sexual advances'' on them and would ``stare and leer'' and make  ``sexually harassing comments about their bodies'' while they were  forced to undress in the same room with him.   After repeatedly confronting the staff of Naomi's House--both  verbally and in writing--with their extreme discomfort, these women  were told that they would be expelled from the shelter if they refused  to comply.   Madam Speaker, if we allow biological men who self-identify as women  to receive access to these women-only shelters, abused women and  children will lose the 'safe space' they so desperately need.   We must first and foremost protect victims of violence.   These brave women and children deserve a place where they can feel  protected and secure, so they can begin the difficult process to heal  as they deal with post-traumatic stress. Forcing them to share a  shelter and its facilities--including showers and sleeping areas--with  biological men who self-identify as women will likely cause these women  and children to experience insecurity, discomfort, confusion, and fear  of additional assault.  [[Page H660]]    Women's shelters--there are about 1,500 nationwide--offer a safe  space where a woman does not have to fear or worry about violence and  intimidation and instead allows her to take steps toward rebuilding her  life.   These victims deserve better. They deserve our protection and  support. We must work to ensure the safety of women, girls, and  children.
