 Mr. President, I am so grateful to join my colleague  today, Senator Warren, to discuss the financial and economic risks that  are posed by climate change.   You have just heard the Senator from my neighboring State of  Massachusetts lay out a powerful case. Given the gravity of these risks  and given our recent experience of the 2008 financial crisis, we should  be doing everything we can to prevent another economic meltdown.   We know exactly what we need to do to mitigate these economic  threats. We need to transition from polluting fossil fuels to clean,  renewable energy. We can do this simply by giving renewables a fair  market chance against the gigantic public subsidies on which the fossil  fuel industry float. Put a price on carbon emissions so the price of  the polluting product reflects its pollution costs to society. That is  the economics 101 answer.   The problem is that fossil fuel behemoths are desperate to duck the  costs of their pollution. They want to protect this massive market  failure. Why do you suppose they are the biggest special interest  political force in the world? It is to do that work. Look over in the  House, where just recently an army of fossil fuel lobbyists and front  groups pushed through an industry-scripted resolution and declared,  falsely, that pricing carbon would be bad for the American economy. All  but eight House Republicans voted the way the industry instructed--for  a resolution that was, for them, politically correct in a polluter- obedient kind of way but was factually false.   Today, in my 217th ``Time to Wake Up'' climate change speech, I am  going to relate recent testimony by a respected Nobel Prize-winning  economics professor, Joseph Stiglitz. Unlike all of that cheap  political chicanery around the House resolution, Professor Stiglitz'  report was presented under oath and was subject to cross-examination.  Fat chance the climate deniers would ever let themselves get cross- examined under oath. Truth is kryptonite for them.   Stiglitz' report came out in Juliana v. United States--a case in  which the plaintiffs were children who sued the U.S. Government for  violating their constitutional rights through a knowing failure to  protect them from the costs of unlimited carbon emissions.   Here is what Stiglitz' testimony states:         [The U.S. Government's] continuing support and perpetuation       of a national fossil-fuel based energy system and continuing       delay in addressing climate change is saddling and will       continue to saddle Youth Plaintiffs with an enormous cost       burden, as well as tremendous risks.    Obviously, when Stiglitz talks about ``youth plaintiffs,'' his  testimony actually covers all of the children and future generations  who will bear the terrible, foreseeable costs of climate havoc.   In particular, Stiglitz notes that ``rising sea levels will lead to  massive reductions in property value,'' just as Senator Warren and  Freddie Mac have warned, and children and future generations will have  to ``bear the enormous cost of relocating the people and infrastructure  that are now on this [inundated] land.''   Of all places, the State of Kentucky has a report that warns that its  population might rise because people will have to flee coastal States.  Even the leader's own State recognizes this coastal problem.   This testimony echoes other warnings that I have related in recent  speeches about this looming coastal property value crash--warnings we  hear from sources as diverse as Freddie Mac, as the Union of Concerned  Scientists, through insurance trade publications, and now from this  Nobel Prize-winning economist. Peer-reviewed research also shows a gap  emerging between coastal and inland property values, which is what you  would expect as an early warning signal.   Stiglitz' report, however, isn't doom and gloom. It actually shows  that economic gains result from a wise transition to sustainable energy  sources.   Stiglitz writes:         Retrofitting the global economy for a climate change would       help to restore aggregate demand and growth. . . . Climate       policies, if well designed and implemented, are consistent       with growth, development, and poverty reduction. The       transition to a low carbon economy is potentially a powerful,       attractive, and sustainable growth story, marked by higher       resilience, more innovation, more livable cities, robust       agriculture, and stronger ecosystems.    Think about that. The fossil fuel industry and its phony front groups  have cooked up a phony hobgoblin of economic harm, which just so  happens to protect the industry they serve at the expense of everyone  else.   Here is a Nobel Prize-winning economist telling us that shifting to  renewable energy would actually help us grow the economy. The need for  this transition is also echoed in the warnings, which I have spoken  about and which Senator Warren just so eloquently spoke about, of a  carbon bubble and crash.   Why is it that the clean energy economy grows? The same reason the  economy grew when we went from horse and buggy to automobile or  landline to cell phones. The key word is ``innovation.'' As Professor  Stiglitz says, we get more innovation as we manage this transaction.   Renewable energy, electric cars, battery storage, carbon capture,  energy efficiency, low-carbon and zero-carbon fuels--these are  technologies of the future, promising millions of great jobs. The  question is whether these will be American technologies and American  jobs or whether China, Germany, Japan, and other countries will win the  transition to a low-carbon economy.   Growth will not just come from new jobs; it will come from lower  costs. Stiglitz notes this: ``Many energy efficiency technologies  actually have a negative cost to implement.'' Now, you have to be an  economist to use the phrase ``negative cost.'' Negative cost,  obviously, is ``economics-ese'' for ``that's a good thing.''   The reverse case is the Trump administration's recent decision to  freeze fuel economy standards for cars. That is a bad thing. It will  cost American consumers hundreds of billions of dollars more at the  pump. It is no surprise that all of that extra cost for consumers in  gas money goes to Big Oil, which has the Trump administration  obediently in its pocket.   Stiglitz's testimony estimates the total benefits to the U.S. economy  from shifting away from fossil energy sources at around $1 trillion by  2050--$1 trillion by 2050. As I said, a $1 trillion negative cost is a  good thing. It is a really good thing, and if we weren't completely in  tow to the fossil fuel industry around here, we would be striving for  it.   Stiglitz recommends the policies to get us to that low-carbon  economy. First, he says we must put a price on carbon. He testifies  that putting a price on carbon could be beneficial to the economy all  by itself. He says:   [[Page S5824]]              [A] carbon tax . . . could substitute for other more       distortionary taxes. If governments made such a substitution,       the aggregate cost of curtailing carbon emissions could be       even less than zero, providing net benefits to the economy.    Second, he testifies that we must end the enormous, gigantic  subsidies we grant to the fossil fuel industry. Here is what he says:         The full amount of post-tax subsidies in the U.S. [to the       fossil fuel industry] has been estimated at nearly $700       billion per year, more than half of the Federal government's       forecasted deficit for the next fiscal year. Eliminating all       fossil fuel subsidies (implicit and explicit, many of which       go to large corporations) could, therefore, both curtail       fossil-fuel production, through forcing companies to bear       more of the true costs of fossil-fuel production, and       substantially reduce our national deficit in one fell swoop.    For the record, Stiglitz adds that ``equity would also be improved  with corporations paying more and individuals, such as Youth Plaintiffs  and Affected Children, benefiting.''   Of course, around here, corporate interests get better service than  the American people, so that observation doesn't count for much, but  there it is.   There is one last bit of Stiglitz's testimony that is important. I  quote him again: ``The more time that passes, the more expensive it  becomes to address climate change.''   Time is not our friend. This doesn't get better or go away. Every day  we delay is a missed opportunity. Every day we delay bears a cost, and  we have been delaying--we are good at that--for decades.   James Hansen appeared before this body 30 years ago--three decades  ago--to sound the alarm about climate change in a hearing called by  Senator John Chafee. Stiglitz cites a 40-year-old report--four  decades--to President Carter that subsidies to the fossil fuel industry  were stifling competition from solar.   For decades, the fossil fuel industry has jerked Congress's chain to  keep anything from happening. Even now, their mischief is visible in  the hobgoblin about economic harm.   By the way, it is not just Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph  Stiglitz who says that pricing carbon emissions would be a good thing.  Economists across the political spectrum agree. Just last month,  economic researchers at Columbia University found that even if you look  only at the pure economic effects, a carbon fee is a winner.   Here is a $50-per-ton carbon fee, and here is a $75-per-ton carbon  fee, and both show growth compared to the status quo in the economy.  You have to roll them back through the payroll tax, which is something  we can do, to see this added growth effect from a carbon fee.   Remember, this growth--that is only the tax effects. This doesn't  count the health benefits of a cleaner planet; this doesn't count the  environmental benefits of a healthier planet. Both are huge. They are  not even counted here. This is just the tax effects.   These carbon pricing ideas are a winner on their own, and it becomes  a win-win-win when you add the environmental and health benefits.   So who are we going to believe, the front groups paid by the fossil  fuel industry? If there were Olympic medals in having a conflict of  interest, these phonies would take the gold. Unfortunately, you would  have to hose off the medals platform afterward.   On the other side, you have actual experts, honest experts--the ones  cited by Senator Warren, the economists I have mentioned here today,  and many others--who all agree. They are all saying that we need to act  now. They are all telling us that failure to act puts us in harm's way  for serious economic disruption. They are all telling us that pricing  carbon and ending fossil fuel subsidies will actually be a boon to the  economy.   Our choice is clear. Going with the corrupt guys is not a good look,  not when the day of reckoning comes. And warnings are more and more  widespread and clear that a day of reckoning draws nigh.   So if you want, go with the oddballs and the fossil fuel flunkies,  not the Nobel Prize winners; go with the scripted disinformation, not  the sworn testimony; go with the industry protecting a $700 billion  subsidy, not the actual scientists; and good luck looking your  grandchildren in the eye.   I yield the floor.
