 Mr. Speaker, this week I am introducing bipartisan  emergency legislation to correct the devastating issue of child labor  in west Michigan and across the country.   In west Michigan, we believe in protecting kids. When big companies  and corporations go against that goal, we take the necessary steps to  hold them accountable. I have heard from my constituents, and I am  responding.   Here is what my bill, the Justice For Exploited Children Act, will do  and why it is important. Right now, the maximum fine per violation of  child labor laws is around $15,000, and there is no minimum. No  minimum.   If you think that is an embarrassingly low price to pay for  exploiting a child, you are right. That is because these are the fines  that have been on the books since this law was first introduced almost  100 years ago, and they have not been raised.   These meager penalties, effectively pennies for big corporations,  allow guilty parties to evade meaningful consequences, and as a result,  continue these shameful practices. It is unacceptable. This legislation  makes clear that exploiting kids cannot be the cost of doing business.                            ____________________
