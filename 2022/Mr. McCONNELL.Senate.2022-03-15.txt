 Mr. President, American strength is not a provocation.  American strength secures deterrence and peace. It is American  hesitancy and weakness which our adversaries see as an invitation. It  is a simple fact. We relearned it the hard way many times in our  history. It should form the cornerstone of any administration's foreign  policy, but every day brings new distressing signs that the Biden  administration forgets this lesson.   President Biden hesitated and waited to reinforce our NATO allies  with more American troops out of fear that it might provoke Putin.  President Biden hesitated and waited to send Stingers to the Ukrainians  out of fears that it might provoke Putin. President Biden declined to  send support and training to Ukraine in December because he feared it  might provoke Putin.   Here is a headline from earlier this week:         Pentagon push to send more trainers to Ukraine was scrapped       in December amid White House fears of provoking Russia.    Last week, President Biden publicly split from our ally Poland and  scrapped a plan to get airplanes to Ukraine because our administration  feared it might--you guessed it--provoke Putin. Predictably, Putin has  not pulled his punches as a thank-you to President Biden for pulling  his punches.   American strength is not the provocation; American weakness is. We  need to help get air defense systems to Ukraine without wasting another  second.   But, meanwhile, the Biden administration is already replaying this  mistaken philosophy with another adversary. Iran watched our  humiliating, botched retreat in Afghanistan. They have watched the  Biden administration squabble with our Middle Eastern partners while  removing sanctions from Iran's own terrorist proxies in Yemen.    The Iranians have taken the measure of this administration. This  weekend, even as the Biden administration is reportedly putting the  finishing touches on an agreement deal that would massively favor Iran  over America, they unleashed an audacious--audacious--missile strike  into the Kurdistan region of Iraq that came very close to hitting our  U.S. consulate.   How will our Commander in Chief respond? The record is not  encouraging. Deterrence of Iran has steadily eroded under his tenure.  The worse the Iranians behave, the more desperate the Biden  administration seems to be to give them concessions.   Judging by public reports, the deal that President Biden is preparing  would impose fewer, weaker, and shorter restrictions on Iran than even  the deeply flawed 2015 deal, while giving them major and lasting relief  from sanctions.   The deal would reportedly not even touch Iran's ballistic missile  program. So Iran lobs missiles toward our facilities, and we give Iran  a huge influx of cash and a relaxation of pressure.   Iran clearly does not fear that they will pay a price for threatening  American interests. They must be made to think again.   Yesterday, Senate Republicans sent the administration a letter  expressing our grave concerns that they are preparing once again to  give away the store. Republicans stand ready to work together on a  real, tough agreement that blocks Iran's path to nuclear weapons,  constrains its missile programs, and confronts its support for  terrorism. But if the administration  [[Page S1159]]  continues down the path they are on, they will find the stiff  opposition that that path deserves.
