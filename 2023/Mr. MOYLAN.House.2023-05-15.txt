 Madam Speaker, while there are certainly many important  issues to celebrate and recognize during the month of May, one that  definitely hits home to me is that May is when our Nation celebrates  Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage month. I stand with honor  and pride to celebrate my district, my community, and my home, the  beautiful island of Guam.   Guam is an island community proudly displaying an American flag in  the midst of the Pacific region. Guam is home to a diverse and vibrant  community. We are a melting pot consisting of Chamorros, Filipino  Americans, Asian Americans, Micronesians, and so many other beautiful  ethnicities.   In Guam, we embrace the spirit of inafa'maolek, which is to make  good, or in the larger scheme of things, to restore harmony or order.   We are an island of respectability, from taking care of our elders to  ensuring our neighbors are okay. We are also a welcoming community, as  servicemembers assigned to Guam can proudly share their stories of  being invited to village fiestas.   This month we honor and reflect on our island's unique history,  culture, diversity, and contributions to our Nation's history and  development.   We are an island of patriots and proud Americans, many of whom have  served in the U.S. Armed Forces during wars and conflicts. On a per  capita basis, we have among the highest number of enlistments in the  Nation.   Guam is also proud to be home to veterans, once again, among the  highest per capita. Our proud veterans hope to be provided the same  care that their brothers and sisters receive on the mainland.   In fact, the island remains one of the Pacific's most strategic  assets holding key military installations and is also a vital component  of the INDOPACOM theater.   As a Pacific Islander, I am proud to be continuing a tradition of  holding a seat in the sacred Halls of democracy where I can proudly  stand and represent my community. It is a tradition which started with  the late Delegate Antonio Won Pat and continued through the works of  the late Delegate and General Ben Blaz, Delegate Robert Underwood,  Delegate Madeleine Bordallo, and my predecessor, Delegate Michael San  Nicolas. Each did their job ensuring that Pacific Islanders were  represented with honor and dignity.   As we will certainly have many discussions over this term to discuss  the inequities our community faces as American citizens, today I wanted  to rejoice in the celebration that I represent Pacific Islanders who  are proud, welcoming, and who always display the Hafa Adai spirit.   I want to reflect on the hardworking islanders who have contributed  to the growth of Guam and our region, from the levels of commerce,  education, farming, healthcare, public service, engineering, and so  much more. Many of them have relocated throughout the Nation to become  integral contributors of so many districts represented by many Members  of Congress.   Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month reminds us of the  immense contributions to the Nation's history and culture while  encouraging us to learn more about their extraordinary and diverse  stories, stories I look forward to sharing with my colleagues  throughout this term.   Happy Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.                            ____________________
