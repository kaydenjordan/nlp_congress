 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Kathleen  Daley--a friend, a trusted colleague, and a respected member of the  Riverside community.   I met Kathleen Daley when I was elected to the RCC board of trustees.  As I got to know her, I realized that she and I could not be more  different. She was a conservative Republican, and I am a progressive  Democrat. She was a tax accountant, and, back then, I was still a  public schoolteacher. But in spite of these differences, when we served  on the board of trustees, we were always able to work together and put  the needs of students first.   I respected her for her expertise in finance. The board trusted her  to chair the finance committee during her tenure. I admired her for her  knowledge and experience, and so did my colleagues. We often  unanimously supported her to be the presiding officer of the board. And  I befriended her because of the dedicated person she was, because she  always worked in the best interest of students.   Riverside has lost a great public servant, and I join our community  in remembering Kathleen Daley's passion for student success and  recognizing her contributions.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 6691, the Community  Safety and Security Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, I want to bring to my colleague's attention an issue I  don't think the majority considered when rushing this bill to the floor  without any hearings or markup. They departed from regular order, and  doing so always has some, I think, unintended consequences.   H.R. 6691 will help deport veterans, people who have served in our  military and often who have served in combat. Current law makes certain  crimes a deportable offense for legal permanent residents. For the  thousands of servicemembers and veterans who are legal permanent  residents, this bill will make it easier to deport them.   If a soldier comes home with PTSD or if a veteran is struggling with  substance abuse or gets in trouble with the law, this bill makes it  harder to grant them any kind of discretion.   I have met with dozens of deported veterans who have served their  country honorably, even been to war, but were deported when they came  home. They made mistakes. They paid their debt to society, and their  service meant nothing when it came time to permanently banish them from  our country.   Now, that is unfair. It is cruel and unusual punishment. I believe  that if anyone deserves a second chance in our country, it is our  veterans.   Now, I agree with many of my colleagues that the Supreme Court is  right and that we need to change the vagueness in the current law;  however, we need to do that through regular order. This bill would  classify certain crimes as violent, even if no one was harmed in the  act. These are serious issues and they deserve a serious process.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will have many unintended consequences if made  into law. I implore my colleagues to vote against it and have it go  through regular order and get the hearings that it merits.
