 Madam Speaker, today I rise because of the double  standards in this Chamber. Once again, this weekend we saw a Member of  the majority openly call for more confrontation in a Minneapolis  suburb. That very night there was a drive-by shooting in that community  where police and National Guardsmen were targeted.   If this were reversed, if this were said by a Republican, you know,  Madam Speaker, that the majority in this Chamber would move to strip  that Representative of their committees and possibly move to expel them  from Congress.   We have actually seen this before.   If what President Trump said on January 6 was inciting a riot, then  what do the words ``get more confrontational'' mean?   Are those not the words someone would use if they wanted to incite  more violence or insurrection?   If the majority cares about this institution, and if the majority  cares about our Nation, then they need to get their own house in order  and tamp down this vile rhetoric.                            ____________________
