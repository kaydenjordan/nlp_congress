 Mr. Speaker, California's leadership on protecting public  health and safeguarding our environment should be a national model.   When the Federal Government has failed to guarantee cleaner air to  every Californian, our State government has acted to reduce harm.   When Washington, D.C., politicians were doing the bidding of Big Oil,  California had the courage to curb pollution and improve air quality.   California's recent strengthening of emission standards will save $13  billion in healthcare costs and prevent more than 1,200 lives from  being cut short. House Republicans' wrongheaded legislation would undo  this progress and substitute their judgment for that of California's  own representatives.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 1435 and instead  work to provide cleaner air to every American.
