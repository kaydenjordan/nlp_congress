 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his  leadership on this issue. I rise in strong support of H.R. 79, the  bipartisan HALOS Act.   As the chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I have the  honor and pleasure of hearing and speaking with many of America's  small-business owners and their employees almost every day. I hear case  after case of small-business owners working days and nights and  weekends. I hear stories of sacrifice. I hear inspiring stories of  success.   But all too often, I hear about how the government continues to make  it difficult for small businesses to prosper and grow and create more  jobs, which is, obviously, very important to our Nation and its  economy.   Perhaps one of the most common and most alarming concerns is just how  difficult it is for entrepreneurs who are starting out to access the  capital they need in order to grow. We must provide entrepreneurs a  better way to build their businesses. The HALOS Act does just that.   The Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act expands access to capital by  ensuring small businesses are able to continue to connect and interact  with angel investors. One popular way in which small businesses connect  with angel investors is through demo days. These exciting events are  sponsored by universities, nonprofits, local governments, and many  other groups that allow entrepreneurs to showcase their products and  informally meet investors and customers. However, SEC regulations are  threatening to force these events out of business by imposing unwieldy  regulations that dictate who is and who is not allowed to simply  attend.    These ill-considered regulations would force everybody who merely  walks through the door to go through what is essentially a full  financial examination--handing over tax documents, bank statements,  paycheck information, and on and on. This just doesn't make sense. We  should be encouraging participation in demo days, not creating  obstacles. We should be allowing the largest group of attendees to  gather in the room, not be limiting who can walk through the door.  After all, not only are these events places to connect people with our  communities' small businesses, but they also provide a great  opportunity for our next generation of entrepreneurs to ask questions  and learn what it takes for a business to open its doors and be  successful.   I thank Chairman Hensarling for his leadership as well as  Representatives Sinema and Schneider for working in a cooperative and  bipartisan manner.   An identical bill, as the chairman mentioned, passed this House in  the last session of Congress in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion.  We must continue to work together to create an environment in which our  small businesses--the engines of our economy--grow and flourish. This  bill is one more step in that direction.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 79.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 288, the  Small Business Broadband Deployment Act. This commonsense, bipartisan  legislation does two important things. First, it extends the temporary  exemption granted to small businesses by the Federal Communications  Commission, the FCC, from the burdensome disclosure requirements for  Internet service providers and the FCC's own Open Internet Order by 5  years. Second, it increases the number of small businesses that can  utilize the exemption by raising the threshold from 100,000 subscribers  to the much more realistic 250,000 subscribers.   Small businesses frequently feel that the Federal Government  exercises its most creativity in looking for new ways to get in their  way. Oftentimes, small Internet providers are the only ones willing to  take the risk and deploy broadband to particularly hard-to-reach areas  of rural America. The last thing they have time for is the FCC imposing  a greater regulatory burden on them, diverting precious resources to  make Washington bureaucrats busy instead of doing what they do best,  providing high quality broadband services to millions of Americans in  every corner of our country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and  help reduce a portion of the tedious regulatory burden on small  businesses.                                time  1545
