 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the package of  gun violence prevention bills we are considering today.   Gun violence is at unseen epidemic levels in this country. We need to  combat the source of the epidemic: easy access to guns.   I will address, however, the impact of the lack of statehood for the  residents of the District of Columbia on their ability to pass and  maintain their own commonsense gun violence prevention laws.   If Republicans take the majority in the next Congress, they could  eliminate D.C.'s gun violence prevention laws, which they have  repeatedly tried to do, including its ban on assault weapons and high- capacity magazines and its universal background checks.   At least seven current Republican Members of Congress have introduced  such bills. I have defeated each effort in Congress to overturn D.C.  gun violence prevention laws, and I vow to do so again, but the  ultimate remedy for congressional interference in local D.C. matters,  of course, is D.C. statehood.
