 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Madam President, I rise to talk about some of the issues  we are facing as we approach a deadline tonight, but I really wanted to  start with one observation about where we are and where we could be in  the next couple of days.   Some of the debate is focused on simply what could happen at midnight  were there to be a shutdown of the Federal Government, but there is  another alternative, of course, and that is--well, two, really: to have  an agreement that would carry forward before the deadline. That is, in  my judgment, less likely to happen. I don't think anybody believes that  would happen, necessarily, but the other option, of course, is to have  a number of days ahead of us--3 days, 4 days, whatever the leadership  on the two sides can agree to--to continue negotiations because, of  course, we have a range of issues. Sometimes we haven't talked enough  about the long list of issues. I will get into a few tonight, but there  is a rather long list of issues, some of which have already been the  subject of not just consensus but a bipartisan piece of legislation,  actual bill text that has been introduced or could be introduced in  short order, in the next few days or even the next couple of hours.   Then there are other issues where there have been ongoing issues for  a long period of time, haven't reached consensus, but if we all give  ourselves a deadline and stay here--and I hope people in both parties  will stay for the next few days no matter what happens tonight. If  there is an extension of 3 or 4 days, that doesn't make it any less  challenging because that just means there will be a short-term  deadline. I don't think it makes any sense to go another month because  the can, in essence, will be kicked down the road again.   We need to make decisions about some big issues. There are some who  have observed that even if you were in favor of the measure that came  over from the House last night, which I have real trouble with--a lot  of gaping holes in that proposal, a lot of urgent matters for many  Americans that have not been addressed in that proposal--but even if  you favor that, you can also still hold the position you don't favor  continuing resolution after continuing resolution. I guess we are on  our fourth resolution, if we have the right count, since October 1--not  that long ago.   So that is at least my sense of where we could be in the next couple  of days: not leaving Washington and staying at the negotiating table on  a range of issues. That is the reasonable thing to do, not only to keep  the government operating and open but also to finally resolve some  major issues, which I think most of both parties want to solve.   Let me start tonight with some personal letters. One of the major  issues which is not resolved, but there has been a lot of effort made  which is bipartisan, is the issue of pensions. I have received letters  from a lot of Pennsylvanians who say: Look, it is up to you and up to  the people in both parties to solve this pension crisis which has  engulfed so many families. In Pennsylvania, if you add up the  categories of people affected--retirees and their families--you are  talking about at least 35,000 families, usually because the largest  share of retirees are coal miners in Pennsylvania. I am sure it is true  in other States as well.   I got a letter from a woman in Washington County, PA, right in the  southwestern corner of our State. I will not read the whole letter, but  she was talking about her husband who is a retired miner. She said:  ``He worked for many years in the coal mines and endured dangerous  conditions, unsafe work hazards, and a mine fire which he narrowly  escaped and closed the mine forcing him to lose his job.''   She concludes by saying: ``This pension is so important to him and to  us''--and she goes on from there.   That is one person talking about her husband doing the most dangerous  work imaginable. I am not sure there is a more dangerous job in the  world than coal mining, and I know of what I speak because of the  corner of Pennsylvania I am from, the anthracite coal region.   Here is another letter from the same corner of the State,  Southwestern Pennsylvania, in this case, in particular, talking about  the pension legislation which is before the Senate right now, the so- called Butch Lewis Act. Here is what this man says about his family,  talking about the way he earned a pension. He said:         We gave up pay raises, to get a meager pension, and as we       get older we can't start over. Please [pass . . .] the Butch       Lewis act.    A third letter, also from Southwestern Pennsylvania--in this case  from Westmoreland County, one county over, just to the east of  Pittsburgh. This individual talks about the pension he received. He  said: ``I am facing pension cuts that will have an immediate and  devastating impact on my family.'' He goes on from there.   We have even more letters. A letter from the same corner of the  State, Fayette County--one of the great counties of Pennsylvania in the  most southwestern corner, right next to Greene County, right on the  Ohio or West Virginia border, depending on which side you are looking  at.   This individual said to me in the letter:         [T]here are so many retired miners, widows and families       that rely upon those benefits each month. Including my mother       and me, she is a widow and I have cerebral palsy and we       depend on my dad's pension to survive on the limited income.    So the miner is speaking about the pension they earned and their hope  and expectation, which is a reasonable expectation that the promise  made in that pension would be fulfilled, or it is the perspective of a  son or a daughter or a wife or even, unfortunately, in many cases, a  widow talking about a miner who had passed away.   Here is another letter from Southwestern Pennsylvania, talking about  that word I just used, ``promise.''         This [pension] was a promise made by the government. . . .       we kept ours . . . and now we hope that you will continue to       KEEP THE PROMISE.    ``KEEP THE PROMISE,'' all in capital letters, by this individual.         I am 73 years old and if I was to lose my pension, my wife       & I would be forced to live in poverty.    Here is another pension letter. This is not from a coal miner but  from a retired truckdriver--another group of Americans affected when  the U.S. Senate doesn't get pension legislation done, like we can do in  the next couple of days. ``I am a retired truck driver . . . spent 25  years of my life in this occupation . . .'' and asking me as his  Senator ``if you could do whatever you can do to preserve that pension  for my wife and I.''   Another letter from the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, not far  from where I live, talks about the same act, the Butch Lewis Act. In  this case, the letter is about his father: My father, for over 25  years, was paying into a pension. He was a dock worker, physically  loading trucks by hand. He did this to provide for my family and to  ensure we had medical coverage and also a pension.   Then it talks about a pension. His dad was told at one point that the  pension was wiped out, that everything he had worked for was taken  away. He worked hard for 25 years--nights, weekends, double shifts  sometimes, on and on and on.   I heard from the majority leader last night that somehow these kinds  of issues that are part of this larger debate are not urgent. He said  the only urgent matter is the government funding bill. I would agree  that is urgent, but I would also agree that if you are a retired coal  miner or the family of a retired coal miner or a retired truckdriver or  you are owed a pension of any  [[Page S342]]  kind for all the work you did in your life, your situation is urgent.  It is not something we can put off and say: Well, why don't you wait  another 6 months? Wait for a couple more CRs--continuing resolutions-- and we will get to you later.   The pension issue is as urgent as any other. There is a lot of talk  around here as if it isn't. It is very, very urgent.   I will give you another urgent issue--the issue of community health  centers. Here is a letter I received from Southeastern Pennsylvania-- just outside of Philadelphia--about funding for community health  centers, which, just like the pension issue, is not addressed in the  House proposal or the House bill that passed. They don't address  pensions. They don't address community health centers. By the way, the  deadline for community health centers, just like children's health, was  way back in October--October 1.   I am glad that some Republicans are finally--finally, after more than  100 days--starting to clue in a little bit to children's health  insurance. They are talking about it. It is great that they are finally  talking about children's health insurance, which they haven't talked  about much since they let the deadline expire months ago. The majority  party allowed that to happen. Maybe by midnight tonight they will start  talking about community health centers that serve 800,000 people in  Pennsylvania. I hope they start talking about it at least, and maybe we  can come together and get something done.   Here is what she says about community health centers: We serve  hundreds of thousands of underserved people who deserve the quality of  care we provide. They have lives filled with trauma and in turn suffer  from social, physical, and behavioral issues that will go untreated if  funding for community health centers go away.   I guess that is not urgent. If you rely upon a community health  center for your healthcare, it is urgent. It is every bit as urgent as  anything we have talked about in the last couple of days and weeks. The  House bill does nothing on that, nothing on miners' pensions, nothing  on pensions, nothing on community health centers. And we are supposed  to just accept that and move on and have another continuing resolution  when they don't even address it in their proposal.   Here is another letter about community health centers. This one is  about the patients who live in rural and underserved areas, who are in  areas where there is a great need for health centers. I guess it is not  urgent for those folks in rural areas who depend upon these health  centers. As I said, in Pennsylvania, if you look at the total--rural  and urban and everything in between--it is 800,000 people. I guess it  is not urgent for them. This House bill does nothing for those  community health centers and those people who live in rural and urban  areas who depend upon those health centers. I guess we should just  wait--wait another month, wait another 6 months, wait another year--for  community health centers to be funded. The majority allowed funding for  those to expire, just as they allowed funding for children's health  insurance to expire.   Here is another letter that talks about health centers. This  individual says:         If Congress kicks this can down the road one more time, it       will be a signal to health centers that we need to implement       measures that will result in site closures, layoffs and       reduced services.    I guess community health centers are not urgent.   How about this program that is also not addressed in the House  legislation--the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting  Program. This is an evidenced-based home visiting program that supports  at-risk pregnant women and young families. It is a great program that  has been in place for the last couple of years. In fiscal year 2017,  funding was about $400 million. That is not addressed either. I guess  that is not urgent, just like community health centers and just like  pensions for retired coal miners and truckdrivers and others. None of  this, apparently, according to the majority, is urgent. None of this is  urgent.   I will tell you what was urgent for the majority at the end of last  year, November and December: an obsession with getting a tax bill  passed, which did pretty well for the superrich and big corporations.  There was all kinds of time for that--negotiations between and among  Republicans, discussions and changes in the bill, between and among  Republicans only, for a tax bill. That was very urgent. To get that tax  bill rammed through--that was very urgent, so children's health  insurance had to wait even though in December it was already 2 months  overdue, 2 months after expiration. Community health centers had to  wait, as well, because you had to get your Republican tax bill done.  All of that had to wait. Coal miners' pensions had to wait, too,  because you had to get the tax bill done for the rich and for  corporations.   How about the issue that received a lot of attention, the so-called  DACA Program, the Dreamers? Right now, we have seven Senate  Republicans, at last count--it might have gone higher--seven Senate  Republicans have joined with Senate Democrats on a bipartisan bill to  do a lot of things but principally improve border security and help  young Dreamers. That is a bill that is ready to go right now, and it is  urgent because people have been deported, and both parties assert that  they are concerned about these Dreamers. We could get it done right  now. One Republican Senator said he could get it done in half an hour.  Let's say he is way off--maybe an hour and certainly a few days. We  could get that done as well.   There is a lot that is urgent, and there is a lot that is left on the  table with this House bill that came over last night.   I hope both parties continue to negotiate. I hope we will heed the  words that were sent out last night by the Defense Department. Here is  what Dana W. White said:         We have been working under a Continuing Resolution for       three years now.   Meaning the Defense Department.         Our current CR expires tomorrow, 19 Jan. This is wasteful       and destructive.    She hopes and I think our military hopes that we don't keep kicking  the can down the road. Let's come together and get so much done for the  American people that we can get done tonight, tomorrow morning,  tomorrow night, Sunday morning, Sunday night, Monday morning, Monday  afternoon, Monday night, Tuesday. We can stay here and get a lot of  this done, and then we can move on to other things. We can get a major  list of problems solved, not this House bill full of holes that leaves  so many Americans out, leaves coal miners out, leaves truckdrivers out.  It leaves millions out. By one estimate, 27 million people in the  country get their healthcare at community health centers, 800,000 in  Pennsylvania. We could do all that, bring the country together, and  then move on to other issues that we haven't discussed yet, such as  infrastructure, fixing roads and bridges, and bringing broadband to  rural America. Fill in the blank with whatever else you want to work  on, but there is a lot we could do.   The President said that he wanted to make infrastructure a priority.  It is going to be difficult to get to that if we keep getting stuck on  these 3-week or 2-month continuing resolutions.   I know there has been a lot of chatter today about blame games. Look,  according to my count, there might be only one politician in the  country who has spoken directly and I think repeatedly, but at least  once that we know of, about a government shutdown, and that happens to  be the President.   I will hold up this poster, which is a statement dated May 2. ``Our  country needs a good shutdown,'' said the President on May 2, 2017. I  hope the majority will not agree with that, that our country needs  that. We need to come together and use this opportunity to do the  following: Fund the Federal Government. Make sure retirees have the  pension they have been waiting for for a long time. Coal miners have  been coming to this town for years now trying to get their healthcare.  They were promised that in early 2016. It didn't happen because the  majority made them wait. They were promised in 2016--later in the  year--that it would happen in the fall when the Finance Committee got  the coal miners healthcare bill done. It didn't happen in the fall. The  majority made them wait. Then, of course, they said: Oh, no, but after  the election, in December of 2016, it will get done then. But the  majority made them wait. After months and months of pressing, these  coal miners finally got the promise fulfilled by  [[Page S343]]  getting their healthcare in April of 2017.   At the time, they said: We appreciate the fact that we got the  healthcare problem solved. Now we need to work on the pensions.   So the pensions for coal miners didn't start in April of 2017. That  was part of the original bill, but we were only able to get the  healthcare part of it done. So miners' pensions goes back much further  than the early part of 2017; it goes back to 2016 and 2015 and years  before that.   I would hope that before we move to bringing the sides together, that  we would make those pensions and those retirees a priority. I would  hope we would make community health centers a priority, as well as  getting done for children what we should get done.   One point about the Children's Health Insurance Program. I am glad  that my Republican friends are finally talking about the program. They  were rather quiet the last couple of months when they refused to bring  it up on the floor. Of course, everyone knows that if you put a CHIP  bill on this floor tonight, it would pass in minutes. We would get an  overwhelming vote. If the majority really cares about it, they would do  just that, just as we have been asking for months. But, of course,  children weren't a priority because they had to get a tax bill done.  That was the big priority. They had to get that big tax bill done so  that the corporations would be happy with Republican Senators.   Let me make one point about children's health. We have to get that  done as well, but the problem is, for a lot of reasons, the cost has  changed a good bit. Here is the reality. The CHIP program, according to  this proposal, is limited in time to 6 years. If Republicans included a  10-year extension, it would actually save billions of dollars and, more  importantly, would remove us from the cycle of funding crises to which  we have grown accustomed.   If it is less expensive and provides more certainty, why don't we do  CHIP for 10 years? I would like to make it permanent. That would be the  best result, the optimal result. But why not 10 years? Because of a  whole series of dynamics that happened over the last couple of months,  the cost has actually gone down. If you can get a cheaper rate, so to  speak, for a 10-year extension, why not make it 10 years? I know the  Freedom Caucus and House Republicans came up with 6, but I thought they  wanted to save money, and I hope they want to save money and help kids.  I hope we can come together on that as well. Let's make it a 10-year  commitment to our kids. I think the Senate Republicans passed a tax  bill that had a corporate tax break that is permanent--permanent tax  relief for big corporations. Why not at least give children's health  insurance and the children who depend on it at least 10 years. Give  them a decade, right? That is not a big sacrifice. Of course, it would  be better if we gave them permanent certainty like the corporations got  with their taxes. At least give them 10 years. Now that both parties  are beyond the 5 years, let's give them 10 years, and it will have the  added benefit of saving billions of dollars.    We can do all of this in the next number of hours and days. We can  get all of this done, and then we can move forward in a bipartisan way  on to other priorities. We cannot, simply, accept a measure from the  House that is full of holes--that does nothing for those retirees, that  does nothing for community health centers, that does nothing to address  the opioid crisis. We didn't get into that, but we could easily be  funding more for our local communities.   I hope we don't listen to this statement here that somehow this is  something that is good for the country. We need to stay here and  continue negotiations and, in some cases, wrap up promising  negotiations that have already reached a consensus. We should stay here  tonight and Saturday and Sunday and Monday and Tuesday at least. That  is not asking much to negotiate hard for 4 days. Let's see what we can  get done in a couple of days and see where we are.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
