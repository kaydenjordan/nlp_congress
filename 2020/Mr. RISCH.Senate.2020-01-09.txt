Transmittal No. 20-06       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The F-35B Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL)       aircraft is a single-seat, single-engine, all-weather,       stealth, fifth-generation, multirole aircraft. It contains       sensitive technology including the low observable airframe/      outer mold line, the Pratt and Whitney F135 engine, AN/APG-81       radar, an integrated core processor central computer, mission       systems/electronic warfare suite, a multiple sensor suite,       technical data/documentation, and associated software.       Sensitive elements of the F-35B are also included in       operational flight and maintenance trainers.        a. The Pratt and Whitney F135 engine is a single 40,000-lb       thrust class engine designed for the F-35 and assures highly       reliable, affordable performance. The engine is designed to       be utilized in all F-35 variants, providing unmatched       commonality and supportability throughout the worldwide base       of F-35 users. The Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (STOVL)       propulsion configuration consists of the main engine,       diverter-less supersonic inlet, a three (3) Bearing Swivel       Module, Roll Posts and Duct Assembly System, and Lift Fan.        b. The AN/APG-81 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA)       is a high processing power/high transmission power electronic       array capable of detecting air and ground targets from a       greater distance than mechanically scanned array radars. It       also contains a synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which creates       high-resolution ground maps and provides weather data to the       pilot, and provides air and ground tracks to the mission       system, which uses it as a component to fuse sensor data.        c. The Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) provides       long-range detection and tracking as well as an infrared       search and track (IRST) and forward-looking infrared (FLIR)       capability for precision tracking, weapons delivery, and bomb       damage assessment (BDA). The EOTS replaces multiple separate       internal or podded systems typically found on legacy       aircraft.        d. The Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS)       provides the pilot with full spherical coverage for air-to-      air and air-to-ground threat awareness, day/night vision       enhancements, a fire control capability, and precision       tracking of wingmen/friendly aircraft. The EODAS provides       data directly to the pilot's helmet as well as the mission       system.        e. The Electronic Warfare (EW) system is a reprogrammable,       integrated system that provides radar warning and electronic       support measures (ESM) along with a fully integrated       countermeasures (CM) system. The EW system is the primary       subsystem used to enhance situational awareness, targeting       support and self-defense through the search, intercept,       location, and identification of in-band emitters and to       automatically counter TR and RF threats.        f. The Command, Control, Communications, Computers and       Intelligence/Communications, Navigation, and Identification       (C4I/CNI) system provides the pilot with unmatched       connectivity to flight members, coalition forces, and the       battlefield. It is an integrated subsystem designed to       provide a broad spectrum of secure, anti-jam voice and data       communications, precision radio navigation and landing       capability, self-identification, beyond visual range target       identification, and connectivity to off-board sources of       information. It also includes an inertial navigation and       global positioning system (GPS) for precise location       information. The functionality is tightly integrated within       the mission system to enhance efficiency.        g. The aircraft C4I/CNI system includes two data links, the       Multi-Function Advanced Data Link (MADL) and Link 16. The       MADL is designed specifically for the F-35 and allows for       stealthy communications between F-35s. Link 16 data link       equipment allows the F-35 to communicate with legacy aircraft       using widely distributed J-series message protocols.        h. The F-35 Autonomic Logistics Global Sustainment (ALGS)       provides a fully integrated logistics management solution.       ALGS integrates a number of functional areas including supply       chain management, repair, support equipment, engine support,       and training. The ALGS infrastructure employs a state-of-the-      art information system that provides real-time, decision-      worthy information for sustainment decisions by flight line       personnel. Prognostic health monitoring technology is       integrated with the air system and is crucial to predictive       maintenance of vital components.        i. The F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS)       provides an intelligent information infrastructure that binds       all the key concepts of ALGS into an effective support       system. ALIS establishes the appropriate interfaces among the       F-35 Air Vehicle, the warfighter, the training system,       government information technology (IT) systems, and       supporting commercial enterprise systems. Additionally, ALIS       provides a comprehensive tool for data collection and       analysis, decision support, and action tracking.        j. The F-35 Training System includes several training       devices to provide integrated training for pilots and       maintainers. The pilot training devices include a Full       Mission Simulator (FMS) and Deployable Mission Rehearsal       Trainer (DMRT). The maintainer training devices include an       Aircraft Systems Maintenance Trainer (ASMT), Ejection System       Maintenance Trainer (ESMT), Outer Mold Line (OML) Lab,       Flexible Linear Shaped Charge (FLSC) Trainer, Fl35 Engine       Module Trainer, and Weapons Loading Trainer (WLT). The F-35       Training System can be integrated, where both pilots and       maintainers learn in the same Integrated Training Center       (ITC). Alternatively, the pilots and maintainers can train in       separate facilities (Pilot Training Center and Maintenance       Training Center).        k. Other subsystems, features, and capabilities include the       F-35's low observable airframe, Integrated Cure Processor       (ICP) Central Computer, Helmet Mounted Display System (HMDS),       Pilot Life Support System, Off-Board Mission Support (OMS)       System, and publications/maintenance manuals. The HMDS       provides a fully sunlight readable, bi-ocular display       presentation of aircraft information projected onto the       pilot's helmet visor. The use of a night vision camera       integrated into the helmet eliminates the need for separate       Night Vision Goggles (NVG). The Pilot Life Support System       provides a measure of Pilot Chemical, Biological, and       Radiological Protection through use of an On-Board Oxygen       Generating System (OBOGS); and an escape system that provides       additional protection to the pilot. OBOGS takes the Power and       Thermal Management System (PTMS) air and enriches it by       removing gases (mainly nitrogen) by adsorption, thereby       increasing the concentration of oxygen in the product gas and       supplying breathable air to the pilot. The OMS provides a       mission planning, mission briefing, and a maintenance/      intelligence/tactical debriefing platform for the F-35.        2. The Reprogramming Center is located in the U.S. and       provides F-35 customers a means to update F-35 electronic       warfare databases.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures, which       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that Singapore can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This       proposed sale is necessary to further the U.S. foreign policy       and national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification. Moreover, the benefits to be derived from this       sale, as outlined in the Policy Justification, outweigh the       potential damage that could result if the sensitive       technology were revealed to unauthorized persons.        5. All defense articles and services listed on this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Singapore.                            ____________________
