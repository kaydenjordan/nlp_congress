 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong  opposition to President Trump's ban on the entry of refugees from  around the world as well as the ban on refugees and citizens from seven  select countries.   This ban, whether temporary or not, is shameful, and wholly un- American. There are better ways to protect our Nation, ways that are  effective and stay true to our American values.   For example, in the 1970s and 1980s, thousands of my constituents  fled the horrors of war and genocide in Vietnam and in Cambodia as  refugees. Today, these immigrants and their children are doctors,  lawyers, teachers, parents, students, all integral to the success of  our Nation.   America has long endured as the shining beacon on the Hill. Sadly,  that light was dimmed by the President's immigration executive order.  Our Nation is great because it has been built by refugees and  immigrants from every part of the world.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in strong opposition to this resolution, which would waste  resources, waste money, pollute our air, and worsen the impacts of  climate change.   When it comes to regulations that we should keep on the books, the  BLM Methane Waste Prevention Rule is a no-brainer. Currently, oil and  gas companies are venting, flaring, or leaking hundreds of millions of  dollars' worth of natural gas each and every year.   People who are sitting at home may wonder: Why would a company simply  waste or burn off such a valuable resource?    The answer is simple: They want the oil, and they want it now. To  them, the natural gas that goes along with the oil is just a nuisance;  so they burn it off or they don't make the effort that is required to  ensure that their equipment isn't leaking.   The problem is, when they are operating on public lands, this isn't  their natural gas to waste. They cannot waste this. This belongs to the  American people. So when that gas is simply burned off or is allowed to  escape, the royalties that are owed to the American people are gone  with the wind; and instead of generating electricity or heating our  homes, this wasted resource generates pollution and heats our planet.   For people who live near oil and gas wells, this is not just a  climate problem. Methane contributes to low-level ozone, which causes a  number of health problems, such as shortness of breath, more frequent  asthma attacks, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. When the  methane leaks, you also get leaks of benzene, which is a known  carcinogen, and of other volatile organic chemicals that further  contribute to ozone and smog and can contribute to liver and kidney  damage, nausea, and other health problems.   Now, my colleagues on the other side say that this is exactly the  problem--the Bureau of Land Management is trying to regulate air  pollution, and that is the job of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The fact is, though, that the Bureau of Land Management has very  clearly written a waste prevention rule, as they are authorized and  required. I will state that again--as they are authorized and required  to do under the Mineral Leasing Act.   Section 30 of the Mineral Leasing Act reads:         Each lease shall contain provisions for the purpose of       insuring the exercise of reasonable diligence, skill, and       care in the operation of said property; a provision that such       rules for the safety and welfare of the miners and for the       prevention of undue waste as may be prescribed by said       Secretary shall be observed.    The BLM simply did its job by writing this rule, and now that they  have done the job that Congress required of them, the majority is  attempting to argue that Congress never gave the BLM that job in the  first place. If you look at the statute, that claim is clearly an  alternative fact. Just because preventing the waste of methane helps  keep our air clean and moderates the severity of climate change, it  doesn't mean the BLM is doing anything outside of their authority. The  BLM is not regulating the quality of the air around oil and gas sites.  It is just trying to make sure that methane stays out of the atmosphere  and gets into the marketplace.   Another argument you have heard from the majority is that this is an  effort to shut down oil and gas production on Federal lands. It is just  another salvo in their war, which they claim is the Obama war on  energy, except that that is simply not true. I am almost tired of  having to say this, but the production of Federal onshore oil went up,  not a little bit--it went way up under President Obama--but by 71  percent, as a matter of fact, between 2009 and 2015.   Now, would this Methane Waste Prevention Rule hurt production? Would  it drive operators off Federal lands?   To answer that, let's just take a look at one of our States-- Colorado, which, in early 2014, enacted methane venting and flaring  regulations that the BLM used as a model in writing its own rule. I  want to state this really clearly: after Colorado enacted their methane  regulations, their production went up 47 percent from 2013 to 2014 and  another 32 percent in 2015. Colorado's oil production from Federal  lands has been up 28 percent over the past 5 years also.   Clearly, strong methane waste regulations do not scare away oil and  gas companies.   What about the claim that companies have to burn off natural gas  because the BLM takes too long to process pipeline applications?   If we look at a recent report from the Government Accountability  Office just from last year, they found that only 9 percent of flaring  was due to the lack of pipelines and that 91 percent had nothing to do  with pipelines.                                time  0930    How about the point that is made at the oil and gas companies'  insistence that they are making great strides in reducing their own  methane emissions so they don't need additional oversight?   Members, that is a myth as well. Oil and gas producers in the field  emitted 45 percent more methane in 2014 than they did in 1990. In fact,  methane emissions from oil and gas producers went up 21 percent in the  past 24 years.   The majority also says this is a power grab, an effort by BLM to take  power away from the States, except that the BLM has regulated venting  and flaring since the Carter administration. And this has not stopped  States from setting their own regulations, as I have just said that  Colorado  [[Page H953]]  has done, which they will still be free to do under this rule. In fact,  despite all the complaints about one-size-fits-all regulations,  companies still have to follow State regulations when they operate on  Federal land.   Mr. Speaker, none of these arguments against the regulation hold any  water, but the benefits of this regulation would be huge: enough gas  saved to supply up to 740,000 households each year; the reduction of an  estimated 185,000 tons of methane emissions, which would have the same  impact as taking nearly 1 million cars off the road; and up to $14  million each year to the American taxpayer from additional royalties,  and that number could be even larger if the price of natural gas  increases, which the majority is trying to do by expediting natural gas  exports.   The BLM methane waste prevention rule is a win for the taxpayer, a  win for the environment, a win for the climate, and a win for common  sense. That is why it is supported by over 80 percent of voters in  Western States, including both Democrats and Republicans, according to  a poll just released this week. If my colleagues have not seen that  poll, I would be happy to share it with them.   Unfortunately, the Republican antiregulatory, antitaxpayer,  antihealth, antienvironment machine must be continually fed. Earlier  this week, they voted to strip clean water and transparency  regulations. Today, they are going after clean air.   I ask my colleagues to stand up and put a stop to this, to speak for  the ordinary Americans who don't own oil and gas or coal companies,  which those companies donate immense sums of money to politicians. The  industry has to do its share and not simply demand that the farmers,  the ranchers, the sportsmen, the conservationists, and all the rest of  us have to put up with their waste in the name of higher profits. I ask  my colleagues to do this by voting ``no'' on H.J. Res. 36.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to be very clear about the situation on public lands because  there are a lot of misleading statements that are being thrown about.  We heard that the majority insists that oil and gas production on  Federal lands is down. To support this, they often show misleading  charts that compare apples to oranges or use visual tricks to hide the  facts.   The facts are Federal onshore oil production was up 71 percent  between 2009 and 2015. All the panic that we have heard for years that  President Obama is trying to shut down oil and gas was based on as much  reality as the claim that he was coming to get everyone's guns.   I will say it again: there was a 71 percent increase in oil  production on onshore Federal lands under President Obama's watch. And  it is the oil producers that are wasting and leaking methane at a  faster and faster rate since it is not a product they care about. They  just want the oil.   With an unfortunate likely return to a drill-at-all-cost mentality  under President Trump, we need the BLM methane waste prevention rule  more than ever. I urge my colleagues to defeat H.J. Res. 36 and support  cutting down on methane waste.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0945     Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot from Members from Colorado about how  this onerous methane rule will hurt industry in Colorado. I would like  to read from a couple of Colorado editorials that came out this past  week in support of maintaining the BLM methane rule.   On Saturday, The Denver Post posted an editorial entitled ``Congress  shouldn't butcher federal methane rules.'' In it, they say: ``Congress  is getting ready to use an ax where it needs a scalpel. . . .''   Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Review Act is an ax.  It is an ax being swung blindfolded after several shots of whiskey. It  shows a complete lack of seriousness on the issue, and it could have  serious, long-term consequences.   That is why The Denver Post editorial board asks Republicans to be  surgeons and not butchers, and to avoid repealing what they call a  thoughtful regulation.   This past week, another editorial was published on Wednesday by the  Grand Junction, Colorado Daily Sentinel entitled, ``Stop methane  leaks.'' Referring to their State's own methane waste rules, they say:  ``We're fortunate to have the rule in Colorado. But if the federal rule  isn't enforced, the results can undermine our own gains.''   Air quality does not recognize State lines. Under-regulated drilling  in Utah produces bad air that blows into the western slope communities.   These editorial boards have seen firsthand that methane waste  prevention rules work, and they know that it is in everyone's interest  to keep the BLM rule in place.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to reinforce a point that I made in my  opening statement. Oil and gas companies and the industry would like to  say they have done a tremendous job cutting methane emissions on their  own.   In fact, just this week, the Western Energy Alliance spearheaded a  letter saying: ``Methane emissions from oil and gas production have  declined by 15 percent since 1990, without any Federal regulations.''   What we have been hearing today, and my friends on the other side, is  continually using some variation of this reduction that they say  occurs. The problem is, and I repeat that the problem is, is that claim  is just flat out false. That is the definition of an alternative fact.   Methane reduction, since 1990, has come entirely from natural gas  storage, from the distribution and the transmission of natural gas. Out  in the field, however, what we are talking about, out in the field,  where companies are actually drilling, methane emissions are up.   For natural gas production, methane in the field, methane emissions  are up by 31 percent. For oil production, emissions are up a staggering  76 percent.   Mr. Speaker, the industry has not fixed this problem on their own,  and they are not going to fix this problem on their own. Only strong  rules and oversight are going to hold companies accountable to reduce  methane waste and, for that reason, we must defeat this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   As I have mentioned before, Mr. Speaker, this rule will not just  reduce waste and increase taxpayer revenues, it will also reduce air  pollution and improve public health.   In support of that, we received a letter this week from 13 medical  and public health groups, including the American Lung Association, the  American Public Health Association, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation  of America, the Public Health Institute, and many more, pointing out  the importance of the BLM methane waste prevention rule for cutting  down on harmful methane emissions.   They write: ``. . . we strongly urge you to oppose any Congressional  Review Act resolution of disapprov- al . . .'' for the BLM rule.   They point to the volatile organic compounds that also pollute the  air when natural gas leaks, saying that these chemicals ``include  benzene, a known carcinogen; ethylbenzene, a probable carcinogen; and  toluene, a neurotoxin that may also cause miscarriages and birth  defects.''                                time  1000    Also, these chemicals are ``precursors to the formation of ground- level ozone, a dangerous air pollutant that causes permanent lung  damage. By limiting emissions of volatile organic chemicals, oil and  natural gas limits will reduce the risk of ozone formation in the air  and, thus, the risk of ozone-related health effects, including asthma  attacks, hospital admissions, and, unfortunately, premature deaths.''   These health impacts are just one more set of reasons why repealing  the BLM Methane Waste Prevention Rule is the wrong way to go.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, it may no longer be Groundhog Day, but it feels like we  have been here doing the same thing over and over again.   Once again, Republicans are doing the bidding of wealthy fossil fuel  companies at the expense of ordinary Americans. On Wednesday, we were  here so our majority could strip away clean water protections from coal  mining. Later on that day, the majority gave our new Secretary of  State, Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, a gift by repealing  the requirement for oil and gas companies to tell the public how much  money they paid to foreign governments.   Now, today we are here to shower more goodies onto the oil and gas  industry by repealing a rule designed to keep them from wasting--and I  urge you to hear that term, ``wasting''--natural gas and also polluting  our air.   Really, Mr. Speaker? Less than 2 weeks into the new all-Republican  government and they are already handing out early Valentine's Day gifts  to their wealthy donors. Instead of chocolates and flowers, they are  giving their oil and coal executives the right to pollute our air, dump  waste into our water, and do it all under the cover of darkness.  Republicans are using the Congressional Review Act so fast that I doubt  they even know what they are repealing from day to day. It's Friday, so  I guess it must be air pollution day.   Let me warn everyone that is watching this telecast that they are not  going to stop at trying to destroy clean air, clean water, and  transparency. Dozens of health, safety, transparency, and consumer  protections are on the chopping block, and Republicans are more than  happy to swing the ax.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to protect the BLM Methane Waste  Prevention Rule and defeat this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I include in the Record two letters opposing this resolution and  supporting the BLM Methane Waste Prevention Rule. The first is from 78  environmental, conservation, public interest, and sportsmen's groups  urging a ``no'' vote on this resolution. The second is a letter from 13  public health and medical organizations strongly urging a ``no'' vote  on this resolution because of the damage that it will do to public  health.                                                   January 31, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of our millions of       members and supporters, we write to urge you to oppose any       effort to use the Congressional Review Act to overturn the       Bureau of Land Management's Methane and Natural Gas Waste       Rule. We rely on laws and regulations to protect taxpayer       resources and to keep our air and water clean and healthy.       While we oppose the use of the CRA for any rule, the BLM rule       is one of the anticipated targets to be considered under a       Congressional Review Act Resolution.        The BLM rule is a common sense policy that requires the oil       and gas industry to reduce venting, flaring, and leaks at       industry operations on public and tribal lands by deploying       methane mitigation technology. Currently, more than $330       million worth of natural gas is wasted on public and tribal       lands each year, meaning that taxpayers could lose out on       $800 million in royalties over the next decade due to venting       and flaring of this gas. Repealing this rule would harm       public health and reduce revenue to the federal government       and Western states. The BLM estimates the rule's net benefits       range from $46 to $204 million per year. And economic studies       have found the technologies and practices included in this       rule to be very cost effective since the gas captured can be       sold to the benefit of industry and taxpayers. Leaked natural       gas contains volatile organic compounds, an asthma irritant;       benzene; and other hazardous air pollutants that are known.       carcinogens. After Colorado implemented a similar rule,       natural gas production increased, and the standard has been       popular.        The Congressional Review Act (CRA) is a blunt instrument       that seeks to undermine the federal rulemaking process. It       allows Congress to overturn a recently finalized rule--major       or otherwise--through an expedited process called a       Resolution of Disapproval. In the Senate, a Resolution of       Disapproval requires only a simple majority vote, may       circumvent the committee process and cannot be filibustered.       If the resolution passes and is signed by the President, the       rule becomes void and the promulgating agency is prevented       from issuing a rule that is ``substantially the same'' in the       future without an act of Congress. By essentially voiding the       rulemaking process and mandating that substantially similar       rules not be pursued in the future, the CRA on the BLM's       Methane Rule wastes taxpayer money and defies the public       interest.        We request that you vote in opposition to this attack on       commonsense standards which limit wasted resources and       protect the American taxpayer, public health, and the       environment. Vote no on the BLM Methane CRA Resolution.

Dear Representative: On behalf of the tens of thousands of       members of the undersigned medical and public health       organizations, and the communities we serve, we strongly urge       you to oppose any Congressional Review Act resolution of       disapproval that would block air pollution limits that       address the leakage of methane, including the Bureau of Land       Management (BLM) Methane and Waste Prevention Rule.        The Congressional Review Act is a blunt tool that would       permanently block actions by BLM to reduce dangerous and       wasteful methane leaks from the oil and gas industries. Use       of the Congressional Review Act would not only block current       actions to solve manageable problems; it would also prevent       BLM from moving forward with substantially similar actions in       the future.        Methane fugitive emissions (leaks) occur from oil and gas       wells, drilling-related infrastructure and natural gas       pipelines. Estimates of the amount of methane lost to leakage       range from 9.3 percent to about 12 percent. Not only are       these leaks wasteful, but they also create dangerous threats       to health.        Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), gases recognized as       hazardous air pollutants, accompany the methane extracted       from deep underground wells. VOCs include benzene, a known       human carcinogen; ethylbenzene, a probable carcinogen; and       toluene, a neurotoxin (affecting the nervous system) that may       also cause miscarriages and birth defects. Comprehensive       methane limits would immediately reduce emissions of these       life-threatening substances.        VOCs are also precursors to the formation of ground-level       ozone, a dangerous air pollutant that causes permanent lung       damage. By limiting emissions of VOCs, oil and natural gas       limits will reduce the risk of ozone formation in the air       and, thus, the risk of ozone-related health effects,       including asthma attacks, hospital admissions and premature       deaths.        Finally, methane itself is a highly potent driver of       climate change, one of the greatest threats to public health       in our time. Methane is an extremely powerful heat-trapping       gas; over its first 20 years in the atmosphere, it is 84       times more effective at retaining heat than is carbon dioxide       . . . The resulting higher temperatures mean longer and       hotter heat waves and more ground-level ozone; these in turn       contribute to asthma attacks, cardiovascular disease, heart       attacks and premature death. Climate change also increases       the frequency and intensity of storms, droughts, wildfires       and flooding; these are associated with accidental deaths,       crop losses, air pollution, water contamination, and the       spread of disease-causing pathogens. If we as health and       medical organizations are to protect the public's health, it       is vital that our nation make progress in the fight against       climate change.        The Congressional Review Act, if applied to BLM's Methane       and Waste Prevention Rule, would block feasible, affordable       steps to reduce methane leakage. It would deprive Americans       of vital protections from carcinogenic and neurotoxic       substances and from climate change. Please make the health of       your constituents your priority and reject the use of       Congressional Review Act resolutions on actions that would       protect our health and our current and future wellbeing.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
