 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Idaho's Ginger  ``Mama'' Passarelli and the Soup Ladies, a nonprofit organization she  founded to serve first responders fresh meals following Hurricane  Katrina. Since 2004, the Soup Ladies have served countless meals to  those responding to tragedies across the country.   From hurricanes on the East Coast, wildfires across the West, and  tornadoes in the South, Ginger and the Soup Ladies provide fresh meals  to first responders, police and fire departments, search and rescue  teams, and military personnel. Most recently, the Soup Ladies' pink  trucks and trailers traveled to the southern border, where they cooked  fresh meals for Border Patrol agents working the frontlines of our  illegal immigration crisis. When the Soup Ladies are not responding to  national emergencies, they support emergency personnel and law  enforcement agents in their local communities. They recognize the  important sacrifices first responders make to selflessly serve their  communities and support them as they support us.   The Soup Ladies now consist of more than 80 volunteers across the  country and serve countless meals each year. All Soup Ladies are  certified in crisis management because they meet first responders where  they are, on the frontlines. When the Soup Ladies answer a call, they  aim to feed at least 100 people on site within an hour. Their favorite  recipes include soup, stroganoff, and chicken pot pie for their  nutritional value and convenience. In addition to recognition by  communities across the country, the Soup Ladies's honorable work has  received national attention from Mike Rowe on ``Returning the Favor''  and the Today Show.   Thank you, Mama Passarelli, for your commitment to supporting the  emergency personnel, search and rescue teams, military personnel, and  law enforcement officials who selflessly serve and protect our  citizens. You are truly ``warming the world, one bowl at a  time.''                            ____________________
