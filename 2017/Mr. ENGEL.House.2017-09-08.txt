 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call out the horrendous  postal service my constituents in Westchester County, New York, are  suffering.   My constituents are missing paychecks, and have had their mail thrown  away. This is disgraceful, and I am appalled.   I have requested several meetings with Postmaster General Megan  Brennan, which have been ignored. Their actions are unacceptable and  are bordering on incompetence. As a Member of Congress, I demand the  Postmaster General take responsibility and correct the problems my  constituents are facing.   Although the House is in session today, I am here to join my  colleague, Senator Schumer, who is in my district today, calling for an  investigation. Together, we will continue to push for greater oversight  of the post offices in Westchester, New York, until these matters are  resolved.                            ____________________
