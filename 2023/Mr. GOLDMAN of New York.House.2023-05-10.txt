 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  H.R. 2, which is a cruel and draconian bill that demonizes asylum  seekers, harms unaccompanied migrant children, and defunds programs  that support nonprofit organizations and local governments that are  essential to the humane processing of asylum seekers coming to our  shores hoping for a better life.   Just a brief response to the gentleman from Florida. Our law says  that anyone crossing the border anywhere can apply for asylum. There is  no such thing as lawful asylum and unlawful asylum. In fact, this is an  area that we should address in a bipartisan way. We are in desperate  need for comprehensive immigration reform. We need thoughtful and  effective border security. We need more immigration judges to process  asylum applicants. We need more visas for those to enter this country  legally, and we need a pathway to citizenship that all of our ancestors  have benefited from.   But this bill is the opposite of that. It was unilaterally written by  House Republicans as a partisan messaging bill with no chance of  becoming law. With this bill, Republicans are putting politics over  people.   In our committee, Democrats offered more than 30 amendments to try to  amend and improve this bill. Every single Republican voted ``no'' on  every single amendment. One even expressed shock that Democrats would  dare to try to change their bill.   Sadly, the Republicans rejected one of my amendments that would do  more to address border security and fentanyl trafficking than anything  else in this bill: An amendment to stop the massive flood of American  guns to drug cartels in Mexico, those same cartels that the chairman  from Tennessee says are in control of the border. These guns give the  cartels their power, it fuels the violence, and facilitates their  illegal trade.   Mexico has one gun shop, and it takes months of background checks to  purchase a gun. But the latest estimates that we have here are that  more than 500,000 American-made guns are exported to Mexico, including  assault weapons of war, and many land in the hands of cartels to fuel  their human and drug trafficking operation. There isn't a single  mention of guns in H.R. 2, not one.   This bill is supposed to be about border security. Our border is  broken, as one of my colleagues just said. How can we fix the border  when the cartels are ruling it with American guns? Any serious attempt  to secure our borders has to address the exportation of more than  500,000 American guns per year to Mexico.    Mr. Speaker, just like the gun violence  epidemic that is ravaging our country, Republicans refuse to address  the source of the problem. We need comprehensive immigration reform,  meaningful solutions to address our broken immigration system, and to  live up to our American values. This bill is nothing of the sort.  Instead, it turns a real crisis that needs serious solutions into a  political messaging tool.   Mr. Speaker, therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''                                time  1900
