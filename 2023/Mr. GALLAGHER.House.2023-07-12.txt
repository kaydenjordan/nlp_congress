 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California  for his work, in a bipartisan fashion, on the CITI Subcommittee. His  bipartisan spirit is always a pleasure, and the innovative mindset that  my friend has brought to our work together, I very much enjoyed.   My staff prepared a beautiful speech. I will, instead, be blunt and,  hopefully, be brief.   The way I see it is that we are in the early stages of a strategic  competition or a new cold war with the Chinese Communist Party, and we  are not winning in part because we haven't grasped the fundamental  insight that in order to prevent war, which is a goal we all share, one  must move and one must wage peace with the same alacrity, urgency, and  creativity that one wages war.   Despite the horrors on display in Eastern Europe on the battlefields  of Ukraine, we have not yet improved our deterrent posture in the Indo- Pacific west of the International Date Line such that we can persuade  Xi Jinping that his attempt to take Taiwan by force will fail. That is  where this bill comes in.   This makes extraordinary improvements in terms of our deterrent  posture, which is a testament to the collaboration between Chairman  Rogers and Ranking Member Smith.   To the Members of this body who are skeptical and who feel as if they  didn't get enough wins in the bill, I get it. We are in divided  government. This bill would look different if there was unified  government one way or the other. What we have here is a serious  bipartisan compromise. It is not perfect, but it is a good bill.   The Armed Services Committee is the last remaining functional body in  Congress. It works because everyone is brought into the process. None  of us gets 100 percent of what we want, but we all get a chance to  influence the outcome.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this critical piece of  legislation. I believe it promotes the cause of peace, and I believe it  promotes the cause of defending American sovereignty.
