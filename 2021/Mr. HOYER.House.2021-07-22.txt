 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate that my colleague from Maryland, the  distinguished Anthony Brown, is presiding, having served in Iraq and  served in the U.S. Army for a 30-year stint.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Representative Crow, for his  leadership on this issue and in offering this legislation.   Representative Crow, like Congressman Brown, is one of the Members of  this House from a new generation of service who wore the uniform of our  country in the post-9/11 conflicts.   These veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, like  Representative Crow, understand what we must do to support our friends  who stood with us, who risked their lives and the lives of their  families with their American partners.   The mission of our Armed Forces in Afghanistan over the past 20 years  has been clear, although very extended: destroy the terrorists who  attacked us on 9/11 and deny al-Qaida a safe haven from which to  threaten global security in our country. Today, Osama bin Laden is dead  and al-Qaida has been routed. Terrorism, however, has not gone away.   Our troops are now coming home. The fate of the Afghan people will  surely be determined by them, with our help, with us standing by.  America will continue to support the Afghan Government and its security  forces, but it is up to them to show the Taliban that there is no  military solution and that their resolve is evident by their defense of  their Nation.   As American personnel return from Afghanistan, that country's civil  war will continue, and we cannot leave our Afghan partners behind. We  talk about leaving no American behind. That is an absolutely essential  premise as we send our men and women into harm's way. Nor should we  leave behind any of those who facilitated our efforts, who stood with  us, who risked their own lives and put themselves in jeopardy.   No one has any illusions about what the Taliban would do if they had  their way and what they will do in those places they already control.  They will take it out, and they will, in fact, literally take out those  who stood with us and facilitated our efforts. There can be no doubt  the punishment they would inflict on Afghans who stood alongside the  United States and our allies.   We can only imagine the horrors that would befall their families in  retribution. This legislation recognizes that these Afghan allies have  earned safety in our country for themselves and for their loved ones.  It would expand the visa program and expedite processing to help ensure  there is a path to America for Afghans who worked side by side with our  troops, our diplomats, our development professionals, and our partner  forces in carrying out our missions there.   While President Biden is already taking executive action to bring  some of these allies here, legislation is needed to ensure that all of  them can make it safely out of harm's way. It should be said, of  course, that they will all be vetted to ensure that, in fact, they are  coming to the United States and will be consistent with the security of  our country and our people.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill today in a very bipartisan  way. This is not about Democrats. It is not about Republicans. It is  about an effort that Republican and Democratic administrations pursued  and received help in doing so. Each vote is not only an assent for this  sound policy, but a gesture of our deep appreciation for the service of  our allies.   Let this vote remind the world that our country's steadfast  foundation, our highest ideal remains our bonds of friendship, loyalty,  and trust. Let us remind our friends and foes alike that Americans keep  faith with our allies, and let us practice that in this body and at the  White House.   I ask my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike: Vote for this  bill. We can argue about differences of opinion on our effort in  Afghanistan, but when we do something, whether we argue one side or the  other, when we ask people to help us in that effort, help us, America,  our men and women in uniform in harm's way, when we ask those to help  us, it is important for us to keep the faith with those who do. Vote  ``yes.''    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Scalise), for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning  hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed until  10:30 p.m.   On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. I want to make that clear.  That is an acceleration from 12 p.m. We have a lot of business to do  next week. We have a lot of appropriations bills, so we want to make  sure that we are not meeting late, late into the night.   So on Tuesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and 12  p.m. for legislative business.   On Wednesday, the House is expected to meet at 11 a.m. for  legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will expect to meet at 10 a.m. for legislative  business.   On Friday, the House will meet, as usual, at 9 a.m. for legislative  business.   The House will consider several bills under suspension of the rules.  The complete list of suspensions will be announced by close of business  tomorrow.   In addition, the House will consider at least 7 of the 12  appropriations bills for fiscal year 2022.   Recognizing the importance of completing our work well in advance of  the deadline at the end of September, I would let the Members know  that, unfortunately--well, first of all, let me say, we have marked up  all 12 bills, and they have been reported out of committee.   The Senate has not reported out, nor considered a single  appropriation bill. And we have 60 days before the end of the fiscal  year, approximately, give or take.   The House will consider a seven-bill minibus, H.R. 4502. That bill  will include seven appropriations bills: the Labor, Health and Human  Services, Education, and Related Agencies bill; and Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies; Energy  and Water Development, and Related Agencies; Financial Services and  General Government; Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies;  Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies;  Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act.   There will be additional bills on the appropriations. There are,  obviously, after the seven, five additional appropriation bills that  will be available for consideration. Three of those bills, as I  understand it, have been noticed by the Committee on Rules for  amendments to be filed. So they will be ready to go next week, and I am  hopeful that we will be able to move some of those bills next week.   They will be the Legislative Branch appropriation bill; the Commerce,  Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriation bill; and the  Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  appropriation bill. That will leave the Department of Defense bill and  the Department of Homeland Security bill.   Lastly, additional legislative items are possible. And that will be  our schedule for the week to come. I expect it to be long days, which  is why we are going in at 11 a.m. on one day and at 10 a.m. on two of  the days, which we usually go in at 12. I would hope that that would  preclude us from going very late at night, but I think everybody ought  to expect that we will be here into the evening.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. He is  certainly accurate that the Hyde amendment has been in our bills for a  very long period of time. What I think is not completely accurate is  that it has been a bipartisan support, has enjoyed bipartisan support,  and that there were Democrats who obviously supported the Hyde  amendment.   And I realize that this has made it controversial, having been left  out of the bill. I don't know what the Committee on Rules is going to  do; we will have to see what they do. But in any event, I want to tell  you that a large number on our side of the aisle believe that a  constitutionally protected healthcare matter for women ought not to be  determined by their financial ability.   So there is controversy with respect to Hyde. There is also  controversy with respect to Federal employees as well, that I know  well, because I chaired that subcommittee. We give to Federal employees  the healthcare benefit, but then we say they can't use it for some  things. Actually, that money is their money; it is not our money. It is  given in compensation for their services.   But in any event, so there are controversies, I would tell the  gentleman, and I am not sure exactly what the Committee on Rules is  going to do and, therefore, don't want to speak for it.    Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman can explain it. I  think, frankly, your party is hoist on its own petard. We brought to  this floor, with Mr. Katko and Mr. Thompson agreeing on the process,  offering to the House an equally divided five-and-five commission; the  five Republicans being totally in the ambit of the minority leader. We  brought it to the floor; the subpoena power being equally divided  between the parties and having to cooperate in accomplishing the  issuance of the subpoena. And very frankly, although there was some  discussion of it, there was no doubt that the staff would have been  resolved. The question of being equal staff on the Republican and  Democratic side would have been resolved in the Senate.   I see the gentleman shaking his head. I can tell him, I know it would  have been resolved; period. And the Republican Party objected to that  commission, equally divided, five and five, with the minority leader  strenuously lobbying against it being passed in the United States  Senate. It was not passed in the United States Senate.   Press asked me, If it is defeated in the Senate, what are you going  to do? I said, We are going to move forward, of course. And that is  what we are doing. We are moving forward.   Now, the makeup of that committee, three of the persons who were  appointed by the--excuse me--were recommended by the minority leader  were accepted by the Speaker. And I am not going to spend a long time  going into the quotes of the two or their premise, but all I can say is  when asked the question, Ms. Cheney, who I know you folks have kicked  out of leadership because she tells the truth.    Well, that is certainly one of the statements, however.    That is one opinion.    Well, I clearly know we don't share that view, but it was  referenced that, well she may have told the truth but she ought to stop  telling the truth.   And that was one of the references that were made as you replaced her  as your third in line because she--from our perspective--and I think  from a large perspective of the American people--told the truth, and  she continues to tell the truth.   And she was asked the question: What do you think about this  nonpartisan investigation? She said, I am absolutely confident that we  will have a nonpartisan investigation that will look at the facts; that  it will go wherever the facts may lead. There are three members from  the minority leader proposed that the Speaker did not object to. She  has objected to two members. And the rhetoric around this from minority  leader and from those two members has been disgraceful. Thus, this must  be an investigation that is focused on facts. And the idea that any of  this has become politicized is really unworthy of the office that we  all hold and unworthy of our Republic.    So I don't blame you, and I probably would have taken the same  reaction as you have taken. But very frankly, from the Speaker's  perspective, and from others, this needs to be a commission that does  in fact commit itself to going where the facts lead and determining the  who, what, where, when, and why.   I have some very strong feelings as to why the insurrection, or as  some say, the tourist visit--on your side of the aisle, Mr. Whip--the  tourist visit that resulted in the death of a number of people,  terrorizing Members of this House who thought their lives were in  danger because people were trying to break into the House Chamber.   The rationalization of that activity has been rampant by many on your  side of the aisle. We have some strong feelings on this, and we are  going to get to the facts. And the American people will make the  ultimate judgment, obviously. And we want to see that commission,  again, hoist on your own petard, the overwhelming majority of you voted  against a commission. Five Republicans appointed by the minority  leader--appointed by, not recommended by--and five Democrats; subpoena  power shared, and notwithstanding the fact that some of you,  apparently, don't agree. I guarantee you, it would have been equal  staffing. That would have been resolved. That was not a really big  issue.   It was a make-up issue to vote ``no'' in the United States Senate  because, in our view--so you understand--Donald Trump didn't want the  commission.                                time  1115    So, Donald Trump was saluted, and we didn't get a commission, which  was a commission that almost exactly to the jot and tittle, as Mr.  Katko said, what the minority leader asked for.   So, you don't like the result now. I get it. But I believe, as Ms.  Cheney said, this is going to be a factfinding select committee.  Witnesses will say what they are going to say.   By the way, one of the people that was rejected by the Speaker may  well be, and maybe both, witnesses before the select committee. I don't  know that. Nobody has told me that. But that may be the case.   So, we are going to proceed. I know there is disagreement. That is  not surprising. But you looked the opportunity that you asked for in  the eye and rejected it, so here we are.    Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, is that a quote about Mrs. Greene?    Mr. Speaker, the legislation we passed said the Speaker  would appoint all the members. These Members were not kicked off; they  never got on.    Liz Cheney was asked whether that was the appropriate thing to do,  and her response was--you had her quote: ``I agree with what the  Speaker has done.''   Now, the reason she agreed--yes, they have raised questions, and on  your side, you wanted to raise questions. You wanted to look at  everything but January 6. Maybe January 6 as well, but you wanted to  look at this incident, that incident, the other incident, the incident  over here. Are they relevant incidents? Sure, they are; but not to  January 6.    Clearly, when you were in charge, you didn't look at some  of the incidents that happened while you were in charge that were  similar in nature. Very frankly, I think those incidents ought to be  looked at, but not by this commission because they were incidents that  did not involve insurrection; did not involve stopping the work of the  Congress of the United States; did not terrorize Members of this House.   Now, I know that some of you have had pictures taken of you in this  House. You looked pretty terrified to me. You thought there was  something serious happening. This stuff that this was a tourist visit  is absurd.   The issue of dissembling is not new. President Trump put that in an  art form. If he didn't like what was going on here, he created  something over here with a tweet or a comment or an action that he  took. That is the shell game.   The issue is: What happened on January 6? What was the insurrection  about? Why were people coming into the Capitol saying: Let's hang the  Vice President of the United States--not of our party.   People shake their heads. I am not sure why they are shaking their  heads. They saw it on television. They see it on the tapes over and  over and over. They see people being convicted. I happen to think the  sentences are too short. It was treason. It was treason based upon a  lie.   We need to get to the bottom of it. What the Speaker has done is make  sure that we are going to get to the bottom of it, notwithstanding the  fact, and I will repeat again, all of you had the opportunity to vote  five--five--shared subpoena, and the leader was empowered to appoint  anybody he would want.   The legislation that passed this House said the Speaker would  appoint--the Speaker. Did she consult with the minority leader? She  did. Did she disagree with two that he appointed? She did, and she did  not appoint them. That was in her power. And I agreed with her, and Liz  Cheney agreed with her.   Why? Because that would have been dissembling, not looking for facts.  Mr. Jordan has said over and over again that he believes the election  was stolen. Court after court after court after court said no proof. No  proof.   So, we are where we are, and we are going to proceed. We are going to  proceed, and if the Speaker decides to retain the three and name two  others, so be it.   We are going to proceed. We are going to proceed, and we are going to  get the facts, and we are going to get those facts known to the  American people. It is going to be widely covered. There are going to  be a lot of witnesses. We are going to find out the who. Maybe that is  the problem: the who, the what, the where, and the why.   For the first time in history, Americans, Trump signs waving, stopped  the business of the Congress of the United States--an insurrection and,  from my view, a treasonous act. So, we are going to proceed.    Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman believe that the three  Members that the Speaker accepted and was willing to appoint would not  have asked those questions?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Your side had an opportunity to support the Capitol Police. Your side  had an opportunity to support law enforcement. Your side had the  opportunity to increase the capability of the Capitol Police to respond  to insurrectionist, violent, and criminal agents.   Your side had that opportunity, and what did it do, to a person?   It voted ``no,'' and we passed it. We passed support of the Capitol  Police. We passed support to strengthen our defenses. We passed  legislation to try to make the Capitol more secure and our Capitol  Police safer. We passed that legislation with not a single one of your  votes. It went to the Senate, and it sits. You read what that is doing  to the morale of the Capitol Police along with some of your comments  about the Capitol Police.   So you had that opportunity.   I will say to the Speaker, Republicans had that opportunity. Just as  they rejected the five and five, they rejected support of the Capitol  Police.   Seventeen of them voted against giving them a Gold Medal.   Why?   Because the insurrection was mentioned in the resolution, and, of  course, there was no insurrection. It was a tourist visit, as they  ambled politely through the Halls of the Congress saying how  appreciative they were of the efforts being made by their Democratic  Representatives.   If you saw it that way, if you believe that, it is impossible for me  to understand why.   So I tell the whip, Mr. Speaker, that the Republican Party has had  two opportunities to have an even, fair commission. They rejected them,  apparently, according to what the whip says, because we didn't want to  look at Seattle, we didn't want to look at this city or that city or  the other city or this, that, and the other.   By the way, President Biden made it very clear that those who  committed criminal activities were not demonstrators, they were  criminals. Biden said that, and I agree with him.   What they didn't want to look at is who recruited the crowd that came  in here, who riled that crowd up, and who deployed them to the Capitol  of the United States for the specific objective of stopping the steal,  and what he meant, of course, is our acting.   His Vice President, whom he talked to on numerous occasions about  stopping the election, concluded that that was not legal, that was not  within his authority, and so he acted consistent with the law. That  really annoyed Mr. Trump.   So here we are. We should have had a bipartisan commission. We should  have moved that forward, and, yes, we should support the Capitol Police  by adopting the supplemental.   By the way, the Senate supplemental is more in terms of dollars than  the House supplemental. So it is not a question of we spent too much  money to do this to make the Capitol safe, to make the Capitol Police  armed, to give them the opportunity to get the intelligence that they  need to proceed.   But what a distraction that the Capitol Police weren't prepared.   The question is not: Were they prepared?   The question is: Why did American citizens try to commit insurrection  and treason in the Capitol of the United States and stopped our work?   Not for very long. We came back, we did our work, and we got it done  to the benefit of our country, our democracy, and our image around the  world. Our democracy was resilient.   Nobody was angrier, I will tell you--and I think Mr. Scalise, you  were there--Mr. Speaker, nobody was angrier about what was happening  that night than Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Senate, who said he  believed subsequent to his voting against impeachment, but  notwithstanding that, he believed the President bore responsibility, as  the minority leader said, not all responsibility, but bore  responsibility.   So we are going to look at this. You can talk all you want. Your  leader has now decided he is going to withdraw the three and not  participate. We regret that. But it is not going to stop us. It is not  going to stop our getting at the truth. It is not going to stop our  having the American people know the who, what, where, when, and why of  the first time since 1812 when a foreign power invaded our Capitol that  the Capitol of the United States was invaded by people who were seeking  to undermine the democratic processes under our Constitution.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   You had an opportunity to support the police and you voted with those  who wanted to defund the police. All of you had an opportunity, just a  few weeks ago while we had a bill on the floor, to support, to fund the  Capitol Police to make them safer, more effective, and better able to  enforce the law,  [[Page H3822]]  and you all, to a person, voted ``no.'' You had the opportunity, and  you voted with those who you say on our aisle didn't want to do that.  But it passed.   Why did it pass?   Because the overwhelming, overwhelming, overwhelming majority of  Democrats--it is the only reason it passed--voted to support the  police, our Capitol Police. I will tell you that is also true of our  Members in terms of supporting law enforcement at the Federal, State,  and local levels.   Are there some who say some things?   Yes. There are some people who say some things on your side--I have  quoted a couple of them--that I am sure you don't support. But having  said that, the proof is in the eating of the pudding. We had a bill on  the floor that supported the police. You voted against it, every one of  you.   Mr. Speaker, you can talk all you want about supporting them, but,  very frankly, the bills you are going to be voting on next week support  the police. They are not defunding.   Unlike the Trump budgets. If you look at the Trump budgets, who cut  law enforcement funding?   Trump budgets.   Check me on that, and then come to the floor and say: Hoyer is not  telling the truth. Check me.   You had an opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, the minority had an opportunity to support the police.  They all voted ``no.'' The Senate is doing the same. It is a shame  because it is undermining the morale of the Capitol Police. You have  seen that reported in the newspapers. This is not me saying it. They  don't understand why.   Mr. Scalise is absolutely right. The Capitol Police have kept him, in  particular, and others who were attacked by a crazed, apparently left- wing, but crazed bad person, he may be mentally defective, but he did a  very bad act, and he was targeting Republicans. We all stood up when  Mr. Scalise was in the hospital and thanked the Capitol Police for  protecting him and others on that site. That was a terrible, terrible,  venal criminal act. The guy was probably a Democrat. I don't know. We  have called him out for being that. That is what we ought to all do.   On January 6, some very bad criminal people acted in this Congress  and in this Capitol against our democracy and against our Constitution,  and we want to study it. We want to get the facts so it doesn't happen  again and so we know who is fomenting this insurrectionist psychology  and who rationalizes it on this floor now.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   We have brought them to the floor. We are going to continue to bring  them to the floor, and we hope Republicans support them.   We created 3 million new jobs; more jobs in our first 5 months than  any administration in history--the gentleman forgot to mention that  figure--double the monthly rates of the 5 months prior to that under  the Trump administration.   The average number of new unemployment insurance claims has been cut  in half. Last week, that number was about 400,000. The same week last  year, it was 1.5 million under the Trump administration. Small business  optimism has returned to its 2019 average. The economy grew at 6.4  percent in the first quarter. Independent projections from CBO, the  IMF, the Federal Reserve, the World Bank, OECD, and many others all  forecast America this year reaching the highest level of growth in  nearly four decades.   Furthermore, as the gentleman knows, the Director of the Federal  Reserve has opined that he thinks, yes, there is a surge in inflation.  Yes, we are concerned about it. The Federal Reserve is watching it. We  are watching it. We want to keep inflation in check.   The gentleman referenced that we are paying people not to work. Let  me remind the gentleman, we had four bills which did similar things  which were passed in an overwhelming bipartisan fashion last year,  overwhelming bipartisan fashion, and none of them would have become law  without the signature of President Donald Trump.   Now what happened? Donald Trump left, and bipartisanship left with  him; not because he was so bipartisan, but he thought that what we were  doing was good for the people, and therefore, I think he thought, good  politics. I think that is accurate.   The fact is that this economy is now doing exactly what we want it to  do. It is growing. Now it surged. There is no doubt about that, and  that surge has resulted in inflation hiking at a higher rate than we  would like, including the products that the whip mentioned, Mr.  Speaker.   We need to contain inflation because it does rob those particularly  on fixed incomes. But the multitrillions that were spent last year, one  of which, the CARES Act spent--was almost a unanimous vote in this  House--$2 trillion. So we did that because we believed that the  magnitude of the challenge confronting us by COVID-19, both to the  health of our people and the health of our economy, demanded such a  robust response.   One of our Members who had been vaccinated--some Members hadn't been  vaccinated--has come down with it. Now, hopefully, the vaccinations  that he has will moderate any adverse impact of this delta virus. But I  would say to the gentleman, it is a little bit like the commission,  that we want to focus on the bad news, not focus on the good news. The  gentleman wants to focus on other news, not the central news of the  insurrection, and I understand that strategy.  [[Page H3823]]    But there is a lot of good news happening in America. There is some  bad news, too. Part of it is because people haven't gotten vaccinated.  The gentleman's State has that problem; Mississippi has that problem;  South Carolina and some other States have that problem; my State has  that problem. Not to the extent of some other States, but all 50 States  are seeing a surge. So giving up and getting off the field at this  point in time is not appropriate.   I think that we are going to find that the President's program that  he suggests, as he says, and I agree, will have a generational impact  for decades to come in making sure that our economy continues to grow;  that our people are educated; that we expand the middle class; lift  people out of poverty, as we did with children who are now 50 percent  of them are going to be lifted out of poverty. That is good news for  America. It is good news for all of us. Those kids are going to be  better educated and make more productive contributions to our society.   So I hope a number of Members will support pieces of legislation that  will carry that vision of the President into fruition, and we will work  toward that end.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. It was  not radical spending in 2020, because Trump signed the bills. Trump  left, and it became radical spending. That is situational ethics, Mr.  Speaker. I will leave it at that.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. As he  knows, the President of the United States has strongly expressed  support of those who are seeking freedom and liberty in Cuba. He said  that shortly after the demonstrations occurred. He has maintained that  position. I share that opinion with him, and we are discussing what  action we might be taking here in this House.    Mr. Speaker, if you mention Jerry Lewis from California,  our Jerry Lewis probably wouldn't be the first one you would think of.  You would think of Dean Martin's sidekick.   When I first met Jerry Lewis some 40 years ago, I guess, now--how  long has Jerry been gone? Thirty-two years plus however long he has  been gone--I thought of Jerry Lewis. ``Oh, Jerry Lewis, yes, he is on  the committee.'' I thought of the comedian Jerry Lewis.   To some degree, Jerry Lewis was a comedian. He was a wonderful guy,  wonderful spirit, a wonderful person. I served with him, as I said, for  32 years, both in the House of Representatives and on the  Appropriations Committee. Actually, that is not really right. I served  with him 32 years, but I was only on the committee for 23 years before  I became the majority leader in 2006 and then went off the committee.   Jerry Lewis is coupled in my thoughts with a guy named Vic Fazio, who  was also from California, who was also on the Appropriations Committee,  who was one of my closest friends and still is. I think about the two  of them because Jerry Lewis and Vic Fazio, for a number of years,  headed up the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee together.  They were a team, a positive team, a team that agreed that this  institution was worth protecting and worth serving.   As I think of Jerry Lewis, I lament the fact--and in doing so, I want  to thank   Ken Calvert, also a member, for seeing me in the hall and  saying, ``Are you doing this Special Order?'' Mr. Speaker, if he hadn't  talked to me, I wouldn't have known, and I wouldn't have gotten this  opportunity to speak.   Much has been said of what he did, but what Jerry Lewis and Vic Fazio  represented were Members who thought about the institution, not about  party. They were representative of a large number of people in this  body who served when I came here in the 1980s and the 1990s who shared  that view.   Tom Cole is sitting here. He is one of those Members that  shares that view.   As I think of Jerry Lewis, I lament the fact that we have lost the  Jerry Lewises--not all of them, but too many--who made this body a  collegial body, not a confrontational body.   That doesn't mean we didn't have severe disagreements. I remember  Jerry Lewis, at one point in time, said, as chairman of the committee,  he was going to move Goddard Space Flight Center, which is in my  district, some 3,000 or 4,000 people, to California. We had a little  tussle about that. The good news was that Barbara Mikulski chaired the  committee in the Senate, and the chances of that happening were zero.  But we had a tussle about that. It was a friendly tussle, and I really  don't believe he was real. He was just sort of getting a little  leverage.   Jerry Lewis was a man of this institution, the Congress, and of the  Constitution. He cared about this country; he cared about this  institution; and he worked positively and constructively for both.   The fact that he was a Republican and I was a Democrat was somewhat  irrelevant. That doesn't mean it was not relevant in terms of our  having differences. The parties had differences, and there were  contentious times. At that point in time, he was on one side, and I was  on the other.   I am, I like to think, a man of the House, but I am also a man of the  Appropriations Committee. I love the Appropriations Committee. I love  the Appropriations Committee because it was a committee where  compromise, frankly, was easier.  [[Page H3836]]    Philosophical differences are tougher to compromise on. Money is not  so tough. We have $100. I am in the majority, so I get $60, and you get  $40. That is relatively easy. It is much, much more complicated than  that, but it is a committee in which you can decide priorities based  upon where you want to put your money. I think it is a little easier  than on issues that are deep, philosophically held beliefs.   I wanted to speak, and I thank   Ken Calvert for giving me a heads-up  that this Special Order was happening, because we need to get back to  the Jerry Lewises and Vic Fazios. I lament the fact that we are so  contentious in this body. I lament the fact that there is so much  tension in this body.   Everybody in this body has been elected by their neighbors and  friends and people who don't know them because that is the only way you  can get here. I, therefore, believe that everyone in this body is due  respect, even those I vigorously disagree with, because they have been  sent here by the people.   But we have lost that sense of camaraderie, and we have lost the  sense that, for the most part, we are going to work together.   I came here when Ronald Reagan was elected President. I came here in  a special election. Even though we had contention, and we had the Boll  Weevils, et cetera, the overwhelming majority of the House, Democrats  and Republicans, felt like working together.   I will close with this. I loved Jerry. He was my dear, dear friend.  What he represented, I think, was so important. But we have lost the  sense that we are all working together for the country, for the people.   I don't mean we have lost it individually, but it seems to me that  the camaraderie and cooperation that existed for a long time that I  have served in this body is very tenuous at best now. Very frankly, I  think it was made even more tenuous in the last administration.   I don't think we are going to get back there. Part of it was because  the Democrats, when I came here, had been in charge for about 20 years,  and there wasn't a real sense that everything one did would change the  complexion or the control of the House of Representatives. Now that is  the case, so it is a lot more contentious. People are thinking, ``If we  do this or do that, maybe we will win the majority.'' That was not the  case then.   I want to thank Jerry Lewis. I want to thank Arlene. I want to thank  their family for being the kind of people who made those of us on the  other side of the aisle feel like that was just an aisle but we were  Americans together, Members of the House of Representatives together,  working on behalf of our country and our people and to make the House  of Representatives the kind of institution of which the American people  could be proud.    Thank you, Jerry Lewis. God bless you.
