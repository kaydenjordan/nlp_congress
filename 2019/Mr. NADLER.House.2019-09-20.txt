 Madam Chairwoman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1423,  the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act, or the FAIR Act.   This critical legislation would restore access to justice for  millions of Americans who are currently locked out of the court system  and are forced to settle their disputes against companies in a private  system of arbitration that is often skewed in the company's favor over  the individual.   Nearly a century ago, Congress enacted the Federal Arbitration Act to  allow merchants to resolve run-of-the-mill contract disputes in a  system of private arbitration that would be legally enforceable. The  system that Congress envisioned was to be used voluntarily and only  between merchants of equal bargaining power.   However, the Supreme Court, over the past 40 years, has issued a  series of decisions that have expanded the use of arbitration far  beyond Congress' original intent or a fair reading of the text of the  Federal Arbitration Act, creating the unjust system that we see today.   Private arbitration has been transformed from a voluntary forum for  companies to resolve commercial disputes into a legal nightmare for  millions of consumers, employees, and others who are forced into  arbitration and are unable to enforce certain fundamental rights in  court.   Many companies use forced arbitration as a tool to protect themselves  from consumers and workers who seek to hold them accountable for  wrongdoing. By burying a forced arbitration clause deep in the fine  print of a take-it-or-leave-it consumer or employment contract,  companies can evade the court system, where plaintiffs have far greater  legal protections, and hide behind the one-sided process that is tilted  in their favor.   For example, arbitration generally limits discovery, does not adhere  to the Rules of Civil Procedure, can prohibit class actions--which it  almost always does--and denies the right of appeal. Worse yet,  arbitration allows the proceedings, and often even the results, to stay  secret, thereby permitting companies to avoid public scrutiny of  potential misconduct, thereby enabling companies to continue unsafe  practices after settling with one person.   For millions of consumers and employees, the precondition--whether  they know it or not--of obtaining a basic service or product, such as a  bank account, a cell phone, a credit card, or even a job, is that they  must agree to resolve any disputes in private arbitration.   We used to refer to these kinds of agreements as contracts of  adhesion, where one party with all the power dictates the terms to the  other party in a take-it-or-leave-it contract.   The next time you apply for a credit card, try crossing out the term  in the  [[Page H7846]]  fine print requiring you to agree to arbitration and see if you still  get that credit card. You will be denied without a moment's hesitation.   These are classic contracts of adhesion, which were once clearly  disfavored under the law, but which now seem to have been blessed by  the Supreme Court as standard operating procedures in the corporate  world.   Madam Chair, the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution guarantees  everyone the right to a jury trial for all controversies at law over  $20. These agreements for arbitration nullify the Seventh Amendment. We  have to respect the Constitution. The Constitution has more things in  it than the Second Amendment. It has a few other amendments, like the  Seventh Amendment, which we should respect.   These contracts of adhesion, these agreements, nullify any  protections that Congress votes. If we vote or a State legislature  votes on an employment protection, a union protection, a consumer  protection, its enforcement can be completely nullified by these  arbitration agreements.   For individuals who have no choice but to agree to these contracts,  that means that their ability to enforce civil rights, consumer, labor,  and antitrust laws are subject to the whims of a private arbitrator,  often selected by the companies themselves. These private arbitrators  are not required to provide plaintiffs any of the fundamental  protections guaranteed in the courts, and their further employment can  depend on building a good reputation with the companies that hire them.   Unsurprisingly, then, arbitration has become a virtual get-out-of- jail-free card that many companies use to circumvent the basic rights  of consumers and workers.   H.R. 1423, the FAIR Act, reverse this disastrous trend by prohibiting  arbitration clauses in consumer, labor, antitrust, and civil rights  disputes.   Importantly, this legislation does not preclude parties from agreeing  to arbitrate a claim after the dispute arises, which will ensure that  arbitration agreements are truly voluntary and transparent. It does,  however, prevent unsuspecting consumers and employees from being forced  to give up their right to seek justice in court.    I urge my colleagues to support this vital legislation, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos).    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining,  please, on each side.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, we have a bedrock principle in this country, and that is  that all Americans deserve their day in court. We make a mockery of  this principle, however, when individuals can be stripped of this  fundamental right and be forced into private arbitration proceedings  without the safeguards our judicial system affords.   We make a mockery of this right not only when individuals can be  stripped of this right, but when almost all Americans are stripped of  this fundamental right and are forced into private arbitration  proceedings without the safeguards our judicial system affords.   Now, we heard the statistics cited by the gentleman, which come from  the Chamber of Commerce, and Mr. Cicilline showed how wrong those  statistics were.   But the real point is, of course, that, under this bill, if a  plaintiff thinks that he can get a better deal under arbitration, then  arbitration is available voluntarily, as it should be.   What this bill seeks to ban is individuals--almost all Americans-- involuntarily giving up their sacred constitutional right to a trial by  jury, to their day in court, whether they like it or not. This bill  will guarantee that people have their rights. They can opt for  arbitration if they want to, but they don't have to.   This bill supports liberty; it supports constitutional rights; and it  supports the little guy against the giant corporation. H.R. 1423, the  FAIR Act, rights these wrongs by reopening the courthouse door to all  Americans.   I applaud the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) for his leadership  on this legislation which has 222 cosponsors.   This measure is also supported by a broad coalition of more than 70  public-interest, labor, and advocacy organizations, including Public  Citizen, Consumer Reports, the Communications Workers of America, the  Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and the American Association of  Justice, not just by trial lawyers.   In addition, 84 percent of Americans across the political spectrum  support ending forced arbitration in employment and consumer disputes,  according to recent polling data.   Mr. Chairman, it is up to Congress to end this secretive and unfair  practice. I urge my colleagues to support the FAIR Act and to restore  access to justice for millions of Americans, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment.   There are more than 60 million workers who make up a majority of  nonunion, private sector employees and who are subject to forced  arbitration clauses. These employees are told that, if they want to get  a job or keep the job they have, they must sign away their right to  their day in court and submit to forced arbitration. These workers have  absolutely no choice.   Many of these workers have no idea that they are subject to forced  arbitration, and even if they are aware, there is nothing they can do  about it; and, of course, it is not possible for them to know that they  may be victims of sexual assault, wage discrimination, or other illegal  behavior before they begin employment.   This is a serious power imbalance which allows companies to  unilaterally impose unfair terms upon nonunion employees. The FAIR Act  aims to put power back into the hands of these 60 million workers who  have been forced by their employer to sign away their rights.   But when real choice is part of the equation, arbitration can be a  reasonable alternative to litigation. Collective bargaining, which  involves meaningful negotiation between the company and the union,  results in a much different arbitration process and can produce much  different results.   In a 2019 report, the Economic Policy Institute noted that ``beyond  the use of the world `arbitration,' the system that organized labor and  management have long been using to resolve disputes has almost nothing  in common  [[Page H7850]]  with the top-down, take-it-or-leave-it brand of arbitration.''                                time  1015    The collective bargaining process provides protections that are  simply unavailable to many nonunion workers, such as the ability to  reject unfair employment terms. In collective bargaining, the company  cannot just impose its will upon the union. There must be buy-in on  both sides.   When arbitration is agreed to through collective bargaining, there is  less likely to be an experience gap between the parties. In nonunion  arbitration, the company continuously interacts with arbitrators, while  the employee may only see the arbitrator once, if that. And in most  cases, the company gives itself unilateral power to pick the  arbitrator. This creates a conflict of interest in which the arbitrator  has a strong incentive to prioritize the company's interest by finding  in its favor than to fairly assess the claim at issue.   The collective bargaining process looks much different. Like the  company, the union also has the benefit of being a repeat player in  arbitration. The union understands how the process works, and it may  even have experience practicing in front of the same arbitrator  multiple times.   When the repeat player dynamic exists on both sides of the  arbitration, the risk that one party will be systematically favored  over the other is greatly reduced.   Furthermore, through collective bargaining, a union can secure a  variety of important protections for workers, such as requiring truly  neutral arbitrators, paid time off for employees to participate in the  arbitration, and transparent decisionmaking.   Often, union employees are guaranteed a multilevel appeals process,  lowering the risk that an arbitrator will ignore relevant laws or that  there will be an unjust result.   The concerns that the FAIR Act is designed to address simply do not  occur in the context of collective bargaining and, therefore, makes no  sense to apply its restrictions to such contracts.   Accordingly, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I encourage my  colleagues to vote against this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   If anything, this discussion about collective bargaining shows that  arbitration can be a fair and reasonable process when there is actual  choice on both sides of the tracks. But for the majority, the  overwhelming majority of nonunion private sector workers, that choice  simply does not exist.   This amendment fails to comprehend these critical distinctions  between collective bargaining and the take-it-or-leave-it arbitration  clauses that the majority of workers face. And it fails to recognize  that restoring equity and choice is exactly what the FAIR Act claims to  do. You cannot compare apples and oranges, as the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Jordan) tried to do.   Finally, as the AFL-CIO explains, this amendment, ``would also be  directly contrary to the intent of Congress in both the Wagner and  Taft-Hartley Acts, which encourage the practice of collective  bargaining and the resolution of contract disputes through  arbitration.''   And, again, arbitration voluntarily agreed to by the workers through  their democratically elected union is not the same as coercive forced  arbitration.   Mr. Chair, accordingly, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
