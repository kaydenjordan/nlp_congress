 Madam Speaker, at its most basic level, the government  should keep us safe. On the 34th day of the longest government shutdown  in our Nation's history, hundreds of thousands of Federal workers  tasked with keeping us safe are working without pay.   As the men and women of TSA, air traffic control, the FBI, the United  States Coast Guard, and many other government agencies continue to  perform their duties, many live with the uncertainty and fear of not  knowing how they are going to pay their mortgage or feed their  families.   In less than 2 weeks, millions will come to Atlanta, Georgia, the  district I represent, and they will be flooding in for the Super Bowl.  Having been a flight attendant for 30 years, I am very afraid. I am  deeply concerned for the Atlanta airport's TSA agents, air traffic  controllers, and for the Federal agencies tasked with ensuring the  public safety during this event.   President Trump said he would shut down the government for a wall  that he claims will make us safer, but, in fact, his shutdown has made  us less safe. I will continue, along with my Democratic colleagues, to  support bipartisan funding packages to reopen the government.  [[Page H1194]]                                ____________________
