 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator James  Risch and Representative Mike Simpson, today I wish to call attention  to an important event taking place today at the U.S. Department of  Energy's, DOE, 890-square-mile site in Idaho. Today, Idaho National  Laboratory, INL, personnel ran the first experiments in the Transient  Reactor Test, TREAT, facility in nearly a quarter century.   Idaho National Laboratory is our Nation's lead nuclear energy  research, development, and demonstration laboratory, the place where 52  original nuclear reactors were constructed and demonstrated. One of  those reactors was the TREAT facility, which operated from 1959-1994,  and remained fully fueled while on standby status. Transient testing  focuses upon testing nuclear fuel under accident conditions. TREAT is  one of the most capable and flexible transient test reactors in the  world.   Following the accident at the Fukushima-Daiichi Power Plant in Japan  7 years ago, Congress directed the DOE to develop reactor fuels that  could better withstand accident conditions. During TREAT's 35 operating  years, the reactor performed 6,604 reactor startups and 2,884 transient  irradiations. Given this history, it made more sense to restart the  facility than build a new reactor. That decision paid off when, on  August 31, 2017, the Resumption of Transient Testing Program was  completed more than 1 year ahead of schedule and approximately $17  million under budget.   This highly successful restart at the TREAT facility was recognized  in August, when a joint DOE-INL team won the Secretary of Energy Award.  This award recognizes DOE employees or contractors who accomplish  significant achievements. It is the highest nonmonetary internal  recognition that can be achieved at the DOE. U.S. Secretary of Energy  Rick Perry highlighted the TREAT restart team's effort and efficiency,  and recognized the importance of the facility to nuclear energy  scientists and engineers as they work to develop advanced nuclear fuels  and reactor technologies.   Congratulations, INL and DOE, on the TREAT restart and for bringing  back online an important national asset in the effort to develop the  advanced nuclear reactors so vital to our economy, environment, and  national security.                            ____________________
