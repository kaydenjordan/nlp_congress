 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to support H.  Res. 24, the Article of Impeachment against Donald Trump for high  crimes and misdemeanors for a second time.   Let us be very clear, what took place on January 6, 2021, was an act  of domestic terrorism by rightwing sycophantic white supremacists,  promoted, instigated, and advanced by the man in the White House,  Donald Trump.   Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once said: ``The ultimate  weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral, begetting the  very thing it seeks to destroy. Instead of diminishing evil, it  multiplies it.''
