 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a comprehensive bill to address systemic  racism in law enforcement.   Today's legislation is named for George Floyd, whose senseless death  at the hands of a police officer shocked the conscience of millions of  Americans and sparked a long-overdue reckoning on race in America and a  movement demanding racial justice. Congress has heard this call for  justice, and in response, Congresswoman Karen Bass and the  Congressional Black Caucus have written this critical legislation to  hold police accountable, change the culture of law enforcement, and  build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.   The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act takes these challenges head  on by banning chokeholds, mandating racial bias training, ending  qualified immunity, restricting the sale of military-grade weapons to  local police departments, and establishing a National Police Misconduct  Registry. While the inequities in our criminal justice system are  immense, this legislation is a bold step to address systemic racism in  law enforcement, and the time has come to make these reforms the law of  the land.
