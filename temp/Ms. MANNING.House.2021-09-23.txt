 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  5323, the Iron Dome Supplemental Appropriations Act.   Israel is our most important, most reliable, and only democratic ally  in the Middle East. The United States has a longstanding bipartisan  commitment to Israel's security, and that commitment must remain  ironclad.   In May, innocent civilians in Israel, Jews, Christians, and Muslims  were targeted by terrorist groups from Gaza who fired more than 4,500  rockets at schools, hospitals, and population centers. It was the Iron  Dome missile defense system that intercepted those rockets, saving  thousands of lives.   Now we must stand with our ally on a bipartisan basis and make sure  Israel has the resources to defend her people from future terrorist  attacks. We do that by passing this bill.   I am grateful to Majority Leader Hoyer and Chairwoman DeLauro for  their leadership in bringing this supplemental to the floor today. We  cannot play politics with Israel's security especially when lives are  at risk.    Mr. Speaker, I was in a confidential briefing and we  were not informed the vote was called in time to get back to vote. Had  I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 284.
