 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, well, the Biden administration's  reckless economic policies have hurt American workers and families  right from the beginning. Right from the start of their one-party  government, Democrats used party-line votes to light trillions-- trillions--of dollars on fire and supercharge inflation that is still  hammering the country right up to the present.   After 2 years of reckless policies and human pain, the American  people voted for checks and balances. They  [[Page S1277]]  elected a Republican House and a narrowly divided Senate to literally  pump the brakes on this radicalism. But there is an old saying in  Washington that ``personnel is policy.'' So while the American people  put a stop to reckless legislation last November, President Biden  continues to send reckless nominations to the Senate. They want to  accomplish through Big Government regulations what the voters have  stopped them from doing here in Congress.   This morning, for example, the HELP Committee is hearing from Julie  Su, President Biden's nominee to run the Department of Labor. Ms. Su  has a lengthy track record for all--all--the wrong reasons.   Before entering the Biden administration, she presided over a  disaster as head of the State labor department out in California. Tens  of billions of dollars in fraudulent payments went out the door on her  watch. The State auditor found Ms. Su and her department were totally  asleep--totally asleep--at the switch on antifraud efforts. Even the  Los Angeles Times had to label her performance--listen to this--an  ``epic failure.''   Our supply chains are already in enough peril, due in part to high- stakes labor negotiations. Think about the negotiations to keep open  the ports on the west coast. Think about the ripple effects. Our  national economy cannot afford a track record of ``epic failure''  leading our Department of Labor.   She also supported and helped implement a controversial new  California law that essentially--listen to this--declared war on  independent contractors and tried to give Big Labor special interests  veto power over the entire gig economy. In essence, these far-left  Democrats want every ride-share driver, hairdresser, or personal  trainer to be reclassified and handled more like a corporate employee,  all so that part of their paychecks could be vacuumed up and donated to  leftwing political causes.   The same partisan inflexibility has defined Ms. Su's time here in  Washington as Deputy Secretary of Labor on the national level. From the  powerful No. 2 job, she helped President Biden try to force that  California model into our entire economy, a giant gift for Big Labor  bosses at the expense of workers and consumers alike. She also signaled  that she wants to help lead the far left's crusade against the current  joint-employer rule, yet another effort to give big-money union bosses  even more power to squash innovation and skim money from workers'  paychecks.   What they can't get through legislation, they fully intend to push  forward through regulations. So it is no wonder that an unending parade  of small business leaders, independent contractors, and other job  creators have written the Senate literally begging us--begging us--to  demand a fairer and more mainstream Labor Secretary. Confirming this  nominee would compound the economic pain the Biden administration has  already caused.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, if I may say to our colleague from  Washington, I remember, as you certainly do, that 1992 was declared the  ``Year of the Woman,'' and a number of women were elected to the  Senate. But you were the leader of the group, and you have had an  extraordinarily successful career, and I wanted you to know that people  on both sides of the aisle admire your service. And congratulations.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the  Senator from Missouri (Mr. Hawley).
