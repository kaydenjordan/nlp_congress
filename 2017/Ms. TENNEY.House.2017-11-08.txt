 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colonel Ben  Margolius and Mr. Al Eaton, founders of the Southern Tier Veterans  Support Group.   Ben is a veteran of the Army, serving as the chief of joint  operations for the U.S. Transportation Command and holding leadership  positions at USCENTCOM, USEUCOM, and USTRANSCOM.   Al is a veteran of the Navy and, like my son, a graduate of the U.S.  Naval Academy, having served as a naval flight officer on P-3 Orions,  performing antisubmarine warfare and surface surveillance missions.   After their military service, Ben and Al saw a great need to provide  help to veterans where other agencies could not. This started  informally, with Ben and Al getting donations and support where they  could, until the Southern Tier Veterans Support Group was formed  officially in August of 2011.   Today, Ben and Al's work has brought over 70 community partners  together to assist veterans and their families, with 425 veterans  receiving $65,000 in assistance since 2016.   Thank you, Ben and Al, for your service and for all that your  organization has done to help our veterans.   Go Navy.  [[Page H8645]]    Go Army.                            ____________________
