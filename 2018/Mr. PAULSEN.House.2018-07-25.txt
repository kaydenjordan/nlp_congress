 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as an advocate for giving consumers more choice in  healthcare and lowering costs, I support this bill, which also gives  more flexibility for those who have healthcare savings accounts, as  well as some of the other provisions that were already just previously  mentioned.   I want to highlight my support for one of the provisions in this bill  that will allow people to use their healthcare savings account to pay  for direct primary care and those arrangements.   The concept of direct primary care is simple, and it is supported by  a lot of family doctors, a lot of primary care doctors. People pay a  monthly fee to see their physician in this area anytime they choose,  over the phone, through telemedicine, or in person, and then they get a  whole host of services. It is really important for strengthening the  doctor-patient relationship, and it means that more people will have  access to primary care services instead of just going to the emergency  room in order to get care.   But, unfortunately, the IRS has stated that direct primary care  arrangements are essentially health insurance, and they categorize them  in this way so you cannot use your HSAs and those funds to pay for  direct primary care. That is why Congressman Blumenauer and I authored  legislation to fix this and to allow HSAs, health savings accounts, to  be used for direct primary care, and I am pleased that it is included  in this bill.   Another important reform will allow employers to offer direct primary  care arrangements to employees that have an HSA, also. This will let  more people have access to direct primary care through their healthcare  savings accounts, allowing family practice doctors like Dr. Julie  Anderson in Minnesota to expand their practice without having to worry  about the headache of filling out mountains of paperwork and excessive  insurance forms, because direct primary care let's the doctor work  directly with the patient and you don't have to go through extensive  billing services and insurance.   Healthcare savings accounts, Mr. Speaker, have already been proven to  help lower healthcare costs; and expanding them, giving consumers more  flexibility and more choices, will mean families are also going to be  better off.   So let's allow healthcare savings accounts to be used for direct  primary care and support the underlying bill.    Mr. Speaker, just to follow up, there are too many  families that continue to suffocate under the high premiums and high  deductibles that we have from the Affordable Care Act.   In contrast to the top-down, one-size-fits-all approach of ObamaCare,  healthcare savings accounts put consumers in charge of their own  healthcare. It is no wonder they are gaining in popularity.   Today, nearly 22 million Americans have health savings accounts. That  is twice as many as was mentioned earlier, twice as many as the number  of people who are getting plans through the ObamaCare exchanges. That  is not even close. In Minnesota alone, more than a million, 1.2  million, people and families are eligible for HSA plans.   Now, the bill before us today supports the continued growth of  healthcare savings accounts and includes a couple of provisions that I  helped author, including allowing working seniors to contribute to an  HSA, increasing the limits that individuals and families can contribute  to their HSAs, and allowing married couples the opportunity to make  larger catch-up contributions to their own healthcare savings accounts.  Then it also creates a grace period to help pay for medical expenses  that someone may have incurred before they actually set up their  healthcare savings accounts.   These are all important improvements that will help provide value in  healthcare and help lower prices.   So let's let people purchase the type of coverage that they want and  that they can afford. I am really pleased that the bill before us makes  these very smart, strategic, calculated reforms, and I ask my  colleagues for their support.                                time  1700
