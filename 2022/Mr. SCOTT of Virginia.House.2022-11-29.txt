 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I rise in support of the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration  Reauthorization Act. The Justice and Mental Health Collaboration  Program is authorized through the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and  Crime Reduction Act, what we call MIOTCRA, legislation that I was proud  to work on nearly 20 years ago as the then-ranking member of the Crime  Subcommittee of Judiciary Committee.   This legislation has proven to successfully connect State and local  governments with necessary resources to plan and implement initiatives  designed to increase public safety, save tax dollars on ineffective or  even counterproductive incarceration, and improve the lives of people  with mental illness and their families.   These grants for States and localities allow for the development of  programming that connects those with mental illness and substance use  issues with evidence-based and comprehensive treatment within the  criminal justice system. Each year there are about 2 million people  with serious mental illnesses admitted to jails across the country.  [[Page H8622]]    In fact, according to the National Alliance of Mental Illness, 44  percent of those in jail and 37 percent of those in prisons have a  history of mental illness.                                time  1545    Furthermore, once incarcerated, individuals with mental illness tend  to stay in jail longer, and upon release are more likely to return to  incarceration than those without mental illnesses.   These grants encourage collaboration between law enforcement and  healthcare providers. The reforms to this program included in this  reauthorization are centered on reducing suicide, increasing access to  case management services, bolstering the roles of co-responder and  crisis intervention teams, and continuing the strong support of mental  health courts. This bill recognizes that prevention is the best  investment in the criminal justice system for long-term success and  cost savings.   This legislation is the result of the hard work of many, including  State government organizations, mental health organizations, and law  enforcement organizations. I thank all of those and my colleagues who  have led this effort with me, including Representatives Chabot, Jackson  Lee, and Emmer; the chairman of the committee, Mr. Nadler; as well as  Senators Cornyn, Klobuchar, Moran, Durbin, Grassley, Whitehouse,  Tillis, and Cortez Masto.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the  reauthorization of this legislation so we can get it to the President's  desk before the end of the year.    Madam Speaker, as dean of the Virginia  congressional delegation, I am joined by Members of the delegation from  the House and Senate. It is with a heavy heart that I announce to the  House the  [[Page H8643]]  passing of our colleague, Congressman A. Donald McEachin.   Throughout his life of public service, Donald was a relentless  champion for all Virginians, serving in the House of Delegates, the  Senate of Virginia, and then here in the House of Representatives. He  was the son of an Army veteran and a public schoolteacher. Donald  graduated from American University, earned his law degree from the  University of Virginia, and received his Master of Divinity from the  Virginia Union University.   As many in this Chamber know, Donald was a thoughtful and principled  legislator respected by Members on both sides of the aisle. He was also  a trailblazing figure in Virginia politics. He was the first African- American nominee of a major party for Virginia Attorney General and  only the third African American elected to Congress from the  Commonwealth of Virginia.   Donald was resolute in pushing Virginia to lead the way in climate  policy. He recognized the climate crisis as a moral issue and was a  champion for environmental justice, using his skills as a trial lawyer  to fight to ensure that the voices of our most vulnerable communities  were heard and heeded. May we all seek to honor Donald's life and  legacy by working to build a future in which everyone has access to  clean air, water, and soil.   Madam Speaker, this body has lost one of its most dedicated public  servants and fiercest advocates for justice and equality, and he will  be deeply missed. I want to offer my deepest condolences to his wife,  Colette, their three children, his beloved grandchildren, his friends,  his staff, and the countless individuals positively impacted by his  life of service.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).    Madam Speaker, I offer a privileged resolution  and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1496         Resolved, That the House has heard with profound sorrow of       the death of the Honorable A. Donald McEachin, a       Representative from the Commonwealth of Virginia.        Resolved, That the Clerk communicate these resolutions to       the Senate and transmit a copy thereof to the family of the       deceased.        Resolved, That when the House adjourns today, it adjourn as       a further mark of respect to the memory of the deceased.                            ____________________
