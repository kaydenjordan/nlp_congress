 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, we can all agree that data is important, but we need  to recognize, particularly as it relates to obtaining data on  companies, that each one is unique.   Mandatory reporting metrics do not accurately measure progress. Just  look at the mandatory disclosure bills that we had on the floor last  week. The only outcome we can expect to see is higher compliance costs  on companies, leaving fewer resources to build our workforce and invest  in research and technology to compete globally. Simply put, one size  fits all does not work.   However, this bill, the bill we have before us today, does not impose  a mandatory reporting regime. Data is collected on a voluntary basis.  Any loan applicant who does not want to provide information can decline  to provide it, meaning there are fewer concerns over privacy because it  is voluntary and fewer concerns over one-size-fits-all data reporting.   I appreciate my Democratic colleagues having offered a solution to  promoting diversity inclusion without imposing requirements on  businesses or business owners that do not effectively measure their  success.   Thus, Madam Speaker, I support the bill, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I think my colleague Mr. Green outlines this well.  This is not a mandatory reporting bill, but data collection. Though the  terms may not be perfect to Chairman Green's points and perhaps we need  to look at the language of this reporting, for sure, but this is not a  mandatory reporting bill. This is voluntary information that borrowers  can offer up or not. Data is a good thing, especially if it is provided  voluntarily.   For those reasons, I support this bill and I urge its adoption.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution.   Earlier this week, President Biden met with financial regulators.  From the four-sentence recap released by the White House, we know one  of the topics they discussed was ``promoting financial inclusion and  responsibly increasing access to credit.''   I agree with that concept, and I think we should all agree with that  concept. Unfortunately, my Democrat colleagues here in the House and  the Senate don't seem to be on the same page with the Biden  administration. This resolution we are considering today would actually  make financial services more expensive and credit less available to  consumers and to small businesses and families across the country.   So why are my Democrat colleagues strong-arming this resolution  through Congress?   Well, the answer is pretty simple. It is politics. That is what it  is. Let's call this what it is. It is blue States and their leftwing,  so-called consumer protection advocates who want to, again, limit the  reach of national banks and partnerships under the guise of ``consumer  protection.''   Democrats are more interested in scoring political points with  leftwing activists than supporting the borrowers and small businesses  that this OCC True Lender Rule helps.                                time  1330    We have witnessed Democrats work for decades to limit the scope of  national banks through one measure or another.   The National Bank Act was signed into law in 1864. We have national  banks. We have had national banks for 157 years in this country similar  to today. What they are striking at is opposition to what we have lived  with for over 157 years of well-regulated national banks doing business  across the country.  [[Page H3101]]    The left, my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle, will  provide misleading statements about interest rates and spurious  arguments about State versus Federal regulation. They will argue  consumers are harmed and this so-called partisan rule that they are  driving invites bad banking practices.   Above all else, my colleagues across the aisle see this as an  opportunity to rebuke the last administration, simply because they  don't like the former President. I understand that. There is plenty of  debate about that. But we should not tinker with existing law that is  longstanding and predates this President or any other President. We  should be talking about the contents of that law.   I would like to remind my friends as well that it was the Obama  administration who supported the risk-management principles underlying  the true lender rule. It was an effort to regulate, to ensure that  instead of having shadow banking provide these services, that you have  well-regulated consumer protection laws at the Federal level as a part  of this process.   So once again, we have the opportunity to come together to support  good, bipartisan policy, rather than doing what the Democrats would  rather do, which is appease the woke left.   So let's stop the political theatrics and talk about what the true  lender rule actually does, not what my Democrat colleagues claim it  does.   The rule specifies that when a bank makes a loan, the bank is the  true lender if, as of the date of origination, it is named as the  lender in the loan agreement or funds the loan. That loan would be  regulated by the entity making the loan, funding the loan, and the  regulation would fall upon them. So the consumers have Federal consumer  protection laws that would act on that loan. That is what it does.   My friends that created the Consumer Protection Bureau, I thought you  wanted that, and yet you are arguing against that with this rule today.  It is pretty straightforward; it is a pretty straightforward law. It  shouldn't be political.   This rule also clarifies that as the true lender of a loan, a bank  holds the responsibility of complying with Federal law. This eliminates  the greatest risk associated with abuse of rent-a-charter schemes,  which we agree are bad, and I think we could be doing something about  that rather than this spurious argument we have today.   In October of last year, the OCC finalized the true lender rule that  is being debated today. This was a second step in a decades-long  process to clarify the bank-third-party relationship when issuing a  loan. It has been longstanding practice, but there have been lawsuits,  a great deal of uncertainty about it, a lot of questions in particular  jurisdictions around the country on the nature of those partnerships,  and it clarifies those partnerships in a rules-based regime.   This legal clarity enables bank and fintech partnerships to provide  their customers with the financial products they want and need.   Consider this: According to the New York Federal Reserve, one in four  African-American-owned firms used fintechs to access PPP loans, one in  four. And they did so using this legal doctrine that enabled that to  happen in partnerships with national banks.   Technology helps create greater financial inclusion. So why are my  Democrat colleagues so afraid of technology, so afraid of innovation?   Per usual, my Democrat colleagues are willing to ignore facts in  favor of myths that back up their preferred narrative. That is  unfortunate, especially for something this important.   The left likes to say that banks can charge whatever interest rate  they want. That is simply not true. Federal law gives national banks  and Federal savings associations the same authority that State banks  have regarding exportation of interest rates.   Now, both Federal- and State-chartered banks must conform to  applicable interest rate limits in those States. States retain the  authority to set interest rates, which varies from State to State.   Here is another myth: Third-party bank partnerships will use this  rule to skirt State supervision and usury laws. Simply not true.   The truth is, banks primarily partner with third parties to reach  additional markets, benefiting from a particular expertise or  technology to improve their efficiency. Partnerships with third parties  do not change the bank's authority or expose interest rate  differentials.   And last, but not least, progressive activists cite the interest rate  as a real problem with the true lender rule. They are pushing a 36  percent best rate cap. They have even pushed it at the national level.  The math simply doesn't back up this falsehood.   The true lender rule was not some sinister plan by the previous  administration to trick borrowers. It was not. It simply was not the  case. This legal principle was established in 1864 with the National  Bank Act. It is being undermined by an attempt at politics rather than  sound policy, and what we should support is good, bipartisan policy  that provides clarity to banks and fintechs so they can better serve  our constituents and the consumers of America. That is it.   We have a well-regulated banking system. We do. It is not perfect. We  have States that have various laws that are operable in their States,  but we also have a national system here as well.   We have worked harmoniously, not perfectly, over the last 157 years  since we established the national banking system. But why undermine a  key principle of that national banking system by spurious arguments  that actually don't have to do with the true lender rule? They don't.  There are other elements that the left opposes that actually, on a  bipartisan basis, we oppose, but the true lender rule is not it.    It is a question of whether or not the bank that is providing you the  loan is, in fact, the true lender. That is it. It is not fancier than  that, people. That is what it is. That is what we are arguing about  today, and that is kind of the absurdity of this stuff that we are  debating right now, because it is that simple.   So let's promote financial inclusion the way that the President  outlined, which was promoting financial inclusion, making rates more  competitive and the cost of credit cheaper for individuals. Let's do  that. Let's oppose this resolution before us so we can have sound  principles, so we can drive that inclusion that is necessary and very  important.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), who is the ranking member on the Consumer  Protection and Financial Institutions Subcommittee of the Financial  Services Committee, and also the ranking member on the Small Business  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I would reference my colleagues the Federal Code, the  Federal Register, that actually has the contents of this rule.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the actual rule that we are  debating here, and I would highlight one piece in particular.   ``The OCC agrees that rent-a-charter schemes have no place in the  Federal financial system but disagrees that this rule facilitates such  schemes. As noted above, instead, this proposal would help solve the  problem by (1) providing a clear and simple test for determining when a  bank makes a loan and (2) emphasizing the robust supervisory framework  that applies to any  [[Page H3103]]  loan made by a bank and to all third-party relationships to which banks  are a party. As noted above, if a bank fails to satisfy its obligations  under this supervisory framework, the OCC will use all the tools at its  disposal, including its enforcement authority.''      DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY      Office of the Comptroller of the Currency      12 CFR Part 7      [Docket ID OCC-2020-0026]      RIN 1557-AE97      National Banks and Federal Savings Associations as Lenders        AGENCY: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,       Treasury.        ACTION: Final rule.        SUMMARY: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency       (OCC) is issuing this final rule to determine when a national       bank or Federal savings association (bank) makes a loan and       is the ``true lender,'' including in the context of a       partnership between a bank and a third party, such as a       marketplace lender. Under this rule, a bank makes a loan if,       as of the date of origination, it is named as the lender in       the loan agreement or funds the loan.        DATES: The final rule is effective on December 29, 2020.      SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:      I. Background        Lending partnerships between national banks or Federal       savings associations (banks) and third parties play a       critical role in our financial system. These partnerships       expand access to credit and provide an avenue for banks to       remain competitive as the financial sector evolves. Through       these partnerships, banks often leverage technology developed       by innovative third parties that helps to reach a wider array       of customers. However, there is often uncertainty about how       to determine which entity is making the loans and, therefore,       the laws that apply to these loans. This uncertainty may       discourage banks from entering into lending partnerships,       which, in turn, may limit competition, restrict access to       affordable credit, and chill the innovation that can result       from these relationships. Through this rulemaking, the Office       of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is providing the       legal certainty necessary for banks to partner confidently       with other market participants and meet the credit needs of       their customers.        However, the OCC understands that there is concern that its       rulemaking facilitates inappropriate `rent-a-charter' lending       schemes--arrangements in which a bank receives a fee to       `rent' its charter and unique legal status to a third party.       These schemes are designed to enable the third party to evade       state and local laws, including some state consumer       protection laws, and to allow the bank to disclaim any       compliance responsibility for the loans. These arrangements       have absolutely no place in the federal banking system and       are addressed by this rulemaking, which holds banks       accountable for all loans they make, including those made in       the context of marketplace lending partnerships or other loan       sale arrangements.        On July 22, 2020, the OCC published a notice of proposed       rulemaking (proposal or NPR) to determine when a bank makes a       loan. Under the proposal, a bank made a loan if, as of the       date of origination, it (1) was named as the lender in the       loan agreement or (2) funded the loan.        As the proposal explained, federal law authorizes banks to       enter into contracts, to make loans, and to subsequently       transfer these loans and assign the loan contracts. The       statutory framework, however, does not specifically address       which entity makes a loan when the loan is originated as part       of a lending partnership involving a bank and a third party,       nor has the OCC taken regulatory action to resolve this       ambiguity. In the absence of regulatory action, a growing       body of case law has introduced divergent standards for       resolving this issue, as discussed below. As a result of this       legal uncertainty, stakeholders cannot reliably determine the       applicability of key laws, including the law governing the       permissible interest that may be charged on the loan.        This final rule establishes a clear test for determining       when a bank makes a loan, by interpreting the statutes that       grant banks their authority to lend. Specifically, the final       rule provides that a bank makes a loan when it, as of the       date of origination, (1) is named as the lender in the loan       agreement or (2) funds the loan.      II. Overview of Comments        The OCC received approximately 4,000 comments on the       proposal, the vast majority of which were from individuals       using a version of one of three short form letters to express       opposition to the proposal. Other commenters included banks,       nonbank lenders, industry trade associations, community       groups, academics, state government representatives, and       members of Congress.        Commenters supporting the proposal stated that the judicial       true lender doctrine has led to divergent standards and       uncertainty concerning the legitimacy of lending partnerships       between banks and third parties. They also stated that, by       removing the uncertainty, the OCC would help ensure that       banks have the confidence to enter into these lending       relationships, which provide affordable credit to consumers       on more favorable terms than the alternatives, such as pawn       shops or payday lenders, to which underserved communities       often turn. Supporting commenters also observed that the       proposal would enhance a bank's safety and soundness by       facilitating its ability to sell loans. These commenters also       noted that the proposal (1) makes clear that the OCC will       hold banks accountable for products with unfair, deceptive,       abusive, or misleading features that are offered as part of a       relationship and (2) is consistent with the OCC's statutory       mission to ensure that banks provide fair access to financial       services.        Commenters opposing the proposal stated that it would       facilitate so-called rent-a-charter schemes, which would       result in increased predatory lending and disproportionately       impact marginalized communities. Other opposing commenters       stated that the proposal is an attempt by the OCC to       improperly regulate nonbank lenders, a role they consider to       be reserved exclusively to the states. Opposing commenters       also asserted that the OCC did not have sufficient legal       authority to issue the proposal and that the proposal       violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and 12 U.S.C.       25b.        Both supporting and opposing commenters recommended       changes. These recommendations included (1) adopting a test       that requires the true lender to have a predominant economic       interest in the loan; (2) providing additional ``safe       harbor'' requirements to enhance consumer protections (e.g.,       interest rate caps); (3) clarifying that certain traditional       bank lending activities do not fall under the funding prong       of the rule (e.g., indirect auto lending and mortgage       warehouse lending); (4) providing additional details on how       the OCC would supervise these relationships; and (5) stating       that the rule will not displace certain federal consumer       protection laws and regulations.        The comments are addressed in greater detail below.      III. Analysis        As noted in the prior section, commenters raised a variety       of issues for the OCC's consideration. These are discussed       below.      A. OCC's Authority To Issue the Rule        Some commenters argued the OCC lacks the legal authority to       issue the rule because it would contravene the unambiguous       meaning of 12 U.S.C. 85. These commenters believe that       section 85 incorporates the common law of usury as of 1864,       which they view as requiring courts to look to the substance       rather than the form of a transaction. In a similar vein,       commenters argued that section 85 incorporates all usury laws       of a state, including its true lender jurisprudence. One       commenter also argued that the proposal contradicts judicial       and administrative precedent interpreting sections 85 and 86.        The OCC disagrees. The rule interprets statutes that       authorize banks to lend--12 U.S.C. 24, 371, and 1464(c)--and       clarifies how to determine when a bank exercises this lending       authority. The OCC has clear authority to reasonably       interpret these statutes, which do not specifically address       when a bank makes a loan.        Banks do not obtain their lending authority from section 85       or 12 U.S.C. 1463(g). Nor are these statutes the authority       the OCC is relying on to issue this rule. The proposal       referenced sections 85 and 1463(g) in the regulatory text to       ensure that interested parties understand the consequences of       its interpretation of sections 24, 371, and 1464(c),       including that this rulemaking operates together with the       OCC's recently finalized `Madden-fix' rulemaking. When a bank       makes a loan pursuant to the test established in this       regulation, the bank may subsequently sell, assign, or       otherwise transfer the loan without affecting the permissible       interest term, which is determined by reference to state law.        Other commenters questioned the OCC's authority on       different grounds. Some asserted the OCC lacks authority to       (1) exempt nonbanks from compliance with state law or (2)       preempt state laws that determine whether a loan is made by a       nonbank lender. One commenter also asserted that the proposal       is an attempt by the OCC to interpret state law. A commenter       further argued that the OCC's statutory interpretation is not       reasonable, including because the proposal (1) would allow       nonbanks to enjoy the benefits of federal preemption without       submitting to any regulatory oversight and (2) violates the       presumption against preemption, especially in an area of       historical state police powers like consumer protection.        This rulemaking does not assert authority over nonbanks,       preempt state laws applicable to nonbank lenders, or       interpret state law. It interprets federal banking law and       has no direct applicability to any nonbank entity or       activity. Rather, in identifying the true lender, the rule       pinpoints key elements of the statutory, regulatory, and       supervisory framework applicable to the loan in question. As       noted in the proposal, if a nonbank partner is the true       lender, the relevant state (and not OCC) would regulate the       lending activity, and the OCC would assess the bank's third-      party risk management in connection with the relationship       itself.        Furthermore, because commenters expressed concern that this       rule would undermine state usury caps, it is also important       to emphasize that sections 85 and 1463(g) provide a choice of       law framework for determining which state's law applies to       bank loans and, in this way, incorporate, rather than       eliminate, state law. These statutes require that a bank       refer to, and comply with, the usury cap established by the       laws of the state where the bank is located. Thus,       disparities between the usury caps applicable to  [[Page H3104]]       particular bank loans result primarily from differences in       the state laws that impose these caps, not from an       interpretation that section 85 or 1463(g) preempt state law.        A commenter also asserted that the OCC's interpretation is       not reasonable because it (1) does not solve the problem it       claims to remedy, arguing that the proposal itself is unclear       and requires banks to undertake a fact-specific analysis and       (2) departs from federal cases holding that state true lender       law applies to lending relationships between banks and       nonbanks.        The OCC believes that this rule provides a simple, bright-      line test to determine when a bank has made a loan and,       therefore, is the true lender in a lending relationship. The       only required factual analysis is whether the bank is named       as the lender or funds the loan. The OCC has evaluated       various standards established by courts and has determined       that a clear, predictable, and easily administrable test is       preferable. This test will provide legal certainty, and the       OCC's robust supervisory framework effectively targets       predatory lending, achieving the same goal as a more complex       true lender test.        Several commenters also asserted that the proposal       contravenes 12 U.S.C. 1, which charges the OCC with ensuring       that banks treat customers fairly. One commenter also argued       that the proposal is inconsistent with the Community       Reinvestment Act (CRA) because it encourages predatory       lending. As the OCC explained in the proposal, the rule's       purpose is to provide legal certainty to expand access to       credit, a goal that is entirely consistent with the agency's       statutory charge to ensure fair treatment of customers and       banks' statutory obligation to serve the convenience and       needs of their communities.      B. 12 U.S.C. 25b        Several commenters asserted that the agency should have       complied with 12 U.S.C. 25b, which applies when the OCC       issues a regulation or order that preempts a state consumer       financial law. Some of these commenters argued that the       proposal fails to meet the preemption standard articulated in       Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, Florida       Insurance Commissioner, et al. (Barnett), as incorporated       into section 25b. Commenters also argued that (1) section       25b(f) does not exempt the OCC's proposal from the       requirements of section 25b because the rule is not limited       to banks charging interest and (2) the proposal undermines or       contravenes section 25b(h) because it extends preemptive       treatment to subsidiaries, affiliates, and agents of banks.        The OCC disagrees: The requirements of section 25b are       inapplicable to this rulemaking. Section 25b applies when the       Comptroller determines, on a case-by-case basis, that a state       consumer financial law is preempted pursuant to the standard       for conflict preemption established by the Supreme Court in       Barnett, i.e., when the Comptroller makes a preemption       determination. This rulemaking does not preempt a state       consumer financial law but rather interprets a bank's federal       authority to lend. Furthermore, commenters arguing that       section 25b(f) (which addresses section 85) does not exempt       this rulemaking from the procedures in section 25b and that       sections 25b(b)(2), (e), and (h)(2) (which address bank       subsidiaries, affiliates, and agents) preclude the agency       from issuing this rule are mistaken; this rulemaking is not       an interpretation of section 85, nor does it address the       applicability of state law to bank subsidiaries, affiliates,       or agents.      C. Administrative Procedure Act        Several commenters asserted that, for various reasons, the       proposal is arbitrary and capricious and, therefore, in       violation of the APA. Some commenters argued that the       proposal lacks an evidentiary basis, either entirely or with       respect to certain assertions, such as the existence of legal       uncertainty. The OCC disagrees. The APA's arbitrary and       capricious standard requires an agency to make rational and       informed decisions based on the information before it.       Furthermore, the standard does not require the OCC to develop       or cite empirical or other data to support its rule or wait       for problems to materialize before acting. Instead, the OCC       may rely on its expertise to address the problems that may       arise.        The OCC has decided to issue this rule to resolve the       effects of legal uncertainty on banks and their third-party       relationships. In this case, the OCC's views are informed by       courts' divergent true lender tests and the resulting lack of       predictability faced by stakeholders. While the OCC       understands its rule may not resolve all legal uncertainty       for every loan, this is not a prerequisite for the agency to       take this narrowly tailored action. Taking these       considerations into account, the OCC has made a rational and       informed decision to issue this rule.        Commenters also argued that the OCC's actions violate the       APA because the agency has not given notice of its intention       to reverse an existing policy or provided the factual, legal,       and policy reasons for doing so. Specifically, these       commenters referenced the OCC's longstanding policy       prohibiting banks from entering into rent-a-charter schemes.       This rulemaking does not reverse the OCC's position. The       OCC's longstanding and unwavering opposition to predatory       lending, including but not limited to predatory lending as       part of a third-party relationship, remains intact and       strong. In fact, this rulemaking would solve the rent-a-      charter issues raised and ensure that banks do not       participate in those arrangements. As noted in the proposal,       the OCC's statutes and regulations, enforceable guidelines,       guidance, and enforcement authority provide robust and       effective safeguards against predatory lending when a bank       exercises its lending authority. This rule does not alter       this framework but rather reinforces its importance by       clarifying that it applies to every loan a bank makes and by       providing a simple test to identify precisely when a bank has       made a loan. If a bank fails to satisfy its compliance       obligations, the OCC will not hesitate to use its enforcement       authority consistent with its longstanding policy and       practice.        Furthermore, the final rule does not change the OCC's       expectation that all banks establish and maintain prudent       credit underwriting practices and comply with applicable law,       even when they partner with third parties. These expectations       were in place before the OCC issued its proposal and will       remain in place after the final rule takes effect. For these       reasons, the final rule does not represent a change in OCC       policy.      D. Comments on the Proposed Regulatory Text        As noted previously, the OCC's proposed regulatory text set       out a test for determining when a bank has made a loan for       purposes of 12 U.S.C. 24, 85, 371, 1463(g), and 1464(c).       Under this test, a bank made a loan if, as of the date of       origination, it was named as the lender in the loan agreement       or funded the loan.        Some commenters supported the rule without change, stating       that the proposal provided the clarity needed to determine       which entity is the true lender in a lending relationship.       Other commenters supported the proposal as a general matter       but suggested specific changes, including clarifying that the       funding prong does not include certain lending or financing       arrangements such as warehouse lending, indirect auto lending       (through bank purchases of retail installment contracts       (RICs)), loan syndication, and other structured finance.        These commenters are correct that the funding prong of the       proposal generally does not include these types of       arrangements: They do not involve a bank funding a loan at       the time of origination. For example, when a bank purchases a       RIC from an auto dealer, as is often the case with indirect       auto lending, the bank does not ``fund'' the loan. When a       bank provides a warehouse loan to a third party that       subsequently draws on that warehouse loan to lend to other       borrowers, the bank is not funding the loans to these other       borrowers. In contrast, and as noted in the proposal, the       bank is the true lender in a table funding arrangement when       the bank funds the loan at origination.        Another commenter recommended that the OCC consider the       ``safe harbor'' established in the recent settlement between       the Colorado Attorney General and several financial       institutions and fintech lenders. While we are aware of this       settlement, the OCC believes that our approach achieves the       goal of legal certainty while providing the necessary       safeguards.        One commenter requested that the OCC expressly state in the       final rule that the rulemaking is not intended to displace or       alter other regulatory regimes, including those that address       consumer protection. Another commenter requested that the OCC       clarify how account information in true lender arrangements       should be reported to consumer reporting agencies under the       Fair Credit Reporting Act. As the preamble to the proposal       noted, the OCC's rule does not affect the application of any       federal consumer financial laws, including, but not limited       to, the meaning of the terms (1) ``creditor'' in the Truth in       Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) and Regulation Z (12 CFR       part 1026) and (2) ``lender'' in Regulation X (12 CFR part       1024), which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures       Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.). Similarly, the OCC's       rule does not affect the applicability of the Home Mortgage       Disclosure Act (12 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.), the Equal Credit       Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.), the Fair Credit       Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), or their implementing       regulations (Regulation C (12 CFR part 1003), Regulation B       (12 CFR part 1002), and Regulation V (12 CFR part 1022)),       respectively. The OCC recommends that commenters direct       questions regarding these statutes and regulations to the       Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.        Some commenters stated that the two prongs in the       proposal's test would produce contradictory and absurd       results. For example, several commenters noted that, under       the proposal, two banks could be the true lender (e.g., at       origination, one bank is named as the lender on the loan       agreement and another bank funds the loan). In response to       this comment, we have amended the regulatory text to provide       that where one bank is named as the lender in the loan       agreement and another bank funds the loan, the bank named as       the lender in the loan agreement makes the loan. This       approach will provide additional clarity and allow       stakeholders, including borrowers, to easily identify the       bank that makes the loan. Otherwise, the OCC adopts the       regulatory text as proposed.      E. Rent-a-Charter Concerns; Supervisory Expectations        The OCC received multiple comments expressing concern that       the proposal would facilitate rent-a-charter relationships       and  [[Page H3105]]       thereby enable nonbank lenders to engage in predatory or       otherwise abusive lending practices. These commenters noted       that nonbanks are generally not subject to the type of       prudential supervision that applies to banks and that usury       caps are the most effective method to curb predatory lending       by nonbanks. They argued that the OCC's rule would       effectively nullify these caps and facilitate the expansion       of predatory lending.        As explained above, in a rent-a-charter arrangement, a       lender receives a fee to rent out its charter and unique       legal status to originate loans on behalf of a third party,       enabling the third party to evade state and local laws, such       as usury caps and other consumer protection laws. At the same       time, the lender disclaims any responsibility for these       loans. As a result of these arrangements, consumers can find       themselves in debt to an unscrupulous nonbank lender that is       subject to very little or no prudential supervision on a loan       at an interest rate grossly in excess of the state usury cap.        The OCC agrees that rent-a-charter schemes have no place in       the federal financial system but disagrees that this rule       facilitates such schemes. As noted above, instead, this       proposal would help solve the problem by (1) providing a       clear and simple test for determining when a bank makes a       loan and (2) emphasizing the robust supervisory framework       that applies to any loan made by a bank and to all third-      party relationships to which banks are a party. As noted       above, if a bank fails to satisfy its obligations under this       supervisory framework, the OCC will use all the tools at its       disposal, including its enforcement authority.        Although the proposal discussed this supervisory framework       in detail, it bears repeating because of its importance to       this rulemaking. Every bank is responsible for establishing       and maintaining prudent credit underwriting practices that:       (1) Are commensurate with the types of loans the bank will       make and consider the terms and conditions under which they       will be made; (2) consider the nature of the markets in which       the loans will be made; (3) provide for consideration, prior       to credit commitment, of the borrower's overall financial       condition and resources, the financial responsibility of any       guarantor, the nature and value of any underlying collateral,       and the borrower's character and willingness to repay as       agreed; (4) establish a system of independent, ongoing credit       review and appropriate communication to management and to the       board of directors; (5) take adequate account of       concentration of credit risk; and (6) are appropriate to the       size of the institution and the nature and scope of its       activities. Moreover, every bank is expected to have loan       documentation practices that: (1) Enable the institution to       make an informed lending decision and assess risk, as       necessary, on an ongoing basis; (2) identify the purpose of a       loan and the source of repayment and assess the ability of       the borrower to repay the indebtedness in a timely manner;       (3) ensure that any claim against a borrower is legally       enforceable; (4) demonstrate appropriate administration and       monitoring of a loan; and (5) take account of the size and       complexity of a loan. Every bank should also have appropriate       internal controls and information systems to assess and       manage the risks associated with its lending activities,       including those that provide for monitoring adherence to       established policies and compliance with applicable laws and       regulations, as well as internal audit systems.        In addition, a bank's lending must comply with all       applicable laws and regulations, including federal consumer       protection laws. For example, section 5 of the Federal Trade       Commission Act (FTC Act) provides that ``unfair or deceptive       acts or practices in or affecting commerce'' are unlawful.       The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act       also prohibits unfair, deceptive, or ``abusive'' acts or       practices. The OCC has taken a number of public enforcement       actions against banks for violating section 5 of the FTC Act       and will continue to exercise its enforcement authority to       address unlawful actions.        Banks also are subject to federal fair lending laws and may       not engage in unlawful discrimination, such as ``steering'' a       borrower to a higher cost loan on the basis of the borrower's       race, national origin, age, or gender. If a bank engages in       any unlawful discriminatory practices, the OCC will take       appropriate action under the federal fair lending laws.       Further, under the CRA regulations, CRA-related lending       practices that violate federal fair lending laws, the FTC       Act, or Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, or that       evidence other discriminatory or illegal credit practices,       can adversely affect a bank's CRA performance rating.        The OCC has also taken significant steps to eliminate       predatory, unfair, or deceptive practices in the federal       banking system, recognizing that ``[s]uch practices are       inconsistent with important national objectives, including       the goals of fair access to credit, community development,       and stable homeownership by the broadest spectrum of       America.'' To address these concerns, the OCC requires banks       engaged in lending to take into account the borrower's       ability to repay the loan according to its terms. In the       OCC's experience, ``a departure from fundamental principles       of loan underwriting generally forms the basis of abusive       lending: Lending without a determination that a borrower can       reasonably be expected to repay the loan from resources other       than the collateral securing the loan, and relying instead on       the foreclosure value of the borrower's collateral to recover       principal, interest, and fees.''        Additionally, the OCC has cautioned banks about lending       activities that may be considered predatory, unfair, or       deceptive, noting that many such lending practices are       unlawful under existing federal laws and regulations or       otherwise present significant safety, soundness, or other       risks. These practices include those that target prospective       borrowers who cannot afford credit on the terms being       offered, provide inadequate disclosures of the true costs and       risks of transactions, involve loans with high fees and       frequent renewals, or constitute loan ``flipping'' (frequent       re-financings that result in little or no economic benefit to       the borrower that are undertaken with the primary or sole       objective of generating additional fees). Policies and       procedures should also be designed to ensure clear and       transparent disclosure of the terms of the loan, including       relative costs, risks, and benefits of the loan transaction,       which helps to mitigate the risk that a transaction could be       unfair or deceptive. The NPR also highlighted specific       questions that the OCC evaluates as part of its robust       supervision of banks' lending relationships.        In addition to this framework targeted at banks' lending       activities, the OCC has issued comprehensive guidance on       third-party risk management. These standards apply to any       relationship between a bank and a third party, including       lending relationships, regardless of which entity is the true       lender. Pursuant to this guidance, the OCC expects banks to       institute appropriate safeguards to manage the risks       associated with their third-party relationships.        Under the final rule, this robust supervisory framework       will continue to apply to banks that are the true lender in a       lending relationship with a third party. Rather than allowing       banks to enter into rent-a-charter schemes, the final rule       will ensure that banks understand that the OCC will continue       to hold banks accountable for their lending activities.      IV. Regulatory Analyses        Paperwork Reduction Act. In accordance with the       requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), 44       U.S.C. 3501 et seq., the OCC may not conduct or sponsor, and       respondents are not required to respond to, an information       collection unless it displays a currently valid Office of       Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OCC has       reviewed the final rule and determined that it will not       introduce any new or revise any existing collection of       information pursuant to the PRA. Therefore, no submission       will be made to OMB for review.        Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Regulatory Flexibility Act       (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., requires an agency, in       connection with a final rule, to prepare a Final Regulatory       Flexibility Analysis describing the impact of the rule on       small entities (defined by the Small Business Administration       (SBA) for purposes of the RFA to include commercial banks and       savings institutions with total assets of $600 million or       less and trust companies with total assets of $41.5 million       or less) or to certify that the final rule would not have a       significant economic impact on a substantial number of small       entities.        The OCC currently supervises approximately 745 small       entities. The OCC expects that all of these small entities       would be impacted by the rule. While this final rule could       affect how banks structure their current or future third-      party relationships as well as the amount of loans originated       by banks, the OCC believes the costs associated with any       administrative changes in bank lending policies and       procedures would be de minimis. Banks already have systems,       policies, and procedures in place for issuing loans when       third parties are involved. It takes significantly less time       to amend existing policies than to create them, and the OCC       does not expect any needed adjustments will involve an       extraordinary demand on a bank's human resources. In       addition, any costs would likely be absorbed as ongoing       administrative expenses. Therefore, the OCC certifies that       this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a       substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a Final       Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.        Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Consistent with the Unfunded       Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), 2 U.S.C. 1532, the OCC       considers whether a final rule includes a federal mandate       that may result in the expenditure by state, local, and       tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private       sector, of $100 million adjusted for inflation (currently       $157 million) in any one year. The final rule does not impose       new mandates. Therefore, the OCC concludes that       implementation of the final rule would not result in an       expenditure of $157 million or more annually by state, local,       and tribal governments, or by the private sector.        Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement       Act. Pursuant to section 302(a) of the Riegle Community       Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (RCDRIA),       12 U.S.C. 4802(a), in determining the effective date and       administrative compliance requirements for new regulations       that impose additional reporting, disclosure, or other       requirements on insured depository institutions, the OCC must       consider, consistent with principles of safety and soundness       and the public interest, any administrative burdens that such       regulations would place on depository institutions, including  [[Page H3106]]       small depository institutions, and customers of depository       institutions, as well as the benefits of such regulations. In       addition, section 302(b) of RCDRIA, 12 U.S.C. 4802(b),       requires new regulations and amendments to regulations that       impose additional reporting, disclosures, or other new       requirements on insured depository institutions generally to       take effect on the first day of a calendar quarter that       begins on or after the date on which the regulations are       published in final form. This final rule imposes no       additional reporting, disclosure, or other requirements on       insured depository institutions, and therefore, section 302       is not applicable to this rule.        Congressional Review Act. For purposes of the Congressional       Review Act (CRA), 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq., the Office of       Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) of the OMB       determines whether a final rule is a ``major rule,'' as that       term is defined at 5 U.S.C. 804(2). OIRA has determined that       this final rule is not a major rule. As required by the CRA,       the OCC will submit the final rule and other appropriate       reports to Congress and the Government Accountability Office       for review.        Administrative Procedure Act. The APA, 5 U.S.C. 551 et       seq., generally requires that a final rule be published in       the Federal Register not less than 30 days before its       effective date. This final rule will be effective 60 days       after publication in the Federal Register, which meets the       APA's effective date requirement.      List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 7        Computer technology, Credit, Derivatives, Federal savings       associations, Insurance, Investments, Metals, National banks,       Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Securities,       Security bonds.      Office of the Comptroller of the Currency        For the reasons set out in the preamble, the OCC amends 12       CFR part 7 as follows.      PART 7--ACTIVITIES AND OPERATIONS        1. The authority citation for part 7 continues to read as       follows:        Authority: 12 U.S.C. 1 et seq., 25b, 29, 71, 71a, 92, 92a,       93, 93a, 95(b)(1), 371, 371d, 481, 484, 1463, 1464, 1465,       1818, 1828(m) and 5412(b)(2)(B).        2. Add Sec. 7.1031 to read as follows:      Sec. 7.1031  National banks and Federal savings associations           as lenders.        (a) For purposes of this section, bank means a national       bank or a Federal savings association.        (b) For purposes of sections 5136 and 5197 of the Revised       Statutes (12 U.S.C. 24 and 12 U.S.C. 85), section 24 of the       Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371), and sections 4(g) and       5(c) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1463(g) and 12       U.S.C. 1464(c)), a bank makes a loan when the bank, as of the       date of origination:        (1) Is named as the lender in the loan agreement; or        (2) Funds the loan.        (c) If, as of the date of origination, one bank is named as       the lender in the loan agreement for a loan and another bank       funds that loan, the bank that is named as the lender in the       loan agreement makes the loan.      Brian P. Brooks,      Acting Comptroller of the Currency.      [FR Doc. 2020-24134 Filed 10-29-20; 8:45 am]      BILLING CODE 4810-33-P    Madam Speaker, additionally, I would highlight for you  that the outline here and the arguments by my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle really strikes at the nature of national banking.   So just repeal the National Banking Act rather than trying to  undermine it by taking away the legal principle by which a bank can  make a loan. That is what this rule does, and that is the absurdity of  this debate. That is why I oppose this attempt on the floor today.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Loudermilk), my colleague and friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Utah (Mr. Moore), a great new Member of the Congress.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), who is the ranking member on the Subcommittee on  National Security, International Development, and Monetary Policy of  the Financial Services Committee. He is also a member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee.                                time  1400     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Donalds), who has been a great new Member of Congress.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The true lender rule specifies that when a bank makes a loan, the  bank is the true lender. The rule clarifies what was uncertain and,  therefore, made those loans more expensive.   This gives certainty to the marketplace. It is a good thing. The true  lender rule is a good thing.   Under the true lender rule, we have fintechs that have been enabled  to make loans in coordination with banks and regulated like the people  that they work with, like the banks that they work with, which means  the loans fall under Federal consumer protection laws, under Federal  usury laws, under Federal laws.   One case in point, what the true lender rule enabled was one out of  four African American-owned businesses accessing credit through  fintechs.   I would ask Members to review a few pieces of evidence that I have  here.   Madam Speaker, I would refer the Members to a study conducted by NYU  highlighting the important role that fintechs play in supporting  African American-owned small businesses.   I would also refer the Members to letters in opposition to S.J. Res.  15: a June 8 letter from the American Bankers Association, Consumer  Bankers Association, Electronic Transactions Association, Independent  Bankers of America, Midsize Bank Coalition of America, and National  Bankers Association; an April 2, 2021, letter from FreedomWorks,  Americans for Tax Reform, National Taxpayers Union, Center for a Free  Economy, American Commitment, and Citizens Against Government Waste; a  letter from the Structured Finance Association; a letter from the  Independent Community Bankers of America; a May 11, 2021, letter from  the American Bankers Association; a May 7, 2021, letter from the  [[Page H3109]]  Americans for Prosperity; and a June 22, 2021, letter from the  Competitive Enterprise Institute, which consists of a number of  additional signatories.    None of those people are payday lenders, by the way, which is the  most spurious argument about the true lender rule. If you want to get  at payday lending, go talk about valid when made. That would be the  sound argument from there. At least it has some relationship  tangentially to payday lending. True lender does not. These are  different loans that are being described by my colleagues across the  aisle.   Let's be clear. The National Banking Act enacted in 1864 established  the principle by which and explicitly granted national banks the  ability to transfer loans State-by-State. If you don't like that model,  then repeal the 1864 National Banking Act instead of making these false  arguments about the true lender rule, which simply provides clarity  about the National Banking Act.   My colleagues across the aisle would have you believe that this is a  complex scheme cooked up by the previous administration to get around  consumer protection laws. That is not true. We are talking about 157  years of banking law here in the United States, and my colleagues  across the aisle are arguing about that.   My Democratic colleagues also ignored this basic fact: They have made  misleading statements about national banks versus State banks. They  have implied falsehoods on State interest rates. They have cited  protecting consumers when now they are just leaving them out to dry.  That is not consumer protection.   I get it, Democrats are now so politically motived that the facts and  longstanding precedent no longer matter. I think facts matter. In fact,  Democrats are so blinded by partisanship, some can't even seem to  differentiate between that doctrine of valid when made versus what we  are discussing today, which is true lender. I think we should be rooted  in fact, and our policy debates should be rooted in fact.   Make no mistake, the true lender rule provides necessary consumer  protections and supports affordable credit to more communities. The  rule does nothing to change interest rates, plain and simple. States  retain that authority.   The actions in 2020 to clarify true lender are very different than  codifying and clarifying valid when made. Both were important  clarifications, though.   The argument today is about true lender, not some massive shift away  from congressional intent, not something new, something longstanding.   Regardless, the Democrats will push through whatever they can in the  House today. But as former Acting Comptroller Brooks recently stated,  nullifying the true lender rule does nothing to undo payday lending-- nothing. And it seems to be what my colleagues across the aisle have a  real problem with.   Deal with that. Don't create needless pain for consumers. Don't drive  up the cost of credit and make it less available by repealing this true  lender rule.   This is another moment where my colleagues are working against the  national banks for politics rather than protecting consumers and  creating a more vibrant, competitive, and innovative marketplace.   We should do what is good for consumers in the financial system.  Technology and innovation facilitate financial inclusion, which should  be our goal.   Let's not waste further time here. Let's vote this idea down that we  are debating right now. Let's get back to actually driving a more  competitive marketplace and doing what is right for our constituents,  what is right for consumers, and what is right for families.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
