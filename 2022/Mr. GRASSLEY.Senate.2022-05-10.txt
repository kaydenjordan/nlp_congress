 Madam President, I intend to lift my objection to  proceeding to the consideration of the nomination of Mayor Eric  Garcetti, of California, to be the U.S. Ambassador to India.   Today, I released the findings of a staff review examining whether  Mr. Garcetti was aware of allegations of misconduct by a former senior  adviser. I am making these findings public in the interest of  transparency and for the benefit of my colleagues as the Senate  fulfills its advice and consent duties. I intend to lift my hold on the  nomination, but based on what I have learned, I intend to vote no if  the nomination is considered by the full Senate.
