 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for the  President's counsel.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question from Senator Coons to the  President's counsel is this:         The President's brief states, ``Congress has forbidden       foreigners' involvement in American elections.'' However, in       June 2019, President Trump said if Russia or China offered       information on his opponent, ``[t]here's nothing wrong with       listening,'' and he might not alert the FBI because: ``Give       me a break. Life doesn't work that way.'' Does President       Trump agree with your statement that foreigners' involvement       in American elections is illegal?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senator, thank you for the  question.   I think Congress has specified specific ways in which foreigners  cannot be involved in elections. Foreigners can't vote in elections.  There are restrictions on foreign contributions to campaigns--things  like that.   When the whistleblower originally made a complaint about this July 25  call, and that was reviewed by the inspector general for the  intelligence community, he framed that whistleblower's complaint and  wrote a cover letter framing it in terms of those laws. And he said  that there might be an issue here related to soliciting a foreign  contribution to a campaign, a thing of value, foreign campaign  interference.   That was specifically reviewed by the Department of Justice. The  Department of Justice concluded that there was no such violation here.  So that is not something that is involved in this case.   President Trump's interview with ABC that you cited does not involve  something that is a foreign campaign contribution, something that is  addressed by the law as passed by Congress. He was referring to the  possibility that information could come from a source, and I think he  pointed out in that interview that he might contact the FBI, he might  listen to something.  [[Page S686]]    But mere information is not something that would violate the campaign  finance laws. And if there is credible information, credible  information of wrongdoing by someone who is running for a public  office--it is not campaign interference for credible information about  wrongdoing to be brought to light, if it is credible information.   So I think that the idea that any information that happens to come  from overseas is necessarily campaign interference is a mistake. That  is a non sequitur. Information that is credible, that potentially shows  wrongdoing by someone who happens to be running for office, if it is  credible information, is relevant information for the voters to know  about, for people to be able to decide on who is the best candidate for  an office.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The majority leader is recognized.                                    Recess
