 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, as you know, from time to time I address the House  floor with my version of a speech that my  [[Page H3102]]  childhood pastor would give every Sunday called ``Joys and Concerns.''   During his remarks, he would highlight some of the remarkable things  that members of the church were doing and some of their many  accomplishments.   He would also take this time to bring up prayer requests. It served  as an opportunity to unite as a congregation and pray for our community  and those in need.   Today, the community that instilled this tradition in me needs our  prayers as last Thursday, my childhood home, Perryton, Texas, was hit  by a deadly tornado.   In the 11 minutes the tornado was on the ground, it left three dead,  hundreds injured, and hundreds of homes destroyed.   My office obviously has received an outpouring of prayer requests,  both over the phone and through my website for the people of Perryton.   While it may be different from my usual order, I start this ``Joys  and Concerns'' speech with asking everybody to keep Perryton and their  people in your hearts and minds and prayers going forward.   I also ask that as weeks go on that you continue to keep them, along  with the first responders, community leaders, and volunteers, in your  prayers.   Several weeks ago, I had the opportunity to go to Hillsboro, Texas, a  city in my new district. I learned a lot about Hillsboro while I was  there.   It is a very welcoming community, full of people who love their  country, so much so that the local community college, Hill College, has  on its campus the Texas Heritage Museum.   Out front is a small memorial, and during my visit, I spent some time  there. On that memorial, they honor every Medal of Honor recipient from  Texas.   The Medal of Honor is the Nation's highest military award, and only  U.S. servicemembers who distinguish themselves through conspicuous  gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond the call  of duty can receive the medal.   There I learned that the Sixth Congressional District of Texas in its  current form has nine Medal of Honor recipients.   Due to time constraints, I will only address one today, but we have  nine of them--nine Medal of Honor recipients from the Sixth District of  Texas. On my next occasion, I will reach the other eight.   The first I bring up is First Lieutenant Jack Lummus. He was born on  October 22, 1915, and served our Nation during World War II.   A little known fact is he couldn't graduate from high school because  the cost was too high. He played some semi-pro ball. He finally went to  Baylor and was an all-star baseball player and football player there.   He was playing professional football when December 7 happened, and he  signed up to join our Nation's military. Ironically, he was attempting  to be a pilot and in flight training was a natural pilot. On taxiing  back, he ran his airplane off the taxiway. They booted him. He went  back to playing football, but he signed up to be a marine.   Jack received the Medal of Honor as a leader of a rival platoon  attached to the 2nd Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th Marine Division, in  action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands  on March 8, 1945.   Resuming his assault tactics with bold decision after fighting  without respite for 2 days and nights, he slowly advanced his platoon  against an enemy deeply entrenched in a network of mutually supporting  positions.   Suddenly halted by a terrific concentration of hostile fire, he  unhesitatingly moved forward in his front lines in an effort to  neutralize the Japanese position.   Although knocked to the ground when an enemy grenade exploded close  by, he immediately recovered himself, and again, moving forward despite  the intensified barrage, quickly located, attacked, and destroyed the  occupied emplacement.   Instantly taken under fire by the garrison of his supporting pillbox  and further assailed by the slashing fury of hostile rifle fire, he  fell under the impact of a second enemy grenade.   Courageously disregarding painful shoulder wounds, he staunchly  continued his heroic one-man assault and charged the second pillbox,  annihilating all the occupants.   Subsequently returning to his platoon position, he fearlessly  traversed his lines under fire, encouraging his men to advance and  directing the fire of supporting tanks and placing suppressive fire  against hostile troops.   Jack lost both legs and lost his life on Iwo Jima, a man with a great  deal of promise. He is interred in Ennis, Texas, and he is a local  hero.   The greatness of America comes from her people, and the best of us  are men like Jack Lummus. Next time I talk, I will talk about the other  eight.   As we talk about divisiveness and bad times in our country, I want  you to know that we have great Americans--and have throughout our  history--serving us in times of war and making us the great Nation that  we are.   All we ask when we fight for another Nation overseas is a small plot  of land to bury our dead. This is a debt we owe not only to those who  have fallen in battle but to all those who choose to serve on our  Nation's volunteer force.    As the years go on and our Nation grows, we must continue to ask the  best of us to make sacrifices to protect and defend the United States.   My district is home to 30 different high schools, and within those 30  schools, there were 134 brave young men and women who raised their  hands and said, here am I. Send me.   Within the coming months, they will be joining our Nation's military,  and I take a moment to recognize their sacrifice.

Madam Speaker, if anybody has any questions about the future of our  Nation, 134 young men and women from District Six just this year  enlisted to serve this greatest Nation that has been seen on the face  of this Earth.   Occasionally, some people will tear this Nation down for what she  stood for, her past, her future. For me, why would anybody sign up in  an all-volunteer force if we were anything but exceptional?   I am so very proud of these young men and women in this day and age  when we hear nothing in the press except the dire straits that this  country is in. Well, somebody believes in it, and these 134 people  certainly do, along with the 31 people who applied to the military  academies. I will say to them all: I am very proud, and our future is  bright. Don't listen to any of the naysayers.   Ecclesiastes 1:9 says there is nothing new under the Sun. Jeremiah 29  says only I know the plans I have for you, and they are great plans.   Next, I recognize some of the members of our community that have gone  above and beyond.   I congratulate Aiden Hunter on being selected to represent Texas 4-H  at the National 4-H Conference this year. Agriculture and farming are  the backbone of this great Nation, and I am proud that he is involved  in Ellis County 4-H. Organizations like this are helping to prepare  Aiden to be a future leader not only in agriculture but in life.   I congratulate Alyssa Anderson on achieving the Girl Scout Gold  Award. There are few accomplishments that carry as much prestige and  respect as this honor. The commitment, tenacity, integrity, and work  ethic that are required to achieve the Gold Award are invaluable  qualities.   I congratulate Amy Tidwell and the Corsicana Main Street team on  being awarded the President's Award and People's Choice Award for  cities under 50,000 population by Texas Downtown for their video series  ``New Faces, New Places.'' Departments like theirs are essential to  downtown development and revitalization, and I thank Amy and her team  for their commitment to serve our community.   I congratulate Archie Gerbine on receiving the Donnie and Karen  Pickard Heroism Award. I thank Archie for not only choosing to  preserve, protect, and defend the people of Alvarado but also for  taking on the important role of community leader, role model, and  servant to others. I thank Archie for his continued dedication to the  city of Alvarado and the State of Texas as a first responder.   I congratulate Ashley Thompson on being awarded the Unsung Hero Award  from the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce for 2022.   I congratulate the 2023 Maypearl Panther baseball team for their  third-place finish in State, and I congratulate them for breaking the  school record for total wins and finishing their season with a trip to  Round Rock for the State tournament.   I congratulate Becky and Terry Hill on earning the Mabel Frame Award  from the Waxahachie Chamber of Commerce. I thank them for their  commitment to serve our community. Our community is lucky to have  people like them who have dedicated time to an event that welcomes so  many people. C/10s in the Park has become one of Waxahachie's prized  tourist attractions and is well deserving of the Mabel Frame Award.   I congratulate Cassie Wilbur on being awarded the DAISY Award for  Extraordinary Nurses at UT Health Jacksonville. This award is a tribute  to Cassie's courageous and selfless acts working in healthcare. I truly  appreciate all the work Cassie does in the ER, saving lives in the  Jacksonville community.    I congratulate Catarina Palladio on earning first place all around at  the USAG Region 3 Level 8 championship in the Junior C division. Her  commitment and dedication to her sport have been shown through her  recent success at the competition. It can't be easy being a full-time  gymnast and remaining a straight-A student, but her work ethic is  ensuring her bright future.   I commend Dale Linebaugh for his receipt of the Anderson County  Sheriff's Office Life-Saving Award and his immediate response to help  those in need.   I congratulate David Joseph on earning the Earhart Award with the  Civil Air Patrol. All of his hard work and dedication are a reflection  of this prestigious award. I commend David on all of his achievements  thus far in the Civil Air Patrol, 4-H, and archery.   I congratulate Dylan Starkey on having his book ``Powers'' published.  It is always exciting to hear about the talented young students in our  community that commit time and dedication to leaving a positive impact  on their city for many years to come.   I congratulate Eli Bierman on winning the State championship in  wrestling at the 132-weight class. That is an incredible  accomplishment. Eli's hard work, hours of practice, and devotion to his  sport are reflected in his success.   I congratulate Elizabeth Norwood on her livestock entries winning  Supreme Champion Heifer, Reserve Grand Champion Market Steer, and fifth  Overall Market Steer honors at the Arizona National Livestock Show.  That is an incredible achievement, and I think Elizabeth should be  providing beef for our entire Nation with that kind of award.   I congratulate Officer Jack Daniel on beginning his career with the  Hillsboro Police Department as an officer. Our community is very  fortunate to have Officer Daniel take on this role, and the citizens of  Hill County will benefit as he continues to progress in his law  enforcement career.   I congratulate Jerrilyn Bowman on receiving the Anderson County  Sheriff's Office Life-Saving Award. Her quick thinking, training, and  calm reaction saved a life, and that is something she should be proud  of.   I congratulate Julianna Dublin and Julia Burnham on achieving the  Girl Scout Gold Award.   I congratulate Kaden Lyles on earning the General Billy Mitchell  Award for the Civil Air Patrol. All of Kaden's hard work and dedication  are a reflection of this prestigious award. The time and commitment  Kaden has put into this award is truly commendable.   I congratulate Karen Koop on being awarded the Texas Governor  Beauford Jester Award this year by the Texas  [[Page H3104]]  Veterans Day Parade Committee. This honor recognizes Karen's selfless  commitment to community and veterans and will have a lasting impact for  years to come.   I congratulate Karson Tompkins on winning the State championship in  wrestling in the 190-weight class. That is an incredible  accomplishment.   I congratulate Kendyl Wilson on winning first place with her  submission to the Texas Rural Education Association's art contest.   I congratulate Kim Boales on being awarded the James Acree Award this  year by the Texas Veterans Day Parade Committee.   I congratulate Kimberly Cantu and Mansfield ISD on being named to  Forbes' list of America's Best Midsize Employers. Being recognized on a  national level is an amazing accomplishment. I thank Kimberly for her  commitment to Mansfield ISD.   Madam Speaker, I have more folks that I would like to point out, but  I am short on time today. I will leave you with this: We have some  incredible citizens in District Six. I am incredibly proud to serve  them.   Madam Speaker--you also being from Texas--I love my State, and I love  my district as you do, as well. It is a tremendous privilege to be able  to announce these folks on the floor and honor them in the way that  they deserve.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
