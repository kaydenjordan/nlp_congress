 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  service and the sacrifice of our Nation's first responders.   In Pennsylvania and around the entire country, police officers,  firefighters, EMTs, and other emergency personnel are willing to put  their lives on the line each and every day that they report to duty. On  today, National First Responders Day, we thank these men and women and  their families for serving our communities.   As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am committed to  ensuring that first responders are well-equipped to do the job that we  have entrusted them to do. This month it was my privilege to announce  that FEMA, through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, has  awarded nearly $3 million to local fire companies and first responders  in the 13th District of Pennsylvania. These funds will help them to  acquire much-needed equipment and training.   When there is an emergency, we know that our first responders will be  there, and Congress needs to be there for them too.                            ____________________
