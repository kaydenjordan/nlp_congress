 Madam Speaker, on November 12, Medicare announced the  largest part B premium increase in the history of the Medicare program,  14 percent. This could not come at a worse time in terms of, again, the  cost of living that many seniors are facing.   Looking closely at that decision, one of the driving factors was the  projected cost of the drug Aduhelm, which was priced at $56,000 per  year for Alzheimer's patients who were, again, very excited about the  possibility of getting the benefit of that drug. But the cost of that  drug was one of the big driving forces for a 14 percent rate increase.   On December 20, Biogen, the manufacturer, cut the cost of that drug  from $56,000 to $28,000. About 2 weeks ago, Secretary Becerra correctly  instructed the actuaries of Medicare to go back and try and recalculate  the Medicare part B premium to see if there was a way to get some  relief for seniors from that 14 percent rate increase.   Today, 31 Members of the House Democratic Caucus are sending a letter  to Secretary Becerra again applauding his decision and strongly  advocating that Medicare go back in and recalculate that rate increase,  which will provide tremendous assistance for seniors at exactly the  time that they need it.
