 Mr. President, as a Congress ends, it is a tradition for  the Senate to pause for a moment to acknowledge and express our  appreciation for the service of Senators who will not be returning for  the next Congress. Today, I would like to pause in appreciation of the  service of my friend and colleague Senator Dean Heller.   Dean will be leaving the Senate after 30 years of dedicated public  service at both the State and Federal level. During his time in  Congress, he always demonstrated a willingness to consider all  viewpoints, while remaining true to the principles that guided his  career in public service. It is safe to say that Dean's commitment to  Nevada is as strong as ever, and his unique perspective in areas  critical to his State will surely be missed in the next Congress.   Growing up in Carson City, NV, Dean earned a bachelor of business  administration from the University of Southern California in 1985.  After working as a stockbroker in California, Dean moved back to Nevada  and brought the skills he gained in the business realm to the public  sector when he became the deputy State treasurer for Nevada.   Learning about Dean's time as a Nevada assemblyman was something I  appreciated because of my time in the Wyoming Legislature. Dean's hard  work led him to become Nevada's secretary of State for 11 years, then  to the House of Representatives in 2006, and finally he joined the  Senate in 2012.   His background in both the financial sector and public service was  invaluable as a colleague on the Senate Finance Committee. As a former  small business owner, I appreciated his expertise and business acumen  as the committee considered complex and important issues like tax  reform. Dean's insightful perspectives and willingness to work with  people on different sides on key issues will surely be missed by the  committee moving forward.   It was a pleasure to work with a Senator representing a State that  shares so much with Wyoming. From the prominence of public lands, to  welcoming visitors year-round to world class destinations, Nevada and  Wyoming's similarities afforded us the opportunity to collaborate on  key issues important to the people of both States.   Dean's dedication to Nevada ensured he was a strong voice for the  people who lived there. I am sure he will continue to use that voice to  help others.   Diana joins in sending our best wishes and appreciation to Dean, his  wife Lynne, and his four children for his dedication to this country  and the State of Nevada. His effect on the Senate was profound, and he  certainly made a difference. We will always appreciate his service to  the Senate and wish him the very best in whatever the future holds.                            ____________________     Mr. President, at the end of each session of Congress, it  is a tradition for the Senate to pause for a moment to acknowledge and  express our appreciation for the service of each Senator who will not  be returning in the next Congress. With that in mind, I would like to  take a moment to express my gratitude to U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp of  North Dakota.   During the past 6 years, those of us who had a chance to come to know  and work with Senator Heitkamp have been impressed with her dedication  to the people of her home State, her involvement with tax issues, and  her willingness to work with members on both sides of the aisle to find  solutions to the problems and concerns of the people of North Dakota.   I share a connection with Senator Heitkamp, who is a Senator from a  smaller rural State. Because of this shared background, we have had the  opportunity to work on various issues. But beyond our work together, I  have enjoyed knowing Senator Heitkamp. Heidi is a remarkable person.  She is the first female Senator elected from North Dakota and a  survivor of breast cancer. She would feel comfortable in my home State  of Wyoming, the Equality State, where we know what it is like to have  women trailblazers. She may be leaving us after this Congress, but she  does so knowing that during her time she has made a significant  difference in the lives of North Dakotans and in our country.  [[Page S7233]]    She joined the U.S. Senate in 2013 and has served in a Congress often  divided by partisan views. She has been willing to work with President  Trump and to work across the aisle on many issues, all for the good of  the people of North Dakota. I have been one of those she has worked  with, and I am happy to call her a friend.   The accomplishments that brought her to the Senate are substantial.  Before serving in the U.S. Senate, Senator Heitkamp served as North  Dakota's tax commissioner and, later, attorney general.   I have had the privilege of working with Senator Heitkamp on many  issues. Notably, we worked together on an issue that has long been  important to Wyoming, forging parity between brick-and-mortar stores  and e-commerce. During her time as tax commissioner, North Dakota  sought to make an out-of-State mail order retailer, which had no  physical presence in the State, collect and pay use taxes on sales into  the State. After entering Congress, Heidi cosponsored my bill, the  Marketplace Fairness Act, seeking to level the playing field for brick- and-mortar retail stores and out-of-State online sellers. Later, we  worked on amicus briefs with several of our colleagues, and our efforts  to create this level playing fields went all the way to the Supreme  Court in the case South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., a case in which the  U.S. Supreme Court sided with our position. These efforts have been  such an important part of my time in the Senate, and I thank Senator  Heitkamp for her work on this issue.   Heidi has consistently and tirelessly fought for the people of North  Dakota. She has worked in the best interests of small businesses and  contributed in a significant way to culture of the Senate and the  Nation as a whole.   If her past is any indication of her future, I think it is clear that  she will be closing the door on this great chapter of her life and  moving on to something new. Whatever that may prove to be I am certain  it will make good use of her abilities, background, and experience.   My best wishes to Heidi, her husband Darwin, and their children as  they enter the next chapter in their lives. I thank her for her  willingness to serve the people of North Dakota and the people of the  United States. There are countless ways of saying farewell, one of my  favorites is: Happy Trails. Until we meet again.                            ____________________
