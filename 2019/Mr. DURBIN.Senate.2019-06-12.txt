 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I listened carefully this morning to  Senator McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, who came to the  floor to speak to the issue of the border crisis which we now face. I  acknowledge, as everyone should, that we are facing an unprecedented  number of people who are presenting themselves at our southern border  from primarily three countries--El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.   These people who are presenting themselves, for the most part, are  not trying to sneak across our borders; they are literally coming up  and presenting themselves--identifying themselves--to the first person  they find in a uniform. The reason is they want to apply for asylum in  the United States. They want to make the argument that they have  credible fears that might entitle them to be considered as asylees in  this country, which is a legal classification.   After they state that they seek that status, they are taken into our  system. They then, ultimately, go through a hearing process, but that  hearing process is not done quickly. In fact, it can take months and  sometimes years before the actual hearings take place. Because we are  seeing so many people coming--especially young children who are  accompanied by their parents or who are even on their own--it has  created a special challenge for our border authorities.   I was down in El Paso just a few weeks ago. I met with the Border  Patrol agents and the Customs and Border Protection agents, and we  talked about the challenges they face. In my mind, there is no question  that the numbers have overwhelmed the system to the point at which  there are things happening down there that are absolutely unacceptable  by American standards. I will give you an example.   Those who present themselves at the border are processed and put into  detention cells, but these detention cells are not large enough to  accommodate the number of people who come to our border. In El Paso,  there was a cell that had a plate glass window on the outside so one  could see everyone inside. Above the door of that cell was a sign that  read ``Capacity: 35.'' I counted the number of people in that cell on  the day I visited. There were 150 who were jammed shoulder to shoulder  inside the cell. About 20 of them, maybe 30, had an opportunity to sit  on benches along the perimeter, but for the most part, they stood. They  stood all day. They were fed their meals while they stood up, and I  have no idea how they possibly worked out their sleeping arrangements.  There was just no room for all of them to lie down on the floor at any  given time, and there was one toilet in that room for 150 people. I  learned afterward that the number in that cell increased shortly  thereafter to 200. Next to it was a cell for women--capacity 16. Inside  that cell, I counted 75 women, including women with nursing babies.   We now have press reports that state, because of the desperate  situation these detainees face, there have been attempted suicides.  This is in the United States of America. This is a situation we need to  address. I couldn't agree more with the Republican leader from Kentucky  that we need humanitarian assistance quickly to provide temporary  housing or whatever is necessary so that there will be humane treatment  of those who have been detained at our borders until they are processed  through our legal system.   I might say, although the Republican leader came to the floor to  blame the Democrats for not coming up with more money in a timely  fashion, it was just this February when we joined, on a bipartisan  basis, in voting for $400 million more for humanitarian assistance at  the border. There has been no resistance from this Senator or from this  side of the aisle when it has come to humanitarian assistance in  addressing the issues that have been before us.   We remember--and it was not that long ago--the Trump administration's  policy that was called zero tolerance. Do you remember? Certainly, I  do. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that we were then going to  have a policy of treating as criminals those who came across the  border.    Now, understand what I mentioned earlier. You present yourself at our  border for the purpose of seeking asylee status so that you will not be  considered a criminal when you present yourself, which is perfectly  within our legal system. Rather, Jeff Sessions said, if you come to our  border and do not have legal status in the United States, you shall be  treated as a criminal. In his having said that, there was a problem. It  meant that they separated the children from their parents because,  under Sessions' zero-tolerance policy, the parents were presumed to  have been engaged in criminal conduct.   The result was awful. There were 2,880 infants, toddlers, and  children who were separated from their parents at the border under the  zero-tolerance policy. Yet there was a swift public reaction against  it, and court cases were filed to stop this policy. In one of the few  times since he was elected President, this President came forward and  said he was wrong--that this policy was not good and that he was going  to end it.   The problem was, in his having separated those children, our  government has not kept track of where their parents have gone and how  we might possibly reunite them in the future. It took a Federal judge  in Southern California to come forward and mandate that our agencies of  government find those children and reunite them with their parents.   We didn't accomplish it completely. Overwhelmingly, it took weeks and  months for us to put them together because no one thought to keep track  of where the parents were headed and where their children were headed.  Eventually, we put it together for all but, say, 100, I think--the  final number of children for whom we just couldn't find their families  and parents.   That was a horrible situation, but it is a reminder to us today as we  reflect on what is going on at the border. For goodness' sake, we  should all demand the humane treatment of people at our border,  particularly of the children. Six children who came to our border died  while they sought this asylum status. That is unacceptable.   In fairness to the Department of Homeland Security and to all of  those involved in it, I don't believe for a second that they  consciously allowed this to happen, but we did not provide the kind of  medical assistance that might have ordinarily been provided in these  circumstances. We are told that this is changing for the better, and I  salute and applaud the efforts to reach that.   When it comes to the humanitarian assistance that Senator McConnell  [[Page S3332]]  spoke about on the floor this morning, I could not agree with him more.  We need to put the resources in place. There are serious differences of  opinion about the policy at the border--of the so-called Flores consent  decree and the TVPRA legislation. There is also no common agreement  between the parties in the House and Senate on that policy's language.  I am not sure we will reach an agreement when it comes to some  fundamental questions about how long you can hold a child in detention,  for example. In the Flores decision--and this was a consent decree  entered into by our government--we say that you can't detain a child  for more than 20 days. The proposal now is 100 days.   Let me ask an obvious question. As a father and as a grandfather,  what impact does it have in one's holding a child in detention for 100  days? Imagine, if you will, all of the possible circumstances of these  kids in their having come to the border, what they have been through to  reach this point, and what we then do in response. I think we need to  be very sensitive to the reality that children are often harmed in ways  we can't even imagine by things that happen so early in their lives.  The notion of a longer detention needs to be carefully scrutinized to  make sure we are never doing anything at the expense of these children  and their long-term development.   I wanted to raise another issue too. While I agree with Senator  McConnell when it comes to the humanitarian treatment of children and  young people and others, too, at the same time, we are in a  circumstance now where the President of the United States, in September  of 2017, eliminated a program called the DACA Program.   I know a little bit about this because 18 years ago I introduced a  bill called the DREAM Act, and the DREAM Act said that if you were  brought to the United States as a child, where you didn't have any  conscious part of the decision to come to this country, and you grew up  in this country, went to school, did not have a criminal record, and  went through a basic background test, then, you ought to be able to be  allowed to stay in the United States and ultimately achieve legal  status. That is the DREAM Act. We haven't passed it or enacted it into  law, though I have tried many, many times. But we did prevail on  President Obama to create the DACA Program so that these young people  can step forward, pay a fee, go through a background check, be finger- printed, make certain that they were no threat to the United States,  and be allowed to stay in this country for 2 years at a time without  fear of deportation and be allowed to work.   Ultimately, 790,000 of these young people came forward. I have told  their stories on the floor of the Senate many, many times. They are  incredible young people who simply want a chance to be a part of the  country--the only country they have ever known.   President Trump decided to abolish the DACA Program, leaving these  190,000 people in a precarious situation in terms of their legal rights  and their future.   Fortunately for them, the Federal Court stepped in and said that the  President needed to justify eliminating this program. While we are  going through the argument in court, they will be protected--790,000  will be protected. No new ones have been allowed to sign up.   I see that my friend from New York is here, and I just wish, if I  can, to make a statement about one of these Dreamers and then yield the  floor to him. I am certain that he has some important things to say.   But I would like to, if I can--he helps me with my signs when he  comes to the floor. I thank Senator Schumer.   I produced on the floor more than 100 of these colored photographs of  these Dreamers to tell their story. This is Pratishtha Khanna, the  117th Dreamer I have spoken about on the floor of the Senate. She was  brought to the United States from India at the age of 10, and she grew  up in Laurel, MD. Her parents were university graduates with  professional degrees. They both worked long hours in blue collar jobs  for less than minimum wage with no time off.   Pratishtha said:         My parents believed in the hallmarks of American values:       Work hard and you can achieve anything. They encouraged me to       study hard and be the best I can be.    This is exactly what this young lady did. She was an excellent  student who was placed in the gifted and talented program, and she was  a peer mentor who tutored fellow students in math. In high school,  Pratishtha earned college credits in an advanced placement class, was a  member of the color guard, and served as treasurer and vice president  of the student government association.   In 2009 she graduated from high school with honors. She attended her  local community college. Because of her undocumented immigration  status, she was not eligible for financial aid and had to pay  international student tuition. She cleaned homes and tutored high  school students to help pay the tuition. She volunteered at a local  infectious disease laboratory. She graduated with an associate's degree  in biology.   Then, on June 15, 2012, President Obama announced DACA, the program I  mentioned earlier, which was abolished by President Trump.   Pratishtha says:         [It was] a monumental day for my family. For the first time       in many years, my family sat together to eat dinner. I saw       tears stream down my father's face. He talked about       everything my brother and I could achieve with the basic       scraps of dignity given us by DACA. The stress and despair in       his eyes was replaced with energy and hope.    In May 2014 Pratishtha graduated with honors with a bachelor's degree  in biological sciences from the University of Maryland, Baltimore  County. Following graduation, she worked as a scribe in the emergency  department at Baltimore Washington Hospital Center. She kept studying,  obtaining a nursing assistant and patient care technician  certification. She then obtained a position at the medical intensive  care unit at Johns Hopkins, while she continued working in the  emergency department at Baltimore Washington Medical Center.   Her father passed away in November of 2015, just a few years after  she was given DACA status. Through long night shifts in the ICU and the  5 a.m. shifts in the emergency department, Pratishtha had become the  family's breadwinner.   She is now studying for a master of science in biomedical science at  Western University of Health Sciences, in Pomona, CA. Her dream is to  become a doctor.   She wrote me a letter, and she said:         America is my home. My father's ashes will lay to rest       here. I don't have another home. As assaults on immigrants       and democracy run rampant, the world looks to Congress for       leadership and justice.    The eyes of Pratishtha and hundreds of thousands of Dreamers are on  Washington and on the U.S. Senate. Last week the House of  Representatives passed the American Dream and Promise Act in an effort  to save Pratishtha and the hundreds of thousands of others like her. We  want you to be a part of America's future. You are an extraordinary  person. Her life and what she has already given are an indication of  why we need her in America's future. The fact that the Republican  leader would come to the floor and speak about the humanitarian  treatment of young children and overlook the fact that we have a bill  that has been sent to us by the House of Representatives, which would  help 790,000 and more with the American Dream and Promise Act, tells me  that he is not closing in the loop on humanitarianism.   I call on the Republican leader in the Senate: Do not make this a  legislative graveyard. Let's use the power of this Senate to pass the  legislation that passed the House of Representatives and give this  young woman and thousands more just like her an opportunity to be a  part of America's future.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.

I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, it is hard to believe that this week marks  1 year since the Trump administration and Federal Communications  Commission Chairman Pai, chose to reverse the Commission's stance on  net neutrality. What is net neutrality? The principles are simple.  Internet service providers should be required to treat all internet  content and traffic equally. They should not be able to block access to  websites, to reduce the speeds at which consumers browse the internet,  or charge consumers more based on the types of websites they are  visiting.   The Trump administration believes that companies should be able to  freely block or slow down consumers' access to the internet in the  interest of higher profits. My Democratic colleagues and I believe that  all content should be treated equally, and corporate financial  interests should not be more important than protecting American  consumers.   The fact is that most Americans agree with us. The decision to  rollback net neutrality was unpopular a year ago, and it remains  unpopular today. In March of 2019, a poll conducted by tech research  firm, Comparitech, found that four in five Americans support net  neutrality.   Make no mistake, at times, it seems like we are living in one of the  most partisan times in our Nation's history, but on the topic of net  neutrality, 86 percent of Democrats, 79 percent of Independents, and 77  percent of Republicans support protecting a free and open internet for  American consumers.   Now more than ever, constituents are engaging with the issues of the  day and are willing to let their elected officials know their views on  what is important to them. I can tell you that, of the physical mail  and emails my office receives, net neutrality has been one of the most  important issues to Illinoisans. Since January 20, 2017, my office has  received almost 200,000 letters on the topic of net neutrality, and by  a mile, constituents are in support of the principles of net neutrality  and want to reverse the action taken by the FCC.   I have got news for you: the Members of the House have heard their  constituents loud and clear. Two months ago, the House passed the Save  the Internet Act that would reaffirm the government's commitment to net  neutrality and prevent major corporations from slowing down, blocking  access to, or charging more for certain websites. When this bill  arrived in the Senate, what have we chosen to do? A measure containing  principles that 77 percent of Republicans support and received  bipartisan support last Congress? Not a thing.    Leader McConnell and Republicans have instead proceeded to turn the  Senate into a legislative graveyard. They have prioritized doling out  lifetime appointments to our Federal courts while refusing to take  action on many of our Nation's pressing most issues, including  demonstrating a commitment to upholding a free and open internet.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
