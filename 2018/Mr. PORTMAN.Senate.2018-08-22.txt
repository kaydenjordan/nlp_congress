 Mr. President, today I want to talk about a huge  responsibility we have here in the Senate and a great opportunity that  lies before us. The Senate is asked to confirm nominees both for  executive branch appointments and for judicial branch appointments. We  have heard a lot of great debate here on the Senate floor over the past  1\1/2\ years on some of these nominees. We were able to confirm Justice  Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, who I believe is doing a superb job.  That was quite a debate here. In the meantime, we have been able to  confirm a number of circuit court judges, some district court judges,  and executive branch appointments.   That is all important, but once again, we are asked to do something  that is perhaps our most important task, and that is to fill yet  another opening on the U.S. Supreme Court. There are only nine of these  Justices, and this is a lifetime appointment. What the district court  and circuit court do--it all comes up to this one Court. Our Founders  created this Court in order to have a place where people could get a  fair hearing and where we could have a dispassionate look at whether  what we pass here fits within the Constitution and whether laws are  being properly interpreted. These are hard and tough issues, and we  want the right people there to do it. Once again, because of an opening  that has occurred on the Supreme Court, we have the opportunity and  responsibility to step up as a body and do that.   In this case, we are asked to fill the seat of Justice Kennedy, who  is viewed by many as being an important player in the Court because he  was often the swing vote. He is a thoughtful guy. I think we are very  fortunate in that one of Justice Kennedy's law clerks has been  nominated by the President and has agreed to step forward for this  confirmation process to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court  and to fill that ninth spot. My hope is that this can be done in a way  where we have honest and spirited but fact-driven debate on the floor  of the Senate.   I have to tell you that I am probably a little biased in this case  because I know this nominee personally. I think a lot of him, not just  as a judge, where he has an amazing record on the second highest court  in the land, but also as a person.   This is the third time I have come to the Senate floor to talk about  him because I feel so strongly and I want to be sure that he gets a  fair shake. I think that as the American people get to know him better,  he will see a lot of support around the country for his confirmation  because people will see that he is the kind of person they would want  to have representing them, their family, and their children on the  Supreme Court.   I worked with him in the George W. Bush White House. He had a job  there, which we will talk about in a second, called Staff Secretary,  which is a job where you are responsible for being the traffic cop,  basically, for the Oval Office. The documents that go into the Oval  Office and go out of the Oval Office go through that office. It is not  a substantive job in that sense, but it is an important job to the  President to have somebody he trusts to decide what he looks at, what  he doesn't look at, and how this material is then distributed out.   He is someone who became close to President George W. Bush. President  George W. Bush, as he has said many times publicly and to me and others  privately, thinks the world of him. He got to know him very well.   So I know Brett Kavanaugh more as a person, as a friend, as a father,  and as a husband, but his legal background is incredibly impressive. I  don't think anybody is better qualified to serve on the Supreme Court  based on his legal background and his judicial philosophy. I know some  of my colleagues have now met with him, as well.   I am told that as of yesterday, 49 of the 51 Republicans who are here  in the Senate have now met with Judge Kavanaugh. I am glad to hear  that. By the way, the reactions have been very positive. I talked to  most of my colleagues about their meetings with him, and a number of  them have gone out of their way to speak publicly about how impressed  they were with him, his demeanor, his background, and his character.   I am also pleased to hear that several of my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle have now met with Judge Kavanaugh, as well. I think  that is really important. I know that this is a partisan town these  days, and it is tough to get things done, but in this case, I would  hope that more of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle agree to  sit down with him and talk to him. I think he needs to have the ability  to talk one-on-one to some people who perhaps don't know him well,  based on some of the comments I have seen about him. I think he could  put some of their concerns to rest.   For some, that may not be possible. They may have philosophical  differences with his approach to the law. I get that, but I hope they  will take the opportunity to sit down with him and talk to him. The  Supreme Court is going to be faced with a lot of tough issues, and this  needs to be a serious consideration. I am pleased that we are taking it  seriously.  [[Page S5814]]    Some have said that this is going too fast. I will tell you that the  amount of time between when he was nominated and when his hearing will  be--which is scheduled now for the week of September 4--is more time  than elapsed during the previous few Supreme Court nominations--Justice  Kagan, Justice Sotomayor, and Neil Gorsuch, about whom I talked a  minute ago. There has been adequate time here relative to other  confirmations.   Second, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are  saying they want more documents to review his nomination. I would just  make this point: More documents have been produced with regard to Judge  Kavanaugh than any other Supreme Court nomination in history. That is  what I am told by the Judiciary Committee. Some Democrats have  suggested they need to review the literally millions of documents that  passed through his office and passed through his desk when he held the  job we talked about earlier as Staff Secretary for President George W.  Bush.   Again, this is a job that is sort of like the traffic cop. It is not  to be substantively giving the President the documents from an agency,  department, or other White House policy office, but rather to provide  the documents to the President in a timely way to be sure the President  is seeing the right documents and to be sure there is coordination. It  is the flow of the documents.   So I think seeing all those documents are not relevant, frankly, to  the confirmation process because they don't relate to him. What they do  relate to, obviously, are a lot of things that have to do with  President George W. Bush, which I am sure were very personal documents  where the President would write in the margin and so on. That would be  interesting for people to look at. People could probably write a book  about those things. That is not the purpose here. And that is why I  think it is a fishing expedition to say: Let's see millions  of documents that passed through this guy's desk, particularly in the  context of a confirmation where more documents are being provided than  any previous confirmation.    I was told by the Judiciary Committee this morning that 430,000 pages  of documents are being produced. I don't know how many of my colleagues  are going to read through 430,000 pages of documents, but they are free  to do so. By the way, this compares to 170,000 pages of documents that  were produced with regard to former Solicitor General Elena Kagan's  confirmation. Think about that: 430,000 versus 170,000.   Elena Kagan also served as a senior aide in the White House. She  worked for President Clinton. She had a senior position there--a  substantive position, actually--in domestic policy. She also, of  course, was the Solicitor General of the United States--yet 430,000  versus 170,000. I just hope people keep that in mind when they hear  about the documents.   What is really relevant to me is what he has done as a judge. He has  spent 12 years on the DC Circuit Court, which is viewed by most as  being the second highest court in the land. He has a lot of documents  that are related to that. He has authored more than 300 published  opinions. Clearly, these opinions are relevant. By the way, more than a  dozen of his opinions on the Circuit Court have been endorsed by the  Supreme Court, which is an unusually high number and a testament to his  outstanding judicial record.   In addition to the more than 10,000 pages of published opinions he  authored or joined, out of the 430,000 pages of documents I mentioned,  the Judiciary Committee tells me they have released more than 176,000  pages of appropriate documents from Judge Kavanaugh's time in the  executive branch. So there are plenty of documents to look at. I  encourage my colleagues to do so.   As I said earlier, based on the traditions that we have here and on  the amount of time spent between nomination and confirmation and based  on the number of documents that have been produced, I think it has been  an appropriate and transparent process. I am glad Chairman Grassley has  made it so.   My hope is that from his time on the bench and his time in the  executive branch, both of these documents will be reviewed--the  appropriate ones.   Brett Kavanaugh is very well respected as a judge. He is the thought  leader among his peers. I am sure you have heard a lot about that.  There have been op-eds written about him from Democrats and Republicans  alike saying: I know the guy. I clerked with the guy. I worked with the  guy. I was one of his students. He is smart. He is thoughtful.   He has said very clearly that he will be guided by the Constitution  and the rule of law. He understands that the proper role of the Court  is not to legislate from the bench. He has respect for precedent. He  actually wrote the book, meaning he is one of the coeditors of this  book looking at legal precedent and what they call stare decisis. He is  someone who is very much in the mainstream of legal thought and very  well regarded.   His former colleagues, his current colleagues, his former students,  and legal experts on both sides of the aisle have come out to say this  about him. I think he has exactly the right qualifications, extensive  experience, and a judicial philosophy that most Americans agree with  and would want in a judge.   Again, as important as that is to me, he is also a good person. He is  compassionate. He is humble. He is someone who has a big heart. Maybe,  most importantly, he has the humility to be able to listen, to hear  people out. As I said earlier, there is no more important a quality in  a Supreme Court Justice given the incredibly important issues they have  before them.   So, as his confirmation process continues, I hope my colleagues and  the American people will get to know the Brett Kavanaugh that I know. I  hope he is soon able to continue his lifetime of distinguished service  as a member of the highest Court in the land. I am proud to strongly  support his nomination for this important position.
