 Madam President, the crisis on our southern border  continues to escalate. CBP is tracking the largest surge in migrant  apprehensions in 20 years. Unaccompanied children are literally piling  up in close quarters. It turns out when politicians spend a 2-year  campaign advertising amnesty, people actually listen. As one senior CBP  official said, there is ``no end in sight.'' No end in sight.   The administration still refuses to even admit there is a crisis,  much less address it. We keep hearing strange mixed messaging from the  White House  [[Page S1793]]  podium like ``now is not the time to come,'' as if there will be a good  time to break the law and come illegally, and the White House will let  us all know when that time is, I assume.   The Washington Post put it gently: ``Administration officials have  been plagued by muddled messaging.'' Boy, that is an understatement.  But actually, when you look at Democrats' actions, the message isn't  mixed at all. That is the problem. For months on the campaign trail,  President Biden spoke directly to potential migrants. At one point, he  said, ``You want to flee . . . you should come.'' That was President  Biden.   President Lopez Obrador of Mexico himself stated this week that  President Biden's campaign created expectations that ``caused Central  American migrants, and also from our country, wanting to cross the  border, thinking that it is easier to do so.'' That was the President  of Mexico.   On Inauguration Day, the President followed through--five Executive  orders to roll back immigration enforcement and open up the border. The  administration wasted no time rolling back the policies from the prior  administration that had guarded against this exact outcome. South of  the border, message received. Some migrants are arriving with Biden  campaign flags and T-shirts. One arriving person said, ``Biden promised  us that everything was going to change.''   So what about the Democrats here in Congress? Are the House Democrats  rising to the occasion with solutions? Well, not exactly. They  prioritized passing another amnesty bill. They doubled down on the  wrong direction and the wrong incentives.   The situation is raising eyebrows among Democrats' own rank and file.  As one Texas Democrat put it, ``When you create a system that  incentivizes people to come across . . . that immediately sends a  message.''   Here, in the Senate, our Democratic colleagues decided to go the  route of obstruction. Yesterday, Republicans tried to pass serious  proposals to help address parts of the immigration system. Democrats  rejected every single one of them.   Senator Ernst had a proposal to require detention for migrants  charged with violent crimes. It is not exactly a radical idea.  Democrats blocked it.   Senator Cruz had legislation to raise the stakes for repeated illegal  entry. It is not exactly rocket science. Democrats blocked that one  too.   Senator Blackburn and Senator Lee tried to combat child trafficking  within the asylum process, and Democrats even blocked that.   The furthest left ideology on these issues is keeping Washington  Democrats from upholding the basic responsibility of government:  ensuring the integrity of our borders and protecting our national  security.                              Election Security    Madam President, now, on another matter. Yesterday, the Rules  Committee held a hearing on the Democrats' proposal to tilt our entire  political system on a partisan basis. It would forcibly rewrite every  State's election laws in ways that defy common sense and are deeply  unpopular with American voters.   It would mandate nearly unrestricted same-day registration. It would  mandate big loopholes that would render voter ID almost meaningless. It  would make every State legalize ballot harvesting, where paid  operatives can turn up carrying big piles of ballots with other  people's names on them, zero chain of custody.   Democrats want to hide behind the mantle of voting rights. What they  are really proposing is less security, less integrity, and a grab bag  of changes that are deeply, deeply unpopular. Just look at the other  changes with zero relationship to voting rights that Democrats want to  smuggle in behind that smokescreen.   This bill would take the Federal Election Commission from an evenly  split, bipartisan panel to a partisan body so that Democrats could rule  unilaterally over politics as well as citizens' speech, turn the  neutral judge into a partisan prosecutor, and it would send taxpayers'  money to fund political campaigns.   It contains a massive attack on the privacy of citizens who engage in  free speech, a massive and intentional gift to cancel culture. That led  even the leftwing ACLU to oppose this bill 2 years ago and lead senior  ACLU lawyers to torch it again in the Washington Post just recently.   Democrats are desperate to avoid talking about any of these things.  They are desperate to convince the media that a partisan takeover at  the FEC, socialism for political ad makers, and an assault on free  speech and Americans' privacy are just ``voting rights,'' a shameless,  shameless bait and switch.   I noticed something funny yesterday. Remember, this is the same bill  Democrats were shopping around 2 years ago in response to the 2016  election, which they said was a disaster. Now, 2 years ago, Democrats  were marketing this bill as a massive shakeup that our broken elections  badly needed.   Our democracy was in shambles after they lost in 2016. It was broken,  they said. It was insecure, they said, and only this sweeping  transformation could possibly repair it. Of course, it didn't pass, and  the 2020 election came and went without the liberal takeover, and yet  Democrats say it was a huge success.   Democrats said the 2020 election was beyond reproach. They said the  integrity and security were beyond question. They have said only  conspiracy theorists would complain about the last election.   Oh, but curiously enough, they are now still pushing this very same  bill. Now, instead of a sweeping transformation, they are trying to say  it would just preserve our smoothly functioning system so State  legislatures can't mess it up.   So let's get this straight. Two years ago, in 2019, Democrats  suggested this bill was a bold, radical overhaul for a broken system.  In the meantime, what happened was, they got an election they liked,  and now they claim the exact same legislation just does a few modest  things to protect our system just the way it is.   What utter nonsense--utter nonsense. This legislation has but one  goal, just one. It has only ever had one goal, just one. That goal was  the same in 2019 as it is today. And that goal is to let Washington  Democrats rig the rules of democracy from top down to hide that  partisan project behind the smokescreen, the smokescreen of voting  rights.                          Business Before the Senate    Madam President, now one final matter. Senators will soon head home  for the State work period. We will be seeing an Easter recess of  optimism and hope as the tide of the pandemic continues to turn. Thanks  to science and fueled by five bipartisan bills we passed last year,  vaccines were developed, approved, and preordered in record time.  America was delivering more than a million doses per day before the  current administration even took office.   And because of last year's bipartisan work, our economy was already  poised for a historic comeback. I am also going to be talking with  Kentuckians about their confusion and concern surrounding the  multitrillion-dollar partisan spending plan that Democrats just rushed  through Congress recently, like why teachers unions got huge sums for  schools, much of which won't be spent until years, years into the  future, without any meaningful requirement to reopen, even though  science says it is safe. There are concerns like why Kentucky and other  States whose budgets have come through the crisis intact will actually  be subsidizing massive bailouts to other States for mismanagement that  predates the pandemic, and confusion and concern about the radical,  last-minute provision that tries to prevent States from implementing  any policy, any policy that might be interpreted as a tax cut.   That one could wreak havoc on the plans of local officials in my  State and entire industries as they try to get the Bluegrass growing  again. This provision has the potential to shoot down a State law  designed to help the Commonwealth's small businesses deduct PPP  expenses from their State taxes and unwind planned waivers of hikes on  their unemployment taxes.   Secretary Yellen was asked about this huge uncertainty in a hearing  yesterday, about how this will be defined or enforced. She essentially  had no answers.   So I will be joining Kentuckians to celebrate what has gone well,  thanks to our bipartisan work just last year; to hear their concerns  about all the  [[Page S1794]]  consequences of the Democrats' go-it-alone effort; and to hear what  they think about the multimillion-dollar cousin of the Green New Deal  that Democrats are reportedly planning for a sequel.
