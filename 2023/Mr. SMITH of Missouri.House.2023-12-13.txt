 Mr. Speaker, President Biden has hidden from  the American people his knowledge of and role in his family's overseas  business dealings.   Even in the face of overwhelming evidence, showing his knowledge and  involvement, President Biden still refuses to come clean. So far, two  key DOJ witnesses have failed to show for congressionally subpoenaed  depositions after DOJ directed them not to appear. Other witnesses have  refused to answer certain questions from investigators and the Biden  administration has refused to turn over many of the documents requested  by Congress, claiming this inquiry was not properly authorized.   Let there be no mistake: Today's vote asserts Congress' authority to  conduct an impeachment inquiry and gather all the evidence to proceed  with our investigation.   The American people deserve answers.   Here is what we know so far: The existence of multiple email aliases  suggest that Joe Biden was deliberately trying to conceal his  activities from the public, including one-on-one communications with a  key Hunter Biden business partner during his Vice Presidency.   We also learned that investigators were blocked from looking into  potential campaign finance crimes by the Biden campaign. Hunter Biden  had only known Kevin Morris, a Democrat donor, for 2 months before  Morris started settling his tax debts to the tune of about $2 million  and then spent about $3 million more to cover Hunter's lifestyle.   In the midst of the 2020 campaign, just weeks before Super Tuesday  primary elections that would decide the future of Joe Biden's  candidacy, Morris emailed Hunter Biden's business associates and there  was ``considerable risk personally and politically'' to not filing his  late taxes, but the only person who faced political risk was Joe Biden,  whose campaign the whistleblowers had reason to believe Morris was  speaking to.   As Members of Congress, we have to abide by campaign finance limits  and so must the President. Morris' millions in payments to cover Hunter  Biden's taxes and other financial obligations appeared to the  whistleblowers to be an illegal donation to the Biden campaign.   Unfortunately, they were blocked from investigating further. Time and  again, when investigators found a lead that pointed to Joe Biden, DOJ  stepped in and prevented them from pursuing it.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, thanks to the evidence released  by the whistleblowers, the DOJ indicted Hunter Biden on nine tax  charges, including three felonies. Everything the whistleblowers told  us about the Hunter Biden tax case has been proven  [[Page H6883]]  right. I am convinced they are also right about the links to Joe Biden  they were prevented from following.   Mr. Speaker, Congress owes it to the American people to follow the  facts wherever they lead and pass this resolution.
