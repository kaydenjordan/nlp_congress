 Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be on the floor today  with the chair of our EPW Committee and with my friend from Arkansas,  Senator Boozman.   I am going to speak again about another example of the bipartisan  work of our EPW Committee, where we have had accomplishments that are  real, practical, and positive and result in good change for our  country. On the EPW Committee, we have a history of working together,  of crafting legislation together, and of getting good policy going.  Sometimes it is not easy, but we have been able to do it.   The cornerstone of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which  made needed investments in our Nation's core infrastructure, was  written and passed out of EPW. With the Water Resources Development  Act, it was the same thing. It supports the work of the U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers on projects across this country. It was passed out of our  EPW Committee unanimously, and it eventually became law.   Today, Chairman Carper, Senator Boozman, and I are reintroducing two  pieces of legislation that had been previously approved by EPW and the  Senate unanimously--both the committee and the full Senate--to tackle  another issue in a bipartisan way, which is access to recycling in  America.   Not only is recycling something that we have found people really want  to do, but it is great for the environment, and it is good for  business. It supports over 1 million jobs and generates billions of  dollars in economic output every year. But in order to grow these  numbers, we need to ensure people who want to participate really can,  particularly those in rural and underserved areas, such as areas of my  State, so that they can do so.   Mr. President, the first bill we are reintroducing today, the  Recycling Infrastructure and Accessibility Act, addresses challenges  when it comes to recycling for many of our smaller cities and towns.   In the one I live in, we have sort of stopped and started on  recycling. Recycling services, including curbside recycling, are just  simply not available. These rural areas share common barriers to  accessibility: location and proximity to material recovery facilities  and the size and density of the population. This is just not available.  This has led to low processing yields and high costs in collection and  transportation costs, making it difficult for material recovery  facilities to operate at a profit.   Our legislation would establish a pilot recycling program to ensure  places like West Virginia, Arkansas, Wyoming, or Alaska aren't being  left behind. The pilot program would award grants on a competitive  basis to eligible entities for improving recycling accessibility in a  community or communities within the same geographic area.   Along with improving access to recycling, it is important to fix  important data gaps, as the chairman spoke about, when it comes to  recycling in America. That is the intent of the Recycling and  Composting Accountability Act, which is the other piece of legislation  we are introducing today. It would improve data collection on our  Nation's recycling systems and explore the potential of a national  composting strategy. Not only would this give us a better idea of how  well States are doing through recycling and composting rates, but it  would also help us identify those areas that may be struggling to  sustain and grow proper recycling programs.   These are simple steps we can take, supported by both Republicans and  Democrats, to improve and expand recycling in this country. Americans  in every community--rural and urban, on the coasts or in the  heartland--share a desire to protect our environment. These pieces of  legislation will help make it easier for them to recycle, to contribute  to a healthier planet, and to create jobs along the way.   With Earth Day coming up, it is fitting that we continue our efforts  to expand recycling by reintroducing these bills today, alongside  Chairman Carper and Senator Boozman, and I thank them both for their  work.                                 Drug Crisis    Mr. President, I informed the Senator from Arkansas, but I need to  inform Senator Carper that I am having back-to-back speeches, so I am  going to totally change the topic here real quick before Senator  Boozman talks about recycling. Thank you for letting me move ahead  here.   Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue that is impacting  every State in our Nation, an issue that has the potential to impact  every community, every family, and every person in the Chamber today,  and that is the drug and substance abuse crisis.   My home State of West Virginia knows all too well about the scars  that this crisis has created and the devastating toll that it takes.  West Virginia, unfortunately, continues to lead the Nation in overdose  deaths per capita. It is a sad statistic for us, and although these  deaths have been declining, every single overdose death is one too  many.   In 2020, we lost 1,197 West Virginians to overdoses. Data from our  State health department indicates that over 80 percent of these deaths  included an opioid.   Our State's EMS teams responded to over 9,000 suspected overdose  calls, and there were 6,916 emergency room visits related to overdoses.  These numbers are just staggering and clearly show the continued and  urgent need to address this crisis and the many forms that it comes in.   This is certainly an issue that requires immediate attention from  every level of government and deserves more than just four mentions in  the President's most recent budget proposal.   While I feel the President and his administration lack that sense of  urgency, ending the addiction crisis and taking action to save  countless lives remains one of my top priorities.   Each time I meet with our northern or our southern U.S. attorneys in  West Virginia, the drug crisis is by far the largest topic of  discussion. Their offices see firsthand the amount of illicit drugs  that are entering our State and work around the clock to remove the  threat that these substances create in our communities.   Like I have said in this Chamber before, last October our U.S.  Attorney's Office of the Northern District of West Virginia recovered  approximately 75 pounds of cocaine, 19 pounds of methamphetamine, and  nearly 5 pounds of fentanyl in Wheeling, WV, on one bust.   Investigators found that traffickers had these drugs shipped from the  U.S.-Mexican border to Ohio via tractor-trailer and used cash payments  to people who flew from California to Pittsburgh to move the cash back  and forth. The connection between the crisis at our southern border and  the drug epidemic we are seeing at home does not get any clearer than  that.   In December of last year, the DEA announced nationwide seizures of  over 50.6 million fentanyl pills and more than 10,500 pounds of  fentanyl powder. The DEA estimates that these seizures could represent  379 million potentially deadly overdoses of fentanyl. That is enough  fentanyl to kill every single American. And these are just the drugs  that they found.   With the Border Patrol stretched unfathomably thin, there is no  telling the amount of drugs that are getting through undetected. We  know that these drugs are entering our country through the southern  border, making their way into each and every State and wreaking havoc.   If President Biden would get a little more serious about stopping  this, I think he has to get serious about border security. In a crisis  this urgent, it is time to act.   I have spoken with the DEA administrator about the support they need  and the challenges that they are facing. I have introduced legislation,  led letters, and pushed for initiatives that informed the public of the  dangers of fentanyl getting in the hands of our youth, that strengthen  our investigations on fentanyl trafficking, and that  [[Page S1230]]  prevent fentanyl and synthetic drug shipments from being smuggled into  the United States through the mail.   Currently, we are working on efforts to crack down on and schedule  the illicit drug xylazine, which I understand is also known as  ``tranq.'' If you didn't know by now, xylazine is an easily accessible  veterinarian tranquilizer that is being mixed with opioids, including  fentanyl, increasing the number of fatal overdoses nationwide.   This crisis is ever-changing, which means our approach needs to be  multifaceted as well.   I encourage the President, his administration, and all of our  colleagues right here in the Congress to stay on this effort and stop  the latest modifications before it is too late.   Even in the midst of devastating losses in our State, I have always  been inspired, encouraged, and moved by the efforts of people in West  Virginia to end the drug crisis and help those in our State during the  times when they need it the most. West Virginians continue to be  responsible for the most innovative recovery solutions and prevention  efforts that we have seen.   The opioid crisis has made a personal targeted impact on communities  all across our State, and in turn we have seen success through these  community-based solutions.   I have seen in Martinsburg, WV, with a program that is a police- school-community-health-and-education partnership working to prevent  substance use disorders from ever happening to our youth. By building  strong families and empowering the community, we build resiliency in  children and families to help them overcome this horrible addiction.   I have seen this in Kearneysville, WV, where they are building a  recovery village so that individuals who are struggling with addiction  receive access to family and community they definitely need.   The detailed focus is on housing and workforce development, aspects  of recovery that are absolutely critical.   I have seen drug court programs all across our State, where West  Virginians are building each other up, holding each other accountable,  and giving those who struggle with addiction the chance for a life of  recovery.   You know, West Virginians take care of West Virginians, and there is  no other issue that requires each and every one of us to work together  quite like this one.   So, President Biden, the drug crisis has created a dire situation in  communities not just across my State but across the country. We have no  time to waste. Every day of inaction results in turmoil and devastation  for so many families and loved ones.   We need to secure the southern border; we need to crack down on  illicit drug trafficking and new tactics that criminals are  implementing; and we need to deliver the tools our communities need to  implement Federal programs and develop those community-based solutions  that we know work best. We must do this together. We must do it now.  Countless lives depend on us.   With that, I yield the floor to my colleague from Arkansas, my fellow  recycler, Senator Boozman.                                  Recycling
