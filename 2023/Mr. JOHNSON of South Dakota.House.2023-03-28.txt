 Mr. Chairman, I spent 6 years as a State  energy regulator, and our focus was always on safe, affordable,  reliable energy because we knew that that could power American  prosperity.   Indeed, this abundance of American energy that we have been talking  about can be a huge American competitive advantage in an increasingly  uncertain world. Unfortunately, we have made it so difficult to do big  projects in this country anymore.   If you need a strong piece of evidence, look at President Biden's  unilateral canceling of the Keystone XL pipeline. Unfortunately, that  is not the only piece of evidence.                                time  1730    It takes 5 to 7 years to permit an energy project in this country. It  is an almost uniquely American problem. That same energy project could  get permitted in less than half the time in countries like Canada and  Australia.   H.R. 1, Mr. Chairman, is a huge step in the right direction. It  prevents the constant relitigation of projects and of reviews that have  already been settled. It moves the NEPA process into the 21st century  by making sure that we have got an online permitting portal for  projects. It creates deadlines for NEPA and other environmental  reviews. Imagine that, a shot clock, a deadline, to make sure the  government's work is done on time. Then, Mr. Chairman, it unlocks  American energy by allowing the Department of the Interior to resume  energy leasing and to repeal restrictions on the export and import of  natural gas.   Mr. Chair, the abundance of American energy is a huge American  competitive advantage. H.R. 1 makes that so.
