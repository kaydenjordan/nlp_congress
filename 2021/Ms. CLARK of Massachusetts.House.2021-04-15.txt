 Mr. Speaker, in December, American women  lost 156,000 jobs, accounting for 100 percent of jobs lost; and since  the start of this pandemic, nearly 3 million women have been pushed out  of the workforce.   Women have borne the brunt of the economic crisis brought on by this  pandemic, and gender pay inequality is at the root of the problem. More  than five decades after the passage of the Equal Pay Act, women still  only make 82 cents for every dollar earned by men, and that gap is even  wider for women of color.   By passing the Paycheck Fairness Act today, we are correcting this  injustice and ensuring that all people receive equal pay for equal  work.   Let's be clear: this isn't a women's issue. Pay inequity hurts  children, families, and our entire economy. It is fundamental to our  recovery and our ability to not just rebuild to status quo, but to  rebuild a just and inclusive America for all.
