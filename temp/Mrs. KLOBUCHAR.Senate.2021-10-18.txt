 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Bernard  A. ``Bud'' Barton, Jr. on his retirement from the Library of Congress  and to thank him for nearly three decades of dedicated public service.   Since 2015, Bud has served as chief information officer for the  Library of Congress. As the senior information technology official for  the Library, Bud established and enforced standards for IT resources  and oversaw IT design, development, and service operations to ensure  that the needs of the Library and those it serves were met. Bud oversaw  the development of a Library-wide digital strategy, worked to improve  IT security at the Library, and led efforts to optimize and modernize  the Library's IT infrastructure. Under his leadership, the Library  successfully addressed more than 100 technology recommendations  identified by Congress and the nonpartisan Government Accountability  Office, GAO.   Prior to joining the Library, Bud served as a U.S. Air Force officer,  as deputy chief information officer for the North Carolina National  Guard, and then as chief information officer for the Defense Technical  Information Center. In these latter roles, Bud managed the design,  planning, implementation, and testing of disaster recovery and  continuity of operations capabilities for these agencies.   Mr. Barton leaves the Library a stronger institution that is better  prepared than ever to serve the needs of Congress, researchers, and all  Americans.   Bud, thank you for your public service. We owe you a debt of  gratitude and wish you a well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
