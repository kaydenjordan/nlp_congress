 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me  time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in respectful opposition to this amendment  by my good friend from Pennsylvania.   The Southwest Border Regional Commission encompasses all five of the  counties that I represent in Arizona's Sixth Congressional District, in  addition to 88 other counties in Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, and  California.   While I appreciate the sentiment of this amendment to rein in Federal  funding that I think we can all agree on, cutting funding from the  Commission is not the way to do so. Of the approximately 35 million  people the Commission serves, nearly 5 million live in poverty.   Additionally, of all the regional commissions, the Southwest Border  Regional Commission has the largest population, about 2.4 million  people living in the most severely economically distressed counties.  [[Page H5097]]    These are communities that are dealing with drought, economic  downfall, and overstretched resources as we see record-high levels of  illegal immigration along the southwest border. Many of the people live  in designated health professional shortage areas and lack access to  clean water and also other necessities.   The Southwest Border Regional Commission finally received its first  Federal co-chair just last December. That means that it was just  recently allowed to begin convening and to begin activities. It would  be a shame to reduce funding that is so desperately needed to promote  economic development in our counties along the southwest border.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.
