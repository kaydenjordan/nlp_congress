 Mr. President, I want to thank my friend and colleague       from Florida for joining me today on the floor to talk about a very       important subject which Americans are watching unfold every single day       on their television.        The Biden White House claims we have been doing the work to secure       the border. In fact, some in the administration have said the border is       secure.        With thousands of migrants illegally crossing our southern border       every single day and drug cartels funneling fentanyl into our       communities, the Biden administration's talking points are actually a       bunch of malarkey.        With the Biden administration attempting to do away with title 42--a       policy put in place under the Trump administration to turn away illegal       immigrants--the U.S.-Mexico border is going from crisis to catastrophe.        Our hardworking Border Patrol agents are overwhelmed. They are       exhausted, and they are hurting. They, too, want a break for the       holidays. But, sadly, their Christmas will be spent dealing with the       drug cartels and processing migrants.        Without title 42 in place, Biden administration officials have       estimated that nearly 500,000 illegal immigrants--which is almost 100       times the size of my hometown of Red Oak, IA, could cross our southern       border each month. That is on top of the over 2.2 million Border Patrol       encounters this year, which is half a million more than the previous       year. Even more concerning, 98 of those apprehended were on the       terrorist watch list.        On top of this being a humanitarian and national security disaster,       Biden's open border policies are intensifying our Nation's drug       epidemic. Illicit fentanyl overdoses are now the No. 1 cause of death       among adults ages 18 to 45. This administration has truly turned every       State into a border State.        To make matters worse, the Biden administration is telling States       they don't have a right to secure their own borders. Just last week,       the Biden Justice Department sued Arizona Governor Doug Ducey in an       effort to stop the State from constructing its own border barrier.       Arizona was simply trying to protect Americans from drug smuggling and       human trafficking.        Well, Arizona, since President Biden won't help you, I do have a       solution.        Instead of blocking States from installing much needed safety       precautions, we need to make use of the border wall materials that have       already been bought and paid for by American taxpayers. Some $350       million worth of concrete, steel, and fencing to build the barrier are       just sitting idle, collecting dust and rust, and taxpayers are covering       the costs to babysit these unused materials. This is government waste       at its finest.        So I have a question: Why not let States that want to build a wall       access these already-paid-for materials? Not only would it save money,       it would deter the unprecedented number of border crossings we have       seen as a result of Biden's border policies.        America is and always has been a welcoming nation, but those seeking       a better life here have an obligation to respect our laws, including       our immigration laws, and the President has a sworn duty to enforce       them and to protect the American people.        That is why I am asking the Senate today to pass my Border's Unused       Idle and Lying Dormant Inventory Transfer--or the BUILD IT--Act, which       would turn over the unused materials, which have already been purchased       by taxpayers to construct the southern border barrier, to any State       wishing to finish the job. This bill won't cost a single cent. In fact,       it will prevent government waste, which Washington has in excess. It       will help end the catastrophe occurring along our border and help make       communities across the Nation safer from the threat of violent       criminals and lethal drugs.        Folks, there is no way around it: President Biden's policies are       fostering illegal immigration, creating a national security nightmare,       and impacting the lives of far too many Americans both in Iowa and       across the country, all while costing taxpayers billions of dollars.       Here is a simple solution: Pass the BUILD IT Act, and allow States to       put these materials to use.        I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs be discharged from further consideration of S.       4294 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. I       further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed       and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the       table.         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Evan Carroll,       a military fellow from my office, be granted floor privileges for the       remainder of the Congress.
