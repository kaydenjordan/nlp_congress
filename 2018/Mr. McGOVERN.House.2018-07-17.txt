 Mr. Speaker, as we look toward ways to help our  constituents live healthier lives and address the rising cost of  healthcare, I would like to draw attention to successful partnerships  that are working to address these challenges.   We know that diet-related diseases are driving up healthcare costs.  Research from the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at  Tufts University estimates that diabetes costs our healthcare system an  astounding $327 billion per year, and cardiovascular-related diseases  cost more than $317 billion a year.   Much of this cost, and the human suffering it represents, could be  lessened or prevented through greater access to nutritious foods and  better eating.   I am proud that stakeholders in my home State of Massachusetts,  including nonprofits, advocacy organizations, hospitals, universities,  and other private sector partners, are coming together to examine the  impact of hunger and diet-related disease on our health system.   One shining example of a collaboration formed to tackle this terrible  problem is Vitality. John Hancock, a leading life insurance company  based in Boston, has partnered with the Friedman School at Tufts  University on an innovative life insurance product that helps to  encourage healthier behaviors.   John Hancock clients complete an online health review and engage in  activities like preventative care, physical activity, smoking  cessation, education, and improved nutrition to earn points that  translate into discounts on insurance and other products. What is  particularly impressive about the program is the discount it provides  to participants who want to increase their purchases of fruits and  vegetables. Those who sign up receive a 25 percent discount on healthy  food at more than 14,000 grocery stores across the country.   The Vitality program is one example of the positive impact incentives  can have on our collective public health when they motivate and reward  individuals to take up healthy behaviors. We should learn from this  innovative model and look at ways to expand upon its reach to greater  segments of the population.   Some Federal programs already allow for incentive-based programs.  Within SNAP, our Nation's first line of defense against hunger, we know  that incentives work. My home State of Massachusetts has been a leader  in the effort to help ensure SNAP recipients have access to fresh  fruits and vegetables.   In 2011, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts worked with the U.S.  Department of Agriculture to pilot a first in the Nation initiative to  provide incentives for the purchase of healthy foods. The pilot enabled  participants to increase their consumption of fruits and vegetables by  26 percent and led to the creation of USDA's Food Insecurity and  Nutrition Incentive, known as FINI.   FINI has provided States and localities across the country with  Federal resources to expand incentive programs for SNAP beneficiaries.  Massachusetts currently uses Federal FINI dollars in conjunction with  private donations and State resources to increase the purchase of  fruits and vegetables.   It is working. In our State, FINI has helped more than 63,000 SNAP  recipients increase their fruit and vegetable intake in 1 year alone.  Estimates suggest this increase can mean savings of more than $1.1  million in public health costs. So imagine the impact these sorts of  programs and incentives could have if they were replicated and expanded  on a larger scale.   New research from Tufts' Friedman School shows that incorporating  technology-based incentives for healthier eating into other Federal  programs like Medicare and Medicaid would be highly cost-effective,  saving millions of lives and billions of dollars in healthcare costs.   We should also look at how we can reach beyond Federal health and  nutrition programs to encourage private worksite wellness programs.  [[Page H6266]]    The fact of the matter is that all of us can and should be taking  steps to make healthier choices. Congress should take lessons learned  from successful partnerships like the Tufts and John Hancock  collaboration to pilot and expand incentive programs. In doing so, we  can provide greater access to nutritious foods, promote healthier  choices, alleviate human suffering, and save our healthcare system  billions and billions of dollars.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 999 was introduced by our  colleague Eliot Engel from New York. Basically, what it says is that  the House of Representatives expresses its agreement with the  statements of the Speaker of the House of Representatives made on July  16, 2018, regarding the Russian Federation's interference in the 2016  United States elections and related matters.   It basically, again, is an endorsement word for word of what the  Speaker of the House said, a very strong statement, basically making it  clear that there was no question that Russia interfered in our election  and continues to attempt to undermine our democracy here and around the  world.   It is not just the finding of the American intelligence community but  also of the House Intelligence Committee.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that any  committees of referral be discharged from further consideration of H.  Res. 999, expressing agreement with the statements of the Speaker of  the House of Representatives made on July 16, 2018, regarding Russian  Federation interference in the 2016 United States elections and related  matters, and I ask for its immediate consideration in the House of  Representatives.    Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, how do I get this cleared? Maybe I can  yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma, who can maybe, in a gesture of  bipartisanship, agree that it would be a strong statement for the House  of Representatives to come together, Democrats and Republicans, and get  behind the strong words of our Speaker of the House. Would that be  appropriate?    Mr. Speaker, my question was: How do I get it cleared  now that I am on the floor? Can I ask the Republicans if they would  agree to it?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, the measures included here aren't just bad, they are  dangerous. Take the Interior Appropriations bill. It would put the  health and safety of Americans at risk by slashing funding to address  climate change and enforce environmental safeguards.   The EPA, the agency tasked with fighting carbon emissions, is cut by  $100 million. That is especially ironic since the majority was  completely unwilling to rein in the wasteful spending by its former  Administrator, Scott Pruitt. This is someone who spent $43,000 on a  soundproof phone booth, but the majority was silent.   The Land and Water Conservation Fund is cut by $65 million. That is  after Republicans cut it by a third in the last fiscal year. As many of  my colleagues know, I have been a champion of the LWCF, especially the  stateside grant program where States provide a 50 percent match to  grants that create more recreational and green open spaces in our  districts. The people in communities in nearly every congressional  district in the country have benefitted from these grants. We should be  increasing, not cutting, LWCF.   There is even language in the bill that would repeal a rule designed  to protect our wetlands and waterways. State revolving funds were cut  by $300 million, a $150 million cut to clean drinking water and a $150  million cut to clean water projects like water treatment and sewage  programs.   Mr. Speaker, the American people rely on Congress to make sure that  the  [[Page H6276]]  water they drink is clean. What is going on with this bill?   As always, Republicans have again attached several poison pill  provisions that undermine the health and safety of our communities and  the environment. Every year--every year--provisions like these weigh  down this bill.   Mr. Speaker, when will my Republican friends realize that harmful  provisions like this are why the bill has to become law? I am  especially outraged to see what the majority has done with the  Financial Services Appropriations bill, especially after what we saw on  Friday. That is when some of our worst fears were confirmed.   As part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, Deputy  Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced charges against 12 Russian  military intelligence officers. They were accused of hacking the  Democratic National Committee, hacking Hillary Clinton's Presidential  campaign, and hacking the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.  The website of a State electoral board was also hacked. Voter  information was stolen. Even the vendor of voting equipment was  targeted for a cyber attack. And those individuals involved in  administering elections were also targeted.    These charges are proof that our Nation, that our very democracy, is  under attack. No troops were sent into combat. Not a single gun was  fired. Instead, an adversary turned the internet into a battlefield.  That is the new face of warfare in the 21st century.   Although the methods were different, this Congress should be  responding the way we always have, by putting partisanship aside and  putting our country first by doing whatever it takes to ensure we are  not left vulnerable again.   But, Mr. Speaker, how is this majority responding? By using the  Financial Services Appropriations bill to zero out funding for grants  that help protect our election systems from cyber hacking. That is a  cut of $380 million compared to what Congress enacted in fiscal year  2018. The wolf is at the door, and my Republican colleagues are  inviting it inside for dinner. This is insane.   The President tweeted, shortly after the election: ``Unless you catch  `hackers' in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the  hacking.''   Well, Mr. Speaker, it may be hard, but it is not impossible, because  we now have a 29-page indictment from President Trump's own Justice  Department providing the roadmap. The indictment goes into  extraordinary detail outlining how Russia successfully hacked into our  election systems, how candidates and committees were successfully  targeted--not by China or somebody sitting on their bed who weighs 400  pounds, as the President suggested, but by Russia, by Vladimir Putin.   It is mind-boggling that even after this indictment, after Russia's  meddling was laid bare, the President did not stand up to Putin. He  held a summit with him instead. He even told CBS News, in an interview  before his sit down, that he ``hadn't thought'' about raising the issue  with Putin during their talk.   It gets worse, Mr. Speaker. British investigators believe that  current and former agents of the same Russian military intelligence  service accused of disrupting our 2016 elections are also likely  responsible for the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his  daughter in Salisbury, England, earlier this year.   Sadly, it is no surprise that the President didn't stand up to Putin.  He never does. When President Trump was asked whether he was a friend  or a foe, he recently called Putin a competitor instead, like this was  all some kind of real estate deal.   A President who calls the free press, journalists in the United  States, ``the enemy of the American people'' time and time again is  unwilling to call the leader of Russia a foe or even an adversary. It  is disturbing.   What kind of hold does Vladimir Putin have on this President, Mr.  Speaker? So much so that the President basically blamed the United  States for much of the tensions between the two countries.   The President even deflected when asked whether he trusts the  American intelligence community or Putin.   The President may be satisfied by what he called Putin's strong and  powerful denial of election interference, but I am not, Mr. Speaker. I  am disgusted.   It is clear that an effort to defend our democracy will have to be  led by Congress, because it is not coming from the White House. But we  are not leading when we make it easier for an adversary like Russia to  attack us again. That is retreating.   I remember learning about the separation of powers in school, how the  legislative branch is a separate but equal branch of government. The  Founders designed it that way so we could provide a check on a  President.   Mr. Speaker, when are the Republicans in Congress going to provide a  check on President Trump? He is cozying up to Putin instead of holding  him accountable for hacking our election.   As Senator Schumer suggested, we should be increasing sanctions on  the Russians. The Republican majority should be joining us, demanding  the President's national security team that accompanied him to Helsinki  testify before Congress, detailing what they know.   It is past time that Republicans end their attacks on the Department  of Justice, on the FBI, and on the special counsel. Already, 32 people  and three companies have been either indicted or pleaded guilty under  Special Counsel Mueller's investigation. Now, we will see where else it  leads, but there is already evidence of clear wrongdoing.   He should be able to finish his work without any interference. The  majority should move a bill from Representative Nadler to the floor  immediately, so we can protect the special counsel's investigation from  the whims of this President.   President Trump has shown he is willing to fire his FBI Director. Mr.  Speaker, are the Republicans really going to stand by and make it  possible for him to fire Robert Mueller, too?   This majority must also demand the President insist that the 12  Russians named in Friday's indictment are sent to the United States to  stand trial. The President should have already done this when he met  with Putin, but, apparently, it was an afterthought. Maybe he was too  busy admiring the strongman to stand up for his country's interests.   I wish I were optimistic that Republicans would take these  commonsense steps to protect our country, but I am not, not after what  we saw in the Rules Committee last night. The majority failed to make  in order an amendment by Representative Quigley. It was germane. But  they failed to make in order his amendment that would provide $380  million to help States protect election systems from cyber hacking.  This funding should not have been zeroed out in the first place.   Do my Republican friends see what is happening? Is anybody paying  attention over there? Russia meddled in our election, and your response  is to zero out funding for an election security assistance program.  Then, when we pointed it out and tried to put the money back, you  blocked the amendment. You won't even allow us to debate the program.  That is the smallest step that they could have taken. Instead, we can't  even have a debate on the floor.    Apparently, the Republicans are afraid of having a fair fight about  protecting our democracy, and it is indefensible. If the President  isn't willing to do more to prevent Putin from doing it again, then  this Congress has an obligation to act, not gut the accounts that  provide for election security.   We can start standing up by voting against this rule and the  underlying legislation. It doesn't do nearly enough to protect our  Nation against hostile foreign powers hell-bent on attacking our  democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to my good friend from Oklahoma who I  think said that 39 percent of the funds are still left in the Election  Assistance Commission account. Well, we still have 5 months left in  this year, and does anybody here really believe that these attacks are  going to stop? And shouldn't we have money in the pipeline? Shouldn't  we be prepared not just for this election, but for the election after  that?   This is about protecting our democracy, and I don't understand why  this is controversial. But no matter what you think about Mr. Quigley's  amendment, it was germane. It was relevant to this bill. It should have  been brought up, and we should debate it. All we are asking for is a  fair fight.   We are deeply concerned about what is happening to our country, and  we are especially concerned in the aftermath of President Trump's  disastrous meeting with Vladimir Putin.   Mr. Speaker, now is the time for Congress to stand unified with the  unanimous assessment of our intelligence community.   I ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question. If we do, I am  going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative  Engel's resolution, H. Res. 999, which follows word for word  yesterday's statement by Speaker Ryan affirming Russia's attacks on our  democracy.   This is the second time today that I am going to give my Republican  friends a chance to go on the Record and agree with the words of the  Republican Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan.   Defending our democracy shouldn't be controversial. Agreeing with the  Republican Speaker that ``the United States must be focused on holding  Russia accountable'' should not be controversial. I would say to my  friends, take yes for an answer.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Engel) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee  on Education and the Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the majority has filled the Financial Services  Appropriations bill with anti-Home Rule riders that meddle in local  D.C. affairs. Not one or two provisions, which would be bad enough, but  five.   One would prohibit D.C. from using its own funding to carry out  Initiative 77, which eliminates the tipped minimum wage. That is an  initiative, by the way, that passed recently with 56 percent of the  vote.   Last night in the Rules Committee, the Republicans even made in order  the Palmer amendment. This would prevent the District from implementing  its local individual responsibility requirement. If passed, this  amendment would increase health insurance premiums and cause residents  to lose access to affordable coverage options.   Mr. Speaker, why are the Republicans continuing to interfere in local  D.C. government? Where are the small-government conservatives? Where is  the Freedom Caucus? They should be outraged by this meddling.   Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton filed amendments to strike these  riders and spoke in the Rules Committee last night. She asked a pretty  simple question: Don't my Republican friends have their own districts  to worry about?   Her amendments complied with the rules of the House, yet they were  blocked from getting a vote on the floor. We can't even debate them  here. The majority is afraid of a fair fight.   We are long past the point of breaking the record for being the most  closed Congress in the history of the United States of America. This is  more of the same for the most closed Congress in history, but that  doesn't make it right, Mr. Speaker. When will the Republicans finally  say, ``Enough''?   So enough with the meddling in D.C. affairs, enough with overriding  the will of local residents, and enough with the restrictive amendment  process.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District  of Columbia (Ms. Norton).                                time  1300     I yield the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia  an additional 1 minute.    I yield the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia  an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how many more speakers the  gentleman has on his side.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have left to  close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, when Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein announced the  charges against 12 Russian military officers on Friday, he said: ``We  need to work together to hold the perpetrators accountable, and we need  to keep moving forward to preserve our values, protect against future  interference, and defend America.''   Well, Republicans and Democrats working together need to come  together to defend this country. That shouldn't be controversial. It  should be common sense, and it should be above partisanship.   But we have a President who probably tunes out anything the Deputy  Attorney General says because President Trump is too busy attacking the  special counsel investigation on a near-daily basis. He calls it a  witch hunt and even worse, and that is despite the fact that the  Justice Department has issued more than 100 criminal counts against  more than 30 people and three companies. Numerous associates of the  President have pled guilty, and his former campaign chairman is sitting  in jail today.    Or maybe more accurately, Mr. Speaker, the President attacks Robert  Mueller's investigation because of that fact, because the special  counsel could be closing in on even more possible wrongdoing. Where  there is smoke there is usually fire, and there is at least a lot of  smoke so far.   So, given the President's action, we need, as a Congress, to step it  up. We need to hold Russia accountable and prevent this kind of hacking  from ever happening again because the President, who is unwilling to  say even publicly that he trusts the American intelligence community  over Vladimir Putin, will not.   Mr. Speaker, I am asking my colleagues to defeat the previous  question so we can go on record as disagreeing and condemning what the  President did in Helsinki, which was such a betrayal of our values. And  what we are asking to do is to vote to endorse the Speaker of the  House, the Republican Speaker of the House's words.   I mean, quite frankly, we should have a resolution of disapproval on  the floor, or maybe even a censure, given what the President did. But  we are saying let's come together in a bipartisan way, and let's make a  statement that we disagree with what the President did, what his  behavior was.   So vote ``no'' on the previous question, and vote ``no'' on the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.  [[Page H6282]]    A recorded vote was ordered.
