 Mr. Speaker, today I urge President Trump again to make  good on his promise of partnering with Congress to invest $1 trillion  in America's infrastructure.   This week marks National Infrastructure Week; and yet,  disappointingly, little action has been taken by this President and the  majority in Congress to provide substantive funds for our Nation's  crumbling infrastructure. Easing congestion on our highways is just one  investment that will have a significant return, getting central coast  residents to their jobs and back home to their families faster.   This is also an issue of safety for our constituents. California  currently has over 1,300 structurally deficient bridges, 678 high- hazard dams, and 50 percent of its nearly 200,000 miles of public roads  are in poor condition.   I urge my colleagues to work together in a bipartisan way to address  the infrastructure crisis in our country.                            ____________________
