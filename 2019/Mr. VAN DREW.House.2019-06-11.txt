 Madam Speaker, Harry Yoa is a 101-year-old World War II  veteran. He is living in Ocean City, New Jersey.   He was only 23 years old when he enlisted in the Army in 1942,  working as a truck driver and newly married to his wife, Valerie.   In the 321st Bombardment Group in the 12th Air Force, Harry was  stationed in the south of France, where he completed 63 missions as an  aerial engineer and as a tail gunner.   He now, unfortunately, suffers from dementia and doesn't remember  much from the war, but he says he hasn't forgotten the intensity of his  missions, where he was tasked with repairing the aircraft and defending  the craft through the weapons in the rear of the plane.   After the war, Harry was awarded multiple medals and three Bronze  Stars for his service.   In the wake of the 75th anniversary of D-day, we remember the  sacrifices of many Americans and the many Americans who made them in  World War II.   Harry is truly one of the great ones, and God will bless him.                            ____________________
