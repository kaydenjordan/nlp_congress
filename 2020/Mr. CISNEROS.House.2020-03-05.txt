 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Thompson,  for his steadfast leadership on this critical issue and for working  with me to ensure that this amendment be made in order.   Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment which would require the  Secretary of Homeland Security to prioritize the hiring of veterans and  related preference-eligible individuals, including disabled veterans  and widows or widowers of veterans, for positions within the  Transportation Security Administration.   Mr. Chair, I rise as a supporter and cosponsor of H.R. 1140 because I  believe we must do what we can to ensure our public servants have fair  pay and adequate protections. This is especially true for the Federal  workforce charged with preserving our national security and protecting  our Nation.   As the threats against our Nation continue to evolve in complexity,  TSA employees are tasked with adapting just the same. They deserve the  ability to negotiate compensation equitable to the service they  provide.                                time  0945    I rise to offer this amendment to ensure that our TSA workforce  includes the fortitude of our Nation's heroes, veterans who are already  mission-driven, molded in integrity, national-security minded, and,  above all, driven by a proven track record of service to the mission. I  have heard firsthand testimony of servicemen and -women, many returning  with service-connected disabilities, but many who still yearn to serve  and protect our Nation.   What better way than with the Transportation Security Administration,  a crucial necessity to the safekeeping of our Nation's citizens?   My amendment would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to  prioritize our Nation's heroes first when hiring to support TSA's  workforce. This includes veteran-related-preference-eligible  individuals such as disabled veterans and widows or widowers of  veterans. As a Navy veteran and member of the House Veterans' Affairs  Committee and the House Armed Services Committee, the hiring of our  servicemembers and veterans is one of my top priorities.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  amendment to ensure we do not overlook veterans who would strengthen  the TSA workforce.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close.   Mr. Chairman, I just want to reiterate this is a simple amendment in  support of our Nation's veterans. I urge my colleagues to adopt the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
