 Mr. Speaker, the EPA is forcing electric vehicles upon  Americans by using a tailpipe emissions rule designed to phase out  vehicles with internal combustion engines. In so doing, the EPA imposes  an unwise restrictive policy and eliminates consumer choice.   The Clean Air Act directs the EPA to reduce pollutant emissions from  vehicles themselves; however, electric vehicles are entirely separate  products. They are not emission-controlled devices like catalytic  converters in combustion engine cars.   By setting emission standards at a stringent rate, the EPA is  essentially mandating substitution of a different product to comply  with tailpipe standards.   This goes beyond existing authority and tries to circumvent  congressional powers, and that is illegal.   Instead of ripping away consumer choice, the EPA should do its job  and stop enforcing irrelevant rules to meet political objectives. Those  in favor of the EPA's rules here use the term ``sound science.'' Well,  cutting off vehicles that have shown tremendous improvements in  efficiency with less emissions is denying scientific gains.   What would actually help Americans is driving lower fuel prices  through domestic production with reliable baseload energy sources like  nuclear, hydro, geothermal, natural gas, and clean burning coal.   We need to stop attempting to control what vehicle drivers can  purchase and instead focus on what the people elected them to do.   Mr. Speaker, we need to protect people's rights and choices, and pass  H.R. 4468, the CARS Act.
