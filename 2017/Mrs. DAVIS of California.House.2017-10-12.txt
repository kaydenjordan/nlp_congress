 Mr. Speaker, today, we are considering a  National Defense Authorization Act measure that would transfer  thousands of military weapons to a civilian nonprofit, the Civilian  Marksmanship Program. These guns will then make their way into the  public for purchase.   The Army has recommended against this proposal. One of their  concerns, not a surprise, is public safety. For us to go against the  recommendations of our own military on this matter is, frankly, absurd.  Every single day, our country--our country--experiences horrific gun  violence, and the last thing we should be doing is going against the  advice of our military and putting more guns onto American streets.   Those who are in support of the measure claim that transferring these  weapons to the Civilian Marksmanship Program will save the government  the cost of storing these guns, but the amount of money to be saved to  store some weapons is really negligible, and that small cost is nothing  compared to the potential cost to human life by unleashing these  handguns for the public to purchase.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to employ common sense here. Listen  to the advice of our Army and support the motion to instruct.
