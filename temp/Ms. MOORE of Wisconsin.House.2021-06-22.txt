 Madam Speaker, I rise to support acting,  taking up and passing the American Jobs Plan and the American Families  Plan.   Our infrastructure is in dire need of an overhaul, and it can't be  put off any longer.   We also need to invest in the human infrastructure in our country,  and we don't have to choose one over the other.   Americans across the Nation rely on sustainable infrastructure to get  their children to school, to get to work, to facilitate commerce. We  need to build on the investments that this Congress has already made  through the American Rescue Plan, including dollars that are flowing to  our communities.   Madam Speaker, $2 million has recently been sent to Milwaukee for the  East-West Bus Rapid Transit project in my district, a green public  transit option.   I support the American Jobs Plan, bold investment to get every lead  pipe in our country out from underneath our ground.   I also support investments in paid leave, childcare, and expanded  access to affordable and quality health insurance.   I urge my colleagues to support these measures.                            ____________________
