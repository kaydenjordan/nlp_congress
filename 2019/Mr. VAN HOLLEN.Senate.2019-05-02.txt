 Madam President, I thank my colleague for his  comments in support of NATO and the alliance, one that we share on a  bipartisan basis here in the Senate.                          Remembering Richard Lugar    Madam President, I wish to take a few moments to honor former Senator  Richard Lugar, who passed away on April 28.   Richard Lugar's leadership as chairman of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee was a model of statesmanship--someone who put  country over party and principle over politics.   I did not have the privilege of serving as a Senator with Richard  Lugar, but I did have an opportunity to see him in action when I served  as a Senate staff member, working on national security issues for  another great Senator and statesman, Senator Mac Mathias, who also  served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   During that time, I witnessed Richard Lugar's work on a bipartisan  basis to achieve major foreign policy successes. He had the vision to  remain true to American values, and in a complex world, he took the  long view of what was best for our country. Those traits produced the  landmark law to reduce the threat of nuclear proliferation, known as  the Nunn-Lugar Act, after its chief authors. The program has led to the  elimination of more than 10,000 nuclear warheads, more than 1,000  ICBMs, and almost 40,000 tons of chemical agents that had been  scattered across the former Soviet Union.   I was especially inspired by Senator Lugar's work to end the racist  apartheid regime in South Africa. At the time, the Reagan  administration was pursuing a policy of so-called ``constructive  engagement'' with that apartheid regime. The Reagan administration was  opposed to imposing sanctions on South Africa to help free Nelson  Mandela, who was imprisoned, and to bring about an end to apartheid  rule. Senator Lugar understood that continued engagement with that  regime undermined America's values and our interests. As chairman of  the Foreign Relations Committee, he led the efforts to pass the  legislation to impose sanctions on South Africa, and when President  Reagan vetoed that bill, Senator Lugar lead the bipartisan effort to  overturn the veto of the President of his own party. That override was  successful. Richard Lugar spurned partisanship in order to do the right  thing for America.                                 S.J. Res. 7    Madam President, that brings us to the vote we will have today-- whether or not to override President Trump's veto of the bipartisan  legislation to end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's brutal actions in  the catastrophic war in Yemen.   I see Senator Murphy, a colleague from Connecticut, on the floor. I  thank him for his leadership in this area.   I urge the Senate to stand up together for American values and for  our long-term interests and to vote today to overturn President Trump's  veto.   Whether it is Saudi Arabia's conduct in the war in Yemen, their  grizzly murder of American resident and Washington Post columnist Jamal  Khashoggi, their imprisonment of U.S. citizens, or their gross  violations of basic human rights, the United States must reevaluate and  reshape our relationship with Saudi Arabia.   Let's look at Yemen. The Crown Prince has recklessly directed a  brutal war in Yemen for 5 years. That war has resulted in the world's  largest humanitarian catastrophe. More than 100,000 civilians have been  killed, and millions more are on the brink of starvation. More than 100  children die every day from extreme hunger there.   In fact, the United Nations has called the war in Yemen one of the  ``greatest preventable disasters facing humanity.'' Even after waging  this brutal war, the result has been that the Iranian-backed Houthis  are more entrenched and more militarily sophisticated today than they  were at the start of this catastrophe, and Iranian influence in the  region has expanded.   In short, the Crown Prince's and Saudi Arabia's military adventurism  has been a major strategic blunder. So rather than vetoing the  bipartisan legislation from Congress, the President's administration  should be working overtime to help resolve the conflict and bring a  negotiated end to that catastrophe.   I mentioned the vile and brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, who was a  U.S. resident and a Washington Post columnist. Yet President Trump  threw his own intelligence community under the bus when it came to the  question of whether the Crown Prince had been complicit in the murder  of Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. It was the assessment  of CIA Director Gina Haspel and others who said that the Crown Prince  had been complicit in that murder. Yet President Trump said: ``Maybe he  did and maybe he didn't,'' and dismissed the whole thing. When the  United States dismisses a CIA determination that the Crown Prince is  responsible for the brutal killing and murder of an American resident,  and we do nothing, that sends an awful signal around the world that  puts Americans everywhere in danger.   Then, of course, we have seen just recently the terrible crackdown  with respect to human rights violations in Saudi Arabia. In fact, just  a week ago, Saudi Arabia beheaded 37 citizens, most of them minority  Shiites, in mass executions across the country for alleged terrorism- related crimes, which Amnesty International pointed out were nothing  more than sham trials that relied on confessions extracted through  torture. Among those put to death was a young man convicted for  reportedly attending a pro-democracy rally during the Arab Spring when  he was just a teenager.   I have here a headline report: ``Young Man Set to Attend Western  Michigan University was Beheaded in Saudi Arabia.'' This was a man who  was a teenager, was part of a democracy movement, and was imprisoned by  the Saudi authorities. He had been intending to attend one of our  American universities, and yet he was beheaded. You also find that the  Saudis are detaining a number of American citizens, dual nationals, for  their activism on human rights. They were seeking greater freedom for  women in Saudi Arabia.  [[Page S2587]]    So rather than holding the Saudi regime accountable, this  administration instead seems determined to move forward, in a very  secret way, with providing nuclear assistance to the Saudi Government.  They have talked about providing the authority for U.S. companies to  engage in these conversations, even though Saudi leaders have openly  talked about acquiring nuclear weapons and have raised the possibility  of dumping spent nuclear fuel from their reactors on the border of  neighboring countries.   Instead of helping the Saudis with their nuclear program and instead  of vetoing bipartisan legislation to hold the Saudi Government and the  Crown Prince accountable, the President should be actually reaching out  on behalf of American interests, but he chose not to. He vetoed the  bill. It is now our duty, in a bipartisan way, to stand up for American  values and American interests, and I urge this Senate to vote to  override the veto of President Trump.
