 Madam Speaker, my father once said to me: Just because  you can do something doesn't mean you should.   In the short time I have served in this body, one thing is clear:  This is not a serious place.   Last year, we watched as the other side delayed COVID relief for  months to inflict maximum pain and sway the outcome of the election.  The Speaker said as much.   Yet, these last 2 days, we have seen just how fast they can move when  they want to exact political retribution on their opponent.    My friends on the other side now have complete control of both Houses  of Congress. In a few days, they will control the entire executive  branch as well.   Madam Speaker, Joe Biden has talked unity and healing. Is that what  this is today? Is accusing Republican lawmakers of sedition and calling  for their expulsion the plan for healing? Is working with Silicon  Valley to digitally disappear those with whom they disagree with the  plan for reconciliation?   I was among the first to condemn the riots in Madison months ago, and  I condemn what happened last week. But where were the swift accusations  of incitement and insurrection from the other side last year? Is  today's political theater a preview of what the American people can  expect from single-party rule, 2 years of double standards, of  punishing those who voted for someone else?   Madam Speaker, I hope Mr. Biden is watching today and that he will  rise to the moment and call off this effort to rub salt in the wounds  of millions of Americans.   It is now time for all of us, Democrats and Republicans alike, to  turn down the temperature.
