 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring  importance to a treatment issue that faces our Nation's veterans  suffering from traumatic brain injury, TBI, and post-traumatic stress  disorder, PTSD.   In line with National Suicide Prevention Month, I am introducing the  Veterans National Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Act today. This bill  will help so many of our veterans who are suffering from TBI and PTSD  by creating a pilot program, increasing their access to hyperbaric  oxygen therapy, HBOT. There are presently many treatments for PTSD and  TBI, but they do not work for everyone.   As a physician for over 30 years, I have long been a strong advocate  for HBOT, since I was in the North Carolina legislature. This type of  treatment has restored the lives of so many of our veterans when all  else failed. But the Department of Veterans Affairs has refused to use  this treatment despite many requests by Members of Congress.   This is a bipartisan issue. It is time for Congress to authorize this  treatment option by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Charitable  organizations--donations, not taxpayer funds--will pay for this  program. My pilot program should show how efficacious this treatment  truly is.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, as we owe our  veterans and their families this treatment option for those who have  lost all hope to help their lives return to some sense of normalcy.                            ____________________
