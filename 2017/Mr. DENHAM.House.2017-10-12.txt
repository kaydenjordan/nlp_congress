 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the lives of the  victims of the California wildfires.   We have seen some devastating fires throughout California,  specifically huge fires in northern California, that have already  burned over 142,000 acres. It is one of the deadliest weeks in  California wildfire history, already seeing 23 lives perish in those  fires.   Today, we will see disaster relief funding here on the floor. It is  important that, while we have already passed one funding bill, we pass  another to address all natural emergencies across the entire country.  We must also have funding available for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and  Maria in devastated areas like Puerto Rico, Texas, and Florida.   We have had big challenges in this country, and it is time to make  sure that we pass a second relief funding bill that will address many  of those concerns in the disasters that we have seen across the  country.   Shortly hereafter, we are going to see another funding bill come  forward that will address some reforms. While some of our States have  building codes and are addressing the impacts so that we don't see this  devastation in the future, we need to make sure that these reforms are  passed in the coming bill as well.   We have three major bills. We will pass one today. Another one is  soon to follow. We have to address the country's national emergencies.                            ____________________
