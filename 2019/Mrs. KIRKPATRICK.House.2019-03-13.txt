 Mr. Speaker, I am here to represent the residents  of Arizona's Second Congressional District. I work for them.   Our constituents sent us here to practice good government and to  fight for their values and interests, so I am upset with the  President's recent budget request.   A budget is an expression of our values, and this budget further  proves how out of touch Donald Trump is with real American families.   This budget ransacks Medicaid, Medicare, and affordable healthcare.  It makes it harder for Americans to have access to quality healthcare.   This budget abandons hungry families who are struggling to make ends  meet. It fails farmers and rural communities. It pushes affordable  college further out of reach, making it harder for students to attend  college. And this budget demands billions for a wasteful, ineffective  wall.   We need to have a budget that prioritizes working families and not  large corporations.   We need to invest more in our education system and invest more in our  young people, not less.   What the President has laid out does not accomplish the goals or  values of American families, and I reject this budget.                            ____________________
