 Mr. President, this Capitol Building has served as the  backdrop for some of the most notable moments in America's history. In  this building, wars have been declared, peace treaties have been  signed, and the march toward progress has either moved forward or has  been stopped in its tracks.   Today, the Members of this Senate have the opportunity to take a  monumental step forward. We will vote to confirm a once-in-a-generation  legal talent, a jurist with outstanding credentials and a lifetime of  experience, and the first-ever African-American woman to serve as  Justice of the Supreme Court--Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.   Judge Jackson's confirmation will be a glass-shattering achievement  for America.   Consider this moment in history. When the Supreme Court first met in  this building in 1801, there were 1 million slaves in this Nation--a  Nation of 5 million people. This very building was built with the labor  of enslaved people.   And at the time the Court met, neither Black Americans nor White  women had a constitutionally guaranteed right to vote. Women had no  place in that first Supreme Court chamber, and Black women would only  enter to clean it in the dark of the night.   We know what followed. America's battle to end slavery saw a bloody  civil war and decades of efforts to break down racial barriers, and the  efforts continue to this day.   Our struggle to enfranchise and empower women did not end with the  19th Amendment, 102 years ago. It continues to this day, as well, as we  strive to give our daughters the same opportunities we give our sons.   This confirmation of the first Black woman to the Supreme Court  honors the history that has come before it. It honors the struggles of  the past and the men and women who waged them.   And this confirmation draws America one step closer--one step--to  healing our Nation, one step closer to a more perfect Union.   Nearly a century after our founding, we guaranteed the rights of  citizenship, finally, to every American, including, for the first time,  those who were born into bondage, with the ratification of the 14th  Amendment.   It took a long century later for us to expand the bounds of liberty  again. We ensured the Federal Government could vigorously protect the  right to vote, the most fundamental of rights, with the passage of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965.   One victory for progress begat the next.   Two years after the Voting Rights Act, we confirmed the first Black  American to ever serve on the Supreme Court--Justice Thurgood Marshall.  But I would like to remind you: That was 50 years ago.   Now, with the passage of that time, we are beginning to write another  chapter in our Nation's quest for equal justice under the law, and that  chapter begins with three letters: K-B-J.   With Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's confirmation to the highest Court  in the land, we are not only making history; we are carrying on a great  American tradition: elevating one of our Nation's best and brightest  legal minds to an honored position of service.   There is no one more deserving of this high honor. As we have learned  over the past month, she is the best of us. She has devoted her life to  serving our country. She has done so at every level of the Federal  judiciary, and at every turn, she has distinguished herself.   But I hear the critics say she is soft on crime. I wonder how they  explain that she was endorsed by the largest law enforcement  organization in America, the Fraternal Order of Police, as well as the  International Association of Chiefs of Police, as well as an army of  Federal prosecutors who have appeared in her courts.   She is dedicated to protecting judicial independence, to advancing  freedom and liberty, and deciding every case, as she says, from a  neutral posture. That is exactly what you will find in evaluating  nearly 10 years of service on the bench.   I hear Senators come to the floor and say: Well, there is one opinion  I disagree with.   For goodness' sake, she has issued almost 600 written opinions in 10  years on the bench in the district court. She has been reversed a small  percentage of the time. Her work speaks for itself, and when you  evaluate it, you will find out she is thoughtful and evenhanded.   As the American people saw during last month's hearing in the  Judiciary Committee, Judge Jackson has the right judicial temperament.  Calm, collected, she answered every question, even when the questions  were hostile and confrontational. She answered them with dignity and  grace and stood by for more than 24 hours of questioning.   She is a proven consensus builder. She has been confirmed by the  Senate on a bipartisan basis more than three times--three times, I  should say--and soon, we hope, she will be confirmed again by a  bipartisan majority.    She has earned the support from leaders across the political and  ideological spectrum. Civil rights leaders,  [[Page S2067]]  leaders in law enforcement, former Federal judges appointed by  Democrats and Republicans--all of them have lined up proudly to endorse  her.   Perhaps most importantly, Judge Jackson will help ensure that the law  works for the people and that the people understand the workings of the  courts.   For many Americans, what happens in a courtroom can be cold and  impersonal. Judge Jackson has made a habit of making it real. She looks  people in the eye, walks them through her decision making with patience  and empathy, and she reaches every one of her decisions by following  the facts and the law, wherever they lead.   She said that her opinions can run long. That is by design, because  she wants America to rest assured--whether she writes in the majority,  the concurrence, or dissent--they will know exactly where she stands on  the most important issues.   Serving as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee during Judge  Jackson's confirmation has been one of the highest honors of my Senate  experience.   I want to give a special thanks to the man who spoke before me,  Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa. His friendship and fairness  have really guided our relationship throughout this historic process.   In the weeks since President Biden announced her nomination, Judge  Jackson has already lifted the spirit of countless Americans, inspiring  a new generation of aspiring jurists and public servants. Millions of  Americans see themselves in Judge Jackson--Black Americans, members of  law enforcement families, working moms, public high school graduates  like her fellow Palmetto Panthers in Florida.   Everywhere I have gone for the last few weeks when I go home-- visiting law schools, going to the grocery store--I have been  approached by people who have been following this nomination closely.  They tell me how deeply impressed they are with Judge Jackson, even  under fire from her critics.   Hannah Amundsen is one of those people. She is a law student in  Waukegan, IL, a city on the shores of Lake Michigan. In a letter to my  office, Hannah wrote:         If you can see it, you can be it. [And] I'm very excited to       see . . . [America's] first black female justice.    Reverend Krista Alston is a Baptist minister in the city of Chicago.  She comes from a long line of Baptist ministers. She calls herself ``a  civil rights baby,'' born in 1964, the year LBJ signed the Civil Rights  Act.   Rikki Jones is also from Chicago. She has been working for civil  rights for nearly 60 years--since she was a teenager.   Well, late last month, Reverend Alston and Ms. Jones, with four other  people, drove 11 hours from Chicago to attend an hour of Judge  Jackson's hearing.   Rev. Alston said she was moved by the judge's courage, grace,  integrity, and wisdom. She imagined what it will be like years from now  to tell her future grandchildren what it was like to be in that room  for that historic moment.   And Rikki Jones said she had never even expected to hear about a  Black woman being nominated to the Supreme Court, let alone to be in  the room for her hearing. She said that as she watched Judge Jackson,  ``it felt like the fulfillment of everything I've worked for my whole  life.''   She thought of all the strong Black women who came before her and  helped make the movement possible: Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Ida  B. Wells, and my personal late friend, the Reverend Willie Barrow, a  Black woman minister from Chicago who worked alongside Dr. Martin  Luther King. This moment was about them too, she said.   And this moment is possible because of Judge Jackson and who she is-- her qualifications, her integrity, her record of excellence. She has  earned her seat on the Supreme Court.   That is why it is so unfortunate that several Republicans on the  Judiciary Committee did not approach Judge Jackson's hearing with that  same level of fairness and respect as their colleagues.   Thankfully--thankfully--there are Members of the Senate who are  willing to rise above the partisan fray.   I want to particularly commend Senator Susan Collins of Maine,  Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Senator Mitt Romney of Utah for  their political courage and their willingness to support a singularly  qualified and historic nominee to the Supreme Court.   You know, when Senator Romney announced his support for Judge  Jackson's confirmation, I couldn't help but remember his father, the  late George Romney, who served as Governor of Michigan in the 1960s,  during the height of the civil rights movement. Governor George Romney  knew a thing or two about political courage. As a proud Republican  Governor, in 1963, he marched alongside the NAACP Detroit President  Edward Turner in support of civil rights. That same year when Dr.  Martin Luther King organized a march in Detroit, Governor George Romney  declared the occasion ``Freedom Day'' in Michigan.    To my colleague, Senator Mitt Romney, you are your father's son.   This week marks 54 years since the shot rang out in Memphis, TN,  claiming the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, an American who spoke with  greater moral clarity than nearly any other in our history. The night  before he died, Dr. King spoke at a rally in support of the city's  striking sanitation workers. There was tension in the air. From the  moment he set foot in Memphis, he had received a barrage of death  threats.   As Dr. King spoke to the crowd at the Mason Temple, death was on his  mind. He said:         Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity       has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just       want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the       mountain.    His next words proved prophetic. Dr. King said:         I've looked over. And I've seen the Promised Land. I may       not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that       we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land.    Rikki Jones said that she thought about Dr. King's prophecy when she  realized the Judiciary Committee was voting on Judge Jackson's  nomination on the anniversary of Dr. King's death. It felt like the  prophecy had come to pass.   Dr. King didn't make it to the Promised Land, but Judge Jackson's  ascension to the Supreme Court brings us closer to that longed-for  place.   I would like to close with one last personal plea to my Senate  colleagues. I hope you will think about this. In the years to come,  long after we have left the Senate, one of our grandchildren may ask  where we were on this historic day, April 7, 2022, when America broke  down what seemed like an impossible racial barrier and voted to send  the first African-American woman to serve on our highest Court. I will  be proud to say I was on the Senate floor, standing at my desk, and  casting my vote with pride for the next Associate Justice to the  Supreme Court of the United States, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. I  hope my colleagues will join me in sharing this historic moment.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, an hour or so ago on the floor of the  Senate was an amazing sight. It has been a long, long time since I have  seen the Galleries full. COVID-19 kept us apart. I missed it. I didn't  realize how much until those full Galleries were here to witness the  vote on the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme  Court.   It was a time of great celebration for most Members of the Senate and  I think for the Nation because we have achieved something which many  doubted would occur.   It has been 50 years since the first African American--Thurgood  Marshall--was appointed to be a member of the U.S. Supreme Court. It  was another 50 years for us to wait for the opportunity to put a  person, a woman of color, on the Court. And we did it today.   Soon, in the coming future, the President will be swearing in Judge,  now-Justice Jackson. I am certain that she will be a credit to our  Nation. She has already proven that in her lifetime of service.   Many Members of the Senate, of course, were excited and happy about  it. I was one of them. I want to thank my colleagues for their kind  words, but I also want to acknowledge the obvious.   All of the hard work that led up to this successful vote happened a  lot behind the scenes. There were members of our staff who worked long  hours--20-hour days--to prepare for this and to be ready to handle the  important Judiciary Committee hearings. I would like to acknowledge the  staff members on both sides of the aisle who worked tirelessly on Judge  Jackson's nomination.   I have got quite a team on my side, and I am very proud of them. I  want to recognize the following individuals who played an important  part in this historic process: Pat Souders, my chief of staff; Joe  Zogby, my Senate Judiciary Committee staff director; Dan Swanson,  general counsel; Stephanie Trifone, deputy general counsel; Sally  Brown-Shaklee, my deputy chief of staff; Maalik Simmons and Miriam  Wheatley, my floor staff who are often sitting right in the back of  this Chamber; Claire Reuschel and Riley Foti, my schedulers; my press  staff, including Emily Hampsten, my communications director; Jenna  Valle-Riestra; Maddie Carlos; Theresa Bordenave; and Laura Keller, and  many others on my Judiciary team, including Phil Brest, who was my  chief nominations counsel--he worked so hard on this, and he is so  good--Sarah Bauer, who was right by his side working every minute; and  Gabe Kader, as well; Ziya Smallens, speechwriter; Joe Charlet;  Vaishalee Yeldandi; Maggie Hopkins; Anna Shepard; David Adeleye; Eric  Chung; Eliza Lehner; Samir Sheth; David McCallum; Mady Reno; Katya  Kazmin; Rachel Martinez, Yashi Gunawardena; Doug Miller; Chastidy  Burns; Nicole Walton; Lane Giardina; and many, many others.   I also would like to recognize some members of Senator Grassley's  staff. Now, he--for those who wouldn't know--is my Republican  counterpart. I chair a committee evenly divided--11 to 11--and Senator  Grassley is in charge of the Republican side. We have developed a  strong friendship and trust over the years that really meant a lot  during this process.   I want to recognize Senator Grassley's staff members, in particular:  Kolan Davis, his staff director of many years; Brendan Chestnut, his  chief nominations counsel; and Lauren Mehler, his senior counsel for  nominations.   Our two staffs worked very well together in this process, and I  really appreciate that. I want to thank Senator Grassley, again, for  it.   I want to thank the committee's nondesignated staff, including  Heather Vachon, Michelle Heller, Bryan Palmer, Kara Dubbs, Shannon  Bartley, Chuck Papirmeister, and others.   I want to also express my gratitude to the larger Senate community  who played a part in Judge Jackson's nomination process: the staff of  the Architect of the Capitol, the Sergeant at Arms, and of course the  men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police Force who were critical to the  success of the hearing and markups for Judge Jackson's nomination. More  than 1,000 people occupied the chairs in the back of the committee room  in the 4 days of hearings. It was the largest gathering, largest crowd,  short of the State of the Union Address, in modern memory on the  Senate. And today's Gallery attendance, again, was something, a welcome  change from the forlorn empty Chamber's Galleries that we have come to  be used to.   I also want to thank and add the names of the Senate staff who were  so instrumental in supporting the committee's proceedings.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a list of Senate staff who were instrumental in supporting the  committee's proceedings.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Ronda Stewart.............................
