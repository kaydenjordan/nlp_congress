 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of  North Carolina's First Congressional District.   Right now, the American people are down on the government and tired  of the politics of division.   When I am at home in the district, I am reminded that there is still  hope for the future, for the American Dream.   Mr. Speaker, eastern North Carolinians are tired of what they see in  Washington. They want us, Democrats and Republicans, to do right by  them, to find solutions to the most pressing issues being discussed at  the dinner table.   Mr. Speaker, I will do just that. I will fight to ensure those who  fought to defend our freedoms do not have to fight their country to  survive. I will fight to ensure our families and farmers are better  connected, because they, too, deserve every resource to thrive.   Mr. Speaker, I will fight to ensure our most vulnerable communities  have access to affordable healthcare. We owe it to our communities. We  must act together.                            ____________________
