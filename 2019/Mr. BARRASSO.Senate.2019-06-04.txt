 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor today as part of  our national celebration of the 100th anniversary of U.S. women's  suffrage.   Now, 100 years ago today, on June 4, 1919, Congress passed the 19th  Amendment to the Constitution giving women the right to vote. This  hard-fought legislative victory would ensure women's full participation  in our democracy.   On August 18 of 1920, women's suffrage became U.S. law. Now, some of  the people watching may not know that Wyoming was actually more than 50  years ahead of the Nation when it came to women voting. That is a fact.   This year, people back home in Wyoming are celebrating both the 100th  anniversary of the U.S. women's right to vote and the 150th anniversary  of Wyoming women's right to vote. Wyoming truly is the Nation's  trailblazer when it comes to women's equality.   Many people think of Wyoming as the Cowboy State, and that name  honors our State's great western heritage, but Wyoming is also known as  the Equality State--the first State in the Nation to grant women the  right to vote, long before statehood, actually, because, on December  10, 1869, the Wyoming territory passed the first law in the United  States granting women the right to vote and to hold public office. The  law meant full civil and judicial equality with men.   The following year, on September 6, 1870, Louisa Ann Swain, of  Laramie, WY, became the first woman in the United States--in the  history of the entire country--to vote in a general election.   Twenty years later, Wyoming reaffirmed its commitment to women's  rights as we sought statehood. Wyoming, categorically, refused to enter  the Union without the right for women to vote. When standing on  principle became a major sticking point, Wyoming stuck to its guns on  women's equality.   In fact, retaining women's right to vote was so essential that  Charles Burritt, of Johnson County, a delegate to the Wyoming  Constitutional Convention, famously declared: ``If we cannot come into  the union of states with a platform of right, why then we will stay out  and willingly remain in a territorial form of government until all of  us have passed away to the grave.'' That is how important this issue  was to the people of my home State of Wyoming.   In Congress, Joseph Carey was here as a Wyoming delegate to the U.S.  House of Representatives. He presented the case for statehood in the  House of Representatives. He emphasized the strong values of the people  of Wyoming, values that included political parity between men and  women. Members of Congress opposed to women's suffrage meanwhile argued  strongly against Wyoming becoming a State. One Representative opposed  to statehood even remarked--and I will quote him from the Record of the  House of Representatives. He said: ``Mr. Speaker, I do not hesitate to  say that in my judgment the franchise has been too liberally  extended.'' It is a Member of the House of Representatives arguing  against allowing Wyoming to become a State.   Well, Wyoming, of course, won the debate narrowly. On March 26, 1890,  the U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed the Wyoming statehood  bill by a vote of 139 to 127. The measure passed the Senate a few  months later, and then on July 10, 1890--that is the day we became a  State--President Benjamin Harrison signed Wyoming's statehood into law,  naming the 44th State the ``Equality State''--not the ``Cowboy State,''  not a ``Western State'' but the ``Equality State.'' Let me just say  that my State may have been the 44th State to enter the Union, but  Wyoming will always be the first when it comes to women's rights.    Wyoming has declared 2019 as ``The Year of Wyoming Women,'' and on  December 10 of this year, Wyoming will celebrate Wyoming's Women's  Suffrage Day. It is a time to pay tribute to Wyoming's many women  trailblazers, such as Nellie Tayloe Ross, who was Wyoming's 14th  Governor and the first elected woman Governor in the United States.   Governor Nellie Tayloe Ross completed the term of her late husband,  Governor William Ross, who had died suddenly in office. She showed  great courage and resolve by then running for election--and she did  this against the advice of close family and friends--and she won. On  January 5, 1925, Nellie Tayloe Ross became the first U.S. woman to be  sworn in as Governor, serving with distinction until 1927. She didn't  stop there. Nellie Ross went on to become the first female Director of  the United States Mint, serving five terms here in Washington from 1933  to 1953. She died in 1977 at the age of 101.   I want to recognize another Wyoming trailblazer today--educator  Estelle Reel. Estelle Reel was the first woman elected to Wyoming's  statewide office as the superintendent of public instruction. Only 1  year later, in 1895, she became the first woman confirmed by the U.S.  Senate to a Federal position, the Superintendent of Indian Schools.   There are a few more Wyoming women firsts whom I would like to  mention.   On March 7, 1870, Esther Hobart Morris was the first woman to serve  on a jury. That jury was in Laramie, WY. She was also the first female  justice of the peace, appointed on February 17, 1870.   In 1870, Wyoming's Mary Atkinson became our country's first female  court bailiff.   Wyoming was also home to the first all-woman city government, elected  in 1920 in Jackson, WY, and they are shown here in this photograph as  Wyoming's trailblazing women. The Jackson Press dubbed them ``the  petticoat government.''   Clearly, the people of Wyoming and all Americans owe an incredible  debt of gratitude to the Nation's extraordinary women leaders, past and  present, so this year, we celebrate those first laws that gave women  the right to vote and ensured their full participation in our  democracy.   Thank you, Madam President.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, tomorrow, a number of us will be  traveling from Washington to France, to Normandy, for the 75th  anniversary of D-Day on Thursday. We will commemorate the heroic,  selfless efforts of a courageous group of Allied forces, and we will  honor all of our World War II veterans.   The 156,000 Americans and British and Canadian troops who stormed the  beaches of Normandy, France, on that fateful day, June 6, 1944, turned  the tide to win the war in Europe.   Launched from England, the Allies' landing in France was carefully  planned and really brilliantly executed. In his D-Day message to the  troops, General Dwight David Eisenhower instilled confidence. His  message was this:         The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere       march with you.        In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on       other fronts, you will bring about the destruction of the       German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over the       oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a       free world.    That was the message from General Eisenhower.   Well, because of the tremendous sacrifices of our Allied forces, Nazi  Germany surrendered unconditionally less than a year later, on May 7,  1945.   The price for European peace and security proved high. In all, there  were 4,414 Allied deaths on D-Day alone, and 2,501 Americans were  killed that day. Allied deaths in the Battle of Normandy, which lasted  until August, topped 226,000.   Now, 75 years later, thousands of veterans and world leaders will  gather on this hallowed ground to honor the self-sacrificing soldiers  who fought for our freedom.   My home State of Wyoming lost five of its finest sons on D-Day. I  want to recognize these heroes who never made it home: Private Raymond  Dahlman, PFC Thompson Dicks, Private Thomas Offutt, Jr., PFC Steven  Serkovich, and Private Jack Simpson.   I also salute Wyoming's 602 living World War II veterans, including  my wife Bobbie's father, Bob Brown of Thermopolis, WY, who served not  only in World War II in Europe and then was sent to the Pacific, but he  was also called up to serve our Nation once again in the Korean war.   In all, 16 million Americans fought in World War II; more than  400,000 U.S. servicemembers were killed in the war; and most of those  who returned home have now passed away.   So today I want to highlight one of my home State's D-Day heroes who  died 5 years ago at the age of 92: SSG Chester ``Chet'' Stephens of  Glenrock, WY.   Chet was born in Casper, WY, in 1911 and moved with his family to a  ranch south of Glenrock.   At 21, he was called to serve in the Army in World War II, joining  the 161st Field Artillery Battalion. Chet supplied ammunition to the  battery throughout the war. The 161st landed in Normandy's Omaha Beach  in the third wave and fought the Nazis for months.   Chet was awarded the Bronze Star for his heroism in crossing a  flooded road to deliver ammunition to his stranded comrades.   His battalion stopped only 7 miles from Berlin, Germany, before he  returned home to Glenrock and to his lifelong love of family ranching.  In fact, he was still ranching at the age of 92 when he died in 2014.   So I will be thinking of Wyoming's D-Day heroes and all of our  State's World War II veterans during the tribute at Normandy.   I will also be thinking of my dad. He was part of the liberation of  France, fighting in the pivotal Battle of the Bulge.   I will carry his dog tags with me when I go overseas, the dog tags  that he wore during World War II in the liberation of France.   I will also carry with me the medal that was given to the brave  soldiers who fought in the liberation of France. The medal says  ``1944.'' There is a chain around France with breaks in the chain, and  on the back, it says ``la France''; it says ``liberateurs''--the  liberation of France.   I will also have with me the missal he carried, his prayer book. It  says: My military missal. There is a crucifix on the front and on the  back, a rosary, the crucifix, and then the beads that were elevated in  the printing so that one could, in a foxhole, in a time of war, with  this in your pocket, pray to your Lord and God.   You know, from the time I was a little boy, my dad would always say:  John, you should thank God every day because you live in America. You  don't know how fortunate you are.   We are truly blessed to live in this great country, and it is due to  the selfless actions of our troops--those brave soldiers who risked  their lives--and many gave their lives for the rest of us.   As President Franklin Roosevelt said in his D-Day prayer: ``Almighty  God: Our sons, pride of our Nation, this day have set upon a mighty  endeavor, a struggle to preserve our Republic, our religion, and our  civilization.''   We must never forget those who fought for our freedoms. So many gave  their lives to protect our way of life.   We owe an incredible debt of gratitude to our Gold Star families and  the sacrifices of those families and of their loved ones.   So on the 75th anniversary of D-Day, it is a time to remember all of  our brave service men and women, to reflect on their faithful service  to this country, and to recall the sacrifices that they have made and  continue to make in defense of this great Nation.   Let me close by saying God bless our troops who fought and died in  World  [[Page S3203]]  War II. God bless our servicemembers, veterans, and their families, and  God bless, yes, the United States of America.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
