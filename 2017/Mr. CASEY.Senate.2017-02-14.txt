Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            Remembering Al Boscov     Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to pay tribute to a  Pennsylvanian who passed away this past week, Al Boscov.   Al was known not only in Pennsylvania, but beyond, as the owner of  Boscov's Department Stores, a very, very successful retail department  store chain. I rise not just to pay tribute to his life, his work, and  his success but, most importantly, what he meant to the people of  Pennsylvania--all that he did above and beyond in addition to his great  business success.   I want to extend condolences to the Boscov family--to his wife  Eunice, their children and grandchildren, and, of course, to the people  of Reading and  [[Page S1156]]  Berks County, and, by extension, our entire Commonwealth because of  what Al meant to his community and the larger community in eastern  Pennsylvania but also all the way up to my home area of northeastern  Pennsylvania.   I live in Scranton. One of his stores was, and still is, in the  downtown business district in Scranton. So this is personal to me as  well.   Al leaves two generations who will carry on his legacy in so many  ways: his three daughters, Ruth, Ellen, and Meg, and his five  grandchildren.   Al was born on September 22, 1929. He was the youngest son of Solomon  and Ethel Boscov. He first made a name for himself as an expert  flycatcher in his father's neighborhood store at Ninth and Pike. In  those days, when he was just learning skills that would help him later  in the business world, obviously people could see a great future for  this young man.   He was a graduate of Reading Senior High School. He also graduated  with a business degree from Drexel University, where he started his  first business--a delivery service for hero sandwiches--which would  presage a great career in business.   Al received an honorary doctor of humanities degree from Albright  College in Reading, a doctor of arts and letters degree from King's  College in Wilkes-Barre, PA, and, finally, a doctor of public service  from Kutztown University. So three distinguished Pennsylvania  universities paid tribute to him by way of a doctorate degree.   He served in the Navy during the Korean war. After service, Al  returned home to join the family business and, in 1962, opened Boscov's  first full-service department store, Boscov's West, in suburban  Reading. Since that time, the Boscov chain has become the largest  family-owned department store chain in the Nation, with 45 stores in 7  States, employing some 7,500 coworkers.   Here is what Al said about his store, which shows the attitude he  conveyed as a businessperson and a member of the community. When he  talked about people visiting his stores, he said:         We like to give people a reason for coming to Boscov's even       when they don't want to buy anything. They enjoy themselves       and hopefully we make a friend.    What a great attitude for any business leader, especially one who  opened his business in the town in which he grew up.   Al's family remains especially proud of his continual efforts to  fight prejudice and promote cultural understanding. For example, at  times of growing racial tension in Reading years ago, Al used his three  Reading stores to present a heritage festival, providing the  opportunity for the African-American community to share various aspects  of Black culture, whether food, art, writing, or entertainment.   Similarly, Al Boscov presented a Puerto Rican heritage festival in  both his Reading and Lebanon stores--Lebanon being in the middle of  Pennsylvania--again, bringing together the Hispanic, White, and Black  communities with a theme of ``Knowing is Understanding.'' His belief  that we all must take time to know each other and to take care of each  other remains as one of the most important and, his family hopes,  lasting legacies.   As the chairman of Boscov's, Al set new standards for successful  retailing, community involvement, and civic duty. He founded and led  the nonprofit Our City Reading, Inc., to assist Reading in restoring  abandoned homes and to bring about a resurgence in downtown Reading.  Under his leadership, more than 600 families had the opportunity to own  and live in a new home. He led the efforts to equip a senior citizens  center in downtown Reading. The Horizon Center provides seniors with  hot meals and activities. I could go on and on, but I will not this  afternoon.   It is clear from his life that he was very successful. It is also  clear from his life that he gave and gave, not only to his home  community of Reading, but well beyond. I know from my own personal  experience what he did for northeastern Pennsylvania, for Lackawanna  County, Luzerne County, and a lot of other counties as well.   So we are thinking of Al Boscov today, remembering his generosity,  remembering his legacy, and remembering the many contributions he made  to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
