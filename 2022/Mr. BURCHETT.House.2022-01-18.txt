 Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of John  Rice Irwin, a renowned historian and the founder of east Tennessee's  Museum of Appalachia. He recently passed away at 91 years of age.   John joined the U.S. Army and was stationed in Germany during the  Korean war. When he returned to east Tennessee, he began a career in  education and became Anderson County Schools' youngest superintendent  at the age of 31.   It was around this time John started collecting old-timey Appalachian  items. John was fascinated by east Tennessee's rich cultural history,  and he traveled around the region to collect artifacts and document  stories of how the people lived long ago. He even bought a historic  cabin and restored it to what it would have looked like when it was  first built.   Madam Speaker, that little cabin became the Museum of Appalachia,  which opened in 1969 and received around 600 visitors during its first  year. John kept expanding the museum, and now it covers 65 acres,  contains over 250,000 historical artifacts, and welcomes tens of  thousands of guests each year. Anyone who visits the museum will  recognize John's passion for the Appalachian heritage.   Former Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander displayed loaned artifacts  from John's museum in his Washington office until his retirement in  2020. These same artifacts are now on display in my Washington office,  and I am reminded of John's incredible work each time I walk through  the front door.   Rest in peace, brother. Thank you for telling the stories of our  historic Appalachian community.                            ____________________
