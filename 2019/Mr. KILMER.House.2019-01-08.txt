 Madam Speaker, yesterday, I met with a group of Federal  workers in Tacoma to discuss the impacts of the government shutdown.  One of the folks there was a prison guard. She told me that, without  her paycheck, she didn't know if she could pay for childcare or for the  prescriptions she needs after successfully fighting cancer just last  year.   Because of this shutdown, that is the conversation that is unfolding  across 800,000 kitchen tables as Federal workers try to figure out how  to scrape together mortgage payments and rent payments, trying to make  due without a paycheck.   This crisis doesn't just impact Federal workers. It hurts entire  communities. It hurts the economy around Olympic National Park, such as  hotel owners and restaurateurs, when people cancel their visit to the  park because of the shutdown. It affects college students, prospective  home buyers, and small business owners who won't have access to Federal  loans because of this shutdown.   Madam Speaker, while we can have a legitimate discussion about  immigration reform, America doesn't need a wall. It doesn't need a 5th  century answer to a 21st century challenge. America needs an open  government. The Senate and the President can and should make this  happen right now.                            ____________________
