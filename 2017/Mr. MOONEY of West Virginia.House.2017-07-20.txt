 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a  truly outstanding constituent in the field of healthcare, Greg Elliot  of Charleston, West Virginia. He has been selected this year as one of  the recipients of the prestigious Joe Warner Patient Advocacy Award.   The National Center for Assisted Living, the Nation's largest  association of professional long-term healthcare providers, bestows  this annual award on association members who have worked diligently to  educate Members of Congress about the needs of long-term care patients,  and to advance the quality in the long-term and post-acute care  community.   Mr. Elliot is a second-generation owner of AMFM, which operates 17  long-term, skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers throughout West  Virginia.   Greg is frequently in Washington visiting my congressional office,  advocating on behalf of West Virginia seniors.   The third-party research institute, My InnerView, has ranked AMFM  facilities in the top 10 percent in the Nation 46 times for customer or  employee satisfaction.   Greg Elliot resides in Charleston with his wife of 16 years,  Jennifer; his 10-year-old daughter, Elizabeth; and their two dogs.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Greg for his years of  dedication and care to our Nation's frail, elderly, and disabled. His  career reflects the ideals embodied in the Joe Warner Patient Advocacy  Award.                            ____________________
