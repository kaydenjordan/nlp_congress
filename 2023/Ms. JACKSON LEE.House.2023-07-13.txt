 Mr. Speaker, this morning I rise to share with my  colleagues both pain and a sense of remorse, sense of fear that many  Americans will face, and attempt to have a dialogue and an  understanding as will be reflected in the Congressional Record.   I am a student of the Constitution. I have served as a senior member  of the Judiciary Committee, former chair or ranking member of most of  the subcommittees, covering everything from immigration to  administrative law to criminal law.   I love this Nation. I would argue with anyone on any assessment other  than that I am a patriot, one who views the Bill of Rights as an anchor  of our uniqueness, who appreciates every day the men and women who put  on the United States uniform, and who has had the privilege--obviously  to my dismay--to visit every war zone during my tenure, to acknowledge  those in combat, to honor and respect them and, yes, to attend funerals  of those who gave the ultimate sacrifice and to acknowledge those of  years past in our veterans cemetery in Houston, Texas.   As I begin this discussion, I want it to be known that these are  wonderful documents, the Declaration of Independence and the  Constitution of the United States of America.   If we look at the beginning of the Constitution, it is really poetry,  but it is truth. As we are reminded of the Pledge of Allegiance, these  words are equally potent: ``We the people of the United States, in  order to form a more perfect Union . . . '' They remind us of the  backdrop of these pioneers fleeing persecution themselves. Many  listening today may be the progeny, the descendants of these people. ``  . . . establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the  common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings  of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this  Constitution for the United States of America.''   Our Founding Fathers, who recognized that slavery was an abomination,  and that all Americans deserve equal protection of the laws, in essence  determined that the Bill of Rights was appropriate. All of us know the  First Amendment, but I don't know how many know the functioning of the  14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection of the laws and  allows all of us to live in liberty and prosperity.   I come here today to argue vigorously against the wrong-headed  decision that was made by the United States Supreme Court on two issues  and more to come. Citizens, law, and precedent, and the Constitution  were completely ignored in the wrongheaded affirmative action decision.   Let me be very clear. This is not about words; it is not about  enforcing wrongness against my fellow Americans. It is an affirmation  of affirming everyone. Whether your history is embedded in Pilgrims'  pride, that your ancestors came here that way, or you are part of the  Irish who came because of the famine and the lack of food in Ireland,  or you came early in the 1900s as Italians or many, many other  ethnicities, or maybe you are now Ukrainians who are fleeing the  persecution of a horrible war and the lack of democracy, you are an  American who desires freedom, democracy, and opportunity, as the laws  of this land will allow you to enter.   We are a potpourri. We are a place where people said this will not  work, these people come from all places, but our ancestors realized in  the Bill of Rights that slavery was wrong and abolished it in the 13th  Amendment. However, every day we continue to fight slavery that still  exists around the Nation.   Then we put in place the 14th Amendment of equal protection of the  law, and you could look at that and say, well, isn't it equal  protection to let someone trump over someone else if they indicate that  they have reasons to do so? No, it is not.   Affirmative action has come about through the death of many people,  and it wasn't the death of the Civil War, which was the dastardly war  where brother was against brother which caused the greatest loss of  life and one that we remember in pain, but we also remember the heroes.   I say to you that the affirmative action decision did not affirm  anyone. It took away that affirmation from the LGBTQ community. It will  take it away from race, away from religion and ethnicity. Realize that  equal protection of the law is a vital point. It is lost by the Supreme  Court's decision on affirmative action.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, in this week to stop gun violence, it  is important to remind all of you that 4.6 million minors live with  guns in the home, many of those unstored. Every year, almost 20,000  children are shot and killed or wounded by firearms. In fact, homicide  is now the number one killer of children.   Kimberly Vaughan, a young innocent of 14 years old with a wonderful  mother who served in the military, was killed in 2018 when a 17-year- old student went on a shooting spree. Those guns were left in the home.   Mr. Speaker, I introduced the Kimberly Vaughan Firearm Safe Storage  Act, and I ask my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to join me.   The act provides for the Attorney General to give voluntary practices  related to safe firearm storage and to label and publish them on a  website advising persons to safely store their firearms. It would urge  retailers to provide storage locks to secure devices when possible. It  would provide a $10 million grant program to States, local governments,  and nonprofits to distribute safe storage devices, at no burden to you  whatsoever. Of course, they will receive a tax credit for doing so.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my Republican and Democratic colleagues to join  us. Save lives. Save our children's lives. Stop gun violence with the  Kimberly Vaughan Firearm Safe Storage Act.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Having had some tenure on this floor, my recollection is that, in  many instances, the NDAA has been a welcomed bipartisan initiative. We  have worked together and formulated ways to improve the lives of the  men and women of the United States military.   Let me just make it very clear that that is what the NDAA is supposed  to be, strengthening our ability to be a fighting force. Who do you  have as a fighting force? The men and women of the United States  military.   I take great offense at the suggestion that there are not young  people in America who are willing to lay down their lives as our  fathers, mothers, and grandparents did. They do want to join the United  States military.   It is the ability of the military to govern itself within the  civilian framework that we should be promoting in the NDAA. It is a  terrible shame that Members of color on this floor will be forced to  vote on something that takes us back to the dark ages, to not talking  about how richly diverse we are.   All of these race amendments that have been allowed to come to the  floor are literally a disgrace.   Did we talk about the diminishing returns when the Tuskegee Airmen  took to the skies in the 1940s in World War II and were one of the most  successful bombing units ever? Black--my father-in-law, Philip Ferguson  Lee.   Did we find a diminishing in the military when Truman integrated  legally to allow African Americans to join the United States military  or to rise and not be discriminated against and others followed?   It was a magnificent move and a fearless move. Many thought Truman  would lose his election.   How dare we come to the floor on this? This is about our men and  women.   Why would my amendment be left out that talks about Black maternal  mortality? There are Black women soldiers and officers who would  benefit from that. Or $10 million that I introduced dealing with  triple-negative breast cancer that has been accepted and is in year  after year because it is to save lives.   Mr. Speaker, $2.5 million in post-traumatic stress disorder, it is to  save our soldiers' lives and to be able to admit that there is PTSD  continuing. We need to be able to help or to address injuries that come  after someone comes out of the military and to connect them to military  benefits, which we see many times.                                time  1300    Yes, I have an amendment in this that deals with providing emergency  housing for those of us who live in the Gulf region or live in the West  where these natural disasters are coming or on the East Coast in  Connecticut, so that when people are totally displaced, we are very  grateful for the fact that the bases would be open to providing  disaster care.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment that is in adds a report  to be submitted within 220 days following enactment on capacity to  provide disaster survivors with emergency short-term housing.   This bill should be a bill that builds the mighty fighting force. It  should not deny women the right under their medical care, and Secretary  Austin and the Pentagon to say quietly, you can have a medical  decision. If it cannot be made in the State that you are forced to be  assigned to, posted, you can go to another State.   It is a disgrace that they would interfere in private reproductive  rights. This is undermining what we are here for; to build up a  fighting force of men and women, and that is what this bill should be.   We will stand to the death to make sure this bill supports the men  and women and the fighting forces of America.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding  time.   I am on the floor again holding up the Constitution, which should not  be eliminated for the fighting force of Americans who have been  declared by nations around the world as the strongest, most powerful  fighting force in the world.   Whatever my friend says on the other side of the aisle, I have no  basis for his statistics. No one has undermined the force of the men  and women.   Let me pay tribute to them. Equal protection of the law says  basically a healthcare issue is a healthcare issue. Trans people have  healthcare issues. Trans children have healthcare issues. It is an  outrage that we should deny Americans who want to die on a battlefield  the right to get TRICARE.   Black maternal mortality is more prone to African-American women.  Should they be in the military and denied healthcare because they have  a Black maternal mortality and are more apt to have babies that die?  No. They want to die on the field, too. They want to be able to wear  the uniform.   I have never been able to understand how you can deny people  healthcare. It is healthcare. Let me say it again: It is healthcare.   For trans children, it is more your denial, your denunciation, your  contempt, your hatred that drives them to do anything toward  themselves.   It could be a heterosexual, and you condemn them, and they may be  prone to suicide. This is not apt to those who happen to be trans.   Please, I beg of this floor, do not pass these amendments because the  Constitution will be trampled on. Healthcare, Madam Chair, is  healthcare.    Madam Chair, families care about their children, and  it stuns me that the gentleman on the other side has indicated that he  wants to take health decisions out of the hands of parents who are  serving in the United States military, committed to laying their life  down for America, and eliminate it to the point that the parents who  love the military must leave the military and diminish our fighting  force.   Let me be clear. As relates to trans children and medical care, every  major medical and mental health association in the United States,  representing more than 1.3 million U.S. doctors, support age- appropriate gender-affirming care for transgender people.   In addition, in the special needs of the soldiers and others in the  United States military, there is no indication that money would be  taken away from special needs children as relates to the particular  needs of trans children. What it does say is that parents who love  their children would be discriminated against depending on what their  health need is.   Therefore, I rise today in opposition to this ill-thought-out and  ill-fated, I hope, amendment that clearly divides us as Americans, as  members of the United States military, in that it goes against science  and medicine because this affirming medical care has been accepted.  [[Page H3511]]    I am struck, as I end, by someone suggesting that someone who has  their hand on a nuclear weapon or they are in some strategic assignment  is diminished because they have a life that is different from someone  else, that they are no more of a soldier than someone else. They are a  soldier. They are part of the military, and families should be allowed  to make decisions for their children.   Madam Chair, these health decisions are life-changing and needed, and  medical doctors and science affirm it. I oppose this amendment.
