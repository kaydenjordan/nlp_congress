 Mr. Speaker, first, I thank the appropriations chair, Ms.  DeLauro, and Ranking Member Granger for their leadership in bringing  these appropriations bills to the floor.   I rise before you today, Mr. Speaker, to speak on behalf of my  bipartisan amendment co-led by Representatives Ferguson, Davis,  Fitzpatrick, and Bergman.   For the last 10 years, some foreign airlines have sought to undermine  international standards, the rights of U.S. workers, and to erode the  competitiveness of our U.S. domestic airlines. These foreign airlines  are unfairly using atypical business practices to register their  airline away from its home country in more convenient locations to find  countries with more permissive legal, regulatory, labor, and safety  standards which creates a serious disadvantage for our U.S. workers and  carriers, as well as undermines the safety standards the U.S. has  worked so hard to cultivate.   Commercial aviation contributes over 5 percent to the U.S. GDP and  supports hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs. My bipartisan  amendment seeks to prevent flags of convenience airlines from  undercutting U.S. jobs by ensuring that no Federal funds can be used to  approve a new foreign air carrier permit unless certain conditions are  met, including evaluating if it is in the best public interest.   This commonsense amendment, Mr. Speaker, will enable the Department  of Transportation to prevent foreign airlines that use atypical or  flags of convenience business models from flying to and from the United  States which will support American jobs, American workers, and the U.S.  airline industry.
