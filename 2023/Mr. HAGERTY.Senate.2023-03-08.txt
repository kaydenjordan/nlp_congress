 Mr. President, I move to discharge H.J. Res. 26 from the  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 26.    Mr. President, I am looking forward to a robust debate  today.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I just want to convey my thanks and  deep respect to our Republican whip for his thoughtful comments and my  other colleagues who have been here today to speak on this serious  matter. Thank you, all.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I understand that this was the first  opportunity for my colleague from Nebraska to speak before the Senate.  I want to commend him and thank him for being here to support my  legislation today.   Congratulations.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, just to set the stage before a few more  of my colleagues come to speak on this resolution, just moments ago,  over at Union Station, where there is a protest going on right now  protesting our actions here, with people protesting in favor of this  soft-on-crime position that the DC Council has taken, those protesters  just witnessed an attempted carjacking. The assailant who was  attempting the carjacking was confronted, and as that person fled, they  ran right through the crowd.   That is the situation that we are dealing with right now, and I so  appreciate my colleagues being here to speak on it.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I would just like to say thank you to  all of my colleagues today who have joined me. I thank Senator Lee for  his thoughtful remarks. I am looking forward to a very robust showing  this evening as we vote on my resolution.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the Senate will soon take up my  resolution to nullify the Revised Criminal Code Act recently passed by  the DC Council--a measure that becomes more central every day as the  harrowing reports of lawlessness and deadly violence in our Nation's  Capital steadily accumulate.   Carjackings in DC have increased for 5 consecutive years and have  more than tripled in the past 3 years. For the first time in 20 years,  DC has experienced back-to-back years with more than 200 homicides. Car  thefts are up 111 percent this year. It has gotten so bad that the city  recently announced that it is giving away free steering-wheel locks to  owners of frequently stolen cars here in the District. Instead, how  about just enacting laws that stop crime in the first place?   Sadly, violent crime has become an epidemic in our Nation's Capital,  where our constituents, Americans from across the country, and people  from around the world come to live, come to work, and come to visit,  from schoolchildren to World War II veterans. Yet, unbelievably,  despite escalating crime and palpable unease from all who visit or live  in DC, the DC Council recently passed legislation to reduce penalties  and eliminate minimum sentences for violent criminal offenses,  including carjackings, robberies, and even homicides.   DC's crime bill also dramatically expands jury trials in misdemeanor  cases, which may sound good to a law school classroom but in practice  will overwhelm the system and force dropped charges and crippling  delays in countless criminal cases integral to preserving order and  public safety. The DC crime bill reduces penalties on violent crime in  the midst of a violent crime wave. It is the opposite of good policy  and will make the crime wave even worse. It sends the wrong message-- that DC is not serious about fighting crime.   DC's own police chief recently concluded that one of the main reasons  for rising crime in the District, especially among youth, is the  perception among criminals that they will suffer no consequence. Yet  the council proposes to reduce the consequences even further.   Make no mistake, this DC crime bill will deliver the wrong results.  Under these soft-on-crime policies, public safety will deteriorate  further.   This is common sense to most people. It should be no surprise, then,  that Mayor Bowser recently vetoed the DC crime bill just this January.  She said:         This bill does not make us safer.    I couldn't agree more.   Yet, putting woke ideology over public safety, the DC Council  overrode the Mayor's veto. That is why I am bringing forth this  resolution to block the DC crime bill.   Washington is a Federal district, and the Constitution puts Congress  in charge of governing it. This makes sense. Countless Americans from  all over the country visit our Nation's Capital each week to meet with  their Federal representatives and to enjoy our national history.  Congress has a constitutional obligation to make sure these visitors  can walk down the sidewalk or enjoy a meal without fear of becoming  victims.   This resolution passed with significant bipartisan support in the  House of Representatives, and I am confident that an even larger  bipartisan majority of this body will support it tonight. Numerous law  enforcement groups, including the DC Police Union, are supportive.  Polling shows that 72 percent of DC residents believe that the DC crime  bill sends the wrong message.   A few weeks ago, the White House put out a statement of policy  opposing my resolution--based on the President's support for DC  Statehood, I presume--but last week, the President indicated he would,  in fact, support my resolution. I am glad the President has recognized  that Congress has a legitimate, constitutional role in reviewing and in  rejecting DC's harmful legislation.   To this point, given the now-widespread recognition that this is a  bad bill, imagine if Congress did not have the authority under the  Constitution and the DC Home Rule Act to block DC laws. This dangerous  bill would become law.   Apparently seeing the writing on the wall this week, the chairman of  the DC Council cooked up a desperate and legally baseless ploy to ``un- submit'' the bill to Congress in an attempt to avoid a vote of  disapproval. But the DC Home Rule Act is clear: There is no valid  action of this nature. No matter how hard they try, the council cannot  avoid accountability for passing this disastrous, dangerous, soft-on- crime bill.   Violent crime has become an epidemic in America. This resolution is a  referendum on it. Do you want to decrease jail time for violent  criminals? Do you want to prioritize the interests of law-abiding  citizens or the interests of criminals? This will be one of the  [[Page S709]]  only opportunities during this Congress for this body to send a broad  message on violent crime--a message that may impact the safety and  security of Americans throughout our Nation.   I appreciate that many of my colleagues have cosponsored or indicated  their support for this resolution, and I urge all of my colleagues to  support it tonight.   Stopping violent crime should not be a Republican or Democrat  objective; it should be a commonsense one. I hope the Senate sends that  message today by adopting this resolution and by sending it to the  President's desk.   I yield back all time.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
