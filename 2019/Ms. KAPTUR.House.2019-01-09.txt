 Madam Speaker, 19 days into the Trump shutdown, there is  no end in sight. Real Americans are taking his blows.   Take Ms. J's story. She is a constituent of mine who is a contractor  for NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio.   With the Trump shutdown now into the third week, she faces  unnecessary anxiety and uncertainty on whether she will be paid. Yes,  President Trump is making America's workers bear the brunt of his  shutdown.   Ms. J must weigh which bills to pay if her paycheck doesn't come. As  the mother of four, she fears the loss of health insurance coverage if  she can't cover her monthly premium. She describes herself as lucky to  be in a two-income household with the education necessary to seek  employment elsewhere if it comes to the worst.   Others are not so fortunate. One of her colleagues is an 81-year-old  custodial worker who has dedicated more than 30 years doing the  toilsome work required of her profession. Ms. J asks: ``Who will look  out for her?''  [[Page H348]]    It is over time to end the Trump shutdown, and the taxpaying public  at large expects the Government of the United States to do the work  they pay for.                            ____________________
