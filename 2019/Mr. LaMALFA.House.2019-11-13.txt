 Madam Speaker, after several weeks in the secrecy of the  basement of this building, the impeachment process has moved upstairs,  and it doesn't look a whole lot better in the light of day.   Chairman Schiff has made it pretty much a one-man show and continues  to deny a due process that you would normally see in a court of law,  with bipartisan input. In other modern impeachment examples, you have  seen input from both sides. We are not seeing that here. We have this  really ugly display going on of a partisan witch hunt against President  Trump.   Nothing has changed by coming upstairs. It doesn't look any better  under the light of the cameras. The star witnesses brought today,  indeed, are not stars at all. They weren't even present on the call  between the President of the United States and the Ukrainian President.   Indeed, what we have is a sham. It needs to stop because it is  dividing our country and dividing our ability to get anything  accomplished in this place for the American people.                            ____________________
