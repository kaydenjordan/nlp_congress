 Mr. Speaker, let me take a quick moment and sort of  get adjusted here.   We are going to spend a couple of minutes walking through some things  that I think are exciting, hopeful, and worth getting our heads around.   Every week, I try to come to this microphone when we are here to talk  about what I believe makes the future really bright for all of us,  everyone from my 3-year-old--or 3\1/2\-year-old, as she corrects me-- little girl to someone who is moving into their retirement years.   Once again, what is the greatest fragility in our society? This is  one that is hard for us to get our heads around or even talk about. It  is our demographics.   Whether we like it or not, baby boomers are retiring, and we have 74  million baby boomers. The last baby boomer will hit 65 in about 8\1/2\  years.   In 8\1/2\ years, two workers, one retiree. In 8\1/2\ years, 50  percent of our spending from this body, less interest, will be to those  65 and up.   It is demographics. It is not Republican or Democrat. It is  demographics.   At the same time, we have a substantial collapse, fall, in our  birthrates. As you know, our birthrates now are well below the  replacement rates.   What do you do as a society? What do you do as a government? What do  we do as a body here that is making public policy to make the future  bright?   We keep coming to the floor and talking about that we believe there  are, functionally, five elements. It is the adoption of technology. It  is the adoption of economic policies that maximize economic growth  through tax policy that creates investment in new technology for  productivity; immigration policy that maximizes new Americans having  talents that help us grow the economy; regulatory policy that uses  technology and information to regulate instead of bureaucratic filing  in file cabinets, functionally; incentives to stay in the workforce and  incentives to enter the workforce.   As we have seen recently, millennial females are moving into the  workforce. We still have a problem with millennial males.   How about someone who is older? Can we do certain incentives in  Social Security, Medicare, and other earned benefits to encourage  staying in the workforce or even creating a second career? We are going  to have to redesign a bit of those incentives that are in the current  earned benefits.   Can you create some incentives on Social Security, saying, ``If you  will continue to work, we are going to do these things?'' Because that  labor force participation is so important.   We have worked through these. Now we try to come in and show what we  see working in our society. Then, I want to talk a little bit about one  of these things, and that is the adoption of technology.   This week, the majority, the Democrats, will have a resolution on the  floor about the Paris climate accords. I want to walk a bit through how  technology, pro-growth technology, is the solution. I am going to show  you some of the really optimistic things happening out there.   Let's start swapping a couple of these boards. First, I apologize for  the first slide. The scale is a little off, but it is basically to make  a simple point.   I am blessed to be on the Ways and Means Committee. We had the debate  in December 2017. Over here, I was hearing how the world was coming to  an end, how revenues were going to collapse. It turns out that now we  at least have a good, comparable dataset. What is the term? ``Ceteris  paribus,'' where you can equal to equal.   In 2017, before there was tax reform, the first 6 months, and now we  have the 2019 first 6 months. Guess what? Revenues are up, even though  we are already in the tax reform environment.   I was waved off by some much more sensitive staffers. We had a list  of quotes from the majority, things they said, their predictions, what  their economists said. I am not going to read them.   But do understand, think about some of the crazy things we heard  about what tax reform was going to do to the revenues of the country,  what it was going to do to the economy, what it was going to do to  employment, what it was going to do to labor force participation.  [[Page H3334]]    They were all wrong. It is working. Take a look at our economic  growth. Take a look at unemployment.   If I had come to you a couple of years ago before tax reform and said  our society is going to have more jobs than we have available workers,  what would you have said?   But it is reality. It is happening. We are seeing data within what  they call the U-6, the underlying parts of the unemployment statistics  of our brothers and sisters who have handicaps, who have been long-term  unemployed, who have other life difficulties, moving into the labor  force.    There should be joy in this body and also joy for the fact that all  the predictions were wrong, that revenues are--or ``receipts'' is the  proper term. Receipts are up. These 6 months with tax reform compared  to the 6 months where we didn't have tax reform, we are taking in more  money.   Will we ever get an apology from all those who predicted doom and  gloom? Of course not. But could we just have a little bit of joy that  they were wrong, that the math is good, that good things are happening  in this society?   We need to do more of it because, without the growth, there is no way  we will keep our promises on Social Security and Medicare and so many  other things. We must have economic growth.   This slide right here I am going to leave here for just a second,  this slide here, 2017. We don't use, really, the 2018 fiscal year  because the first 6 months had part of it within tax reform, without  tax reform. But then the gray you see up here is the 2019 first 6  months. That is what that is.   I know I get teased a lot about the slides, but at some point, if you  are talking about math--and substantially, for all of us who are  Members here, we work in a math-free zone. It is a sin of both parties  because we often try to make public policy by our feelings instead of  by our facts.   When we do public policy by feelings, I will make the argument that  we hurt people because we intended good stuff, but we just got our  facts wrong. Could you imagine if we did more like this where we looked  at the real math and the real facts?   This is a month-to-month comparison. It shows you some months it has  been a little more, some months it has been a little less. But,  overall, $10 billion over 2017. The first 6 months, when you compare  them, it is working. It is working.   When you start to look at the revenues that are coming in, in what we  call FICA taxes--Social Security, unemployment, Medicare--good things  are happening.   You saw it 10 days ago when the Social Security actuaries put out  their report. You saw things like Social Security disability go from  being incredibly fragile, within just a couple of years of running out  of money, to gaining 20 years of actuarial life. Some of that was  public policy. Some of that is the fact that people are working.   You see other parts of the program gaining a year's worth of life.  That is a big deal when you consider the types of numbers we are  talking about. It is working. The growth is providing us, as a body, an  opportunity to do positive things for our community, for our country,  for our States. Instead, we just seem to banter around here, doing  crazy.   Let's walk around a couple of other things. Do you remember the  predictions? This was the long-term, freaky-smart economists,  particularly on the left but even some of ours on the right, who were  predicting before tax reform that the baseline economic growth on the  horizon was about 1.9, 1.8. That is where we were going to grow. Also,  the math that, over the 10 years, if you wanted to pay for tax reform,  we only needed a 0.4 percent growth.   Well, guess what? If you look at this chart and realize, since tax  reform, what has happened in the GDP expansion, we are blowing through  those numbers.   Now, it is too early to ever make a prediction like, well, the  additional productivity, the additional number of folks working, the  less demand on social entitlements because there is work, the number of  Americans who now have healthcare because they are working and all  these good things that are happening in our society.   But the fact of the matter is, if you look at this chart and look at  the growth in the size of our economy--and this is a big economy, so  when it grows 3 percent, it is a tremendous amount of economic  expansion--we are seeing numbers that, once again, these really smart  economists were telling us we could not hit.   Where is the joy around here? Whether you are on the left or the  right, if you care about people, if you claim you truly love and care  about people, the fact is that so many of them have work now and their  wages are going up, particularly for our brothers and sisters who are-- sorry to use the geeky term--at the lowest quartiles.   Do you remember the discussions only a couple of years ago that, if  someone hadn't finished high school, they were destined to spend their  lives on the edge of poverty?   What have we seen in the last dozen months? That that is the quartile  having the fastest movement in their wages.   There should be joy that something is breaking out, that something is  happening out there when you see another 400,000 manufacturing jobs  coming back to the United States.   Remember ``manufacturing is dead''? Except it isn't. We did tax  policy that encouraged investment in plants and equipment to raise  productivity.   Why is that so important? When someone gets a wage increase, when you  pay an American more money, what is the classic economic formula? It is  inflation plus an improvement in productivity. Wages go up according to  inflation and productivity.   What happens when American businesses, particularly in the  manufacturing side, across the country are buying new plants and  equipment because of the incentives in tax reform? All of a sudden, we  are starting to see it is working. Spiking of productivity is  happening.   We have a labor shortage. Wages are going up. Shouldn't there be joy  that the brothers and sisters out there who were being written off by  the really smart economists just a couple of years ago are back and  good things are happening?   To be a little bit gratuitous, I know these are hard to read, but if  you just look at the trend lines on the employment chart and think  about some of the other different quartiles, when we geek out on the  Joint Economic Committee, and those of our brothers and sisters who are  Hispanic or African American or females or other quartiles, where we  try to break down and see what is happening in employment statistics,  we are hitting numbers that we have never hit before in our society.  Something is working.                                time  1600    How much happy talk have you heard around here? In many ways, is it  just the nature of this institution is just the rage-based politics  that we bathe in today? There are good things happening. We should be  working on public policy to make more of this happen and more of this  so this continues, so we are a society of opportunity.   So this one is just sort of looking at--I want to double-check  myself. This one I put up just because it was a fascinating breakout,  and this was actually more from last December and then looking at what  is happening.   We had actually been having something called a labor force  participation issue. It is sort of a geeky way of saying, for a society  to grow, you often need two components.   You need capital stock. You need money that people can borrow to  invest and to plant in equipment. Well, it turns out the predictions  that were happening about tax reform, that capital stock was going to  dry up, that everyone was going to go out and spend the money and this  and that, it turns out savings, we have plenty of capital. Savings  rates went up.   The second part was labor supply, and that one we have; we have a  real issue. What do you do to encourage Americans who are not in the  labor pool to enter it?   Then last December, we had this unusual thing. All of a sudden, the  numbers within what we call millennials, millennial females started  entering the labor force, and all of a sudden, we went over the 60-- what? We had 62 or, I think, 62.3 percent labor force participation--I  am doing it from memory--a  [[Page H3335]]  number that lots of those smart economists just a couple years ago told  us we were not going to see again for another 30 years. It has  happened.   Maybe it is time we as a body have an honest conversation that a lot  of the economists who have been advising us are wrong, and the spirit  of entrepreneurism, of capitalism, those things are actually working in  our society and providing real benefits.   Look, as a guy coming to the microphone with lots of charts, but the  math is the math. Even though we work in a math-free zone on occasion,  there are really good numbers in this.   So I want to actually sort of touch on something else as we look at  our pillars of the future of economic growth in our society.   You have heard discussions of the Green New Deal or environmental  protection as almost a Malthusian concept that the economy must shrink  to meet these numbers. We want to argue that is absolutely wrong.   The basic math set: Why has the United States done so phenomenally  well in removing ACO2, a man-made CO2, from the  environment? It is because of our migration to natural gas. We have  gotten dramatically more clean, efficient in our energy production in  the last decade, decade and a half because of natural gas.   Well, in that case we should produce more natural gas, right? It is  working. But there are actually other disruptions of technology, and we  are just going to throw a couple of them up just for the thought  experiment, to understand.   If this were, once again, a couple years ago, the concept of pulling  CO2 out of the air was almost considered absurd--except for  the fact it is happening. It is actually in Canada, but there is  actually a facility that is going to be going online to almost, say,  what you would call an industrial scale that will pull CO2  out of the air incredibly efficiently.   It is a crazy concept, just crazy, except it works. The technology is  out there.   How many of us, as we are debating meeting the Paris accord numbers,  are saying here are actually things we can do to get us to the Paris  accord commitments, which we are going to come really close. If we  would adopt certain technologies, we get there.   I am going to ask you to reverse some of those slides so we actually  talk about the nuclear power first. No, that is carbon capture. Yes.   Sorry. We were running late, so we ran up here with the boards.   This is just a quick thought experiment for folks to understand for  clean power generation, and this is a couple years old. I think this  slide is based on 2015 numbers.   Do you see the yellow side? That is all the solar that was new  generation capacity in the entire country in 2015.   The other side, the multicolored over here, was the amount of  absolutely clean nuclear power generation that went off-line. So even  though 2015 was a remarkable year of new, clean solar generation, we  actually didn't really gain that much because clean nuclear power  generation went off-line.   So this is the occasion of it is great to be joyful about one, but  you need to make sure you have your math understanding what is going  on.   Now, for us in Arizona, there is often this debate, the discussion of  uranium. I don't want to geek out too much, but over the last 15 years  or so, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and world energy markets  on the nuclear side, there was high-grade uranium, almost weapons- grade, that was being stepped down to go into reactors. Most of that  now has been used up.   So, actually, that slide. This is carbon capture. So what would  happen to you if I came to you today and said it looks like our  national labs have actually had a technology breakthrough that is  stunning?   So, instead of us who are not too far from the Grand Canyon where we  do the drilling to pull uranium out of the ground, which is always  controversial because you worry about water supplies, but we need the  uranium for all sorts of things in our society, what happens if there  is never another land uranium mine again? Because we worked out the  technology to pull uranium out of seawater. It has happened. It has  happened.   Where is the joy around this place that technology is breaking  through and providing us this sort of clean energy future in things  that were just sort of academic fantasies just a few years ago and the  technology is breaking through? This is wonderful. It is exciting, and  there should be joy on all sides.    So let's actually go to this next one, and I am sorry for bouncing  you back and forth.   Outside Houston is an experimental natural gas generation facility.  It doesn't have a smokestack. It basically actually uses the  CO2 to spin the turbines. No smokestack. They capture every  bit of the CO2, and they are actually apparently going to go  from, I think it is--forgive me if I got my math wrong--30 megawatts to  300. They are going to go to an industrial- or utility-grade scale.   But the fact of the matter is they are generating power without a  smokestack, and they capture every bit of the CO2 and can  sell it, convert it into other products. We have the technology. It is  up and running right now. They worked it out.   This should be joyful. If you want to actually have a bright powered  future that provides the energy for the economy so the economy grows so  we can keep our financial commitments but we want to protect the  environment, we need to be talking about how we are going to bring more  of this type of technology into our communities instead of sort of the  Malthusian craziness of things that are in things like the Green New  Deal, where we are going shut down this, shut down that, shut down  this. There is a progrowth way to get there.   Those of us on the Ways and Means Committee even a year ago,  Republicans and Democrats, we actually passed some more tax credit  incentives for when you produce the CO2, where do you put  it? Well, you actually can get a little bit of credit if you put it in  plastic or cement or put it in the curb that is being put into your  neighborhood or actually put it into the ground to do recovery to bring  up more hydrocarbons.   It is actually just really exciting, and the technology is working.  We need to be talking about technology and its future and the  disruption it is bringing and the bright, cleaner future environment it  brings with it.   I brought this slide up because it is part of the thought experiment  on this theme. Who here is concerned about plastic in the ocean? I  mean, look, the Speaker is a good guy. He understands. I was a big  scuba diver before I got this job. Now there is never time.   Ninety percent of the plastic in the ocean comes from 10 rivers, 8 of  them in Southeast Asia, 2 in Africa. It is not the straw that you are  going to not be allowed to use here in D.C. It is not the plastics in  the United States. It is that 10 rivers bring 90 percent of the plastic  in the ocean.   If we actually cared about plastic in the ocean, wouldn't we actually  take our foreign aid, our environmental aid, our technology aid and  say: ``We know where the plastic in the ocean is coming from. Let's go  help those 10 rivers, 8 of them in Asia, 2 in Africa. Let's help them  get cleaner''?   That is Republican, Democrat, we want clean oceans. If you care about  the plastic issue, doing crazy things like: ``Well, I am going to  actually affirm that I am a good person and I care by banning straws in  my community even though it will have absolutely zero effect of making  the oceans cleaner''--because, in the United States, our plastic  substantially does not end up in the ocean. Let's stop the theater and  do things that actually provide solutions.   This one just drives me insane because I care a lot about it. And it  could be from the Foreign Affairs Committee to Natural Resources to  Energy and Commerce, they should all say: ``Hey, what do we do to help  other countries not pump plastic into our oceans from those 10  rivers?'' And if you did that, instantly, you just stopped 90 percent  of the plastic waste going into the ocean.   That is a solution, but that is actually using--what is that crazy  thing? Oh, yes--math to do public policy instead of feelings. But  instead, around here, we get rewarded for doing theatrics.  [[Page H3336]]    Now, the next board we are going to put up is the great thought  experiment, and this one actually is the ultimate disruption that I  think may even happen in my lifetime, and I may lack some of the  elegance or eloquence--excuse me--on how to describe it.   You all remember your high school or college botany biology class.  You know, a plant cell from a couple million years ago, it has a  certain issue of it wants to grow and it grabs an oxygen cell when it  meant to grab a carbon molecule. Sorry. And then it spends lots of  energy purging that one because ``I don't want the oxygen molecule; I  want the carbon molecule to grow.''   Okay. I don't mean to geek out, but it is a big deal. It is an  inherent inefficiency in our plants that is a couple million years old.   It turns out, United States Government and a couple of university  labs may have broken the code on the Holy Grail of plant biology, and  with a tweak in the genetic code, a 40 percent improvement in growth.   Do the thought experiment with me. What happens tomorrow if, on the  same piece of land you are growing soybeans or corn or cotton or grass  in your yard, you have a 40 percent improvement in efficiency? How much  less water are you using? How much less fertilizer are you using? How  much less fuel? How much less land?   It also means, mathematically, you also feed the world for the next  couple hundred years.   World agriculture, if you wanted to do part of the thought  experiment, world agriculture produces 2.2 times the amount of  greenhouse gasses as every car on Earth. Think about that. So world  agriculture, the math is you produce about 2.2 times more greenhouse  gasses than every car on Earth. The adoption of this genetic change in  our agriculture around the world would be as if you removed every  single car off the face of the Earth. That is a disruption.   Now, it is going to also have implications on what agricultural land  is worth. I mean, it will have a huge disruption across the world. But  if you truly claim you care about the environment, and someone like me  who does taxes and financial and economic growth as their specialty  here in Congress reads articles like this and sees the disruption in  the future for the environment, why isn't this the discussion here?   If this is real, and we all know in seed stock, you can roll it out  in just a few years. What would happen if in just a few years, it would  be like you removed every single car off the face of the Earth? That is  what something like this equals.   We should be joyful here. We live in a time where technology is  moving so fast it is presenting us solutions, and we need to stop the  debates around this place that sound like we are all still in the  1990s.   The solutions are all around us, they are rolling out of our labs,  they are rolling out of actually people's garages. Smart people all  around us and around the world are producing the solutions. We need to  embrace and move those forward, or we can do what we are doing here so  far this year, and that is engage in the political theater of rage and  completely avoid the optimism of the solutions that are at our  doorstep.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 4 o'clock and 16 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, May 1, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
