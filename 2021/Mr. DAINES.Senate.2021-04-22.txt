 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Rod Ostermiller of Yellowstone County for nearly 30 years  of service in law enforcement in Montana.   Rod first entered law enforcement in 1991 at the age of 21 and moved  up the ranks swiftly. In 2004, he became Chief Deputy Marshal and later  served as acting U.S. Marshal when his predecessor retired.   In 2018, I had the distinct honor of nominating Rod to become the  U.S. Marshal for Montana, which received unanimous approval in the U.S.  Senate. He was then officially appointed by President Trump.   Rod is a Montana native from the south side of Billings. He later  attended Montana State University to earn his bachelor's degree in  criminal justice.   Since his retirement from law enforcement, Rod went on to become the  executive director of the Mental Health Center in Billings, where he  continues to help combat the meth crisis we have in Montana in a  different capacity. He exemplifies what it means to make one's  community better.   It is my honor to recognize Rod for his decades of service to  Montana's law enforcement and for his continued efforts to make Montana  a safer and better place for all.                            ____________________
