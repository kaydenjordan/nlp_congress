 Mr. Speaker, this week the House passed the Pandemic is  Over Act, terminating the national COVID-19 state of emergency.   Now, of course, the pandemic is over. It has been over for some time.  Americans are well aware of this. It seems only the government has not  been aware of it at the national level and in certain States in this  country.   The House of Representatives passed this bill ending the state of  emergency, ending the national emergency, and the President responded  in a very interesting way. He agreed with us. He said: Yes, the  emergency is over on May 11, which is a very interesting concept. An  emergency that you can schedule to end in advance.   This is a page out of Gavin Newsom's book in California where the  state of emergency there had continued month after month, year after  year, and as the absurdities piled up, as California last year hosted  the Super Bowl during a state of emergency.   As, by the way, the Governor refused to abide personally by the  dictates issued pursuant to that emergency, eventually he was forced to  say, okay, I will end it, and he decided to end it 6 months in advance.  The state of emergency in California will now be lapsing on February  28, for those keeping score at home, and the national emergency will be  lapsing on May 11.   This is inherently against the very concept of an emergency, to say  that we can schedule it to end at a specific date in the future. It is  also against the very concept of an emergency to say that it can last  for 3 years.   We have in this country for now almost 3 years experienced our form  of government being turned on its head. At the national level, and in  particular certain States, our entire separation of powers, checks and  balances, and representative government collapsed under a one-man rule.   Now that we have moved on from most of that--although there are still  some remnants of the controls that were put in place still in effect-- we are in a position to assess what was the outcome of all this. Yes,  there was some uniformity in terms of Federal policy, but there was a  great degree of difference in terms of how different States responded.   In my State of California, we had the highest level of government  coercion and control throughout the entire COVID-19 experience. We had  the most onerous business shutdowns, the longest school shutdowns, the  worst church shutdowns. We had the most onerous mask mandates and  vaccine mandates and vaccine passports.   Each and every step of the way, California had the highest level of  government coercion and control, generally done via executive orders  without the say of the people, without the say of the legislature,  without meaningful judicial review, with 40 million people of our State  expected to simply comply. That was the California experience. That was  the experience to a lesser extent of many other States.   But then you had States like Florida that decided that citizens could  be trusted to make decisions for themselves, that empowered local  communities to govern themselves, that focused on disease control  rather than population control.   We can now look, having been through this for a few years and having  had very different approaches, what was the result of this difference  in policy?   Well, economically speaking, California had basically the highest  unemployment rate in the entire country throughout the COVID-19 state  of emergency, whereas Florida had just about the lowest unemployment  rate in the country throughout the state of emergency.   California has experienced student learning loss unlike anything that  has ever been seen before in this country. There has been a 6 percent  decline in third graders reading at grade level over the last few  years, a 7 percent decline for fourth graders in meeting ELA standards,  whereas Florida achieved the highest national assessment of educational  progress ranking in their history across math and reading for fourth  and eighth graders in 2022.   In California, to take another example, in L.A. our students lost an  equivalent of 6 months of math in terms of their overall education in  that period of time. We will be grappling with the consequences of this  for a long, long time. California experienced an economic and  educational calamity that States like Florida did not experience.   What did we get in return?   We were all told this was done for the purpose of safety. It was done  in order to save lives. We can now assess that claim.   When you look at the actual numbers, there was no difference. Age- adjusted COVID mortality rates between California and Florida were a  wash. It was the same, despite the unbelievable toll that the lockdowns  and related policies took on the people of California.   You can also make comparisons within our State. I represent a number  of counties that did everything possible to take the approach that  Florida did despite what we were dealing with at the State level.   In Placer County, for example, we were the first county in the State  to end the local state of emergency. We had our kids back in school  earlier than anywhere else in California. We were among the first to  end mask mandates and to challenge vaccine mandates, and we did  everything possible to enable our businesses to remain open. All the  while, we took the steps that were necessary to give vulnerable  individuals the tools that they needed to protect themselves.    Now, all the while, those of us who favored trusting citizens, who  favored freedom, were attacked viciously by the likes of the Governor  of California, who personally attacked me by name and said that I  believed it would have been better to let Californians die.   Again, you can look at the results in Placer County as compared to  other parts of California. Our students did much better, our employment  rate was roughly half the State average, and our public health outcomes  were much better, with a COVID mortality rate about two-thirds that of  the rest of the State.   The evidence now is very clear as to what approach worked and what  approach didn't. Those States that tried as much as possible to  maintain the structure of our constitutional form of government did a  lot better than those  [[Page H619]]  States that decided an emergency could be used to effectuate an  indeterminate one-man rule.   But there are some who are now saying, as a recent headline in The  Atlantic magazine put it, that we should simply declare a pandemic  amnesty at this point. We should move on, we should forget about all of  the damage that was done to our kids, who may never get the education,  may never make up for the learning loss that they experienced. We  should forget about the damage that was done to businesses that in many  cases have been permanently lost, 200,000 businesses throughout the  country that were shuttered. We should simply move on and forget about  it. Forgive and forget.   Look, I am all for letting bygones be bygones, and I am willing to  work with anyone who is interested in creating good policy going  forward. But we do need to pause and consider how it is that this  happened in our country, how did we get to a point where the appearance  of a virus could cause our entire form of government to collapse?                                time  1800    Our Founders were not unfamiliar with emergencies. After all, they  had just been through a war of independence and yet, they still  believed that combining the executive, legislative, and judicial powers  in a single set of hands, as James Madison put it, was the very  definition of tyranny.   So how, well over two centuries now after the founding, did we get to  a point where our institutions were so susceptible to collapse?   I think that is a question that merits serious scrutiny because it  could point us in the direction of getting back to some of the founding  principles that we have lost touch with.   The fact is that we have seen governmental power become more and more  centralized and consolidated in recent decades in this country, and it  simply became all too easy to fast-forward that process to its logical  endpoint of one-man rule.   We have seen our political institutions become less and less  representative, less and less self-governing institutions, and it  became all too easy to make them not representative at all. Or we have  seen more and more of our levers of power in government controlled by  special interest groups, especially in California, my State, and so it  became all too easy to let special interests completely run the show as  it did when it came to the school shutdowns.   So I don't believe that we can simply move on and turn the page and  forget about what happened in this country for the last few years. I  think we need to give serious thought as to what led us to this point  and how we can move ahead and actually now get the pendulum swinging in  the other direction. That is a far more in-depth conversation than my  time today would permit, but I simply would like to offer a few ideas.   The first is that we need to definitively end the emergency, not on  May 11 but now, not in California on February 28, but now, and any  other States that are retaining the altered legal forms that were put  in place through the emergency. Along with that, we need to end all  remaining mandates that exist.   We took a major step in that direction yesterday in this House by  passing legislation to end President Biden's vaccine mandate for  healthcare workers.   We also need to look at reforming our emergency laws, to make it so  you cannot so easily declare an emergency that lasts for years and is  allowed to continue indefinitely without any serious review of whether  the conditions of the emergency continue to exist.   In a broader sense, I think that this is a moment where we as a  country need to look at the consolidation and centralization of  political power in this country. Yes, at the State level but largely at  the Federal level, and especially in bureaucracies that operate outside  any sort of accountability on the part of voters.   We simply have seen this happen over the course of decades in this  country, and it has veered us farther and farther from the idea of  self-government that was the great American innovation: the institution  of self-government.   Now I am seeing encouraging signs in many ways that this is beginning  to happen. For example, I am starting to see at the school board level,  parents are getting involved like never before. Parents are running for  school board and changing the way that local school districts operate  and trying to fight against mandates from the State level that tell  them how they should run their schools.   The beauty of this is that it gives parents a direct access point in  terms of how their local schools are run. That is the idea of self- government, and I think that is something to build on going forward.   Finally, on the note of education, I do think we need to get much  more serious in this country about civic education which used to be  something that was not simply some addendum to one of your classes but  was part and parcel of your entire education: what it was about, to  prepare you for active citizenship, to be well grounded in what has  made America such a unique country in our Nation's history, the  greatest country in the world's history; what the Constitution is  about; why we have institutions like freedom of speech; why the  separation of powers and checks and balances are important.   I think if we start to teach these things more meaningfully in our  schools, then it would reinforce our civic institutions. It would leave  them less vulnerable to the sort of transformation that they were put  through over the course of the last few years. And should we ever face  another pandemic or whatever other threat that may come our way, I  think we will be much better prepared to get through it in the way that  Florida did and in the way that Placer County did. And not,  unfortunately, in the way that California and many other parts of this  country had to suffer through with such a high cost to so many people.
