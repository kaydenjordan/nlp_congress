 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman DelBene for her  leadership managing this bill and the Ways and Means Committee for  embracing it. Their advocacy sends a powerful message to the House to  pass the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019.   I also thank my friend, Representative   Mike Kelly, for his  bipartisan support of the bill, defying the polarized politics that too  often dominates the healthcare debate.   Madam Speaker, this bill today comes with the support of more than  660 healthcare groups that represent millions of Americans who have  joined together to repeal the 40 percent excise tax on health plans  scheduled to go into effect in 2022.   Madam Speaker, this tax was a late add-on to the Affordable Care Act  deliberations and has been rattling around inoperable in the Federal  Tax Code since 2010, never actually having collected a penny of revenue  but, nonetheless, casting a statutory shadow over 180 million  Americans' health plans, which we know, from HR administrators and  employee reps in real life, has added pressure to shift coverage into  higher deductible plans, which falls on the backs of working Americans.    As the Commonwealth Fund recently reported, the number of Americans  who are underinsured as a result of high deductibles has grown by over  50 percent since 2005. The Kaiser Family Foundation just reported that  31 percent of employer health plans will get hit by the excise tax in  2022, and that number will skyrocket soon after.   Passage of this bill will lift the shadow that hangs over employer- sponsored plans and stop the high deductible trend from worsening.   As the bill's lead sponsor, I want to foot stomp that the repeal of  the tax does not touch the architecture of the ACA's patient  protections. Repeal is completely severable from the other 440 sections  of the law and leaves intact essential health benefits and the  elimination of preexisting condition exclusions and lifetime limits.   Given that those patient protections have been in full operation for  the last 10 years, during which this zombie tax has been in a coma, it  is abundantly clear that the tax is disconnected from the rest of the  law.   Lastly, I want to underscore the CBO determination that passage will  not result in any increase in the number of uninsured.   Madam Speaker, with 370 House cosponsors, I am hopeful that an  overwhelming tally tonight will send a laser-like message to the Senate  to adopt this bill as soon as possible, as is.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters from Families USA, a  strong advocate for the ACA, as well as the Council of Insurance Agents  & Brokers, in support of the bill, and a 2009 letter signed by 188  supporters of the ACA in support of this repeal of the excise tax.                                                     FamiliesUSA,                                                      July 15, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: On behalf of       Families USA, a leading national voice for health care       consumers, I write to offer our support for legislation that       will be considered by the full House of Representatives this       week, H.R. 748, the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal       Act of 2019. This bipartisan legislation would repeal the       excise tax on high value employer-sponsored health care       coverage, also known as the ``Cadillac Tax''. At a time when       almost half of our nation's families report that they are       forgoing needed medical care because they cannot afford the       care, policymakers should make sure that employers doing the       right thing and providing high value health insurance to       their employees are supported, not penalized with an       egregious tax.        More than 181 million people--a majority of the country--      receive employer-sponsored insurance. The Affordable Care Act       (ACA) included a provision to impose a 40 percent excise tax       on high-cost and high-value employer-sponsored insurance       (ESI) coverage. This provision was recently delayed for a       second time, until 2022. While the tax would be levied on       employers, experts expect its costs largely would be shifted       to employees and their families.        The Cadillac Tax is built on the supposition that by       exposing our nation's families to even more financial       vulnerability in their health care, families will manage to       bring their own health care costs down. Creating greater       financial insecurity for families is  [[Page H5961]]       not the answer. It is the primary responsibility of policy       makers, the health care sector, and the government to solve       the health care cost crisis. And your constituents agree.       More than 80 percent of people in this nation--both Democrats       and Republicans--believe it's the responsibility of the       government to get control of out-of-control health care       costs.        H.R. 748 is an important opportunity for Congress to       support high quality health care and the employers that       provide it. In recent years, deductibles in ESI plans have       risen considerably while costs have continued to grow. The       so-called ``Cadillac Tax'' creates the wrong incentive to       employers around the nation. What we need now is higher value       insurance, not lower value coverage.        H.R. 748 has widespread, bipartisan support, and boasts 361       cosponsors, including 199 Democrats and 162 Republicans. We       urge the House of Representatives to support working families       and the employers providing these families high quality       health insurance and pass H.R. 748 when it comes to the       floor.            Sincerely,                                                   Frederick Isasi,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                      The Council,                                                      July 15, 2019.      Re H.R. 748, The Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act           of 2019.       Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Madame Speaker: On behalf of The Council of Insurance       Agents and Brokers (``The Council''), I write to express our       members' strong support for H.R. 748, The Middle Class Health       Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019. The legislation repeals the       looming ``Cadillac Tax'' that undermines the employer       sponsored insurance market. The ``Cadillac tax'' is a 40% tax       on the value of employer-sponsored health coverage that       exceeds certain benefit thresholds--estimated to be $11,100       for self-only coverage and $29,750 for family coverage in       2022. We thank Congressman Joe Courtney and Mike Kelly for       their leadership on this important issue, and urge members of       the House of Representatives to support H.R. 748.        By way of background, The Council represents the largest       and most successful employee benefits and property/casualty       agencies and brokerage firms. Council member firms annually       place more than $300 billion in commercial insurance business       in the United States and abroad. Council members conduct       business in some 30,000 locations and employ upwards of       350,000 people worldwide. In addition, Council members       specialize in a wide range of insurance products and risk       management services for business, industry, government, and       the public.        The ``Cadillac Tax,'' has been delayed twice by Congress to       protect Americans from its harmful impact. But the latest       implementation date of 2022 continues to cause an adverse       effect on the affordability and quality of health coverage       available to employees and their families. The Kaiser Family       Foundation notes that deductibles have risen 89% since 2010,       while wage growth has remained comparatively flat.        The tax was intended to impact Americans with ``gold-      plated'' plans, but the reality is that very modest plans       covering low- and moderate-income working families will       trigger the tax. More than 181 million Americans--including       retirees, low- and moderate-income families, public-sector       employees, small business owners, nonprofit workers and the       self-employed--currently depend on employer-provided health       coverage. Employer provided coverage covers more Americans       than Medicare and Medicaid combined. This tax has real and       harmful consequences--Americans cannot afford to pay more for       their health care.        Thank you again for your continued efforts to address these       important issues.            Best,      Ken A. Crerar,            President/CEO, The Council.      Joel Wood,        SVP, Government Affairs, The Council.      Joel Kopperud,        VP, Government Affairs, The Council.                                   ____                                    Congress of the United States,                                    Washington, DC, October 7, 2009.      Speaker Pelosi,      Office of the Speaker,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi: As Congress continues to consider       revenue sources for America's Affordable Health Choices Act       and other health insurance reform proposals, we strongly       encourage you to reject imposing an excise tax on so called       high cost insurance plans. Such a tax would impact regions       with high health care costs in the short-term, and, in the       long-term, inevitably extend to more and more middle-income       Americans across the country.        As you know, the Senate Finance Committee reform proposal,       America's Healthy Future Act, currently includes a 40 percent       excise tax on insurers for plans that exceed certain cost       thresholds. Real life experience with both health insurers       and inelastic markets for services such as health insurance       has clearly warned us that this tax will be passed along to       insurance payers. Beginning in 2013, the threshold for       individual plans will be $8,000 and $21,000 for family       coverage. In subsequent years, increases in the cost       thresholds will be tied to the Consumer Price Index for urban       consumers (CPI-U) plus one percent. The proposal also       includes a transition relief rule, which will set cost       thresholds 20 percent higher for the 17 highest cost states.       The transition relief rule will be phased out by 2016. It is       important to note that the proposed thresholds for such a tax       already have been surpassed for many middle-income Americans       in 2009.        For middle-income Americans that have forgone wage and       salary increases for strong insurance benefits, these       thresholds are simply too low. And, for middle-income       Americans who live in the nation's highest cost regions for       health care, the transition relief rule is also too low and       phased out far too soon.        A Commonwealth Fund report issued on August 20, 2009,       ``Paying the Price: How Health Insurance Premiums Are Eating       Up Middle-Class Incomes,'' outlined projected increases in       insurance premiums if nothing is done to change the current       cost trajectory. According to the report, average insurance       premiums will increase 94 percent over the next ten years,       with average annual increases of 5.7 percent. The report went       on to conclude that average premium costs for family coverage       in 2015 will range from $15,508 in the lowest cost state to       $19,731 in the highest cost state. Considering high and low       cost states will be treated the same with regard to the       proposed excise tax in 2015, the average premium projections       in high cost regions teeter on the projected cost thresholds       of the excise tax.        Further, the lessons learned from the alternative minimum       tax (AMT) should also serve as a warning for the creation of       an excise tax on high cost insurance plans. Over the past       four decades, the AMT has morphed from a tax on the       wealthiest Americans to a tax on the middle class. In 1969,       when the AMT was first enacted, the tax impacted only the       wealthiest of Americans. In 2010, nearly one in five       Americans will be subjected to the tax. A similar situation       with the proposed excise tax is possible considering our       experiences with medical inflation.        While America's Affordable Health Choices Act will work to       rein in insurance premium costs, these savings will be       generated from long-term fixes and may not substantially       mitigate premium costs in the short-term before the costs of       such an excise tax are passed from the insurer to the       customer, including middle-income families.        Beyond these other arguments, there is a fundamental flaw       in assuming a tax on so called high cost plans will sway       choice of insurance coverage, and in turn, discourage       wasteful health care spending. This assumption is based on       access to a substantial choice in coverage, which is       certainly not the case under our current system. Today, small       employers pay more for a given insurance plan than a large       employer-- not because of benefit quality or an employees'       excessive use of plan benefits, but due to smaller risk       pools. While America's Affordable Health Choices Act will       help close most of these price discrepancies, this won't be       achieved until 2018 when all reforms are enacted. Further,       America's Affordable Health Choices Act will allow for       continued use of age rating with determining premium costs.       While age rating will be restricted, the practice underscores       limited choice for cheaper coverage options.        America's Affordable Health Choices Act includes sensible       revenue sources to pay for the legislation. However,       inclusion of an excise tax on high cost insurance plans, as       proposed by the Senate Finance Committee, could have       significant and detrimental implications for millions of       middle-class Americans. The short-term impact would be       greatest on individuals and families living in high cost       regions and for those that have sacrificed pay increases for       strong benefits. Over the long term, the number of       individuals and families subjected to the tax would likely       continue to grow. To this end, we urge you to continue to       reject proposals to enact an excise tax on high cost       insurance plans that could be potentially passed on the       middle class families.        We look forward continuing to work with you to advance       health care reform legislation that expands coverage and       lowers care costs.            Sincerely,      Joe Courtney.
