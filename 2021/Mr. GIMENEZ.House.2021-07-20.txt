 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my  legislation, H.R. 1895, the Transportation Security Public Health  Threat Preparedness Act. This is an important piece of legislation that  will help ensure America's transportation systems are better prepared  for future public health threats. The current COVID-19 pandemic has  only further underscored the importance of keeping our TSA officers  safe.   Specifically, this bill directs TSA to conduct an analysis of looming  public health risks to all components of our transportation systems,  working with the Chief Medical Officer at the Department of Homeland  Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, and its  transportation stakeholders. The analysis will describe TSA's security  checkpoint policies and procedures to protect TSA personnel,  passengers, aviation workers, and airport personnel from public health  threats.   Additionally, this bill instructs TSA to brief Congress on this  analysis following its conclusion so that we may rectify or codify any  important recommendations so we can protect our officers and our  transportation systems from public health risks.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues who joined me on this  legislation, and I urge the House to swiftly pass this bill.
