 Mr. Speaker, word coming out of the White  House and House Republicans is that there is a new healthcare bill, and  this bill would obliterate the patient protections for preexisting  conditions and eviscerate essential benefits and cost controls.   Under the new healthcare scam, insurance companies could opt out of  all consumer protections. In other words, insurance companies could  write fake policies with big premiums and little or no coverage.   Mr. Speaker, under this plan, a parent of a kid who is struck with  childhood cancer could still buy a policy, but the policy is worthless  because the policy would not have to cover their children's cancer  treatment.   This is how House Republicans and the insurance lobby plan to get out  from under their obligation to cover preexisting conditions.   This means more power for the insurance companies and less protection  for good people, the American people, who play by the rules. This plan  should be rejected again. It is deceitful, cold, cruel, and wrong.                            ____________________
