 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a  remarkable woman and a remarkable Wisconsinite, Patricia Finder-Stone.  She was simply incredible: a wife, a mother, a grandmother, an  educator, a veteran, and a community activist. Her life serves as an  example of what it really means to be passionately involved in a  community and committed to giving back.   During the Korean war, she left her nursing job in Chicago to serve  her country in the Air Force where she proudly served at the Northeast  Air Command in Greenland, and upon leaving the military, she married  her husband, Mark, and raised their four children in northeast  Wisconsin.   Pat then returned to school and received her bachelor's degree from  the University of Wisconsin Green Bay and her master's from UW-Madison,  graduating both times with honors.   She practiced nursing throughout her life and spread her passion for  nursing to others by teaching at schools around Wisconsin including  Bellin College of Nursing and Northeast Wisconsin Technical College.  She was well known and incredibly involved in the healthcare community  and was a proud recipient of both the American Cancer Society's St.  George National Award and the NWTC Teacher of the Year Award.    Beyond her nursing career, Pat was an active community volunteer,  sharing her time and talents to serve on the boards of multiple health  advocacy groups in northeast Wisconsin.   She worked with both Democrat and Republican leadership in Wisconsin  on a number of health policy issues, including educating the public on  the negative effects of tobacco and improving care for the aging  population.   She served as the president of the League of Women Voters of Greater  Green Bay and sat on the state board of the League of Women Voters.   Pat's extraordinary life of service to her family, community, and  country reminds us all of the importance of community engagement and  civic responsibility. Pat's passing will be mourned for many across  northeast Wisconsin, and her impact on our community will not soon be  forgotten. But my hope is her life stands as a reminder of how  important it is to be involved and how lucky we all are to be  Americans.   There are a lot of people when you are a Member of Congress who come  into your office. Some are angry with you, some are happy with you, but  some really find a way past the political moment and find a way to  touch your heart, and Pat was one of those people. My prayers and  condolences go out to her family and to all the lives she has touched.                            ____________________
