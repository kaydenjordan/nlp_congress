 Mr. Speaker, everybody is obsessed with inflation, as  well they should be obsessed, but there are so many stories out there  that the mainstream media is not covering that the American public  ought to be aware of.   Right now, ICE is proposing identification cards for illegal  immigrants. First of all, we have a situation in which there are over  170,000 people allowed in this country every month who should probably  not even be here illegally.   Why is this?   Already we promised free healthcare, and I think in many cases people  coming here illegally are getting more healthcare or easier access to  healthcare than people are originally. They are allowed to travel all  around the country.   Now there is already a concern in my State that many illegal  immigrants are getting public benefits, as well. I am afraid that these  cards will be used to further solidify the programs to give free public  benefits to those people who shouldn't be here.   I hope the press looks into it.                            ____________________
