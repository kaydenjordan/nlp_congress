 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my serious  concern with the inappropriately and euphemistically named ``Paycheck  Fairness Act.'' In reality, this legislation should be called the  ``Leave No Lawyer Behind Act.''   I am sure everyone in this room believes that equal work deserves  equal pay. In fact, Congress passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963 to ensure  that. But that is not what Democrats have put this legislation on the  floor for. Instead, they wanted something to benefit trial lawyers and  to make it nearly impossible for job creators to defend against  frivolous, unlimited lawsuits.   In fact, this legislation is actually harmful to women in the  workforce by creating a mandatory opt-out system for class action  lawsuits that will ultimately limit legal options when there actually  is workplace discrimination.   This legislation is all about litigation, and that is not right.  Enforce existing laws effectively. That will protect women, and  everyone, in the workplace.   The number of working women in the U.S. is higher than ever--nearly  75 million--with more women entering the workforce in the last 2 years  than men. That is the type of fairness we should continue to strive  for.   I support policies that help more women become their own boss, not  unlimited paydays for trial lawyers.                            ____________________
