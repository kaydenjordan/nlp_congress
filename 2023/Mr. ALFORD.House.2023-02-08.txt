 Madam Speaker, I rise today in response to the  President's State of the Union Address.   While the state of the Union was the focus last night, today, I am  more concerned about the state of the President.   Just hours ago, the President of the United States stood in this very  room right behind me and told one of the greatest tales that I have  seen in modern history, attempting to tout optimism, curbed inflation,  and a secure nation.   However, this failing, flailing, incompetent chief executive ran from  the fact that he welcomed more than 4 million illegal aliens into our  sovereign Nation, he reversed our energy independence, he let the  Chinese spy balloon float entirely over our Nation with impunity,  flying over Whiteman Air Force Base, home of the B-2 Stealth bomber.   The state of our Union is strong. The state of our President is weak.   We don't need more yelling, Mr. President. We need more healing in  America.   Some 40 years ago, President Ronald Reagan said, It is time for us to  reassert our trust in God. It is time for us to realize that we need  Him more than He needs us. It is time to turn to God for the healing of  America. Let's get about the business of healing America.
