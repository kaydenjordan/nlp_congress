 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment, which would strip Federal funding for the Delaware River  Basin Commission. This amendment would remove $715,000, funding that I  secured through the community project funding process.   This amount is mere pennies within the entire Federal budget and  provides an outsized return on investment for the millions of Americans  who rely on the Delaware River Basin for clean water and recreational  use.                                time  1830    The basin provides drinking water to over 14.2 million people and  contributes approximately $22 billion in annual economic activity.   The Delaware River Basin provides immense value to the region, and  the Federal Government's small but critical role in managing the  region's water resources is vital to maintaining the Commission's work.   This amendment is an assault on the communities that rely on the  resources and the economy of the basin, and it is an attack on those  who have fought to secure this necessary funding for the next fiscal  year; therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, needless to say, I disagree with the  premise of my wonderful colleague across the aisle.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms.  Kaptur), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water  Development.    Mr. Chairman, I simply say as we finalize this  discussion, that there are 14.2 million people who are being affected,  who will be affected, and who think this is important.   There is a $22 billion economic activity that will be impacted.  Needless to say, I have chosen this as a project that I support because  in the time that I have had the opportunity to serve the 12th  Congressional District in the State of New Jersey, this is an issue  that I find very important. I do hope that my colleagues will oppose  this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
