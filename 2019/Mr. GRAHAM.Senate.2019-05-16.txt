 Mr. President, for over 50 years, our Nation has  preserved an annual tradition of honoring the brave men and women of  law enforcement who make the ultimate sacrifice. This act of  remembrance dates back to President John F. Kennedy's designation of a  ``Peace Officers Memorial Day'' in 1962, which has evolved over the  years to become National Police Week. Police Week now includes a  weeklong celebration of our law enforcement officers and recognition  for their sacrifices.   Tens of thousands from the law enforcement community have descended  upon Washington this week, as they gather near the National Law  Enforcement Memorial to remember their colleagues and their families.  The memorial was dedicated in 1991 to honor our local, State, and  Federal law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. The long  gray walls are curved in a way that makes them appear to go on forever.  Over 21,000 names are permanently inscribed into the marble walls as a  reminder of the cost of maintaining a free, safe, and civil society.   On Wednesday, the 38th Annual National Peace Officers' Memorial  Service was held right outside on the West Front of the Capitol. During  this solemn ceremony, the names of 228 brave men and women were read in  honor of their priceless contribution to their fellow citizens.   Among those being remembered this week are six from my home State of  South Carolina. Sergeant Terrence Carraway of the Florence Police  Department, Detective Micheal Doty of  [[Page S2918]]  the York County Sheriff's Office, Corporal Dale Hallman of the Saluda  County Sheriff's Office, Deputy James Kirk, Jr., of the Lancaster  County Sheriff's Office, Deputy Farrah Turner of the Florence County  Sheriff's Office, and Deputy Jerry Hurd, Jr., of the Richland County  Sheriff's Office will all be memorialized on those stone walls. Their  names will be a perpetual reminder to future generations of the high  cost of keeping South Carolinians safe. We honor them, their families,  and all of the other brave men and women who died while protecting our  communities.   While every officer deserves to have their story heard, I would like  to call attention to Sergeant Carraway and Deputy Turner. On October 3,  2018, Florence County law enforcement executed a warrant on an  individual accused of sexual assault on a child. As they arrived on  scene, the officers were ambushed by the suspect's father. When the  officers got out of their vehicles, the father started shooting at  them. The standoff and the shooting continued for 2 long hours. Despite  the danger, the officers did not retreat, but continued to fight. After  all was said and done, a total of seven law enforcement personnel had  been shot. Sadly, both Sergeant Carraway and Deputy Turner were  mortally wounded.   I was fortunate enough to attend Sergeant Carraway's memorial service  in Florence. It was a beautiful tribute to a life of service. This man  was a decorated police officer, Air Force Reservist, coach, mentor,  loving husband, father, and friend. Like many of those we are  remembering this week, the Terrance Carraway's of the world are the  foundation of America's goodness.   This is but one small example of how our law enforcement officers put  themselves in harm's way for the betterment of the community on a daily  basis. These officers answered a call to take a suspect off the street,  and it cost them their lives. It is our duty to honor and remember  their contribution and their sacrifice.   Earlier this week I introduced a resolution to commemorate National  Police Week. Included are the names of 159 brave men and women who  answered the call of duty, but were sadly taken from us in 2018. This  resolution has unanimous, bipartisan support and honors those who have  given their lives in fulfilling this noble calling. I want to thank my  99 Senate colleagues who signed on as cosponsors of this measure.   In trying to grasp the essence of National Police Week, I think  President George H. W. Bush summed it up best. During the  groundbreaking ceremony for the National Law Enforcement Memorial in  1989, President Bush said, ``The story to be carved on these walls is  the story of America, of a continuing quest to preserve both democracy  and decency and to protect a national treasure that we call the  American dream.'' I am proud to echo his words today and, along with my  colleagues, ensure the story of our heroes is told. I encourage all  Americans to take a moment this week to reflect on how law enforcement  positively affects their own community. These officers show up every  day on behalf of their fellow citizens to serve and protect the  American dream that President Bush spoke of nearly 30 years ago. Join  me in remembering the fallen, and let us ensure their sacrifice is  never forgotten.                            ____________________
