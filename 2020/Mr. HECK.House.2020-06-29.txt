 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Waters. I rise in support  of H.R. 7301, and I thank the chair for including my legislation, the  Emergency Rental Assistance Act, in this bill.   In 2 days, the rent comes due, and as we face historic levels of  unemployment, far too many are going to come up short in their rent  payment. Failure to address the rent crisis will have dire consequences  for millions of Americans and for the housing ecosystem that fortifies  our economy.   Our legislation has 150 House sponsors and the endorsement of almost  700 organizations, and it passed the House as a part of the HEROES Act.  It provides $100 billion in rental assistance through the Emergency  Solutions Grants program. It would change the lives of millions of  tenants across the country who have been hit hard by the COVID-19  crisis.   Over 10 million families pay more than half of their incomes for  rent. As job losses continue and eviction moratoriums expire, that is  not going to improve. We must protect the housing ecosystem.   Residential rent payments are $50 billion each month and represent a  chain of payment between staff, maintenance, and contractors. As  unemployment claims remain at historic highs, we can't afford to lose  those jobs.   This legislation is also for mom-and-pop landlords. Yes, they own  more than half of the 20 million rental properties, and they can't  afford a big rental income loss for a sustained period.   If we do nothing to stop the spike in evictions, in homelessness,  communities of color will be hardest hit. We need to be fighting  systemic racism, not exacerbating it.   So support this legislation. Keep Americans safely in their homes  throughout the pandemic. Save the renters. Save the jobs. Save the  housing ecosystem by voting ``yes'' on this measure.
