 Mr. President, this morning I drove from Cleveland to  Youngstown. I was in Youngstown, OH--Mahoning Valley--at Teamsters  Local 377 talking to workers. There were maybe 200 of them in the room,  mostly retirees who are in danger of having their pensions cut-- pensions they earned over a lifetime of hard work.   To understand how that happens, when workers are at the bargaining  table, whether it is Teamsters, electricians, Steelworkers or SCIU,  they so often are willing to give up wages today in order to have a  secure retirement in 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years.   That is what these workers chose to do. They chose to give up wages.  Whether they worked for Schwebel's in Youngstown, whether they worked  for Roadway, over the road, whether they were working for any number of  companies, they were willing, at the bargaining table, to give up  higher wages today to have money to set aside that was then invested  often in Wall Street. We will get to that in a minute. It is bad enough  Wall Street squandered those workers' money. It is worse that the  government that is supposed to look out for these workers simply isn't  doing it. One of the retired workers, Ed Barker, told us: We did our  part. Now it is time for Members of Congress to cross party lines and  do theirs.   We talk a good game in this body about how we respect workers and  respect their work, but I am not sure we always live that. If we really  value a hard day's work in this country, we start by keeping our  promise to these hard-working Ohioans, Virginians, Montanans, and all  over this country. We keep our promise to those hard-working people in  our country, but we can't end there. That is just the beginning of what  we need to do to ensure that hard work pays off for ordinary Americans.   During his campaign, Candidate Trump made a lot of big promises to  workers in Ohio. He ran some of his big rallies across our State. He  made big promises to workers in Ohio and across the country. He told  them he would put American workers first. Well, the White House today  looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives, and many of the people  the President has put in charge have a record of doing the opposite of  putting American workers first.   That is certainly true of Peter Robb, the nominee to serve as the  general  [[Page S7010]]  counsel of the National Labor Relations Board. Mr. Robb has spent his  career working to strip workers of their rights, defend corporations  accused of mistreating workers, and he has tried to undermine the  watchdog agency he is now seeking to join. He will be working at the  National Labor Relations Board, which is supposed to strike a balance  and advocate only for American workers. The President's nominee is  someone who received a very high salary building his career defending  corporations accused of mistreating workers, working to strip workers  of their rights, and trying to undermine the NLRB's effort to get a  fair shake and build a level playing field for workers.   Someone who views unions and collective bargaining as a threat to be  dealt with was primarily the story of Mr. Robb's career, instead of  helping to protect the central rights for workers. A person like that  has no business serving as the top lawyer for the National Labor  Relations Board.   His nomination is just the latest in a long line of evidence that  work simply isn't valued in this country the way it used to be. People  in Ohio and around the country work harder. They work more days, more  hours, longer hours, harder than ever before, and they have less to  show for it.   Over the past 40 years, GDP has gone up, corporate profits have gone  up, and executive compensation has gone up--all because of the  productivity of the American worker, but, fundamentally, the workers  haven't shared in the wealth they have created. Again, GDP goes up,  profits go up, executive salaries go up, productivity goes up, but  workers' wages are stagnant or worse. We know that.   We also know people in this body rarely side with workers in that  equation. One major reason the economic growth has not brought higher  wages to workers is Americans are less likely to have a union card to  protect them. When Americans reminisce about the good jobs that  disappeared, I am willing to bet most of those jobs were union.   As manufacturing employment declined, the share of workforce  represented by unions declined with it--only more rapidly. I can accept  that the workforce is changing, but what we can't accept is more and  more of our workers are paid less in wages, have fewer benefits, and  have little economic security.   It is no coincidence that over the same timeframe, economic growth in  this country has been shared among fewer and fewer Americans. Keep in  mind, as the 1 percent gets richer, they take more and more of the  profits, they take more of the productivity gains, and workers are left  further behind.   We know what will happen with this so-called tax reform that is being  considered in the House. They are then going to negotiate it right down  the hall here in the majority leader's office the same way they did  healthcare. They will be right down the hall in the majority leader's  office with lots of lobbyists but no light shone, no public, and no  media coverage.   We know what happens. We know what happens with tax reform like that.  The rich get richer and the middle class shrinks. That is the story of  those Teamsters in Youngstown today. As I walked with the crowd of  Teamsters, I spoke with a number of them on the way in and the way out.  I asked how long they had driven a truck. Most had driven 30, some 40,  and a few 45 years. They worked that hard. They gave up wages today so  they would have a pension in the future. Yet, right now, because of  Wall Street misfeasance and malfeasance, in large part, and because  government, the people in this body don't have the guts to stand up for  these workers, we know what has happened to their pensions, and we know  what will happen to their pensions if we don't step in and do the right  thing come December this year.   We know what will happen with the tax reform bill, again, written  down the hall in the majority leader's office--the same thing. The  wealthiest 1 percent get richer. The rich get richer and the powerful  get more power and what happens is, the middle class shrinks. We know  that.   Last week, I was on the floor with many of my colleagues talking  about a case before the Supreme Court--Janus v. AFSCME. The case is  part of a decades-long attempt to chip away at workers' power in the  workplace. Mr. Robb has been part of that effort. The nominee to be the  top lawyer at the National Labor Relations Board has been part of the  effort to chip away at workers' rights, to continue the demeaning and  diminishing role of workers in this country, to suppress wages in this  country. He is the person the President of the United States wants to  serve as the top lawyer on the National Labor Relations Board.   What is wrong with that picture? He defended corporations accused of  discrimination of not paying their workers the paychecks they earned.  Imagine, he represented the corporations that tried to keep these  workers from getting the paychecks they earned. He worked for an energy  company that was working to defeat workers' organizing effort. His own  law firm's website brags about how they delayed the election 2 more  years.   You know how it works. My colleagues know this. These workers signed  a petition. They signed a card, if you will, saying they would like to  have a union election. A majority of these workers--probably a majority  of 60, 70 percent--signed a card saying they wanted to have a union  election. It is a right in this country. It is a right since the 1930s.  When President Roosevelt pushed through the National Labor Relations  Act, workers received the right to vote on a union. Mr. Robb's company  was bragging. They were bragging that they were able to delay the  election for 2 years. So maybe they couldn't defeat the workers, but do  you know what you do then? You delay the election because you have  really good, high-priced lawyers who know how to do this for  management, for the corporation.    If you delay the election for a week, for a month, for a quarter, for  half a year, for a year, for 2 years, you know what happens. Many of  those workers who signed that petition who thought they might have a  shot at the union, some of them got fired, some just left, some of them  were ready to retire, maybe some of them died. So by the time the  election is held, you have pretty much defeated the organizing effort.  That is why people like Mr. Robb don't belong at the National Labor  Relations Board.   We need someone in this job who wakes up every day ready to defend  American workers, not oppress them, not shut them down, not depress  their wages. You don't want somebody who has spent his career trying to  bring these workers down.   What Mr. Robb doesn't seem to understand is, it is not corporations  that drive the economy, it is workers. We grow the economy from the  middle class out.   I know you are going to hear a number of my colleagues who support  this huge tax break in this tax bill. It is all about cutting the  corporate tax so corporations make more money, have higher profits,  have higher executive salaries. It will not have anything to do with  wages. It never does. No matter how profitable the companies are, they  are not willingly giving higher wages to its workers. You are going to  hear from these companies. You are going to hear the defenders of these  companies come to this body, and they are going to talk about how  corporations are driving the economy; that if you give tax breaks to  the richest people in the country, it will trickle down and create jobs  and increase wages. Well, it hasn't worked that way in the past.   In the 1990s, Bill Clinton grew the economy. He focused the tax  breaks in the tax bills on the middle-class workers and grew the  economy out from the middle. Twenty-two million net private sector jobs  increased during the Clinton years.   The next 8 years, under President Bush 2, the tax cuts all went to  the rich, two major tax cuts--not entirely to the rich but  overwhelmingly to the rich. For trickle down, zero net increase of  private sector jobs. There were 22 million during the Clinton years  because he focused on the middle class. There was zero job growth  during the Bush years because it was trickle-down economics.   What is going on in the back room in the majority leader's, Senator  McConnell's, back office? It is another tax cut for the rich, trickle  down, see what happens. The rich get richer, and the middle class  shrinks.  [[Page S7011]]    What Mr. Robb doesn't understand is, it is not corporations that  drive the economy, it is workers. When the workers are doing better,  they are buying more things, they are creating more demand, companies  sell more products, the economy grows. If work isn't valued, if  corporations shortchange workers with the help of lawyers like Mr.  Robb, then Americans can't earn their way to a better life for their  families no matter how hard they work.   We all know, workers are working harder than ever before. They are  working longer hours than ever before. They are more productive.  Profits are up. Executive compensation is up. Wages have been flat.  What is fair about that? What should we do about that? What we should  do about that is not to put people on the National Labor Relations  Board who want to do more of the same.   Whenever we face another attack on American workers and their freedom  to organize, I think of the words of Pope Francis. He said: ``There is  no good society without a good union, and there is no good union that  is not reborn every day in the peripheries--that does not transform the  disregarded stones of the economy into cornerstones.'' We need laws  that reflect the dignity of every discarded stone, of every American  working too many hours for too little pay. The last thing we need is  another nominee who doesn't value work, another nominee who doesn't  respect the Americans who do it, another nominee who always lines up on  the side of the richest people in the country and always is working to  take rights away from workers, to take wages away from workers, and to  take benefits away from workers. That is the story of Mr. Robb's work  history in the private sector.   Is that the kind of person you want representing workers and  representing the American economy at the National Labor Relations  Board? I think not.   I urge my colleagues to listen a little bit more. Go to the  Teamsters' hall in Youngstown like I did today. Listen a little more to  the Americans we serve. Listen a little less at the country club, to  the big corporations trying to squeeze every last penny out of these  workers' hands, to squeeze every last penny out of these workers.  Reject Mr. Robb's nomination.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
