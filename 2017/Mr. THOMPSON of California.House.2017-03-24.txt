 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  bad bill. It is not a step toward fixing the ACA, this is a step toward  destroying health care. It was bad when it ripped health care away from  24 million Americans. It was bad when it created an age tax, forcing  seniors to pay five times that of what other people pay. It was bad  when it forced hardworking Americans to pay higher premiums and  deductibles while billionaires get a trillion dollars' worth of tax  cuts. And it was bad when it shortened the life of Medicare.   But today it got worse. Today Republicans gutted coverage for  emergency services, prescription drugs, hospitalization, mental health  coverage, and preventative coverage. This bill also prevents millions  of veterans from getting health care. This is a truly bad bill. It will  cost millions of Americans their health care. It will force them to pay  more for fewer benefits, and it gives the richest Americans a huge tax  cut. This is a tax-cut bill, not a healthcare bill. The American people  deserve much better. I urge everyone to vote ``no'' on this bad bill.
