 Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer amendment No. 5 included  in the en bloc, to increase our investment in the health workforce and  to decrease spending for the Office of the Secretary of HHS, who has  driven this historic health workforce shortage.   In December of 2020, Congress passed the No Surprises Act, which was  the result of a yearslong effort to ban surprise medical bills in a way  that both takes the patient out of the middle and sets up a fair  process for the provider and payer to negotiate the resulting bill.   Unfortunately, the administration has implemented the policy in such  a way that has tilted the scales in favor of the big insurance  companies at every possible turn.   Historically, Medicare has reimbursed physicians for their services  at a lower rate than private insurance, which is why many providers  don't even accept Medicare. In fact, 42 percent of psychiatrists don't  accept Medicare patients. Most providers rely on private insurance to  keep their practices open.   Now, due to the botched implementation of the No Surprises Act,  private insurance companies are paying the same or less than Medicare,  which, as we unfortunately predicted, is forcing doctors to close their  practices and decreases access to patient care.   Someone told me a long time ago, if you are losing money on every  patient, you can't make up for it on volume. The fact of the matter is  that the Secretary is not enforcing the No Surprises Act as written.   Once an out-of-network bill is generated, we set up a 30-30-30-day  timeline. The doctor and insurance company have 30 days to agree on a  payment amount, or else either side can initiate the arbitration  process. The arbiter has 30 days to determine the appropriate payment,  and then the insurance company has 30 days to pay the provider.   This timeline is simply not happening in a majority of cases. On  average, it takes 236 days for a payment dispute to be resolved and  paid. A recent survey found that after arbitration, 52 percent of the  insurance companies aren't making payments at all.   Unfortunately, the Secretary has implemented this policy poorly and  without serious enforcement. As a result, doctors are leaving the  workforce in droves. Forcing doctors to provide care for which they may  never receive payment is unsustainable.   Because the Secretary is perpetuating the healthcare workforce  shortage, this amendment would decrease the Office of the Secretary of  HHS and increase the top line of the HRSA Health Workforce accounts.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to support this amendment, which would  penalize the Secretary for driving the health workforce shortage.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to  increase funding for Project BioShield from $820 million to $870  million, with the funds coming from taking money from the recurring  expense fund for buildings and facilities at HHS.   Mr. Chairman, medical countermeasures are important. We know that the  chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats are real in  this world and that there is no natural market incentive for private  industry to invest in developing countermeasures despite their critical  importance to national security. That is exactly why Congress  authorized Project BioShield almost 20 years ago, in 2004, which  incentivizes industry to invest in these products despite the fact that  there is no natural market incentive.   The program provides multiyear funding to support advanced research,  clinical development, manufacturing, and procurement. BioShield  responds to national security threats identified by the Department of  Homeland Security's material threat determination process.   According to the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures  Enterprise, or PHEMCE, their multiyear budget, BARDA's Project  BioShield would need $1.7 billion in fiscal year 2024 to develop and  support the candidates in the smallpox, radiological, nuclear, broad- spectrum antimicrobials, Ebola, and chemical countermeasure portfolios.  That is in contrast to the $820 million that is in the underlying bill.  Again, the experts have said we need $1.7 billion.   Additionally, last year, the House included report language in the  fiscal year 2023 omnibus that asked BARDA to compile a procurement  strategy for novel antimicrobials. BARDA then included this objective  in their 5-year strategic plan, but it was, of course, way underfunded.  This amendment would allow them to move forward with these activities  to provide additional funding, which could be used for the procurement  of new antimicrobials.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to support this amendment, which would  increase funding for Project BioShield to $870 million, and I reserve  the balance of my time.  [[Page H5783]]         Mr. Chair, to pay for this, we take money from the NIH  buildings and facilities. That is true. However, Mr. Chairman, you know  that the way CBO works is that we had to take it from that fund because  we expect that money to be replaced from the nonrecurring expense fund  at HHS. The CBO won't score it as a savings, but they will score it as  a savings if you take it from NIH.   Mr. Chair, I get it. Nobody understands how CBO works. It makes no  sense. Nevertheless, that money could be backfilled easily because, Mr.  Chair, that nonrecurring expense fund at HHS is a slush fund with $1.8  billion in it unspent with moneys each year authorized in the bills to  be rolled over to the next year, so there is $1.8 billion sitting at  HHS.   Mr. Chair, that money would be much better spent on countermeasures.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Chair, the dangers in the world are immense. China  and North Korea both, obviously, are nuclear and nonconventional  weapons threats. We are looking at a war in Israel right now with the  possibility that Iran could make a dirty bomb. There are nuclear  threats. We need countermeasures. We need to spend money on  countermeasures.   Just as we are spending $880 billion on what I call kinetic defense,  we need to spend money on nonkinetic defense. One of the things we need  to do is fund Project BioShield because that is where we develop these  countermeasures.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment. It would take $59  million that HHS would transfer out of a $1.8 billion fund that they  have unspent and use that money for countermeasures.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is similar to the last one.  It takes money from the NIH buildings and facilities funds, which,  under authorization of law, can be transferred back from HHS'  nonrecurring expense fund and transfers $100 million of that to the  Strategic National Stockpile.   The Strategic National Stockpile is the only program dedicated to  having civilian medical countermeasures on hand to respond to chemical,  biological, radiological, and nuclear threats that may occur on U.S.  soil.   From what we are seeing in Israel now to the current Marburg virus  outbreak in Equatorial Guinea, these threats are real and growing.   Again, according to the PHEMCE multiyear budget, in fiscal year 2024,  the stockpile would need $1.96 billion, almost $2 billion, to meet  current stockpiling needs. Yet, in the bill is less than $1 billion.   The sharp increase that they feel is necessary--again, these are the  experts in these countermeasures--is largely due to needed investment  in the anthrax, Ebola, and smallpox portfolios. When we underfund that  stockpile, then risky decisions have to be made. A prior annual review  proposed reducing anthrax vaccine and antibiotic holdings. This  amendment provides funds that will help meet the goals that have been  identified by these experts.   I appreciate the Appropriations Committee including my requested  report language directing the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and  Readiness in coordination with the intelligence community to provide  annual classified threat briefings to Members of Congress.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to support this amendment, which is  vital to our national security, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I agree with the gentlewoman from Connecticut  when she said we need to fund the SNS. That is the bottom line. Mr.  Chair, you read the Constitution like I read it. National Defense is  one of the things outlined for Congress in the Constitution.   We don't have adequate defense stockpiles in the Strategic National  Stockpile.   Let's talk smallpox, for example. We had 200 million doses back in  2018. A lot of those have expired. The bottom line is that anthrax has  a 30 percent mortality rate. We need a vaccine for every American,  everyone living in the United States.   It is that simple, because anthrax, Mr. Chair, is not something you  have to develop in the Wuhan Institute of Virology. God knows they can  develop dangerous weaponry. It can be stolen from somewhere and  duplicated. It doesn't take a First World country to be an anthrax  threat.   Now with regard to the buildings at NIH, as I explained before, Mr.  Chair, there is a $1.8 billion building slush fund over at HHS. They  have accumulated $1.8 billion in what they call their nonrecurring  expense fund.   Mr. Chair, I will remind you, because of Bidenomics and a 5 percent  interest rate, that is $90 million a year we are paying on interest on  their slush fund.   Mr. Chair, what I am proposing is we take the money out of NIH--and I  will join with the gentlewoman from Connecticut in writing a letter to  Secretary Becerra asking him to backfill that money from his slush  fund.   Enough with slush funds--$22 billion in Commerce, the Commodity  Credit Corp, in USDA; $1.8 billion slush fund, nonrecurring expense  fund in HHS.   Mr. Chair, we can't afford it. We also can't afford to be without a  Strategic National Stockpile. We need to make sure that we have the  antimicrobials, that we have the vaccines in there that are necessary  to protect against the next threat from China, North Korea, Russia, or  Iran.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 6363, a bill  that would keep the government operating  [[Page H5799]]  while putting Congress on a path toward fiscal responsibility. We  simply can't continue to pass large, bloated omnibus appropriations  bills just before Christmas, and this bill is a new approach to break  the cycle.   Moody's changed the outlook of the Nation's debt on Friday to  negative. Rising interest rates from Bidenomics, the sharp increase in  public debt, and a lack of agreement on measures to reduce the public  deficit led to that downgrade.   This should be a wake-up call for all of us. This bill gives us time  to complete our work in a fiscally responsible manner while working  toward a more normal appropriations process.   Additionally, I would specifically address concerns for funding of  the WIC program. I have heard our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle use scare tactics and a straw man that this bill does not  provide enough funding for WIC and the States will have to have a wait  list for participants. Nothing could be further from the absolute  truth.    Let me remind everyone that provisions in the first CR continue in  this bill, so the Department of Agriculture has the authority to  maintain WIC participation, period.   If States need more money, they should ask USDA for funding, not  start wait lists. USDA and OMB have the authority to work together to  fully fund the program, and if they don't, it is 100 percent the fault  of the Biden administration.   It is shameful that advocacy groups and the Biden administration's  team use such scare tactics when they know full well they have the  ability to fully fund WIC for the duration of this continuing  resolution.   I thank Speaker Johnson for his leadership in restoring fiscal  restraint and supporting a new approach to control spending.   I also thank Chairwoman Granger for her leadership and dedication in  moving the FY24 House appropriations bills forward. The world has taken  notice of the unsustainable spending and debt which undermines our  credibility as a world leader.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6363 to  put us on the path to fiscal responsibility.                                time  1630
