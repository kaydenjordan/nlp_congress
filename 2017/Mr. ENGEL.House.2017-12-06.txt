 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 38, the  Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act.   This dangerous bill is an attack on commonsense gun laws across the  country. It will force States like mine in New York, with carefully  crafted gun laws, to recognize the concealed carry permits from all  other States.   This bill doesn't create a national standard. Instead, it lets the  States with the weakest laws dictate the safety of everyone else.  Thirty-one States require safety training, 35 States prohibit domestic  abusers from carrying concealed weapons, 27 States prohibit people  convicted of violent misdemeanors from carrying concealed weapons. All  of these States' laws will be overridden if H.R. 38 passes.   It is unconscionable, in the wake of two of the worse mass shootings  in modern American history, Republicans are still trying to dismantle  gun laws. It is like ``Alice in Wonderland.'' We must fight on behalf  of the safety of all Americans and pass comprehensive gun safety laws,  not this dangerous bill.                                time  1300
