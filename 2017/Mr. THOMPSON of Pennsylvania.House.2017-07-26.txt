 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the National Council on Independent Living for celebrating  its 35th anniversary this year. Their persistent advocacy has had a  tremendous impact on the disability community and has not gone  unnoticed.   Mr. Speaker, as you may know, before I was elected to serve in  Congress, I worked for many years as a therapist, a rehab services  manager, and worked in the community with individuals living with  intellectual disabilities and as a licensed nursing home administrator.   Working with individuals facing life-changing diseases and  disabilities has been one of the greatest joys of my life, after my  wife and children and two grandsons. There is something extraordinary  about supporting an individual as they set out on challenging journeys  toward rehabilitation and autonomy.  [[Page H6308]]  My passion for improving the quality of care for my patients and  helping them achieve independence is what brought me here to Congress.   Last year, I was proud to turn my experience into advocacy by guiding  the Special Needs Trust Fairness Act through the legislative process.  This commonsense bill empowered those living with disabilities to set  up their own special needs trusts, an action which was barred by  previous law. After receiving overwhelming bipartisan support in both  the House and Senate, language from the bill was included in the 21st  Century Cures Act, which was signed into law on December 13, 2016.   Mr. Speaker, safeguarding the rights of Americans living with  disabilities is a cause I am honored to fight for, and I look forward  to continuing my efforts.                   Honoring the Life of Dr. Howard Kirtland     Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize  a member of the medical community whom we recently lost.   Today, I honor the life and memory of Dr. Howard Kirtland, who passed  away last week after years of selfless service to his community and  employees through his practice, Venango Hematology and Oncology, as  well as the Kirtland Cancer Foundation.   Dr. Kirtland was well-known for his kindness and generosity  throughout the community. Those closest to him will be deeply impacted  by the loss of a man who was loved for his mentorship, selflessness,  and incredible work ethic.   Dr. Kirtland founded the Kirtland Cancer Foundation with his personal  resources to financially assist cancer patients and their families, as  well as providing scholarship money to students affected by the  disease.   Dr. Kirtland was born in San Antonio, Texas, and raised in  Poughkeepsie, New York. During his residency at the University of  Virginia, he left school to enlist in the Army. He served in Vietnam  before moving to Franklin, Pennsylvania, in the Pennsylvania Fifth  Congressional District, to start his practice.   On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania, I recognize and honor Dr.  Kirtland for his incredible life of service to those around him. He  will be greatly missed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the outstanding service of Mrs. Louise Johnson, this year's recipient  of the Friends of the Fair Award from the Clinton County Fair.   Mrs. Johnson has dedicated herself to the people and organizations of  Clinton County for many years, particularly the Clinton County Fair.   She served as chair of the Hershey Baking Contest for 22 years, as  co-chair for Open Show for 19 years, and created the Sizzling Senior  Talent Show in 2010.   Beyond her involvement at the fair, Mrs. Johnson has served at the  Monument Church of Christ for more than six decades, teaching Sunday  school, playing the piano, and serving as treasurer.  [[Page H6313]]    She has further enriched the community by teaching crochet classes,  serving residents at Haven Skilled Rehabilitation and Nursing, and  assisting at Lock Haven Hospital.   Mr. Speaker, the time and dedication Mrs. Johnson has given to her  community is truly inspiring. I am so proud to congratulate her on this  well-deserved award.   I congratulate Mrs. Johnson, and I thank her for all that she has  given in services to the communities of both Centre and Clinton  Counties.                            ____________________
