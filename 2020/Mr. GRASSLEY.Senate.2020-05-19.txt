 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3  minutes as in morning business.    Madam President, I am deeply concerned about reports  that China began hoarding medical supplies in early January while  working to prevent the World Health Organization from sounding the  alarm about the virus pandemic.   By analyzing international trade data, the Department of Homeland  Security assessed that the Chinese Government intentionally concealed  the severity of COVID-19 from the world in early January in order to  stockpile medical supplies. Furthermore, the Chinese Communist Party  Government tried to hide its actions by denying there were any export  restrictions. They even tried to obscure and delay its trade data so it  wouldn't get caught.   These acts are outrageous.   Even worse, the CIA and foreign intelligence agencies have found  evidence that China threatened the World Health Organization to stop  cooperating on efforts to combat COVID-19 if the organization declared  a global health emergency early on. So it was declared, and, hence,  there was valuable time lost in fighting the virus.   This is simply unacceptable behavior. The Chinese Communist Party  ought to be held accountable for the countless lives that have been  lost around the globe due to its nontransparent, aggressive, inhumane  behavior.   The World Health Organization is composed of many honorable and  dedicated medical professionals who believe in the WHO's mission. If  any of them were privy to what was going on by the Chinese Communist  Party, he ought to step forward and shine light on any misdeeds by the  organization's leadership.   Whistleblowers are necessary to prevent corruption within any  institution, which is why I have a longstanding reputation of  protecting whistleblowers. The world deserves to know what the World  Health Organization's leaders knew and when they knew it. The evidence  is quickly becoming crystal clear--that China is responsible for  tremendous suffering worldwide through its lies and active coverup.  Telling the truth about the Chinese Communist Party does not, as some  have suggested, have any bearing on how we analyze our domestic  response.   We should learn from democratic countries that have been successful  in containing outbreaks, like Taiwan and South Korea. However, in going  forward, everyone around the world should have his eyes open about the  true nature of the Chinese regime.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I give tribute to a lifelong Iowan  who has devoted his career in service to families who are mourning the  loss of a loved one.   From an early age, Charles Yoder knew what he wanted to be when he  grew up. He lived next door to the Powell Funeral Home in Wellman, IA.  That is where Charlie's precocious path to his lifelong occupation  first started. Years later, he graduated from the Worsham College of  Mortuary Science in Illinois. He returned home to Washington County,  where he manages two funeral homes in Wellman and Kalona.   Like many small business people across my State, Charlie's leadership  reaches deep into the community. His civic stewardship reflects a  character of service to others. He is a member of the Rotary Club,  Kalona Chamber of Commerce, Community Foundation of Washington County,  and the Dayton Lodge. His public service includes time spent on the  Mid-Prairie Community School District Foundation and the Kalona  Library.   A member of the National Funeral Directors Association, Charlie  participated in its leadership conference here in Washington, DC, for  the past 3 years. Like so many other events, the national conference  this year was cancelled due to COVID-19. That didn't stop Charlie from  stepping up to lead and help his profession navigate these difficult  times.   For the past 4 years as president-elect and president of the Iowa  Funeral Directors Association, he developed strong relationships across  its eight districts, traveling to each one across the State. Networking  strengthened his efforts to update strategic plans and foster  continuing education services.   This collaboration also helped Iowa funeral directors meet  unprecedented challenges from the pandemic. Iowans are known to  celebrate the lives of the deceased with large funeral gatherings,  attended by many people in the community, who gather to pay their  respects and help friends and family mourn the loss of a loved one.  Obviously, COVID-19 limited large social gatherings, including  graduations, weddings, and funerals.   Charlie developed guidelines to help Iowa funeral home directors  adapt to the public health crisis and continue providing safe,  compassionate, and personalized attention to the people and communities  they serve.   As caretakers in their respective communities, Charlie did not let  COVID-19 redefine their mission to serve with professionalism, empathy,  and integrity. Working with the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention and the Iowa Department of Public Health, Charlie's  leadership helped ensure the public welfare was protected and that  grieving families and their loved ones remained in good hands.   I thank Charlie for service to his community and his vocation. As he  steps down as president of the Iowa Funeral Directors Association, I am  pleased to learn a member of the next generation plans to follow in her  dad's footsteps. I congratulate him and his wife, Dorie, and wish their  daughter Morgan all the best as she starts her studies and pursues her  dream this fall.
