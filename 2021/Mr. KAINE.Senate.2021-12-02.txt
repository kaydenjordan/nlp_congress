 Mr. President, Parliamentary inquiry. This is impromptu  because I wasn't aware of this until the Senator from New Hampshire  just spoke.   Is it the case that a Senator making a live UC on the floor to  advance a nomination can be blocked from making a live UC by someone  who will not even agree to appear on the floor of the Senate?    I have learned something new about the Senate rules that I  wish I did not know.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to support the position of my  colleague.   When you are unwilling to describe something accurately, it betrays a  weakness in your position. I heard my colleagues complain about the  vaccine mandate. It is not a vaccine mandate. It is a vaccine or  testing mandate. If you don't want to get a test--if you don't want to  get a vaccine, don't get a vaccine. Get a test so you can go to work  each week without infecting your colleagues with the deadly disease.   What my colleagues are asking is that people be protected so that  they can go to work with a deadly disease, infect coworkers, and still  get a paycheck--and still get a paycheck. If you don't want to get a  vaccine, get a test. If you are unwilling to protect your coworkers,  don't demand a paycheck.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
