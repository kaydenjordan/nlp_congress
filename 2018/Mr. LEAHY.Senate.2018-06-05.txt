 Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?    Mr. President, I see nobody else seeking the floor. I ask  unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for 10 minutes as in  morning business.    Mr. President, for those of us who read history, we know  that throughout history, including at times in our own country many  years ago, the forcible separation of families was used as an  instrument of terror.   I struggle to imagine a more damaging and inhumane governmental  policy than to forcibly and needlessly tear children away from their  parents. For decades, the United States has rightly led the world in  condemning such practices as flagrant abuses of government power and  human rights.   Yet, today, in an extraordinary breach of our most basic values, the  Trump administration is now regularly employing these very tactics. It  is true that some children were separated from their parents during the  previous administration. I vocally and forcefully opposed it then,  because I believed and I am still convinced that there are alternatives  that are far more humane and effective than the tearing apart of  families.   But the family separation we are seeing today is so vastly different  both in purpose and in scope than what occurred during the Obama  administration. There is no comparison. Separation is no longer limited  to narrow circumstances where it is arguably in the best interest of  the child. Separating children, even infants, from their parents is now  being carried out as a blanket policy. It is frightening. This  disturbing policy is happening by design.   The Trump administration's decision to criminally prosecute every  adult who arrives at our border without documentation establishes a de  facto family separation policy that is going to rip thousands of  innocent children away from their loved ones. The administration's  claim that this policy is necessary to deter illegal border crossings  rings hollow. The administration has also separated families who follow  the rules and lawfully present themselves at ports of entry with claims  of asylum. They are asking for asylum.   There is simply no way we can sanitize the cruelty of this policy.  The anguish we are inflicting is evident in the story of each parent  who is losing a child. Let me tell my colleagues a couple of those  stories.   Here are the words of Maria, who was separated from her children,  ages 7 and 2, just last month when she sought asylum at the San Ysidro  Port of Entry.   She said:         [A]t about 8 a.m. they called just my two children and I       went out and they said, ``Miss, only they are going.''. . . .       [T]he officer said, ``They are here for them. Can the little       one walk?''        ``Yes,'' I told the officer.        ``Let him down,'' they told me.        The older one took his hand and they started to walk. Then       they turned around to look and when they saw that I was not       going after them, they cried.    I will tell another story, the ordeal of another mother with two  sons, age 4 and 10. She is seeking asylum from El Salvador.         I was only given five minutes to say goodbye before [my       sons] were torn from me. My babies started crying when they       found out we were going to be separated. It breaks my heart       to remember my youngest wail, ``Why do I have to leave?''. .       . . My youngest cried and screamed in protest because he did       not want to leave my side. My oldest son was also confused       and did not understand what was happening. In tears myself, I       asked my boys to be brave, and I promised we would be       together again soon. I begged the woman who took my children       to keep them together so they could at least have each other.    This is a description from a father seeking asylum at the San Ysidro  Port of Entry:         I was told I was going to be separated from my son. I       suffer from high blood pressure and felt as though I was       having a heart attack. . . . I feel like I was in shock and       do not remember what happened next or even how I got to the       detention center after that. All I can remember is how much       my son and I were both crying as they took him away.    The anguish inflicted on these parents and children at the moment  they are separating is excruciating. For those of us who are parents,  it is inconceivable, but it is just the beginning. Parents are given  limited information--sometimes none at all--about where their children  are being held, in whose care, or for how long. Some have begged the  courts for information, frustrating judges who know little more than  the parents. Some are deported while their children remain in unknown  locations in the United States. Pediatricians describe the trauma that  can be inflicted on these children as toxic stress. It results in  lasting damage to a child's health.   Who here would tolerate such a thing if it were happening to American  children? Who would defend such an abhorrent practice that was  happening in another country--say, Russia or any other country? None of  us would. We would condemn it.   But all of this lays bare the ugly truth about the true intent of  this policy: to strike fear into the hearts of families who are seeking  refuge from gang violence, chaos, murder, and rape in their home  countries. The message could not be clearer: If you try to seek refuge  in the United States, which is your right under international law, if  you seek your right, if you seek refuge, if you seek the right you have  under international law, we in America will punish you and punish your  family because you are not welcome here.   This policy unquestionably flouts our domestic and international  legal obligations. Worse, it flies in the face of who we are. In the  past, we have shown the world that protecting our homeland is not  incompatible with providing refuge to the vulnerable. We have proven  that being a nation of laws is not antithetical to being a country of  compassion. We have demonstrated that our unmatched power is derived in  part from how we treat the most powerless among us. But President  Trump's policy abandons our principles. Actually, it abandons our  identity as a moral beacon for the world.   Republicans and Democrats must speak with one voice to condemn this  cruelty. Family separation is no more a Republican policy than a  Democratic  [[Page S2983]]  policy. It is neither. It is an un-American policy.   The United States, this great country that beckoned my maternal  grandparents to come to the United States and Vermont, or my great- grandparents, paternal grandparents to come to the United States and  Vermont--this great country must not be seen as terrorizing children to  score political points. That is beneath the greatness of the United  States. It is wrong. It is abhorrent. We must not be seen as pursuing  policies with the intent of inflicting pain and anguish on vulnerable  people, on children.   I hope Senators of both parties with join me in condemning this  outrageous practice of forced family separation. We are a nation that  is better than this. We have always thought of ourselves as better than  this. Well, it is time we acted like we are better than this.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
