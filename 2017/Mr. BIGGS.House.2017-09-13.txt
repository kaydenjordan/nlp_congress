 Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Palmer for sponsoring this  amendment, which I support wholeheartedly.   I support Mr. Palmer's implementation of the District of Columbia  Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act which passed the  D.C. Council in 2014. This law limits the ability of employers,  including pro-life organizations, to avoid hiring applicants whose  personal beliefs are contrary to their respective missions.   Today, Congress can begin to right this wrong. Think about the real  effect of this law. Organizations like March for Life, Americans United  for Life, Susan B. Anthony List, or Family Research Council, among  others, whose mission is to advocate for the sanctity of life could be  forced to hire individuals who disagree with those very principles.   In the 2012 case, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the  right of religious organizations to hire employees that support the  mission of the organization for which they will be advocating.   We cannot allow 13 D.C. Council members to circumvent that decision  and strip employers of their Constitutional rights. The United States  Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to ``exercise  exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over'' the District of  Columbia.   I believe we have a responsibility to ensure the D.C. Council is not  infringing on the religious liberties of pro-life organizations.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.
