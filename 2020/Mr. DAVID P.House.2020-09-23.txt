 ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 785, the  Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act  of 2019.   Today, and every day, approximately 20 of our Nation's veteran  servicemembers and members of the National Guard and Reserve will die  by suicide. This bill is named after one of those veterans, Commander  John Scott Hannon.   One of its most important provisions is named after another, Staff  Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox, who grew up in my district in east  Tennessee.   While we cannot bring back Commander Hannon, Staff Sergeant Fox, or  countless veterans like them, we can act by passing this bill today to  help save the lives of the brothers and sisters in arms they left  behind.   This Congress, both the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees  have made it our priority to prevent veteran suicide. This bill  represents the culmination of our work.   We would not be here without the unwavering efforts of many  individuals: Senators and Members of Congress from both sides of the  aisle who have worked hard on the various components of this bill;  Secretary Wilkie and his team in VA and in the White House who have  worked with us on a bipartisan, bicameral basis to make sure we get it  right; and our veterans service organization partners that have  provided their input, expertise, and encouragement every step of the  way.   I would be remiss if I did not say a particular thank you to my  friends and esteemed Senate colleagues, Chairman Jerry Moran of Kansas  and Ranking Member Jon Tester of Montana, the chairman and ranking  member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.   I have had the honor and the privilege of working with Senators Moran  and Tester for many years, and I know that America's veterans have no  greater champions in the United States Senate than them. I am grateful  for their  [[Page H4750]]  hard work and steadfast leadership shepherding this bill to the  President's desk over the last year and a half.   And, of course, I am also grateful to my friend and fellow leader of  the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Congressman Mark Takano of  California. Since he took over the gavel last year, Chairman Takano has  focused our committee's work on veteran suicide prevention. I am proud  to stand with him in pursuit of that goal.   Veterans are 1.5 times more likely to die by suicide than  nonveterans, in general, and veteran women are 2.2 times more likely to  die by suicide than nonveteran women. It is certainly not for lack of  attention, effort, or desire that the veteran suicide rate remains as  high as it has for as long as it has.   When I came to Congress in 2009, the VA's mental health budget was  approximately $4 billion per year. When I leave Congress at the end of  this year, the VA's mental health budget will total approximately $10  billion. Over that nearly 12-year period, the veteran suicide rate has  remained essentially the same, with approximately 20 lives lost per  day.   Finally lowering that number and eventually stopping veteran suicide  altogether will not be easy, but S. 785 takes a number of different  approaches that I believe will make a real difference to veterans in  need.   It includes provisions that would improve access to care for veterans  at risk of suicide; strengthening VA's mental health workforce;  expanding the availability of complementary and alternative techniques  to improve veteran quality of life; advancing important research into  diagnosis and treatment of conditions like post-traumatic stress  disorder, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, suicide ideation, and  the connection between suicide and certain prescription medications;  and support for servicemembers as they transition to civilian life, a  time in which we know they are uniquely vulnerable to stresses and  suicidal thoughts.   S. 785 would also establish the Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox  Suicide Prevention Grant Program to support community-based  organizations that provide needed care and other services to at-risk  veterans in their neighborhoods and backyards.   The care and support that the VA offers to veterans is second to  none. Under President Trump's direction these last 3\1/2\ years,  excellent strides have been made to increase access to care, expand  veteran choice, strengthen the veterans' trust that they have in the VA  healthcare system, and more.   Only 6 of the 20 servicemembers and veterans who die by suicide each  day had used VA care in the last 2 years prior to their death. Not all  of those who have served are eligible for VA care. Even those who are  eligible may sometimes find the barrier to entry to a VA medical center  too high, especially when they already are stressed and struggling.   If we truly want to prevent veteran suicide, I believe that we must  expand the VA's reach by partnering with well-respected community  organizations that are meeting military families where they are,  developing long-lasting and meaningful relationships to help them heal,  and connecting them with the VA and other sources of support that best  suit their individual and family needs.    The Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program  would create the mechanism to do that most effectively. It is based on  the bipartisan IMPROVE Act, which is sponsored in the House by my good  friend and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations, Lieutenant General Jack Bergman of Michigan, and  Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania.   Both General Bergman and Congresswoman Houlahan are veterans  themselves, and I know their commitment to supporting their fellow  veterans is deeply and strongly felt. I am grateful to both of them for  their hard work and leadership on this bill and for their ongoing  service to this country, first in uniform and now in Congress.   As I mentioned in my opening, this grant program is named after one  of east Tennessee's own, Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox. Parker grew  up in Kingsport, Tennessee, very near to where I live, and joined the  Army after high school graduation. He was only 25 years old when he  died this summer.   I did not know Parker personally, but I have been touched by the  loving legacy he left behind and the many wonderful comments I have  heard from friends and family.   My heart is with his family and friends today, and I hope that they  take some comfort in knowing that Parker will forever be memorialized  through this program that will help veterans like him across the  country and, hopefully, save others from the deep grief they are now  experiencing.   It is Parker I will be thinking of when I vote in support of this  bill today, and I hope that every one of my colleagues will join me.   In closing, I would like any veteran listening today who may be  struggling with their own thoughts of suicide to know that you do not  have to struggle alone. These are trying times, but free and  confidential support is available to you any time of the day or night  by calling 1-800-273-8255 and pressing 1, texting 838255, or visiting  veteranscrisisline.net. It is okay not to be okay. Please reach out for  help, if you need it, please.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), my good friend, who has  served together with me for 12 years on the Veterans' Affairs Committee  and vice chairs the committee. There is no greater advocate for  veterans in this country than Gus Bilirakis.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the kind  words and those of Congressman Lamb also. It is very much appreciated.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Bergman), from the Upper Peninsula where there are more deer than there  are people. General Bergman has served our country as a marine, in  private business as a pilot, and now as a Congressman, and I am indeed  fortunate to call him my friend.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, first of all, we have  heard numerous speakers today speak eloquently about the problems we  have with veteran suicide in this country and active duty  servicemembers, I mean, a horrific number of 20, which we have not  changed at all in the last 20 years.                                time  1300    Two decades and we are still having this problem, no matter how much  money, so it was time to think outside the box, which I believe this  did. No one bill, Madam Speaker, is going to solve this problem.   We have read numbers to call. Look, reach out to a friend. If you  have a friend or a pastor or someone who you trust, reach out to them  if you are in a dark place, and then we will get you the help you need.  We will get you the resources you need because most of these decisions,  many of these, are impulsive decisions that once they are avoided, that  person can lead a fruitful, bountiful life.   That is what we want. We want you to reach out, and we will get you  the help you need to get you from the place you are to a place of a  productive, helpful life.   I thank all the Members, especially the chairman, who made this his  primary goal, suicide prevention. I thank him for that.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5245, as amended, the  SHIELD for Veterans Act.   This bill would prohibit the Department of Veterans Affairs from  collecting on debts from the Veterans Benefits Administration that  arise out of VA's failure to process changes in a veteran's entitlement  to benefits within certain timeliness standards.   Veterans should not face financial hardships due to delays or errors  made by VA, nor should Congress accept that forgiving debts is a long- term solution. Rather, we need to strive to eliminate the creation of  the debt in the first place.   H.R. 5245 would do that by addressing one of the major root causes of  debt.   Certainly, veterans can add dependents to their compensation or  pension award using VA's eBenefits online tool, and that change is  effective immediately. However, VA does not allow for the immediate  removal of dependents using that same tool.  [[Page H4754]]    Because the removal of a veteran dependent requires a manual review,  a debt is often created because VA's lengthy review process results in  overpayments to veterans that, by law, VA must attempt to recoup.   I thank my good friend and fellow veteran, the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, Congressman    Mike Bost from Illinois, for amending this bill while it was being  considered in committee to require VA to establish a process to allow a  veteran to remove a dependent through eBenefits as seamlessly as they  add a dependent. This would remove the bureaucratic and archaic hurdles  of the current paper-based process and reduce the creation of debts.   The remainder of the bill would streamline and improve VBA's debt  collection process, so veterans have a transparent understanding of  their rights and how to dispute debts when they do occur.   I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigation, Congressman Chris Pappas from New  Hampshire and General Jack Bergman from Michigan, for their work on  this bill. I also thank Chairman Pappas for amending the bill that we  reported out of the committee to address late-identified CBO scoring  issues.   I believe that our bipartisan efforts produced a policy that is good  for veterans and taxpayers alike, and I encourage my colleagues to join  me in supporting this bill today.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I encourage my  colleagues to support this commonsense bill. It is one of the most  common things we hear in our office, about an outrageous debt that a  veteran owes back that they didn't know they owed because of a  bureaucratic snafu. We have all heard these cases.   I thank my colleagues for bringing this up. We should have done this  years ago.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7105, as amended, the  Dependable Employment and Living Improvements for Veterans Economic  Recovery, or DELIVER, Act.   This bill would help veterans who are homeless, provide needed job  training and education benefits to veterans who are unemployed, and  support veterans who are transitioning out of the military and into  civilian life.   It would contain provisions that help homeless veteran service  providers meet the increasing demands associated with the COVID-19  pandemic, provide additional flexibility to fund services for homeless  veterans with children, authorize grant funding for legal services for  homeless veterans, and assist incarcerated veterans who are leaving the  criminal justice system.   This bill also contains the text of numerous other bills that have  been sponsored by Members on both sides of the aisle to better support  those who have served.   It contains the text of H.R. 8275, the Reducing Veteran Homeless Act  of 2020, which is sponsored by Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy of  California and Congressman   Mike Levin of California, the chairman of  the Subcommittee of Economic Opportunity, to increase funding for  transitional housing providers and improve case management in the  Department of Housing and Urban Development--Department of Veterans  Affairs Supportive Housing, or the HUD-VASH program, which we have used  in my district numerous times. These efforts would help connect  homeless veterans with stable housing and get them back on their own  two feet.    Madam Speaker, I am grateful to Leader McCarthy and Congressman Levin  for bringing these important issues to our attention and working to  address them.   The DELIVER Act also contains another bill that was introduced by  Republican Leader McCarthy, H.R. 5766, the VET TEC Expansion Act.   The VET TEC program was created by Leader McCarthy in the Forever GI  Bill in 2017 to support veterans pursuing careers in the technology  sector by providing them with tuition and a living stipend as they  complete their training.   The VET TEC program is very popular among veterans, with over 1,100  of them completing the program and many already finding jobs with an  average starting salary of $60,000 per year. That is money well  invested when you have veterans getting those kinds of jobs.   The VET TEC Expansion Act would help streamline processes and  authorize additional funding for the VET TEC program so that even more  veterans can benefit from it.   Madam Speaker, I once again thank Republican Leader McCarthy, who is  a champion for our Nation's servicemembers and veterans and never fails  to support efforts for them to succeed, for his work on this bill.   Madam Speaker, the DELIVER Act also contains two provisions that are  named for Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William ``Bill'' Mulder, who  tragically died by suicide in 2017 after years of honorable service to  our country.   The first is H.R. 7111, which I was pleased to introduce this summer  with Congressman Levin and Senators Jerry Moran of Kansas and Jon  Tester of Montana, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Veterans' Affairs.   As we work to restore the record-breaking economy we had in place  before COVID-19, we must do all we can to prepare unemployed veterans  for success in the new post-pandemic economy. My bill would do that by  authorizing a rapid retraining program for veterans who find themselves  unemployed as a result of COVID-19.   Last month, it was estimated that there are 560,000 unemployed  veterans in this country. The retraining program my bill would create  would put those veterans back on track to compete for gainful, long- term employment opportunities.   The second provision named after Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer  William ``Bill'' Mulder is H.R. 2326, as amended, which was introduced  by my friend Congressman Levin and my friends Congressman Bilirakis  from Florida and Congressman Jodey Arrington from Texas, who are,  respectively, the current and former Republican leaders of the  Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity.   Their bill, which passed the House earlier this summer, would improve  servicemembers' transition to civilian life by authorizing a review of  the curriculum of the Transition Assistance Program, or TAP program,  and authorizing TAP at off-base locations and providing grant funds to  community organizations that help servicemembers as they transition.   This bill is a culmination of the work the Subcommittee on Economic  Opportunity started last Congress to improve TAP.   Madam Speaker, I am grateful to Congressmen Levin, Bilirakis, and  Arrington for their continued work to support those transitioning out  of the military and for including their bill in the DELIVER Act today.   Madam Speaker, I also thank the National Coalition for Homeless  Veterans for their help in crafting the homeless veteran provisions in  this bill and the numerous military and veteran service organizations  that helped advocate for the employment, education, and transition  provisions in the bill. Their steadfast advocacy is critical to getting  veterans into safe, stable homes and back to work, and I am grateful to  them for their strong partnership that we have fostered in my nearly 12  years in Congress.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members to support the DELIVER Act  today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington), a former member of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee who I had the privilege of visiting in his  district and I know his commitment to our veterans.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman  from Texas an additional 1 minute.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close,  and I yield myself the balance of my time.   This is a bill that contains a lot of effort, as you can see, from  both sides of the aisle, both Republicans and Democrats, and as Mr.  Arrington said, trying to do the right thing for our Nation's heroes.   I remember in 2008 when I was a candidate for Congress, the HUD-VASH  voucher program was rolled out. I didn't really understand it. It is a  program that helps homeless veterans.   And when I got into Congress, I remember General Shinseki, who was  the Secretary at that time, stated that during the housing crisis there  were over 100,000 homeless veterans in America, the wealthiest country  in the world. I found that shameful.    His goal was to eliminate homelessness among veterans in the next 6  [[Page H4763]]  years. He didn't achieve that goal, but it was a worthy goal. That  number now is under 40,000, less than that. And, hopefully, with this  bill that has help for families and children in it, that we can get  these veterans off the street, and into productive lives.   You can see in part of the bill that Congressman Levin, myself, and  leader McCarthy supported, it takes veterans who have lost their jobs  and gets them skills that they can transition into this new economy  post-pandemic, and has money to take care of their families.   I know the transition assistance program that was mentioned. I know  when I got out of the military, the only thing I was worried about was  the gate of the fort I was in hitting me on the backside on the way  out. That is how much help I got at the end of Vietnam. Nobody really  said: What are you going to do next?   They just said: You are out of here.   We had this little helmet, I remember, when I was in service, with  two feet coming out from under it. And that meant you were short. You  had less than 100 days left in-country.   Well, today, we are doing a much better job with our transitioning,  and we are starting to think, when these young people go into the  military to serve our country and our Nation and protect us, what are  you going to do when you transition out?   In other words, when you go in, start thinking about what you are  going to do when your military career is over. This bill will help us  get to that. I am very proud to encourage all of my colleagues to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8247, as amended, the  Veterans Comprehensive Prevention, Access to Care, and Treatment Act of  2020. The Veterans COMPACT Act is sponsored by my friend and fellow  leader of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Chairman Mark Takano from  California. I thank the chairman for introducing this bill, and I stand  with him today in full support of it.   This bill is a result of bipartisan, bicameral negotiations with  Senators Jerry Moran from Kansas and Jon Tester from Montana, the  chairman and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Veterans'  Affairs, and I thank them for their efforts as well.   To increase access to care to veterans at imminent risk for suicide,  the Veterans COMPACT Act would require VA to cover the cost of emergent  suicide care for veterans, including those with other than honorable  discharges who are in crisis.   To make VA campuses safer places of care and support for veterans in  need, it will require the VA police officers to receive regular  training in suicide prevention.   To ensure that veterans at risk of suicide receive appropriate help  at home and their families are recognized and supported for the vital  roles they play in the recovery process, it would expand training and  support for family members and caregivers of veterans with mental  health disorders.   To support veterans during the vulnerable period of time in which  they transition out of the military and into their civilian lives, the  bill would create a pilot program to allow transitioning servicemembers  to share information about the challenges and stresses of transition  and the benefits and services available through VA and other  governmental and private-sector entities with their loved ones.   To encourage veterans to engage in the VA healthcare system and take  full advantage of the services VA provides, it would require VA to  conduct outreach to veterans who have not been seen by VA within the  prior 2 years. Remember, Madam Speaker, that over 60 percent of those  veterans who commit suicide have not been in a VA healthcare facility  in the last 2 years.   To improve care to the growing number of women who are serving in  uniform and seeking care as veterans, it will require VA to produce an  annual report on women veterans' use of VA care and a gap analysis of  the programs that serve women veterans who are homeless or at risk.   The bill also contains the text of H.R. 2435, the Accelerating  Veterans Recovery Outdoors Act, which is sponsored by my friend,  Congressman Chris Smith from New Jersey, who is a senior Member here.  Congressman Smith is my friend, the former chairman of this committee,  and a longtime champion of our Nation's veterans. His bill would create  a task force to examine what opportunities may exist for veterans to  use our country's bountiful national parks and other beautiful outdoor  spaces to improve their health and wellness. As the saying goes,  nature, time, and patience are the three great physicians.   As an avid outdoorsman myself, I know the healing benefits that  nature offers, and I am grateful to Congressman Smith for his work to  increase outdoor recreation for our Nation's veterans.   Madam Speaker, I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting  the Veterans COMPACT Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith). My friend is the previous  chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and a great advocate of our  Nation's heroes.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   In closing, first of all, I want to thank the chairman for his  persistence in getting this bill done and including Congressman Smith.  It is wonderful.   I was out at Walter Reed a number of years ago. They were talking  about PTSD, and I asked them: Well, do they like to fish? Would that  help?   Chris said: Sure.   I said: Well, I have got some of the best trout streams in the world  in my district.   They said: Well, are they going to catch any fish?   I said: They also have a fish hatchery in my district, and I  guarantee they are going to catch fish.   We had a wonderful event, and it does help. There is no question  about it.   I was just thinking, when Congressman Smith said that, almost every  weekend, I am on the Appalachian Trail, which is very near my home, or  other hiking trails with fellow vets out hiking. It is exactly as he  described. It is therapeutic. I would encourage everyone to do it,  especially now that we can begin to get out in this pandemic. I know  that has kept a lot of people in their homes where they can't get out  and they feel trapped. Again, reach out.   Again, I thank the chairman for his work on making this an important  issue of the committee this year, and I appreciate his leadership on  that.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 3798, as amended, the Equal Access to  Contraception for Veterans Act.   This bill is sponsored by Congresswoman Julia Brownley from  California. Congresswoman Brownley is the chairwoman of the  Subcommittee on Health and the bipartisan Women's Veterans Task Force,  and I am grateful for her hard work and steadfast commitment to  improving care for all the men and women who have served our Nation in  uniform.   The Equal Access to Contraception Act would prevent the Department of  Veterans Affairs from charging copayments for contraceptive items and  services that veterans receive in the VA. This would create parity  between the VA healthcare system and the rest of the healthcare  industry, which already exempts prescriptions for contraception from  cost-sharing requirements.   Prior to coming to Congress, I spent 30 years in private practice as  a board-certified OB/GYN physician, so I know firsthand the importance  of reproductive care and regular access to contraception. I am proud to  sponsor this bill today to increase access to contraception for the  growing number of women who are volunteering for the military and  enrolling in the VA healthcare system following their brave service.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I very, very much appreciate the incredibly kind words.  Some of those stories are probably even true that I tell.   Mr. Speaker, I would take a point of personal privilege before I  close. This will probably be the last time I am down here to speak on  the House floor as the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs before this Congress adjourns in January.   Mr. Speaker, what an honor and privilege it has been. And you cannot  be successful--and I think the chairman will also emphasize this-- without an incredible staff. I have been so blessed with very, very,  very competent people on both sides of the aisle. And it has been fun  working with Ray and the gentleman's staff, and I thank him for that.  They have always been respectful, and I have appreciated that.   Mr. Speaker, you know it is probably time to retire from Congress  when you have delivered one of your staff members, which I have, that  is on our side.   Mr. Speaker, it is not about us. It is about the veterans that we  serve--all of us in this incredible body. How many times in your life  do you get an opportunity to really do good for people?   I will tell you what has influenced me. I grew up in a military town,  Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Clarksville, Tennessee, where the 101st  Airborne is. My scoutmaster, First Sergeant Thomas E. Thayer, was  killed in 1965 in Vietnam. He left four children. I saw what it did to  that family. I have never forgotten that.   After my service was over--I served in Korea in 1973-1974 in the  Second Infantry Division--I came back home, saw what happened to our  Nation's veterans, how they were treated. That has changed.   I am thankful that this country no longer treats the veterans like  they did my Vietnam brothers and sisters who served.   We had the opportunity in this committee, in a bipartisan way, as I  said, to make a difference. In the last Congress, we passed the  Accountability and Whistleblower Protection bill; the Appeals  Modernization that has helped so many people; the Forever GI Bill, and  I used the GI bill when I got out of the military, and it helped me as  a young family, and I know how it transformed this country after World  War II; the MISSION Act, and I could go on and on--the bills we passed  yesterday and the bills we passed today, and we will pass Congresswoman  Brownley's bill in just a moment here.   I got an email last week. We get these all the time. We talked about  the blue water Navy for, I don't know, 10 years, I guess. I get this  email from a widow, who is a veteran, whose husband died in his late  forties with complications of Agent Orange. He served on a service ship  outside Vietnam that offloaded Agent Orange.   Finally, after all these years and the work, Mr. Speaker, we got this  passed in February, I think, of 2019. She got backpay and a stipend for  her and her family for the service that her husband had done. She was a  veteran who had served, too, but not there. I thank the entire body for  doing that because you made a difference in this veteran's life.   Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank the body, the committee, all the people  who have worked, and I certainly want to support Ms. Brownley's bill  and her kind words--I much appreciate that--and I encourage all Members  to vote for this.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
