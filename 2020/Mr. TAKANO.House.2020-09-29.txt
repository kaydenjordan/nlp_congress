 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate a constituent,  who is a dear friend of mine, Elliott Duchon, on a well-earned  retirement from the Jurupa Unified School District.   Mr. Duchon has served as the superintendent of JUSD for 16 years and  a public school teacher for 43 years. He has dedicated his career to  ensuring that our students receive a well-rounded, quality education.   During Mr. Duchon's tenure, he oversaw the expansion of dual- immersion programs to develop bilingualism and biliteracy in English  and Spanish, the creation of makerspaces and innovation centers to  introduce students to career technical education and STEM education,  and the growth of the Jurupa Adult School to open up learning  opportunities to all.   Mr. Duchon once said his greatest dream is for each and every student  to have an equal opportunity to pursue higher education. It is safe to  say that JUSD schools are better positioned to deliver on that dream  because of the inspiring leadership of Mr. Duchon.   He is also an active community member and volunteer, and a dedicated  husband and father of three.   I feel fortunate to have known him, and I am grateful for his  commitment to our community. I am wishing him a very happy retirement.                            ____________________
