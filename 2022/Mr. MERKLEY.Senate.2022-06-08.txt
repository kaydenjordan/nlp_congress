 Madam President, like millions of my fellow Americans, I  contracted COVID-19 from a close contact. Fortunately, because I am  vaccinated and boosted, my symptoms were mostly mild. However, as a  growing number have also experienced, after taking Paxlovid and  recovering, I then experienced what is known as ``Covid-19 Rebound.'' I  again had to isolate, per CDC guidance, and was not able to make a  number of votes as I could not travel back to Washington, DC, to be  present on the Senate floor.   On May 24, 2022, I missed rollcall vote No. 194, confirmation of  Executive Calendar No. 855, Stephanie Dawkins Davis, of Michigan, to be  United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit. Had I been in  attendance, I would have voted yea.   On May 24, 2022, I missed rollcall vote No. 196, confirmation of  Executive Calendar No. 896, Dara Lindenbaum, of Virginia, to be a  Member of the Federal Election Commission. Had I been in attendance, I  would have voted yea.   On May 25, 2022, I missed rollcall vote No. 200, confirmation of  Executive Calendar No. 857, Evelyn Padin, of New Jersey, to be U.S.  District Judge for the District of New Jersey. Had I been in  attendance, I would have voted yea.   On May 25, 2022, I missed rollcall vote No. 201, confirmation of  Executive Calendar No. 915, Charlotte Sweeney, of Colorado, to be U.S.  District Judge for the District of Colorado. Had I been in attendance,  I would have voted yea.

Had I been in attendance,  I would have voted yea.   On May 26, 2022, I missed rollcall vote No. 210, motion to invoke  cloture on the Motion to Proceed to H.R. 350, a bill to authorize  dedicated domestic terrorism offices within the Department of Homeland  Security, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of  Investigation to analyze and monitor domestic terrorist activity and  require the Federal Government to take steps to prevent domestic  terrorism. Had I been in attendance, I would have voted yea.   As recent, unthinkably tragic events at a grocery store in Buffalo,  NY, a Taiwanese church in Laguna Woods, CA, and now an elementary  school in Uvalde, TX, have shown, we need to be doing much more to  protect our fellow Americans. Every man, woman, and child has the  fundamental human right to live their life; to be and feel safe in  their classrooms, house of worship, and within their communities. White  supremacy and gun violence are crises that are plaguing our Nation, and  inaction is unacceptable. I am disappointed that the Senate failed to  advance this important legislation, and I will continue working to pass  it in the future.   On May 26, 2022, I missed rollcall vote No. 211, S.J. Res. 46, a  joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval under chapter  8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the  Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security relating  to ``Procedures for Credible Fear Screening and Consideration of  Asylum, Withholding of Removal, and CAT Protection Claims by Asylum  Officers.'' Had I been in attendance, I would have voted nay.
