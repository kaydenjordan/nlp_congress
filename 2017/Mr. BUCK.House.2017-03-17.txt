 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 11, line 2, strike ``The Secretary'' and insert       ``Notwithstanding sections 3309 through 3318 of title 5,       United States Code, the Secretary''.        Page 11, line 3, insert ``career or career conditional''       after ``former''.        Page 11, beginning on line 4, strike ``or any excepted       service position under chapter 74 of title 38, United States       Code,''.        Page 11, line 7, insert ``or equivalent'' after ``grade''       both places it appears.        Page 11, line 16, insert ``career or career conditional''       before ``position''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Buck) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to  H.R. 1367.   First, I thank Chairman Roe and Representative Wenstrup for bringing  this bill before us today and for consideration of my amendment.   As Americans, as Members of Congress, our job is to serve and care  for our veterans once they return home. That is what H.R. 1367 does.   My amendment strengthens this important bill, guaranteeing that the  Department of Veterans Affairs can employ the best people to care for  our veterans.   My amendment makes clear that former political appointees at the VA  are not eligible for direct hire authority for competitively selected  positions without first going through the proper civil service hiring  process.   America's veterans deserve the top care from people who are devoted  to serving them. The VA is run by hardworking civil servants, men and  women hired in a competitive, merit-based process that assessed their  skill and their passion for serving our Nation's veterans.   Political appointees, on the other hand, are meant to serve their  appointing President's agenda for a temporary period of time. Part of  their duty to the Nation is to know when it is time to step down from  their position of power.   My amendment prevents former VA political appointees from using their  political connections to jump ahead of other qualified individuals,  burrowing into a high-paying career position at the VA.   Along with my friend and colleague Representative Lieu, I have  already introduced a bill to address the problem of political  burrowing.   H.R. 1132 would prevent political appointees from burrowing into the  civil service across the government for 2 years after leaving their  political position. Until that bill is enacted, this amendment will  ensure that the most qualified workers are filling the crucial jobs at  the VA, providing our veterans the treatment they deserve.   We must protect the independence of our merit-based civil service, we  must employ the best people in the VA, and we must guard our veterans  from the failed policies and practices of administrations past.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Wenstrup), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Wenstrup), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck).   The amendment was agreed to.                  Amendment No. 6 Offered by Ms. Shea-Porter    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6  printed in part B of House Report 115-39.   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to  H.R. 1367.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 12, strike lines 2 through 6 and insert the following:        (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall       establish a single database that lists--        (1) each vacant position in the Department of Veterans       Affairs that the Secretary determines is critical to the       mission of the Department, difficult to fill, or both; and        (2) each vacant position in the Department of Veterans       Affairs for a mental health professional.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentlewoman  from New Hampshire (Ms. Shea-Porter) and a Member opposed each will  control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Hampshire.   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Chairman, under this legislation, the VA would  create a database to help match qualified job applicants to critical  open positions in order to more quickly fill those vacancies.   My amendment is simple. It requires the VA to include mental health  positions in that database, allowing it to better serve veterans with  critical needs by ensuring that the VA uses all available tools to  recruit and hire qualified mental health professionals in a timely and  effective manner.   The VA faces a critical shortage of mental health professionals,  including psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health counselors, and  peer support specialists. These providers care for our veterans with  behavioral health needs that include post-traumatic stress disorder,  military sexual trauma, and substance use disorder. Too many of our  veterans must wait to receive the mental health care we have promised  to them, and some might never receive needed care at all.   In my home State of New Hampshire, we are fighting a fentanyl,  heroin, and prescription opioid crisis that is disproportionately  affecting the veteran community. Rates of opioid-use disorder among  veterans rose 55 percent between 2010 and 2015, and overdose rates for  prescription opioids are twice as high as the national average among  veterans getting care at the VA. Increasing mental health provider  capacity will allow more of these veterans to enter treatment and,  ultimately, recover.   Our veterans deserve to be treated by professionals who fully  understand the veteran experience and veteran-specific mental health  conditions. That is why it is so important for veterans to have the  option to receive specialized mental health care from VA mental health  professionals who have the training that will allow them to build  trust.   In fact, only 13 percent of non-VA mental health providers meet the  criteria to deliver veteran-centric mental  [[Page H2162]]  health care, according to RAND. That is why it is so important to hire  and retain mental health professionals within the VA.   Right now, there are several open mental health positions at our  local VA Medical Center. They seek to hire clinical staff and a mental  health service line manager, but are finding it hard to locate  qualified applicants. My amendment will make it easier for the VA to  find such applicants and match them with the open positions that we  need filled.   There is an urgent need to address this problem. Every day, 20  veterans commit suicide. MST, opioid, PTSD--these are all crises we  need to address. The time to act is now. Please vote ``yes'' on this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
