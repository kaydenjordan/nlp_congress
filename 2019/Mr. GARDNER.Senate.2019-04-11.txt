 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it is an exciting day for Colorado. I  have known David Bernhardt, our nominee for Secretary of the Interior-- and the seventh Secretary of the Interior from Colorado should he be  confirmed today--personally and professionally for over two decades.  His roots are deep on both sides of Colorado--in the High Plains and on  the Western Slope.   We share a lot of common interests in rural development and in saving  our small towns. My experience stems from growing up in the  agricultural community of Yuma, CO, in the Eastern Plains, and Mr.  Bernhardt's formative years were spent on the Western Slope of  Colorado--an area that is a microcosm of all of the things that we  cherish about our great public lands. We both began our public service  only 1 year apart when we worked for Colorado State Representative  Russell George, who would later go on to become speaker of the Colorado  House. That is when I first met David. Mr. Bernhardt worked with Jaime,  my wife, at the Department of the Interior during the George W. Bush  administration under another Colorado Secretary of the Interior.   His personal background and public and private sector professional  experiences prove he is a strong voice for the West and is extremely  well-qualified for the nomination to be the Secretary. In fact, there  are few others who have the kind of experience that he has that enables  him to be qualified to be Secretary. Which Secretary of the Interior  has had more experience than David Bernhardt or has been more qualified  to become the Secretary of the Interior? He has extensive insight on  Western water policy, natural resources policy, and on Indian affairs,  just to name a few.   Those who have worked with Mr. Bernhardt commend him for his  integrity and wealth of knowledge on the issues under the Department of  the Interior's jurisdiction.   In 2008, after the Department of the Interior reached the largest  Indian  [[Page S2402]]  water rights settlement in our Nation's history, Secretary Kempthorne  personally acknowledged Mr. Bernhardt's work as then-Solicitor and  stated: ``His effective coordination--both within Interior as well as  with the local, tribal, state and congressional leaders--was essential  to the success we celebrate today.''   More recently, he worked to accommodate many Western States' requests  for more flexibility under the Greater Sage-Grouse RMP Amendment. John  Swartout, who as a senior policy adviser ran point on this issue for  Colorado's Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper, had this to say in  December 2018 once that process was completed:         David Bernhardt is an honest man who puts all his cards on       the table and keeps his word. I have worked with DOI for 25       years, and David is one of the finest people I have ever       worked with.    That didn't come from a partisan Republican or a partisan Democrat;  that came from a person in the Democratic Governor's office who worked  with him on natural resource issues.   Dale Hall, the CEO of Ducks Unlimited, which is hardly a partisan  Republican or Democratic organization but is an organization that does  more real conservation work on the ground than most of the groups that  have the word ``conservation'' in their names, had this to say when Mr.  Bernhardt's nomination for Secretary was announced:         I have known and worked with David Bernhardt for more than       a decade, and we are excited to continue to work with him as       the new Secretary of the Interior. His integrity in following       the law is beyond reproach. David Bernhardt is a champion of       conservation and the right person for the job. We urge the       Senate to swiftly confirm him.    Colleagues of his from his time spent working for Representative  Scott McInnis, who represented Mr. Bernhardt's hometown in Colorado,  swore he worked 40 hours a day, 8 days a week. Notably, during Mr.  Bernhardt's tenure in his office, Representative McInnis was the House  author of the bill that led to the designation of the Great Sand Dunes  as being a national park. Having now worked at very senior levels in  the Department of the Interior over the course of many years, there is  zero question Mr. Bernhardt is qualified to do this job.   Along with Mr. Bernhardt's professional career, I believe it is  important to fully understand his background and the foundation of his  interest in public lands, which further qualifies him for this role.   Mr. Bernhardt is originally from the outskirts of the small town of  Rifle, located on Colorado's Western Slope. Few places more fully  embody the spirit and mission of the Agency he has been nominated to  lead as Secretary with that understanding of this public land. Growing  up in rural Colorado has instilled in him Western values and interests,  and to this day, Mr. Bernhardt enjoys hunting, recreation, the  outdoors, and fishing.   Rifle is located in Garfield County, an area in which about 60  percent of the lands are public lands. Rifle was founded as a ranching  community along the Colorado River, and it retains that heritage today,  along with tremendous opportunities for outdoor recreation, including  fishing, hiking, skiing, rafting, and rock climbing. It also sits at  the edge of the Piceance Basin, an area in Colorado that has vast  amounts of natural gas.   Mr. Bernhardt grew up in the oil shale boom and bust and has said  that the boom and bust ``has made [him] more sensitive to the potential  benefits and the potential impacts, both environmental and social'' of  energy development. In the 1980s, Rifle was hit by the State's oil  shale crash, and he personally experienced some of the hard times that  the Nation's rural communities often face in those boom and bust  moments.   Much like the Department of the Interior itself, Rifle is a community  that is a product of its public lands and Western heritage. It is  centrally located within a few miles of the iconic Grand Mesa--the  world's largest flat-topped mountain--the Flat Tops Wilderness, and the  Roan Plateau. It represents a home base among these public lands with  there being virtually unmatched access to world-class outdoor  experiences, which is why Mr. Bernhardt has such a passion for these  issues.   His previous experience at the Department of the Interior allowed him  to fix a problem for Colorado that I was told for 8 years, under the  Obama administration, was simply not fixable. As a result, in 2018,  revenue that had been sitting in an account in the Federal Government  for over a decade that had been owed to three counties in Colorado were  distributed back to these Colorado counties and to the taxpayers who  had been owed this money. How did this get solved after a decade of  saying it could not be solved? It is because David Bernhardt believes  you don't just push the problems that are on your front porch onto  somebody else's; you find a solution and you fix it.   Prior to his current position, his previous experience includes being  tapped to be the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior. In 2006,  by voice vote in the U.S. Senate, Mr. Bernhardt was confirmed to be  Solicitor. In the last Congress, he earned bipartisan support during  his confirmation process to be Deputy Secretary.   His integrity and ability are assets that should bolster the case for  his nomination, not detract from it. Yet, over the course of the last  couple of months, the Washington, DC, political smear machine has been  working overtime to sully a good man's name. None of what we have seen  or heard in the pages of the New York Times and in other places has  been new information. I guess the hope is that we will take it more  seriously because this time around, the New York Times is the one  writing about it.   Mr. Bernhardt has undergone two separate and extensive FBI reviews  for both his nomination to be Deputy Secretary and his nomination to be  Secretary. These reviews occurred after the allegations were first  raised, and he was cleared for both positions, which is probably  something people didn't read in the New York Times. In understanding  that these claims had been reviewed previously to the Senate's  committee's satisfaction, Mr. Bernhardt's nomination was reported out  last week by a bipartisan vote of 14 to 6.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record Chairman Murkowski's and Ranking Member Manchin's committee  statements.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     Statements From Senators Murkowski and Manchin From the Business            Meeting To Consider Pending Nominations (04/04/2019)                          Senator Murkowski: (21:01)         Good morning everyone. The Committee will come to order.       We're meeting this morning to consider three nominations.       This is for the nomination of David Bernhardt to be Secretary       of Department of Interior; Susan Combs to be assistant       Secretary of Interior for Policy, Management and Budget; and       Aimee Jorjani to be chair of the Advisory Council on Historic       Preservation. I believe that all three of these nominees are       well-qualified and encourage all members to vote to report       them favorably this morning.        As I noted last week Mr Bernhardt, I believe, has the right       background. He's got the right experience to be an excellent       Secretary of the Interior. He has twice been confirmed to       positions at Interior with bipartisan support. First, to be       Solicitor in 2006 and then to be Deputy Secretary in 2017.       He's most recently served as Acting Secretary since January       of 2019. I understand that Mr. Bernhardt has the second most       prior experience at the Department out of any nominee for       secretary, is from the West-I like that-he has great       familiarity with issues that will come before him, and he's       proven that he can ably lead the Department.        So, what everybody's talking about this morning. There is--      there are accusations about his ethics. We had this       conversation last--or two weeks ago when--when his name was       before us. I think it's very clear you got some pretty well       funded groups that are working very hard, very energetically       against his nomination. We saw new allegations last week and       then this morning there is--is yet another report. And this       is all--this is all coming despite--despite the government       scientists involved saying that there was nothing amiss when       we had that conversation last week, Senator Gardner, you       certainly raised that. This week we're starting to see--we're       again seeing new reporting on old allegations. I don't think       that this is a coincidence, that we are seeing this kind of a       roundup of reporting on old stories--and I think nonstories--      just as we're approaching the markup here.        Interior's Inspector General has reviewed the matter as       part of its due diligence. It has not opened an       investigation. In fact, our staff checked with the Inspector       General's office. We were told that there are no open       investigations into Mr. Bernhardt. We have had as a committee       I believe ample time to review all of these allegations. I am       aware of  [[Page S2403]]       no substantiation of them whatsoever and frankly I would be--      I would be stunned if they were to be substantiated. I would       remind members that both the Office of Government Ethics and       the Designated Agency Ethics Official have found Mr.       Bernhardt to be in good standing.        So, again, there--there will probably be a question this       morning, I would imagine, on--on the New York Times article       that is out there this morning, but I would remind colleagues       or ask you to look into these. These allegations again       contain no new infoimation. This is recycled. It's been       repackaged. They're now focusing on an invoice from Mr.       Bernhardt's prior Law Firm. The law firm has said that it was       labeled incorrectly. Others have said it was labeled       incorrectly. It didn't concern lobbying services. We have       known about this previous work that he has had at Westlands.       We knew it back in 2017 when we confirmed him as Deputy       Secretary. And at that time this work was not deemed       lobbying. So, just because it's in the New York Times this       morning doesn't mean that it's correct. It's my hope that as       a committee we will--will move forward in affirming Mr.       Bernhardt to be Secretary of the Interior. And then the full       Senate will confirm him coming up here. I think the sooner we       have a permanent Secretary at Interior, the better.                           Senator Manchin: (30:50)         Thank you Madam Chairman and I appreciate the committee--      ensuring this committee moves forward on important       nominations. We have two of those nominations before us this       morning that I'm glad that we are reporting from this       committee and--the nominations of Susan Combs, Assistant       Secretary of Interior of Policy, Management, and Budget and       the nomination of Aimee Jorjani to chair The Advisory Council       on Historic Preservation. I think Madam Chairman gave a good       overview of that. Committee voted to--to report both of these       nominations during the last Congress, but unfortunately the       Senate didn't vote to confirm them before at adjourned. Each       time, the committee approved the nomination by voice vote and       I previously supported of both nominations and I intend to do       so again this morning.        On David Bernhardt. As a former governor and those who have       served in executive positions, that I understand it, we've       had to ask our state senators and our Oversight committees       about putting in our teams together. And I've always been       differential to allowing an executive to put their team       together as long as the person is qualified and meets the       ethical standards. There's concerns and I respect those       concerns. Mr. Bernhardt, in my estimation met the test. He's       clearly qualified. I think we all know that. He has the       knowledge and experience to serve as Secretary, knows the       Interior Department inside and out--that might be a blessing       to some, maybe a concern--and he is well-versed in all the       issues that come before him.        I spoke with him several times before this business meeting       regarding his nomination. I've reviewed his follow-up       questions for the record following his hearing. He has       answered all of our questions in a timely manner. We received       them back and I think it's all been made record. I even       talked to him earlier this week by phone again. I questioned       him again, extensively, about his willingness to be a good       steward of our nation's greatest natural resources, our       national parks, our monuments, and all of our historical       sites. I questioned him about his responsibility to balance       our resource needs with environmental protection in fairness       to the owners of our public lands, which is all of the       American people. I spoke to him about the need to make sure       that those who are granted the privilege of using our public       lands leave them in better condition than what they found       them in, which is not always the case and we've got to change       that. And I had extensive conversation with Mr. Bernhardt       regarding compliance and ethics--ethics laws and regulations,       as well as his potential conflict of interest. I was very       much concerned about that. Based on my extensive discussions       with Mr. Bernhardt and the assurances that he has given me,       I'm prepared to vote for him this morning, but I will note       that I expect him and the Department, now I've put them on       notice, hold them--hold them to the highest ethical       standards. And I've told him that. I said because I surely       will. I surely will hold him to be accountable for his       actions. He must work to ensure committee and a commitment to       ethical and scientific integrity and I intend to work with       him and his staff persistently to ensure that this is the       case. Our parks and public lands, our scenic beauty, our fish       and wildlife resources are important to all of us here, to       the people we represent, and my state, and in your states.       And West Virginians count on the Secretary of Interior, as       they do in your States also, as the guardian of our public       lands. . . . I intend to work with Mr. Bernhardt these       important issues. I've made it clear to him that I expect him       to put his extensive experience and knowledge of these issues       to work for the American people and not to people used to       work for. And to execute his responsibilities in the manner       that ensures that our public lands are not just being       maintained, but improved. Improved for the benefit of       generations to come. Thank you Madam Chair.     Madam President, let's talk about that story and ethics  for a second.   Mr. Bernhardt has spent more than 15 years of a 25-year career in  public service, and most of that time has been spent at the Department  of the Interior. While in his private law practice, he never lobbied  the Department of the Interior--not once. During his time as Deputy  Secretary, he has focused on the fundamental transformation of the  Department and Bureau-level ethics programs to ingrain a culture of  ethical compliance and reduce workplace misconduct.   The reality is that the ethics program throughout the Department of  the Interior had been, sadly, neglected by the previous administration.  The Office of Inspector General and the Departmental Ethics Office had  recommended significant resource changes that had fallen on deaf ears  under the previous administration. Under Mr. Bernhardt's direction, the  Department has hired a total of 42 career professional ethics advisers.  By the end of fiscal year 2019, they will have doubled the number of  career ethics officials that the previous administration had hired in  its entire 8 years.   The record shows that he has actively sought and consulted with the  Department's designated Agency ethics officials regarding compliance  with his ethics obligations recusals.   In addition, he has installed a robust screening process to ensure  that he does not meet with or engage in particular matters benefiting  the former clients from which he is recused. Every proposed meeting is  reviewed by career professionals to ensure compliance with not only his  ethics agreement but ethics laws and to make sure his ethics pledge to  the President is upheld.   His work in natural resources law prior to joining the administration  and related ethics agreements are very similar in scope and substance  to the private work and ethics agreements of senior Interior officials  who came before him in previous administrations. Let me say that again.  The same kinds of ethics agreements and obligations that basically he  is doing are what previous administrations did as well.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from  the Department of the Interior Designated Agency Ethics Official dated  March 25, 2019.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                         United States Department of                                       the Interior, Office of                                                     the Solicitor,                                     Washington, DC, March 25, 2019.      Hon. Elizabeth Warren,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Blumenthal,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Warren and Senator Blumenthal: Thank you for       your letter of February 26, 2019 regarding your expressed       concerns of the actions of the Acting Secretary of the       Department of the Interior (Department or DOI). Your letter       references an article published by the New York Times on       February 12, 2019 discussing the Acting Secretary's legal       practice prior to joining the Department as Deputy Secretary       in August 2017. Specifically, you asked about the Acting       Secretary's involvement with the Central Valley Project (CVP)       in California and whether his actions, ``violated his ethics       pledge and federal conflict of interest regulations by       participating in decisions that directly affect a former       client.'' As discussed below, we have found the Acting       Secretary's actions have complied with all applicable ethics       laws, rules and other obligations, including the requirements       of President Trump's Executive Order 13770 entitled, ``Ethics       Commitments by Executive Branch Appointees'' (Jan. 28, 2017)       (Ethics Pledge).        As an initial matter, I would like to take this opportunity       to inform you and your colleagues of recent developments and       improvements with the DOI ethics program that will enhance       our ability to prevent conflicts of interest at all levels of       the Department. Since our arrival at the Department in April       2018, Deputy Director Heather Gottry and I have overhauled an       ethics office that was previously characterized by both DOI       employees and numerous Inspector General reports as passive       and ineffectual. With the strong support of the Acting       Secretary, we have spearheaded a long-overdue build-out of       the Departmental Ethics Office (DEO) as well as the ethics       programs of the various Bureaus and Offices throughout the       Department.        Our top priority as non-partisan, career ethics officials,       is to prevent conflicts of interest at the DOI and ensure       that DOI employees are aware of and comply with all       applicable ethics laws and standards. We understand the       importance of our program in helping the American people have       trust and confidence in the lawful and proper administration       of the Department.  [[Page S2404]]         Please know that my office takes all credible allegations       of potential ethics violations by any DOI employee very       seriously and allegations against senior officials are an       extremely high priority. Consequently, when the New York       Times published its article, I immediately sought to       understand the facts and carefully analyzed the applicable       legal authorities. We note that the Acting Secretary also       immediately requested that my office look into this matter       and to examine the prior ethics advice and counsel he had       received.        Of critical importance, we note that the Acting Secretary       does not have any financial conflicts of interest related to       either his former client, Westlands Water District, or the       CVP generally. As reflected in his Ethics Agreement, dated       May 1, 2017, and his Ethics Recusal memorandum, dated August       15, 2017, the Acting Secretary was required under 5 C.F.R.       Sec. 2635.502 to recuse for one year (until August 3, 2018)       from participating personally and substantially in any       ``particular matters involving specific parties'' in which       Westlands Water District was a party or represented a party.       Because Westlands Water District is an agency or entity of a       state or local government it is excluded from the       requirements of paragraph 6 of the Ethics Pledge.       Additionally, consistent with U.S. Office of Government       Ethics (OGE) guidance, it was determined that the law the       Acting Secretary had lobbied on for Westlands Water District,       Public Law 114-322, should not be categorized as a       ``particular matter'' because the law addressed a broad range       of issues and topics. Therefore, because he did not lobby on       a ``particular matter'' for Westlands Water District, he was       not required to recuse himself under paragraph 7 of the       Ethics Pledge either from ``particular matters'' or       ``specific issue areas'' related to Public Law 114-322.       Accordingly, the Acting Secretary's recusal related to       Westlands Water District ended on August 3, 2018, and was       limited in scope to ``particular matters involving specific       parties'' under 5 C.F.R. Sec. 2635.502.        I have enclosed the transmittal e-mail from me to the       Acting Secretary with a detailed memorandum attached wherein       the DEO consolidates and memorializes prior ethics advice and       guidance on certain issues involving the CVP. Of particular       importance for a legal analysis of the scope of the Acting       Secretary's recusals related to Westlands Water District, the       memorandum analyzed and categorized certain issues involving       the CVP and related State Water Project as ``matters,''       ``particular matters of general applicability,'' and       ``particular matters involving specific parties.'' As I state       in the transmittal e-mail, these legal categorizations are       critical in determining whether an official complies with the       various ethics rules. As reflected in the memorandum, we       determined that both the Notice of Intent to Prepare a Draft       EIS and the development of a 2019 Biological Assessment are       appropriately categorized as ``matters,'' not ``particular       matters.'' Our determinations are supported by Federal law       and OGE opinions and though the matters involved may sound       like ``particular matters'' or ``specific issue areas,'' they       are legally broad matters outside the scope of 5 C.F.R.       Sec. 2635.502. As noted above, the Acting Secretary's       lobbying on behalf of Westlands Water District on Public Law       114-322 was not categorized as a ``particular matter'' and       did not require an additional recusal under paragraph 7 of       the Ethics Pledge. Therefore, the Acting Secretary was not       required under either 5 C.F.R. Sec. 2635.502 or the Ethics       Pledge to recuse from participation in either the Notice of       Intent to Prepare a Draft EIS or the development of a 2019       Biological Assessment. Attached, for your convenience, please       find the legal reference materials addressed in the       memorandum--I believe our interpretation and application of       the relevant legal authorities is both reasonable and       prudent.        I have advised the Acting Secretary, at his request, that       he and his staff should continue to consult with the DEO       prior to participating in any matter that is potentially       within the scope of his Ethics Agreement, Ethics Recusal       memorandum, the Ethics Pledge, or any other ethics law or       regulation. Additionally, to eliminate any potential for       miscommunication, I have instructed my staff that all ethics       guidance to the Acting Secretary be in writing prior to his       participation in a decision or action that reasonably appears       to come within the purview of his legal ethics obligations.        In closing, and to be responsive to your final requests,       the DEO has not issued any authorizations or ethics waivers       to the Acting Secretary or other Interior officials on the       topics you raised, nor have we referred any matters to the IG       on these topics. It is worth noting that the Acting Secretary       meets with me and my senior staff frequently and that I have       a standing meeting with him once a week to discuss any       significant ethics issues at the DOI. Pursuant to the Acting       Secretary's direction, my senior staff also meets with his       scheduling staff and other top officials twice a week, at a       minimum, to ensure we are aware of who the Acting Secretary       is meeting with and the issues he will be discussing. These       efforts, supported by the Acting Secretary and his staff, are       designed to ensure his compliance with applicable ethics       rules and protect the integrity of the Department's programs       and operations. My experience has been that the Acting       Secretary is very diligent about his ethics obligations and       he has made ethics compliance and the creation of an ethical       culture a top priority at the Department.        If you have any other questions or concerns, please do not       hesitate to contact me.            Sincerely,                                            Scott A. de la Vega,                                       Director, Departmental Ethics                      Office and Designated Agency Ethics Official.         Enclosure.     This letter is in response to a letter from Senators  Warren and Blumenthal and states that the Ethics Office has found that  Mr. Bernhardt's actions as Deputy Secretary and Acting Secretary ``have  complied with all applicable ethics laws, rules, and other obligations,  including the requirements of President Trump's executive order 13770,  entitled `Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Appointees.' ''   This letter from the career head of the Department of Interior ethics  professionals who served at the White House during the previous  administration goes on to say:         My experience has been that the Acting Secretary is very       diligent about his ethics obligations and he has made ethics       compliance and the creation of an ethical culture a top       priority at the Department.    That wasn't in the New York Times, either, but I think it should be.   This is not about Mr. Bernhardt's ethics or his integrity or his  qualifications; it is about the fact that he has been and will be  effective at implementing an agenda that the other side doesn't agree  with because they know he will be effective in protecting our great  outdoors and our public lands.   I am thankful there are qualified people out there like Mr. Bernhardt  and his family who are still willing to wade through the muck and serve  the people of the United States, knowing that they will be called a  liar in front of their children at a U.S. Senate committee hearing  despite letters from top officers in charge of our ethics laws at the  Department of Interior saying otherwise.   I am thankful for David, and I look forward to working with him and  his team at the Department of the Interior. I hope my colleagues will  see through the partisan rancor, see through the lens of blue or red,  of party politics, and confirm a man who--if you go back to Colorado  and talk to people like Russell George, you will learn that he has the  greatest respect not only for our public lands but for the people of  Colorado, and for that, I am grateful for him and my colleagues who  will confirm him today.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today to honor an officer of the  Colorado State Patrol who was killed in the line of duty on March 13.   As other Members of this Chamber know, many parts of the country were  hit hard by a bomb cyclone storm system last month. Again today, we are  going through another spring storm. That storm caused flooding in much  of the Midwest, as we have seen across the national news, and extremely  hazardous road conditions in my State, which led to thousands of  stranded drivers.   State Patrol Corporal Daniel Howard Groves, like many first  responders that day, was attempting to aid a driver in the Eastern  Plains of Colorado on I-76 who had slid off the road, and he was struck  by a passing vehicle.   Corporal Groves was 52 years old. He leaves behind a large and loving  family, including his parents, his partner Eddie, his four siblings,  and many more. We know that his family will continue to honor his  sacrifice and ensure that his legacy lives on.   Corporal Groves joined the Colorado State Patrol in 2007 after  leaving a career in the technology services industry in Chicago. His  family and friends remember him as a man with a tremendous capacity to  love and care for others. He was a man of humor who wasn't afraid to  crack a joke just to make people smile. According to a fellow officer,  he once arrived at training wearing pajamas instead of the required  police sweats.   At a memorial service honoring his life, a longtime friend spoke  about the encouragement and advice that Dan was known for. He always  encouraged others to follow their dreams, no matter how big. He often  spoke of the importance of family and friendship and the need to make  time to enjoy life with others.  [[Page S2405]]    His fellow officers remembered him as a man who was drawn to service  because of his desire to help, someone who always knew the risks  inherent in the job but never let that deter him from doing what needed  to be done.   One colleague who spoke at the memorial remembered Corporal Groves as  someone who frequently asked, where do you need me to be? He always  wanted to be in the spot where he could be most effective, no matter  the danger involved.   Even on the morning of March 13, as the weather was taking a turn for  the worse, Corporal Groves knew there were drivers on the road who  needed his help, and, as many law enforcement officers did that day, he  bravely ventured out to offer assistance. This quality makes for a  great law enforcement officer but is sadly the quality that we most  often take for granted.   We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Dan and to all first  responders who are willing to put their lives on the line to assist  those in times of need and a debt of gratitude to their families as  well.   I know my colleagues in the Senate will join me in offering our  thoughts and prayers to the family and friends of Corporal Groves and  all those who defend that thin blue line.   As I have done too many times in this Chamber, I remember the words  of LTC Dave Grossman, who said: ``American law enforcement is the loyal  and brave sheep dog, always standing watch for the wolf that lurks in  the dark.''   I drive by the spot where Corporal Groves was killed at least two or  three times a week, and he will always be in my prayers, along with his  family, for his sacrifice.   It is my hope that the thoughts and prayers that we offer to those  who wear the blue uniform will bring them comfort as they carry out  their solemn duties.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
