 Mr. President, Vanita Gupta is President Biden's nominee  to be Associate Attorney General. She is unfit for that role. She is  unfit because of her radical view that every single American and every  single institution in the United States is inherently racist. She is  unfit because she lacks the temperament to do the job, as evidenced by  her relentless attacks on the integrity and character of judges and  Senators alike, seemingly anytime she had a mere disagreement with  them. She is certainly unfit based on her attempts to mislead the  Senate in her Judiciary Committee hearing.   Ms. Gupta has been before the committee many times as a partisan  advocate. There is nothing wrong with that, but her past appearances do  give us a glimpse of what she believes when she isn't seeking our votes  for confirmation.   Less than a year ago, June of last year, she came before the Senate  Judiciary Committee to testify on police reform. When she was asked  ``Do you believe all Americans are racist?'' she replied under oath  ``Yes, I do.'' Think about that. The person nominated by Joe Biden to  oversee, among other things, the Federal Government's civil rights  enforcement says that she believes every single American is racist.   This preposterous idea that anyone and everyone is inherently racist  is at the core of the pernicious ideology pushed by the left called  ``critical race theory.'' But this position was not an anomaly, a  misstatement, or a new position for Mrs. Gupta. In 2005, she published  an article in the Fordham Law Review on what she called ``Critical Race  Lawyering.'' In that article, Ms. Gupta argued that ``the rule of law''  and ``equal justice for all'' and ``equal protection'' aren't the great  bulwarks of our liberty, aren't the single achievements of our Republic  and our constitutional form of government, but instead ``code words''-- that is what she called them--for some kind of twisted racism. Anyone  who thinks that the rule of law or equal justice for all or  [[Page S1961]]  equal protection are simply ``code words'' for racism is unfit for any  position in our government but especially a position of leadership in  the Department of Justice.   The concerns with Ms. Gupta's nomination are not limited to extreme  views on these topics. Ms. Gupta has made a career over the last few  years on social media attacking the character and integrity of Federal  judges, judicial nominees, and Members of the Senate. She accused four  different jurists currently on the Supreme Court of being liars,  extremists, ``dangerous,'' or ``opposed to civil and human rights.''  She must have had a macro; she just hit a shortcut button that said  ``opposed to civil and human rights.''   By my count, she has leveled incendiary attacks on the integrity and  character of around 50 currently sitting Federal judges. It could be  more. I may have lost count when it got so high. I asked her about  these attacks. While she said during her hearings that she ``regrets''  some of her rhetoric, she steadfastly refused to renounce these attacks  on those judges.   Ms. Gupta has leveled similarly caustic comments against Members of  this body, posting online that dozens of Members of the Senate are--you  guessed it--``opposed to civil and human rights.'' She accused one of  our colleagues of being ``a disgrace,'' another of being a  ``hypocrite,'' and another of ``failing her constituents.'' At one  point, she commented: ``How many of us are done with Susan Collins's  concerns?''   I want to be clear. Disagreement with or even deep dislike for  Members of the Senate is not disqualifying for any position in the  Federal Government. People are entitled to have their opinions. They  are entitled to have their political views. But honestly, the Associate  Attorney General of the United States must be able to effectively  represent the United States in court while also working with Congress  on important issues. It might be hard to represent the United States in  court when you have accused dozens of Federal judges of being ``opposed  to human and civil rights'' or being a ``disgrace'' or a ``liar.''  Likewise, I wonder what Senator Collins thinks about Vanita Gupta being  done with her concerns.   Perhaps most concerning, though, is that Ms. Gupta repeatedly misled  the Judiciary Committee under oath. Every single Republican member of  the Judiciary Committee joined a letter on March 23 outlining some of  her most blatant misrepresentations that she made during her hearing,  and we asked the chairman of the committee for a second hearing. That  request was promptly refused.   Mr. President, I asked unanimous consent that the March 23 letter be  printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                     Washington, DC, March 23, 2021.      Hon. Richard Durbin,      Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Durbin: On March 9, the Senate Judiciary       Committee held a hearing to consider the nominations of Lisa       Monaco, nominee to be Deputy Attorney General of the United       States, and Vanita Gupta, nominee to be Associate Attorney       General of the United States. While under oath, Vanita Gupta       misled the Committee on at least four issues: (l) Her support       for eliminating qualified immunity; (2) her support for       decriminalizing all drugs; (3) her support for defunding the       police; and (4) her death penalty record. Unfortunately, in       her responses a week later to our written questions, Ms.       Gupta was no more forthcoming. In some cases, she doubled       down on her misleading statements from the hearing, and in       others she refused to answer altogether. In ``response'' to       scores of our questions, she merely copied-and-pasted the       same inapplicable, general statements for one question after       another.        We urge you to immediately schedule a second hearing with       Ms. Gupta so that she can answer for her misleading       statements, and for her refusal to respond to our written       questions. Indeed, Ms. Gupta herself asked for similar       measures in the context of past nominees. On November 20,       2017, Ms. Gupta issued an open letter in which she wrote       that, as a result of what she described as ``credible       evidence'' that two nominees were not forthcoming with the       Committee, ``Chairman Grassley must put politics aside and       bring back both nominees before the committee so that they       can be asked about their truthfulness under oath. Failure to       do so would abdicate the independent role of the Senate . . .       If the Senate Judiciary Committee is going to be taken       seriously by this and future administrations, it must demand       that nominees accurately respond to questions[.]''        Ms. Gupta's misleading statements to this Committee       include, at minimum:              1. Her support for eliminating qualified immunity         During the hearing, Ms. Gupta was asked whether she       supported eliminating the doctrine of qualified immunity. She       responded that she doesn't ``support[ ] elimination one way       or another.''        In June 2020, Ms. Gupta testified before this Committee       that ``Congress should end qualified immunity in Section 1983       claims.''        When pressed about her June 2020 testimony before this       Committee, Ms. Gupta claimed those were not her own opinions,       but that she had been merely ``representing the consensus       views of the Civil Rights Coalition at the Leadership       Conference.'' But in June 2020, she said, ``I am pleased''       (not that the Leadership Conference was ``pleased'') that       reforms she had recommended, including the elimination of       qualified immunity, were ``included in the newly introduced       Justice in Policing Act of 2020.''        Additionally, during the June 2020 hearing, when one of the       other witnesses said that he believed qualified immunity       should be eliminated, Ms. Gupta added, ``I agree.''                 2. Her support for decriminalizing all drugs         When asked whether she advocates for ``decriminalization of       all drugs,'' Ms. Gupta answered, unequivocally, ``No,       Senator, I do not.''        Ms. Gupta doubled down on this misleading statement in       response to written questions, writing that she had ``never       advocated for the decriminalization of all drugs.''        In a September 2012 op-ed in the Huffington Post, Ms. Gupta       wrote that ``States should decriminalize simple possession of       all drugs, particularly marijuana, and for small amounts of       other drugs.'' This directly contradicts Ms. Gupta's answers.        A member of the Committee pressed Ms. Gupta for explanation       during the hearing, and referred to the September 2012 op-ed.       Ms. Gupta answered, ``Senator, I have advocated, as I believe       President Biden has, for decriminalization of marijuana       possession.''        Later in the hearing, another member of the Committee       followed up on the question by reading aloud Ms. Gupta's       statement from the 2012 op-ed, to which Ms. Gupta responded       that she had only been ``speaking for [her] position today.''       But her answer had specifically referred to her past-tense       advocacy when she stated she had only advocated for       decriminalization of marijuana possession, and her written       answers a week later explicitly claimed that she had       ``never'' advocated for decriminalizing possession of all       drugs.                   3. Her support for defunding the police         During the hearing, Ms. Gupta repeatedly stated that she       did not ``support defunding the police.'' She added, ``I       have, in fact, spent my career advocating where it's been       necessary for greater resources for law enforcement.'' She       later added that she had advocated for greater law       enforcement resources ``at every point in [her] career.''        These statements directly contradict her sworn testimony       before this very Committee on June 16, 2020, where she said       that leaders must ``heed calls . . . to decrease police       budgets and the scope, role, and responsibility of police in       our lives.''        When pressed by a member of the Committee that her       statement in June 2020 was, by any measure, advocating for       defunding the police, Gupta responded that she       ``disagree[d]'' with that characterization. But Ms. Gupta       used the same characterization while speaking on a webinar       just two days after her June 2020 testimony, saying,       ``Localities have been overspending on criminal-justice       system infrastructure and policing and divesting in housing,       education, jobs, and healthcare. Some people call [changing       this] `defunding the police,' other people call it       `divest/invest.' ''        The Washington Post--the same outlet that you cited in       defense of Ms. Gupta's nomination during a March 10 hearing       on another topic--correctly noted that Ms. Gupta's June 2020       statement was ``exactly what `defunding' the police is all       about. Now Gupta says she has never supported the idea.''        A contemporaneous article by Reuters on June 8, 2020, also       noted that ``defund the police'' was a term ``being used by       activists to propose eliminating or cutting spending on       police departments, often the largest expense for       municipalities, and instead funneling the money to programs       for education, social welfare, housing, and other community       needs.''        Any claim that Ms. Gupta was not aware that the policies       she espouses are what other activists mean by ``defunct the       police,'' directly contradicts how she described her own       policies just months ago.                         4. Her death penalty record         In response to a question about her prior statements       against the death penalty, Ms. Gupta said that, while she had       been an opponent of the death penalty, ``I also know how to       enforce the law. And I did so when I was in the Justice       Department before, when Dylann Roof committed the heinous act       against nine parishioners at the Charleston [Emanuel African       Methodist Episcopal] Church. And that prosecution and       conviction happened under my watch.''        Ms. Gupta's statement suggested that she had supported the       application of the death  [[Page S1962]]       penalty in the Dylann Roof case because it met the       requirements under the law, despite her personal feelings.       That was not the case. Contemporaneous reporting by the       Washington Post in 2016 noted that Attorney General Loretta       Lynch approved prosecutors seeking the death penalty for       Dylann Roof ``over the objections of some advising her,       including . . . Vanita Gupta, the head of the Justice       Department's civil rights division.''        What Ms. Gupta said was that the ``prosecution and       conviction'' of Dylann Roof, including the application of the       death penalty, ``happened under [her] watch.'' She misled       Senators by neglecting to say that it also happened over her       objection.        When asked about these contradictions in written questions,       Ms. Gupta found a new way to avoid answering: She said it       ``would not be appropriate . . . to discuss'' what she did at       the Department of Justice, either on the Dylann Roof case       ``or on any other matter [she] worked on during [her] prior       government experience.''        Further, there remain significant questions about Ms.       Gupta's temperament, about which she refuses to answer even       simple questions. During her hearing, multiple members of       this Committee asked her about her harsh rhetoric and her       attacks on the character and integrity of sitting federal       judges and members of the Senate. In response, she told the       Committee that she ``regrets'' her rhetoric. Yet, in       responses to written questions after the hearing, Ms. Gupta       repeatedly and notably refused to renounce her previous       attacks, such as her prior assertions that four different       jurists on the Supreme Court are liars, extremists,       ``dangerous,'' or ``opposed to civil and human rights.''       Instead, in response to written questions from multiple       members about her attacks on senators or the federal       judiciary, Ms. Gupta chose to copy-and-paste more than 40       times a generalized statement that she has either       ``tremendous respect'' or ``immense respect'' for judges or       for members of the United States Senate.        Our call for a second hearing is not due to Ms. Gupta's       substantive views--either her longstanding views or her new       ones claimed only since her nomination. It's about her lack       of candor with the Committee. If her answers at the hearing       were misleading about her record, and in written questions       she shifted her answers again or refused to answer at all,       the Senate Judiciary Committee cannot perform its role to       consider her nomination.        The position of Associate Attorney General is the third-      ranking position in the Department of Justice. The Associate       Attorney General oversees, among other things, the civil       litigation and enforcement apparatus of the United States. It       is critical that the Associate Attorney General be someone       who can be trusted to tell the truth. Further, the Senate       must be able to trust that the testimony of public officials       under oath will be truthful and complete.        Unfortunately, this is not the case with Ms. Gupta, and the       Committee should immediately schedule a second hearing.            Sincerely,          Chuck Grassley, Ranking Member, Committee on the             Judiciary; John Cornyn, U.S. Senator; Ted Cruz, U.S.             Senator; Josh Hawley, U.S. Senator; John Kennedy, U.S.             Senator; Marsha Blackburn, U.S. Senator; Lindsey O.             Graham, U.S. Senator; Michael S. Lee, U.S. Senator; Ben             Sasse, U.S. Senator; Tom Cotton, U.S. Senator; Thom             Tillis, U.S. Senator.     Finally, Mr. President, I have to observe something  independent of Ms. Gupta herself. The discharge petition filed today  requires that there has been a valid, tied vote in committee. That is  the rule we all agreed to in the beginning of this Congress. Yet Ms.  Gupta still has not received a valid vote in the committee. In fact,  during the markup of her nomination, just minutes into my 15-minute  remarks, the chairman of the committee cut off my remarks midsentence  and called for a vote, in violation of committee rules. I guess somehow  allowing members to finish their statements, which are guaranteed under  the committees rules, had somehow become inconvenient for the  scheduling preferences of our Democratic colleagues, or perhaps the  committee's meeting had been mismanaged and they were worried about the  2-hour rule. It wasn't just me. My remarks were interrupted. At least  one Republican Senator didn't have an opportunity to speak at all. The  Democrats simply broke the rules and voted out Ms. Gupta's nomination-- not in accordance with Judiciary Committee rules.   There must be consequences when the Democrats break the rules. Here  is what the consequences are going to be in this case. I will refuse  consent or time agreements for the nomination of any U.S. attorney from  any State represented by a Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. What we  need to have is a valid vote in committee in accordance with the  committee rules, not ramming through this nomination today.   Today we are faced not only with the choice of whether Ms. Gupta is  fit to be the Associate Attorney General, we are also faced with the  question of whether to legitimize yet again the partisan bulldozing of  the Senate's rules if those rules are even marginally inconvenient,  even in committee session. Going down this path is not going to improve  the Senate.   I will be voting no, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   I yield the floor.
