 Madam President, today I am pleased to recognize Senator  Henry ``Hank'' Coe, who has retired from the Wyoming State Senate after  31 years of dedicated service and over 40 years of public service to  Wyoming.   A Cody, WY native, Senator Coe has shown his dedication and love for  the State of Wyoming and willingness to serve its citizens. Hank was  first elected to the Wyoming Senate in 1989 and served with distinction  for over three decades. During his tenure in the Wyoming Senate,  Senator Coe served as vice president of the senate from 1997 to 1998;  senate majority floor leader from 1999 to 2000; and as president of the  senate from 2001 to 2002.   Senator Coe was chairman of the Travel, Recreation and Wildlife  Committee from 1992 to 1998, where he worked to grow the tourism  industry into one of Wyoming's largest industries. He also served on  the Education Committee from 2003 to 2019, working to ensure that  Wyoming's children had the tools they need to succeed. These are just a  few of the many roles to which Senator Coe brought his passion and  expertise, and represent a cornerstone of Wyoming public policy. Prior  to joining the Wyoming Senate, Senator Coe served 8 years as a Park  County commissioner, and in honor of his service, the commissioners  have declared April 29 ``Hank Coe Day'' in Park County, WY.   Senator Coe's service to our great State goes beyond his work as an  elected official. He was a respected member of his community. He was a  member of the Volunteer Fire Department, a trustee for the Buffalo Bill  Center of the West, a member of the Wyoming Business Alliance, an  advisor for the Regional Airport board, and much more.   I had the honor of serving with Senator Coe during my time in the  Wyoming Legislature. Our desks were right across the aisle from one  another on the Senate floor, and we enjoyed playing subtle pranks on  each other. I will also cherish many evenings at the home of his  extraordinary mother, Peg Coe, retiring to the den of her sprawling  home for drinks and unforgettable conversation. The Coes are a one of a  kind but quintessential Wyoming family of the highest order.   Senator Coe passed away today, but I have no doubt he will be an  example for generations to come of a dedicated public servant, a model  of humility, and a true beacon for the values Wyoming holds dear.   Thank you, Senator Coe for your years of tireless service to Wyoming  and for your friendship. I send your family my condolences. God bless.                            ____________________
