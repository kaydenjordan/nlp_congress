 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Burma Beal of  Bryan, Texas, who turned 100 years old on September 15, 2019.   Burma Faye Ellis Beal was born September 15, 1919, in Jewett, Texas,  to Wade and Susan Ellis. She grew up in Jewett and was known as the  girl who climbed to the top of the water tower when she was just 12  years old. She graduated from Jewett High School as salutatorian in  1936, where she played tennis and participated in the Texas State  tournament for this sport.   In 1937, Burma graduated from the Austin Beauty School. Just a year  later, she married Oren Beal. Together, they would have 3 children, 6  grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.   After moving to Bryan, Texas, Burma owned and operated Burma's Beauty  Shop for 46 years. In that time, she forged many strong friendships.  Burma was deeply involved in her community and her church, Central  Church in Bryan-College Station.   Burma and Oren also loved supporting the Texas A&M Aggies and were  season ticket holders for football and basketball games for more than  35 years.   Through their church, Burma and Oren took part in the Adoptive  Grandparent Program, in which they befriended students at Texas A&M.  They formed such a strong bond with one young Aggie that she asked  Burma and Oren to be a bridesmaid and groomsman in her wedding.   Burma is well-known among her loved ones for two things: her love for  Coca-Cola and her world-famous peanut brittle. She has collected many  pieces of Coca-Cola memorabilia and still drinks a Coke every day.  Also, every year, from October until Christmas, Burma is known for  making delicious peanut brittle to give to friends and family, as well  as her doctor, the postman, the staff at her HEB store, bankers,  pharmacists, and many more. Her recipe is so good that, when her son- in-law took it to the Texas State Fair, it won third prize.   Burma has a giving spirit and aspires to bring joy to others. During  her nineties, she made regular trips to nursing homes to visit with  their residents and went grocery shopping for a homebound neighbor.  Even now, as a resident of Crestview Retirement Home in Bryan, she  spreads cheer to her friends. She prays for a long list of people every  night and spends her time showing Jesus' love to others.   Mr. Speaker, Burma Beal has lived a long life filled with love, joy,  and service to others. I am proud to recognize her on this joyous  occasion, and I know that her family and friends love her and are proud  of her. I wish Burma many more years of health and happiness.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to recognize Burma Beal's 100th birthday.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue to pray for our  country, for our veterans, for our military men and women who protect  us, and for our first responders who keep us safe at home.                     Honoring Sergeant Major James Sartor     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sergeant Major James  Gregory ``Ryan'' Sartor of Teague, Texas.   Sergeant Major Sartor was killed on July 13, 2019, after he sustained  injuries from enemy fire in Faryab province, Afghanistan.   Sergeant Major Sartor was born September 23, 1978, in Teague, Texas,  to James Sartor and Mary Teresa ``Terri'' Pryor. He was an excellent  football player and graduated from Teague High School in 1997.   After graduation, he moved to College Station to work, where, in the  fall of 2000, he met the love of his life and future spouse, Deanna  Unger. They married in 2002 and were blessed with three children:  Stryder, Grace, and Garrett.   Shortly after Sergeant Major Sartor and Deanna started dating, he  joined the United States Army. He was deployed to Iraq for the first  time in 2002 as an infantryman assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division.  In 2005, Sergeant Major Sartor became a Green Beret and was assigned to  A Company, 2nd Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group, Airborne, in Fort  Carson, Colorado. He was stationed there with his family for the last  14 years.   During his career, Sergeant Major Sartor was deployed several times,  returning to Iraq in 2006, 2007, 2009, and from 2010 to 2011. He also  deployed to Germany and Israel in 2008, to Africa in  [[Page H7859]]  2012 and 2013, and to Afghanistan in 2017 and 2019. Sergeant Major  Sartor's service made him a highly decorated soldier.   Sergeant Major Sartor received more than 20 awards and decorations  for his bravery during his service to our country. His awards include  the following: the Bronze Star Medal with three oak leaf clusters, the  Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Joint Service Commendation  Medal, the Army Commendation Medal with three oak leaf clusters, the  Army Achievement Medal, the Presidential Unit Citation Award, the Joint  Meritorious Unit Award, the Valorous Unit Award with two oak leaf  clusters, the Meritorious Unit Citation with one oak leaf cluster, and  the National Defense Service Medal.   He also earned the Special Forces Tab, the Ranger Tab with the title  of Honor Grad, the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Senior Parachutist  Badge, the Special Operations Diver Badge, and the Dive Supervisor  Badge.   Posthumously, Sergeant Major Sartor has also received a Purple Heart  and a Bronze Star.   Sergeant Major Sartor was described as a ``beloved warrior who  epitomized the quiet professional. He led his soldiers from the front,  and his presence will be terribly missed.''   Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Major Sartor was a fearless leader and a  decorated soldier. His selfless devotion to protect our country will be  forever remembered. Furthermore, he will be forever remembered as a  devoted husband, a father, a son, a soldier, a selfless servant, and a  loyal friend to many.    All Americans thank him and his family for their service and their  sacrifice for our country. His sacrifice truly reflects the words of  Jesus in John 15:13: ``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man  lay down his life for his friends.''   The loss of Sergeant Major Sartor serves as a reminder of the  sacrifices the men and women of our Armed Forces make each day to  preserve the freedom for this great Nation. We are forever in debt to  these committed individuals who serve our country.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Sartor family. We also lift up the family and friends of Ryan  Sartor in our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to honor his life and legacy.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our veterans, for our military men and women who protect  us, and for our first responders who keep us safe here at home.                       Honoring Matthew Randell Gurule     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Matthew Randell Gurule  of Belen, New Mexico, who passed away on August 17, 2019.   Matthew was born on January 12, 1987, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to  Matthew and Sandra Gurule. In 1996, Matthew moved to central Texas with  his mom and his sister. He graduated from China Spring High School in  2004 and joined the United States Marine Corps on November 7, 2005.   Matthew served many tours of duty during his time in the Marine  Corps. He deployed to Iraq in 2006, 2007, and 2008 and to Afghanistan  in 2009. He was highly decorated and received many awards, including:  the Combat Action Ribbon, the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, the Sea  Service Deployment Ribbon with two stars, the Afghanistan Campaign  Medal with one star, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal,  the Iraq Campaign with one star, the Global War on Terrorism Service  Medal, the NATO Medal International Security Assistance Force  Afghanistan, a Certificate of Appreciation, a Letter of Appreciation,  and Rifle Marksman Badge.   After his time in the Marine Corps, Matthew wanted to work alongside  his father at Albuquerque Downs. He attended the Lookout Mountain  School of Horseshoeing in 2012 and obtained his certification as a  horse farrier. Looking to expand his skills, Matthew changed career  fields and most recently was a mason at Cameron's Custom Homes.   Matthew had a number of interests and hobbies, which included  singing, dancing, and cooking. He was noted for making a good batch of  salsa, steak, baked potatoes, and green chile spaghetti. Matthew also  enjoyed reading, especially about historical subjects such as the  Knights Templar and the Mongol Empire.   Matthew was taken from this Earth too soon. He was last seen on July  27, 2019, leaving the Isleta Casino in Albuquerque. His car was later  discovered burned and abandoned in the desert. After not hearing from  Matthew for several days, his mother, Sandra Miller, traveled to New  Mexico to look for her son. She discovered that his credit cards were  fraudulently being used, and she was able to obtain video surveillance  of the criminals who were using them. Her work led to the eventual  arrest of the two people charged with Matthew's murder. His body was  later found in the New Mexico desert on August 16, 2019.   Through their senseless act of violence, these criminals have caused  an enormous amount of pain for all those who knew and loved Matthew. In  this time of tragedy, I am deeply moved by Sandra's love for her son.  As a father and grandfather, I can only imagine the grief felt by  Sandra. I am in awe of her extraordinary efforts to find her son and  bring his killers to justice. I commend her for her work and the  example she gave of the eternal love a parent has for their children.   Mr. Speaker, Matthew Gurule's life was defined by his service to our  country. He will be forever remembered as a loyal son, a brother, a  veteran, a selfless servant, and a friend to many.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Gurule family. We also lift up the family and friends of Matthew  Gurule in our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Nation's  Capitol to honor his life and legacy.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our veterans, and for our first responders who keep us  safe and secure.                     Honoring Dr. John Joseph Koldus III     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. John Joseph Koldus  III of College Station, Texas, who passed away on August 12, 2019.   Before continuing with my recognition of Dr. Koldus, I would like to  provide background on Texas A&M University in College Station and its  core values.   In the front of the academic building on the campus of the  university, there is a statue of Lawrence Sullivan Ross, the sixth  president of the university. That statue contains the following  inscription: ``Lawrence Sullivan Ross, 1838-1898, Soldier, Statesman,  and Knightly Gentleman; Brigadier General C.S.A., Governor of Texas,  President of the A&M College.''   The key words in this inscription are ``soldier, statesman, and  knightly gentleman.'' They reflect some of the key ways that Texas  Aggies live the Texas A&M core values of excellence, integrity,  leadership, loyalty, respect, and selfless service.   Moving on to my recognition of Dr. Koldus, John was born February 10,  1930, in Gary, Indiana, to John Joseph Koldus II and Helen Kukoy  Koldus. He was an outstanding athlete and lettered in football,  basketball, baseball, and track. He was named the Most Athletic Boy in  the Gary School District.   After graduation, he worked at U.S. Steel on Lake Michigan, just as  his father had done. John then realized that higher education was a way  to improve himself, and he attended Arkansas State University. At  Arkansas State, he was a middleweight Golden Gloves champion and  lettered 2 years in baseball and 3 years in football, capturing many  individual records for the school.    In 1953, John graduated from ASU and was commissioned as a second  lieutenant in the United States Army. John served in the Army until  1955.   Following his military service, he began teaching at Blytheville High  School in Blytheville, Arkansas. John taught from 1955 to 1959, and  during the summers he attended the University of Arkansas in  Fayetteville to complete his master's degree and to begin his doctorate  studies.   During his time as a teacher, John met Mary Dell Hooker. Their first  date was a tennis match, and their competitive athletic spirits  fostered a strong relationship. They married on May 31, 1958.   In 1973, John began his 20-year career at Texas A&M University in  College Station, Texas, as vice president of student services. John was  instrumental  [[Page H7860]]  in guiding the university through an era of incredible growth and  change, as tens of thousands of women began attending the university,  and by creating a unique culture which provided Aggie students with  extensive leadership opportunities. In his role as vice president of  student services, John had a deep and impactful relationship with the  students of Texas A&M.   He had oversight of a number of organizations, including the Corps of  Cadets, Recreational Sports, the Memorial Student Center, Student  Activities, Student Affairs, Student Health Services, and Student Legal  Services. During his time at Texas A&M, the number of student  organizations doubled to more than 700. John also taught classes and  served on many academic committees for graduate students.                                time  1215    In his 20 years at Texas A&M, John was a recipient of 15 significant  awards, including the Association of College and University Student  Personnel Administrators' Distinguished Service Award, The Association  of Former Students' Distinguished Achievement Award for Student  Relations, the Buck Weirus Spirit Award, and the National Association  of Student Personnel Administrators Region III Outstanding Service to  NASPA Award in 1984.   In 1985, this latter award was named in his honor as a reflection of  his impact on student services all across this Nation. John's impact on  the university was so meaningful, that when he retired in 1993, he was  the recipient of the President's Medallion of Achievement, and he was  named Vice President Emeritus of Texas A&M University.   The Student Services Building was also renamed the John J. Koldus  Building, and the Texas A&M Foundation also created the John J. Koldus  Quality of Student Life Endowment. Although neither he nor Mary Dell  were graduates of Texas A&M, in 2006 they were bestowed by proclamation  the title of ``Texas Aggies.''   In the beginning of this recognition, I discussed the attributes-- soldier, statesman, knightly gentleman, and the core values of Texas  A&M University: Excellence, integrity, leadership, loyalty, respect and  selfless service. The reason I discussed these attributes and these  values is this:   Dr. Koldus was a soldier, a statesman, a knightly gentleman, and he  personified A&M's core values of excellence, integrity, leadership,  loyalty, respect, and selfless service. More importantly, he helped  share and model those attributes and values to the Texas A&M student  body through his mentoring capabilities. His skills in this regard were  noteworthy as he mentored thousands of Aggies who started their  education at A&M as, what I would call, ``diamonds in the rough.''   I want to continue discussing this subject, because I was one of  those persons who arrived at A&M pretty rough around the edges. Early  on, as an Aggie student, Dr. Koldus identified me as a person who might  have some promise, and he invested his time and leadership skills into  my education. His mentoring and friendship had an indelible impact on  me as he tried to mold me to be a soldier, statesman, knightly  gentleman, and he helped me live and adopt those significant Aggie core  values.   The bottom line is that John Koldus had a huge impact on tens of  thousands of Texas Aggies, and upon me. He was a great friend, and I  miss him dearly.   Mr. Speaker, John Koldus' life was defined by his service to his  family, to our country, and to Texas A&M University. He will be forever  remembered as a husband, a father, a grandfather, a great-grandfather,  a veteran, a mentor, a selfless servant, and a friend to thousands, if  not tens of thousands.   My wife, Gina, and I offer deepest and heartfelt condolences to the  Koldus family. We also lift up the family and friends of John Koldus in  our prayers. I have requested the United States flag be flown over our  Nation's Capitol to honor his life and legacy.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue to pray for our  country during these difficult times, for our military who protects us  abroad, and for our first responders who keep us safe at home.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
