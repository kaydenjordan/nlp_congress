 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our colleague  from Ohio, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, who has become the longest  serving woman in the United States House of Representatives. She is  from Toledo, Ohio.   I want to rise today to recognize being able to see someone of her  caliber for so many years contribute so greatly. The World War II  monument on The Mall here in Washington, D.C., was a long-term project  that she started and she finished.   Those of us who represent working class people in Ohio know Marcy,  respect Marcy. She is tough, she is smart, and she has one of the  biggest hearts in this Chamber.   This is what I love about her: she is not afraid to say the word  ``union'' and to recognize the power of working people coming together  to bring economic justice to our society.   Mr. Speaker, we salute Ms. Kaptur's service and look forward to many,  many more years ahead working on behalf and for those working class  families in Ohio.                            ____________________
