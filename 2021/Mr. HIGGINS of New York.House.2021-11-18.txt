 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding, for his integrity, and his steady leadership throughout this  process.   I am proud of the legislation that we are considering today, and the  entire House should be as well. Over the past two decades we have spent  $6 trillion in three Middle East wars.   Today, this Congress is cementing a commitment to finally nation- building at home, in America and for Americans; investments in American  families to help them become healthier, happier, and more productive  into and through adulthood.   Mr. Speaker, because of this bill, the future of my community in  Western New York will be stronger and more resilient. We are building  back better, stronger, and longer. This bill reflects our optimism as  Americans to confront our challenges with strength.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.                                time  1200
