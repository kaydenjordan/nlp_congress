 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about  freedom, specifically, individual freedom, a core American value, a  value that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have for years  co-opted, weaponized, and distorted.   I simply do not understand how my Republican colleagues can demand  the individual freedom to spread a deadly disease to other people by  not getting vaccinated or wearing masks yet have the gall to deny the  individual freedom to make decisions about one's own body that has no  impact on anyone else.   How can it be that autonomy to wear a mask or not is of greater  importance than the autonomy over whether to have a baby or not?   Let me say it plainly: We cannot talk about preserving our individual  freedoms while simultaneously ripping away a fundamental freedom for  women in this country. Control over one's reproductive health is a  human right.   We are in the first week of Congress, and what are we focused on?   Is it to fight inflation? No.   To create jobs for Americans? No.   To protect children from gun violence? No.   It is to continue the assault on our autonomy, on women's autonomy.
