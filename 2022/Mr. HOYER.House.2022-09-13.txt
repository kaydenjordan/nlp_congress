 Madam Speaker, it is a rare privilege to be able to  introduce as a new Member the dean of a delegation, but that is my  particular pleasure today.   There are few honors greater, Madam Speaker, in this country than  being elected by your neighbors and fellow Americans to represent them  in the House of Representatives. I welcome Senator Murkowski and  Senator Sullivan to our Chamber and remind them you cannot be appointed  to the House of Representatives. Only by election can one serve in the  people's House.   It is an extraordinary honor to have your friends and neighbors  choose you to represent them in this body. When our friend and  colleague Don Young passed away earlier this year, this House lost a  giant. The people of Alaska lost a Representative who had served them  with great ability, energy, courage, and commitment for half a century.   Earlier this month, Alaskans cast their votes to send a new  Representative to carry their voice and views in Washington. The woman  they chose just made history with the oath that she took. She made  history by becoming the first Alaska Native to be elected to the  Congress of the United States.    Madam Speaker, she also made history as the first woman not to  represent Alaska but to represent Alaskans in the House of  Representatives. Obviously, Senator Murkowski represents them in the  Senate.   In Representative Mary Peltola, Alaskans chose someone who was not  only a friend of former Representative Don Young but also someone cut  from the same cloth, someone who believes fundamentally in pragmatism,  independence, and putting Alaska's unique needs first. The Senators  applaud that, apparently.   Representative Peltola is widely known across Alaska not only for her  strong record as a State legislator but as a champion for rural and  Native communities who are too often overlooked by policymakers. Don  Young did not let that happen. She won't, either.   She has built solid relationships across both parties in Alaska  because of what many have called her extreme kindness and her  determination to befriend all that she meets.   Her record reflects Alaskans' independent approach to the most  divisive issues, and in her election, she appealed to Democrats,  Republicans, and Independents. Her campaign slogan reflected what she  and many others consider the three fundamentals of Alaska: fish,  family, and freedom.   Indeed, she has already begun to assemble a bipartisan staff to serve  her constituents. Representative Peltola has a long record of working  well with Alaska Republicans and even campaigning for Republican  Senator Lisa Murkowski, who is with us here today, when she faced a  primary challenge from an extreme candidate.   What Alaskans have known and shown by them electing Mary Peltola is  that, like so many other Americans, they want to be represented by  someone who is focused on bipartisanship and not on confrontation. They  want someone who will put people over politics and get things done.   That has been Representative Peltola's record back home in Alaska,  and I know it will be her philosophy here in Washington. In so many  ways, she is a perfect successor to Representative Young, who worked  hard to make sure his fellow Republicans understood Alaskans' unique  challenges and preferences on major issues.  [[Page H7776]]                                     time  1845    In similar fashion, Representative Peltola will be an important  addition to the House, helping us better understand the perspectives of  rural and Native communities and the special concerns of Alaskans as  our majority works to deliver results and expand opportunities for all  Americans.   I know, Madam Speaker, Mary will be warmly welcomed to the House by  all of her colleagues on both sides of the aisle.   Because Alaska has only one at-large Representative in the House, the  honor falls to me today, as the senior-most Member of our party, to  introduce her. It is an honor I wholeheartedly accept, and I now ask my  colleagues to join me in welcoming Alaska's new Representative and  someone we will all very shortly be calling our good friend, Mary  Peltola.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Alaska (Mrs. Peltola).
