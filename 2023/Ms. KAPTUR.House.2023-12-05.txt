 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the first female Supreme  Court Justice, Sandra Day O'Connor, who passed away last Friday.   Frequently referred to as the most powerful woman in America, Justice  O'Connor, who was highly gifted and dignified, paved the way for women  on the highest court in our land.   Justice O'Connor knew the value of being the first. She felt a  special responsibility as the first woman. When she was appointed to  the Court by President Ronald Reagan in 1981, no women in the Court's  nearly 200-year history had ever graced the bench with their intellect.  Her diligence and legal mastery moved America forward, and she always  knew how to find the big middle in her opinions.   Since her retirement in 2006, four female Supreme Court Justices have  been appointed and confirmed to the bench of the highest court in our  land. That is only five women in 234 years.   In our Nation's history, our great State of Ohio has never elected a       female Senator. Including myself, Ohio has only ever       elected 13 female Representatives. Our Nation has not seen       a female President yet. Women in our Nation have many       glass ceilings to shatter and many more firsts to go.   Mr. Speaker, I honor Justice O'Connor, her character, and her legacy,  and I honor and encourage the new firsts yet to come from among  America's young women.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the former and soon-to-be again  chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies; Mr.  Bishop.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of former First Lady  Rosalynn Carter of Plains, Georgia.   Born Eleanor Rosalynn Smith, she began dating a young Naval cadet  named James Earl Carter, Jr., in 1945.  [[Page H6137]]  The two were inseparable for nearly 8 years.   Rosalynn Carter, beloved spouse of President Jimmy Carter and mother  to their family and our Nation, has blessed our Republic for over  three-quarters of a century.   Her perpetual kindness, wisdom, and faithfulness to family,  community, and country is legendary. Her patriotism had no bounds.   As First Lady of Georgia and then our Nation, she perserveringly and  with her matter-of-fact manner elevated the plight of the mentally ill  to national attention.   I can recall as a farm wife, after her husband was elected President,  the footage of her carrying her sewing machine into the White House,  which stirred surprise and even criticism in some privileged quarters  by people who had never worked with their hands as she tried to show  struggling families at home and abroad how to be more self-sufficient.    As a White House urban policy staffer after the President was  elected, I had the privilege of working with her, a fierce, caring ally  in neighborhood revitalization across our Nation in some of the most  forgotten corners of America.   She was a lady in every sense of the word, but, boy, was she  determined. She was gracious, erudite, persuasive, faith filled,  indefatigable, committed, and a true credit to our great Nation.   As others have mentioned, upon leaving the White House, she would go  on to be involved in many worthy endeavors both abroad and at home.   From hurricane relief to global aid for Africa to Habitat for  Humanity, building homes for those in need, and to founding The Carter  Center, we all know the lasting legacy that Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter  left for those who came after them and to future generations.   History will treat them well because they helped build a better  America and one with a kinder heart. Their lives of public service will  be unmatched by any First Family in our lifetimes and among the most  consequential in our Nation's history.   May Rosalynn's spirit and memory comfort her husband, her family,  staff that served them ably, and all the millions of people the Carter  family touched with healing and inspiration.   May the angels of mercy carry her to a peaceful rest. I am so honored  to be able to pay tribute to her beautiful life here today.
