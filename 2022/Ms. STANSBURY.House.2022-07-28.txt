 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the brilliant  and boundless minds of our scientists, our innovators, and our young  people in New Mexico and across the United States.   There is a lot to say about the CHIPS bill that is so crucial for our  economy, our national security, and for innovation in our country. But  today I want to celebrate our innovators and talk about the crucial  importance of passing this bill.   This bill has particular meaning for me as it includes my very first  piece of legislation that I filed upon taking office last year which is  the bipartisan Partnerships for Energy Security and Innovation Act.   I thank the chairwoman, her staff, and the leadership for making it  possible and our State's very own Senator Ben Ray Lujan who has led  this legislation for years.   This bill leans into our State's economic strengths and will take our  STEM economy to new heights. It will help to create a nonprofit  foundation associated with the Department of Energy to harness the  knowledge and innovation of our national labs, our universities, our  Tribal colleges, and our HBCUs and Hispanic-serving institutions to  solve our challenges at the highest levels.   Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, the leadership and say: Let's get this  bill across the finish line, and let's build it in America.
