 Mr. Speaker, last year, I was proud to serve on the House  China Task Force with a number of my Republican colleagues. Over six  months through engagement and consultation with national security and  trade officials, foreign policy experts, the business community, and  government officials, we compiled and unveiled a comprehensive report  with more than 400 policy recommendations for how to address the  existential challenges posed by China.   Addressing the challenges posed by China will be one of the greatest  issues Congress and our country face in the decades to come. As we  confront these issues, bipartisan work is needed. The China Task Force  report provides a roadmap with specific policy ideas and goals  regarding how the U.S. can better combat the threat of the Chinese  Communist Party. Two-thirds of the legislative recommendations are  bipartisan; and, overall, more than one-quarter of the recommendations  have already become law or have been implemented by the prior Trump  administration.   As members of the Ways and Means Committee, we authored important  provisions of the report that will help return American intellectual  property and critical supply chains to the United States. We also  included legislation to reform and strengthen the World Trade  Organization to level the playing field for American trade.   Mr. Speaker, to preserve and grow national economic security, we need  to act. I ask everyone to read the report and work with us to get this  done in a bipartisan way.                            ____________________
