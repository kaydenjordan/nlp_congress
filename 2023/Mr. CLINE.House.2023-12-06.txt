 Mr. Speaker, the Sixth District is blessed to be among  those congressional districts with the highest number of colleges and  universities among all the 435 House districts, but Joe Biden's  weakness on the global stage has allowed America's foreign adversaries  to target our Nation's college students.   From pushing propaganda to stealing critical research to censoring  free speech, America's colleges and universities are now on the  battleground of foreign interference.   Regimes like the Chinese Communist Party have expanded their  influence by bribing American academic institutions with funding  opportunities.   According to a Senate report from 2019, 70 percent of all  institutions failed to comply with the enforcement tool that is used to  protect against threats by foreign adversaries.   All of this is unacceptable and dangerous, as it poses a threat to  our national security, research and intellectual property, and our  students and academic freedom.   That is why this Congress must pass the DETERRENT Act, which provides  transparency, accountability, and clarity to foreign gift reporting  requirements for colleges and universities across the country.   House Republicans remain committed to delivering a future that is  built on freedom for the American people, and that starts with  preventing our adversaries from indoctrinating our students with their  propaganda and stealing the research of our colleges and universities  across this country.    Congratulating the James Wood Volleyball Team on Winning the Class 4                                State Title     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the James Wood women's  volleyball team for winning the class 4 State title, the program's  second straight State championship.   After working hard all season, the Colonels left it all on the floor  and dominated the Hanover Hawks for their sixth 3-0 win in six  postseason matches.   These talented student athletes include Kennedy Spaid, Ashlynn  Spence, Alexys Taylor, Adeline Pitcock, Kyla Wilhelm, Tenley Mattison,  Hannah McCullough, Paige Ahakuelo, Brenna Corbin, and Claire Keefer.   Throughout each set, the Colonels focused on working together as a  team and doing what was necessary to get the job done, demonstrating  resilience, adaptability, and impeccable skills.   Under the leadership and encouragement of Head Coach Adrienne  Patrick,  [[Page H6151]]  the Colonels were on a mission all season to repeat history, and it  ended with them once again as State champions.   Again, I congratulate the James Wood women's volleyball team, Head  Coach Adrienne Patrick, parents, faculty, and staff on this incredible  achievement.                            ____________________
