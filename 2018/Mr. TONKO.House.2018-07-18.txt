 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the rule to  make in order the Quigley amendment to restore funds to prevent Russian  interference in our elections.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Americans across our country are very much suffering the negative  effects of climate change. They expect Congress to respond with a plan.  We may not agree on all the details, but our constituents deserve a  serious debate.   This resolution is not serious. It reflects an extreme rightwing  climate inaction plan: embrace denial, sow disinformation, and cash  checks from polluters.   This resolution reveals the hypocrisy of the Republican energy  strategy.   They claim to care about innovation, but support budget cuts to  critical research programs like ARPA-E and EERE.   They claim to care about economic growth, but ignore the millions of  jobs that have been created in the clean energy universe and fail to  see the opportunities to add millions more.   They claim to care about low-income Americans, but cheer the rollback  of environmental standards that would protect them.   They claim to support free markets, but fail to speak out when  President Trump suggests unprecedented market interventions to bail out  uncompetitive coal plants at great expense to Americans, especially  manufacturers.   Make no mistake: greenhouse gases are serious pollutants that will  have long-term consequences. America needs a climate plan, not a love  letter to polluters.   Members that support this resolution are sending a clear message to  the American people that they care more about polluters' interests than  the people we are asked to serve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this misguided  resolution.
