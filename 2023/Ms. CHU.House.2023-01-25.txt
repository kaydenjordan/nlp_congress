 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 400,  the Investing in Main Street Act, which would make commonsense changes  to the small business investing laws to maximize the amount that banks  may invest in SBA-certified small business investment companies or  SBICs.   Even though banking rules allow financial institutions to invest up  to 15 percent of their capital and surplus in SBICs, small business  investing rules cap these same investments far lower, at just 5  percent.   The Investing in Main Street Act simply fixes this outdated  inconsistency to allow banks to invest the full 15 percent in SBICs.  Raising this cap will dramatically increase the amount of investment  capital available to our country's small businesses for whom even small  investments can mean so much.   Already, SBICs have helped companies like Costco, Apple, and Intel  get off the ground back when they were just starting out; and SBICs  fill a gap in the investment ecosystem and level the playing field for  the smallest businesses which often face the highest barriers to  securing investments from traditional private investors.   The nearly 300 certified SBICs in operation today have invested or  committed $38 billion in small businesses nationwide; and last year  alone, SBICs provided $7.9 billion in funding to over 1,200 small  businesses and startups.   By raising the investment cap from 5 percent to 15 percent, we could  potentially triple those numbers in the years to come. The growth will  be especially important as America's entrepreneurship rates continue to  soar as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.   I thank Representative Garbarino for his partnership on this  legislation, and Chairman Williams and Ranking Member Velazquez for  their strong support. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.    This last Saturday night, a shooter came into my hometown of  Monterey Park, California, to a dance studio and killed 11 innocent  people.   Today, I rise to honor the memories of the 11 lives we lost: Diana  Tom, Mymy Nhan, Lilian Li, Xiujuan Yu, Hong Jian, Muoi Ung, Valentino  Alvero, Yu-Lun Kao, Chia Yau, Wen-Tau Yu, Ming Ma.   I also wish for the speedy recovery for the nine who are injured,  many of whom are still in the hospital.   Lunar New Year is a time of celebration for the thriving Asian- American community in my hometown. Saturday's senseless murders pierced  the peace and joy of our celebrations and tore a hole through our  hearts.   This Lunar New Year was supposed to be a celebration of the Year of  the Rabbit, characterized by hopefulness and peace.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to keep hope alive  and work together to make our country a peaceful one free from this  kind of horrific violence.   Thank you for helping me honor the memories of those lost by  observing a moment of silence.                            ____________________
