 Mr. President, I come to the floor today in support of  Felice Gorordo, the nominee to be the U.S. Alternate Executive Director  of the World Bank.   At a time when China is increasingly willing to use its economic  power to pressure other nations to do its bidding, when Latin America  is trying to recover from the economic impact of the COVID pandemic,  when Putin's war in Ukraine threatens the food supply of developing  nations around the world, strong, dependable leadership at the World  Bank has never been more important. And Felice Gorordo has the  experience and vision the United States needs to tackle the challenges  the World Bank faces today.   His journey starts the way mine does. He is the son of Cuban exiles  who fled dictatorship in their country. His parents came to the United  States in search of the American dream. His dad was in law enforcement,  and his mom was a teacher. From them, Felice learned the importance of  public service.   He will be a tireless advocate for the democratic values that our  Nation and both of our families hold so dear, and he will succeed  because of his commitment to helping others, which he has demonstrated  throughout his life and career.   Felice founded Raices de Esperanza, which means the ``roots of  hope.'' It is a nonprofit that empowers young people in Cuba through  technology and entrepreneurship. He also worked for both the Bush and  Obama administrations in advancing the U.S.'s national interests--no  matter which party was in the White House.   He should be in this post because, in the wake of COVID, his  understanding of finance, economic statecraft, and technology will help  the United States and its like-minded partners make the concerted push  to prevent economic collapse in the developing world.   He should be in this post because we need to make sure that China  doesn't continue getting away with their malign influence at the  institutions that we, the United States, created to shape the  international order.   If confirmed to his post at the World Bank, Felice will advocate for  our values. He will stand up for democracy and human rights. So I urge  my colleagues to support the nomination of Felice Gorordo to the post  of U.S. Alternate Executive Director for the World Bank.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
