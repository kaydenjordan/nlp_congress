 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch     Madam President, I rise today to speak about the  President's nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve as Associate  Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.   Whenever great issues like the future of our Nation's highest Court  come before the Senate, it is easy to get lost in the noise and the  hyperbole. Listening to the commentary about Judge Gorsuch, I have  found it instructive to ask whether critics have actually met him and  listened to his philosophy of jurisprudence.   I have met him, and it is easy to guess that those who oppose him  likely have not spoken to him, watched the hearings, or read any of the  glowing testimonials from across the political spectrum. The invectives  thrown at Judge Gorsuch seem really to be about something else  entirely--about anger at the President, disappointment with the  election outcome, or concern about holding certain hotly debated topics  of the day. It appears that critics could substitute almost any name  for Judge Gorsuch in their statements and give them with the same  passion and the same concern.   That is too bad because Judge Gorsuch has been consistently regarded  by his peers as pragmatic and among the most gifted legal minds on the  Federal bench. The man is intelligent, courteous, and modest. He seeks  readily the views of those around him. His approach will be a  constructive addition to the U.S. Supreme Court and of benefit to our  Nation. His judicial record as a Federal judge flows exactly from what  he says, and his message and focus is abundantly clear: judicial  modesty and fidelity to the law.   When our representative government was established in the United  States, a heated debate emerged about the purposes and powers of our  new Federal institutions. The Founders of our country understood that a  system in which lawmaking was detached from accountability was the  quickest path to despotism. A coequal judiciary could help temper  tyranny and balance the powers of an executive and a legislature  stepping over their constitutional powers. The phrase is ``checks and  balances'' not ``usurpation.''   Alexander Hamilton, who has received much recently renewed attention,  wrote at length about the newly imagined judicial branch of our  government. In Federalist 78, Hamilton wrote that the judicial branch  ``may truly be said to have neither force nor will, but merely  judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm  even for the efficacy of its judgments.''   To the Founders, the division of responsibilities between the three  branches of government was clear: Congress would make the laws. The  executive would implement them. The judiciary would review the laws for  their legality and consistency with the Constitution. Further, the  independence of the judiciary would be enhanced through their  distinctive selection process, so they could do their jobs without  succumbing to swings in popular opinion. Put succinctly by Chief  Justice Roberts during his confirmation hearings, a judge's proper role  is ``to call balls and strikes.''   In his testimonial to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Judge Gorsuch  emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary. He writes:         Judges should . . . strive to apply the law as it is,       focusing backward, not forward, and looking to the text,       structure, and history . . . not decide cases on their own       moral convictions.    Judges ``take an oath to uphold'' the Constitution, not ``merely  consider it.'' It is their duty to follow the law.   Jurisprudence is not supposed to be the popular arts. Judges are not  vessels for moral causes. Judge Gorsuch repeats Justice Scalia's words:         [I]f you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have       to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going       to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the       time, you're probably doing something wrong.    Further, Judge Gorsuch states that rulings made in an attempt to  optimize social utility introduces a question of moral relativism.         In criminal cases, for example, we often hear arguments       from the government that its view would promote public       security or finality. Meanwhile, the defense often tells us       that its view would promote personal liberty or procedural       fairness. How is a judge supposed to weigh or rank these very       different social goods?    The answer lies in the common points of reference for all judges, be  they conservatives or progressives--the written law. Reading the law is  difficult enough without introducing the element of uncertainty. Court- shopping for a pliant judge who will interpret the law the way a  litigant believes it should read can be destructive to public  confidence in the legal system.   In our democracy, the public expresses its will at the ballot box and  empowers its duly-elected officials with the duty to advance that will.  Changes in public attitudes can come quickly, and that can be reflected  in the results of elections.   Congress is the body most closely connected to the American public  because its accountability is directly to the people.   Some observers want judges to be legislators, discarding the black  robes for populist impulses. But our system of checks and balances is  predicated on the fact that change comes deliberately and  incrementally, notwithstanding the wild swings in public mood.   The pace of change can understandably frustrate. However,  congressional action is the spirit of the American electorate,  exercised with its unique combination of majority rule, minority  rights, and compromise. The imperfect caldron of the legislative  process is how change happens carefully, purposefully, and properly.   Unfortunately, impatience can drive people to try to circumvent the  constitutional power of Congress. The tendency of some to race to a  courthouse, bypassing the will of the people expressed through  Congress, to compel change is inherently destabilizing to  representative government.   Without a direct say in how policy is decided and without the ability  to hold people accountable, judges who reimagine the law undermine a  fundamental cornerstone of representative democracy. Judges have a  great responsibility to carefully exercise their judicial authority  within the limits of the law. Judges who exercise independence from  anchors of our law are dangerous to our liberties. Judge Gorsuch  demonstrates that he clearly understands this concept when he writes:         Legislators may appeal to their own moral convictions and       to claims to reshape the law as they think it should be in       the future. But judges should do none of these things in a       democratic society.    Some jurists treat the Constitution like a speed bump as they hurdle  down the road reinventing the law. Substituting ideology for the  written law in jurisprudence is the equivalent of changing the law from  what it says to what some wish it says.   Neil Gorsuch identified this very problem when he wrote in 2005 that  ``the courtroom as the place to debate social policy is bad for the  country and bad for the judiciary. In the legislative arena, especially  when the country is closely divided, compromises tend to be the rule of  the day. But when judges rule this or that policy unconstitutional,  there's little room for compromise: One side must win, the other must  lose. . . . As a society, we lose the benefit of the give-and-take of  the political process and the flexibility of social experimentation  that only the elected branches can provide.'' These words reflect a  clear understanding of the importance of the separation of powers.   The Federal judiciary should not be a replacement for doing the hard  work of persuading the public and enacting policy with accountability  to the electorate.  [[Page S2072]]    Americans learn civics early in their upbringing. The Constitution  guarantees certain civil liberties and restrains the powers of the  central government. Our court system has the responsibility to preserve  our constitutional rights, ensure a limited government, and provide  speedy and fair justice when needed. The judiciary holds the sole  constitutional power to interpret laws properly enacted by Congress.  This authority is expressly distinct from the power bestowed to the  legislature to write laws and the executive to enforce them. This  separation of powers plays an important role in the system of checks  and balances envisioned by the Founders.    Public confidence in our legal system is undermined when judges seek  to reimagine Federal law beyond its clear meaning. Judges who  substitute their personal views for the law can shake the public's  faith in our legal system as an impartial protector of our rights and  an upholder of justice. Judges must follow our Constitution in their  decisionmaking and resist this temptation to make policy.   Moreover, without the public sanction of the ballot box, policy  changes, particularly controversial ones, naturally divide people. If  the judiciary cannot be seen as a neutral arbiter of facts and laws,  even more people will see individual judges as ``one of mine'' or ``one  of yours.''   The erosion of the humble judiciary began when the Senate  confirmation process changed. In recent past, district and circuit  court nominees used to be confirmed noncontroversially. Now, instead of  looking at the qualifications of the judicial nominee, partisans hope  to pre-bake court decisions through the use of litmus tests or demands  on nominees to determine in advance what their rulings will be on cases  before the matter is even argued to the court. Perhaps this is the  logical extension of the overreliance on some to secure social gains  they cannot achieve through the democratic process.   Change is hard, and patience is exceedingly rare, but the strongest  building blocks to legitimacy are achieved though consensus and the  give-and-take of politics.   Writing even before he was overwhelmingly approved by this body for  his current seat on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch wrote:         [In courts,] ideas are tested only in the abstract world of       legal briefs and lawyers' arguments. As a society, we lose       the benefit of the give-and-take of the political process and       the flexibility of social experimentation that only the       elected branches can provide. At the same time, the       politicalization of the judiciary undermines the only real       asset it has--its independence. Judges come to be seen as       politicians and their confirmations become just an avenue of       political warfare. Respect for the role of judges and the       legitimacy of the judiciary branch as a whole diminishes.        The judiciary's diminishing claim to neutrality and       independence is exemplified by a recent, historic shift in       the Senate's confirmation process. Where trial-court and       appeals-court nominees were once routinely confirmed on voice       vote--    Based on their credentials and their ability to serve--       they are now routinely subjected to ideological litmus tests,       filibusters, and vicious interest-group attacks. It is a       warning sign that our judiciary is losing its legitimacy when       trial and circuit-court judges are viewed and treated as       little more than politicians with robes.    This development puts a severe strain on our Republic. Particularly  problematic is the increasing number of split court decisions. Rulings  that are given with a one-vote margin further empower litigants to  contest decisions, hoping for a more favorable outcome later or in a  different court. Setting precedent, though, becomes so much more  difficult for the public when a razor-thin decision is accompanied by a  dramatic reinterpretation of the law.   One of the hallmarks of the Roberts Court is the drive to establish  precedent not by finding the narrowest reading that can achieve a bare  majority but its endeavor to ground seminal decisions in large  majorities and unanimous findings. Public confidence in the legal  system and the finality of the holding is ever greater when we do not  see narrow decisions.   The Judiciary Committee just concluded a 4-day review of the  nomination of Judge Gorsuch. In addition to hearing from Judge Gorsuch  for over 20 hours, the committee received formal testimony from almost  30 outside witnesses. Thousands upon thousands of words were exchanged  over the course of the hearing, all in front of the American public.  What the people saw is a thoughtful, humble, and brilliant legal mind  in the service of the people.   In response to a question of mine on Tuesday, Judge Gorsuch said the  following:         I come here with no agenda but one, no promises but one: to       be as good and faithful a judge as I know how to be. That is       it. And I cannot promise or agree or pledge anything more       than that to this Congress.    That statement and the hearing as a whole confirmed Judge Gorsuch to  be a man of great integrity, a mainstream, exemplary student of the law  whose record shows that he is a part of unanimous decisions. On the  Tenth Circuit, of all the decisions he has participated in in the last  10 years, 97 percent of the time, he was a part of a unanimous court,  and 99 percent of the time, he was in the majority.   For days, my colleagues from the other side of the aisle raised the  possibility that he might have secret intentions to try to subvert the  law or shred the Constitution from the bench. They parsed single words  for hidden meanings, imagined devious strategies emerging from  concurring opinions, and searched for cloaked messages in his published  writings.   Judge Gorsuch has over 10 years as a jurist, with 2,700 opinions to  review; yet most of the debate was centered on just 4 or 5 cases. Some  Senators were absolutely convinced they would find some problem. They  did not.   Let's talk about what Judge Gorsuch testified to under oath. Despite  repeated efforts to get him to make commitments about how he would rule  or how he would reshape social policy, on his first day, he gave no  fewer than eight assurances that he follows the law as a judge. By my  count, on the second day, he gave at least 36 assurances that he looks  to the law for his rulings. On the third day, it was 29 more times that  he was asked and again repeated that he would look to the law for his  rulings. That is right. He said at least 73 times that he is committed  to the law when he hears a case as a sitting Federal judge. Still,  several of my colleagues worried that he had a secret agenda to  overturn longstanding legal precedence.   Just in case there are some confused, Judge Gorsuch mentioned no  fewer than 97 times in these 3 days that he follows precedent as a  judge, as he is bound to do. More than 160 times, Judge Gorsuch  reminded the Senate and the American public what a proper jurist does:  follows the law and the precedent. We even talked about the book he  coauthored titled ``The Law of Judicial Precedent''--942 pages of  dedication to following precedent. Maybe the title of the book was  confusing to some.    During his oral testimony, he said he was dedicated to ``rul[ing] as  the law requires,'' ``reading the language of the statute as a  `reasonable person' would understand it,'' and ``respect[ing]  precedent.''   Just to put all such questions to rest, he assured everyone that he  is ``without secret agenda. None.''   In reviewing his record, it is clear that those who come before Judge  Gorsuch receive equal treatment under the law. He said:         When I sit on the bench and someone comes to argue before       me, I treat each one of them equally. They do not come as       rich or poor, big guy or little guy. They come as a person.       And I put my ego aside when I put on that robe, and I open my       mind, and I open my heart, and I listen.    In Judge Gorsuch, we have a nominee who lives the American ideal of a  modest jurist. He understands that his responsibility is not to suborn  the powers of others but to help deliver the powers of justice.   Those who have encountered him as a legal advocate, an adversary in  court, or a presiding judge all praise his fundamental fairness and  subornation of his personal views.   His respect for the Constitution is not in question. His experience,  wisdom, and judgment are not in question. His capability to serve is  not in question. Commentators from both the left and the right  overwhelmingly respect his legal mind and vouch for his commitment to  fair jurisprudence.   Given Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy and his record as a judge,  he  [[Page S2073]]  would be a welcome addition to a Supreme Court seeking cohesive  decisions. His record on the Tenth Circuit is strong. Five of six of  his decisions that did go to the Supreme Court for a review have been  affirmed by the Supreme Court, including one which he wrote, and four  out of five on which he joined the decision.   Not many judges have the experience, temperament, and stellar record  to match Judge Gorsuch. Fewer still can garner overwhelming endorsement  from colleagues, peers, and observers from across the political  spectrum.   Some may try to distract from the central point that Judge Gorsuch is  extraordinarily qualified and suited to serve as an Associate Justice.  Others would like to discuss other issues or make his nomination a  proxy fight about tangential matters. My colleagues and I will vote on  his nomination, not on these other issues or distractions. I encourage  all of us to remember that.   The Senate should be proud to add Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme  Court.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.
