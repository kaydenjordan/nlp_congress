 ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 299, the Blue Water Navy  Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019 which would extend the presumption of  exposure to herbicides to veterans who served in the offshore waters of  Vietnam.   I want to thank Chairman Takano for reintroducing this legislation  and for working with me to get this bill to the House floor.   It is no surprise that the fight for our blue water Navy Vietnam  veterans to receive the benefits they deserve is near and dear to me.  Last Congress, I was heartened by the overwhelming support for these  veterans when the House passed H.R. 299 by a vote of 382-0.   To say the least, I was very disappointed that last year's bill  stalled in the Senate, and never made it to the President's desk.  However, with 333 cosponsors, it is my hope this legislation passes the  House with the same bipartisan support as last year's package, and the  Senate takes it up quickly. I know that is an oxymoron in the Senate,  but quickly.   As many of you know, Agent Orange was used in Vietnam to defoliate  areas in the jungle where enemy forces would ambush our troops. When  Vietnam veterans began developing diseases as a result of their contact  with Agent Orange, Congress legislated the Agent Orange presumption to  streamline benefits for affected veterans.   Unfortunately, the Department of Veterans Affairs' longstanding  practice was to limit the presumption to veterans who set foot, boots  on the ground, in Vietnam or served in inland waterways or brown water.   The blue water Navy Vietnam veterans were excluded from the  presumption because VA claims there was not enough information to  determine whether they came into contact with herbicides. As a result,  blue water Navy Vietnam veterans must provide evidence that they were  actually harmed by herbicides.   I understand how incredibly difficult this must be for veterans who  try to find any records for potential exposure. I served in the United  States 2nd Infantry Division in Korea near the DMZ, and I have no way  to prove where I walked there 40-something years ago. There is just no  way to prove that.   But right now, these veterans are suffering from conditions that are  known to be associated with exposure to Agent Orange, and I believe  Congress must act to resolve this issue definitively.   The recent court decision in Procopio was a huge victory for our blue  water Navy Vietnam veterans. However, it is unclear how VA plans to  implement the court's holdings. Congress should not wait for this issue  to work itself out by VA or the courts.   These veterans have waited long enough to receive acknowledgment from  VA that their illnesses may have been caused by their military service.   Mr. Speaker, 523 Vietnam veterans are dying each day. So, if the VA  and this government waits long enough, we will all die. We need to get  this done.   We must pass H.R. 299, as amended, so that our blue water Vietnam  Navy veterans can qualify for the same benefits as their boots-on-the- ground and brown-water Navy comrades.   Moreover, H.R. 299 not only addresses the concerns of blue water Navy  Vietnam veterans, but also includes provisions that would: one, extend  the presumption to veterans who served in or near the Korean DMZ on  September 1, 1967; provide benefits to certain children of Thailand  veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange; and require VA to identify  the U.S. military bases located in Thailand where Agent Orange was used  and when it was used.   Mr. Speaker, one of my best friends I will ever have in my life who  served on one of those air bases died of a very rare lymphoma. The  perimeter was sprayed with Agent Orange, and he died about 4 years ago.   H.R. 299 also provides an update on current research on their  potential or in-service toxic exposures of the Gulf War veterans.   Finally, this bill would make several improvements to the VA home  loan program, including: changing VA's home appraisal system so that  veterans can close on their homes quicker and more seamlessly;  eliminating the conforming home loan limit to allow veterans to use  their earned VA loan benefits in more expensive areas; extending the  waiver of home loan funding fees to recipients of the Purple Heart who  are still serving on Active Duty; and temporarily increasing VA's home  loan funding fees for nondisabled veterans, which would offset the cost  of the bill.   I would be remiss if I did not thank veteran service organizations  for their unwavering support on this issue. I am particularly grateful  to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, The  American Legion, the Vietnam Veterans of America, the Paralyzed  Veterans of America, the Military Officers Association of America,  AMVETS, and the Military Order of the Purple Heart for their hard work  on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I just read a study that was published yesterday that  the United States is going into Vietnam and providing some benefits for  some of the people there whose offspring were damaged. We are also  doing mega-site cleanups. We are spending tens of millions of dollars  to clean up Da Nang and Bien Hoa, the two major air bases where this  Agent Orange was used.   It is time we did the same thing for America's veterans here in the  United States. That is the right thing to do there. It is the right  thing to do here.   I think I can speak for all of us today when I say that H.R. 299, as  amended, does the right thing for our veterans.   Once again, Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 299,  as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1515     ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost), who was the previous chairman of  the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee and is now  ranking member.   Mr.   Mike Bost is a marine veteran who also led a bill that we  passed 2 years ago, the appeals modernization bill, a bill that has  helped so many disabled veterans get their claims adjudicated more  quickly.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).  Dan Meuser is a new and very  dedicated member of our committee.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would  like to thank the chairman. I know Walter's family appreciates that. He  served this House, this Chamber, honorably for so many years and was an  incredible supporter of our Nation's veterans. I know his family and I  certainly appreciate the chairman's acknowledging his service and his  dedication to our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Zeldin). I have been to his district, and there is no better and more  fervent supporter of our Nation's veterans.    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we all know why dioxin, or Agent Orange, was sprayed in  Vietnam. At the time we thought, our government thought, that we were  protecting our troops by spraying this defoliant to expose the hiding  places where they were being ambushed. We understand that. I get that.   Mr. Speaker, if you were at an air base in Thailand and you were  being attacked on the perimeter, I understand why it was being done. It  turns out it was a horrific mistake, and it is costing lives now.   It is time to do the right thing, and the right thing with 523 of us  dying each day is to pass this bill, H.R. 299, and get it to the  Senate. I believe the chairman and I would like to challenge the Senate  to start hearing this and perhaps even vote on it before Memorial Day.  That would be the right thing to do.   Also, I want to thank Congressman David Valadao, who is no longer  here, along with my good friend Mr. Walz, who is now the Governor of  Minnesota. Congressman Valadao was very helpful. There was not a day on  the House floor that I was down here that David was not asking me: When  are we going to get the Blue Water Navy bill passed? When are we going  to pass this bill?    Mr. Speaker, it is time to stop talking about it, and it is time to  do something about it. The reason that it is important to not let the  courts decide is another court may decide just like 1997, when they  changed what the VA was doing. So it is time to put this in the  footprint of the law so that there is no question about what we do.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman. I want to  thank him for when he was a member of the committee when I was chairman  of the last Congress, how hard we all worked in a bipartisan way to get  this done.   Just so the public knows, last week, we passed 18 bills--this is one  of them--out of our committee in a bipartisan way on a voice vote.  Congress can work. This is one of the ways it does work very well.  Again, I want to thank my staff and the majority staff for their help  with this.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
