 Mr. President, I know that we are in the middle of an  important debate about a topic of education in our schools. One of the  topics I hope young Americans will learn more about is the state of  affairs across the world when it comes to human rights.   We are a vibrant society engaged in a heated debate, as we often have  been throughout our history, about items of political matters. If you  look here today, there are people standing up to speak on different  sides of an issue. You see that the Republican Party today controls the  White House, the Senate, and the House, and yet you have people with  the freedom in this country to be able to stand up and oppose that. We  have seen that across the country with demonstrations and speeches and  all sorts of other protected speech. We are very fortunate  [[Page S718]]  and blessed to live in a nation with those freedoms. That is not the  case all over the world.   I wanted to take this opportunity in the midst of all of this debate  and discussion about an important topic, the nomination before the  Senate, to remind people that despite our differences on these issues,  we are truly blessed to be able to live in a country where opposing the  party in power does not mean you go to jail.   As I have been doing for some time now, I wanted to come this evening  and highlight yet another example of human rights abuses that is taking  place in a very important part of the world. For the past couple of  years, my office and I have been highlighting human rights cases  through our social media campaign. We call it hashtag ``Expression NOT  Oppression.''   The goals of this are to raise awareness about these cases and the  individuals who are suffering at the hands of these repressive  governments. We know that through history some of the oppressed  people--we may not think these floor speeches matter; we may not think  that mentioning it here in this forum matters, but it does to them  because one of the first things oppressors tell them is that the world  has forgotten about them, and they don't matter anymore. That is one of  the first reasons we come: to raise awareness and let them know we know  their names, we know their story, and we will continue to speak out on  their behalf.   The second reason is to show their families and their loved ones that  elected officials--like me here in the United States--have not  forgotten them because we know that tyrants, as I said, like to tell  political prisoners that they are alone in their struggle.   The third reason is to call for action, whether it is for the  administration to make their causes a priority, too, or to call on  these governments to release these individuals.   There is one more reason I think that this effort, hashtag  ``Expression NOT Oppression,'' is important. As well as all the good  work being done here on both sides of the aisle in defense of human  rights, promotion of democracy and the defense of God-given freedoms  like religious freedom and freedom of the press and free speech, which  we celebrate here even in this debate, have to continue to be pillars  of our foreign policy. I hope that these cases we highlight bring those  guiding principles to light.   Today, I want to discuss the cases of two Chinese political prisoners  whose courageous wives I had the opportunity to meet last week when  they visited in Washington, DC. These women personally requested that I  intervene on behalf of their husbands, pressing on the Chinese  Government to unconditionally release them and, in the case of one, to  account for his whereabouts. Perhaps just as importantly, they urged me  that I press our own State Department to prioritize these cases  diplomatically in the hope that these families can be reunited in the  not-too-distant future.   I come here today to urge our now new Secretary of State, Mr.  Tillerson, to prioritize the release of these men in his diplomatic  engagement with China. In the coming weeks, I also expect that we will  have a chance to hear from the President's nominee to be U.S.  Ambassador to China, Governor Branstad of Iowa. When he comes before  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing, I  will bring up these cases and others and urge him to make their freedom  a priority of his work if confirmed.   Jiang Tianyong is a 45-year-old lawyer. He was disbarred by the  Chinese Government because of his vigorous human rights advocacy,  including his representation of blind legal advocate Chen Guangcheng,  fellow rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, Falun Gong practitioners, and other  human rights cases. Despite the risks of this work, he has been  steadfast in his support of the families and of their right to lawyers  and legal advocates caught up in China's sweeping nationwide crackdown  on the legal community in July of 2015, which ensnared roughly 250  lawyers and advocates.   Consistent with a spate of recent media stories, Jiang's wife  indicated that his family and friends lost contact with him in late  November of last year. That is when a Chinese state-controlled  newspaper reported he had been detained for a series of trumped-up  charges.   His wife has received no formal confirmation of his precise  whereabouts, and, to date, he has been denied access to a lawyer of his  choosing. Even more troubling is that this is entirely legal under  China's laws, even though it violates all international norms of  justice. Under China's own laws, authorities may hold him, or anyone,  for up to 6 months without informing his family where he is held and  without allowing him to access a lawyer, conditions that the United  Nations Committee Against Torture has found place ``detainees at a  high-risk of torture.'' Indeed, reports over the past months about four  other human rights lawyers provide detailed information about the  Chinese authorities' use of torture to extract ``confessions'' and  impose unbearable psychological pressure.    All of these realities underscore that China remains a country of  rule by law. Congressmen Chris Smith of New Jersey and I cochair the  Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which found in our 2016  annual report that ``the Chinese Communist Party has continued to  reject the notion that the rule of law should supercede the Party's  role in guiding the functions of the State.'' As such, lawyers,  advocates, dissidents and others often find themselves in the party's  crosshairs, persecuted under the law, rather than protected by it, and  they have no recourse of justice.   A second Chinese individual I want to highlight today is lawyer Tang  Jingling, who has also been disbarred for his rights advocacy. He first  gained prominence as a lawyer working on cases related to village  compensation, corruption, and by representing activists. In January of  last year, he was convicted of ``inciting subversion of state power.''  That is the charge, and he was sentenced to 5 years in prison. He was  first detained in May 2014 on suspicion of ``picking quarrels and  provoking troubles.'' Just imagine that. Picking quarrels and provoking  troubles is a crime in China. This happened, by the way, during the  lead up to the 21st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, when  the Chinese Government worked desperately to wipe out any discussion or  memory of this historically brutal crackdown. In reality, all Tang and  other activists did was participate in a nonviolent disobedience  movement seeking legal and social reform in China.   Following his conviction, Tang eloquently wrote:         Inside the grand edifice of the court, we can see stately       and ornate furnishings and decorations, and we can see the       government employees in dignified attire. But we cannot see       the law and we can definitely not see justice.    He continues, movingly, speaking of the faith that has sustained him  in the midst of injustice:         The Holy Bible has a passage that reads: ``Blessed are       those that are persecuted for righteousness' sake.'' Today,       we have been pronounced guilty, thrown in prison, separated       from our families, and have endured humiliation and       difficulties--and I am far from being able to convince and       prove to others how these tribulations could have become my       blessings. But God's will is inevitably difficult to       understand. I often pray and ask him to give me more       strength, so that I may persevere until the moment of       revelation. I dare say, in 2011, while in a secret jail, and       now in detention, almost every day I have passed has been       calm and fulfilling. I have never lost my direction.    The courage and conviction of these men should be an inspiration to  us all--an inspiration that should propel us to act. I would add a  reminder again of how blessed and fortunate we are to live by the grace  of God in a nation where we have the freedom to speak, to object, to  state our views without fear of the circumstances and the consequences  that these brave men now face. The Chinese people who yearn for the  protection of their most basic human rights and bravely stand with  their fellow marginalized countrymen are China's greatest asset--not  its biggest threat, as the government of the Communist Party wrongly  believes. Any government which views its own people with such fear and  hostility will, as has often been said, find itself on the wrong side  of history.   So I hope more of my colleagues in this body, in the House, and  especially in the administration will join their voices in support of  these political prisoners and all who languish in jails, prisons, and  gulags simply because  [[Page S719]]  they want a better life, because they want a say in their future and  have bravely made these aspirations clear.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry as well.   The first question, Mr. President, is this: It is my understanding  that the ruling of the Chair was based on the advice of the  Parliamentarian. Is that accurate, Mr. President; on the advice of the  Parliamentarian that the rule had been violated?    OK. The second question I have, Mr. President: Does the  rule say anything that impugns another Member of the Senate, directly  or indirectly? Is that an accurate reading of the rule?    Thank you, Mr. President.    Mr. President, I first have a parliamentary inquiry. These  are the continuing rules of the Senate that have been in existence  previous to this time and have carried over into this session, is that  correct?    The reason I ask that is the following--but I think we all  feel very passionate about the issues before us. I have not been here  as long as Senator Leahy, whose service has been quite distinguished  over a long period of time. I truly do understand the passions people  bring to this body. I like to think that I, too, am passionate about  the issues before us.   I think this is an important moment. It is late. Not many people are  paying attention. I wish they would though because I think the question  here is one of the reasons I ran for this body to begin with. Maybe it  is because of my background; I am surrounded by people who have lost  freedoms in places where they are not allowed to speak. One of the  great traditions of our Nation is the ability to come forward and have  debates.   But the Founders and the Framers and those who established this  institution and guided us over two centuries understood that that  debate was impossible if, in fact, the matter became of a personal  nature. I don't believe that was necessarily the intention here,  although perhaps that was the way it turned out. But I think it is  important for us to understand why that matters so much.   I want people to think about our politics here in America because I  am telling you guys, I don't know of a single Nation in the history of  the world that has been able to solve its problems when half the people  in the country absolutely hate the other half of the people in that  country. This is the most important country in the world, and this body  cannot function if people are offending one another, and that is why  those rules are in place.   I was not here when Secretary Clinton was nominated as a Member of  this body at the time, but I can tell you that I am just barely old  enough to know that some very nasty things have been written and said  about Senator Clinton. And I think the Senate should be very proud that  during her nomination to be Secretary of State--despite the fact that I  imagine many people were not excited about the fact that she would be  Secretary of State--to my recollection, and perhaps I am incorrect, not  a single one of those horrible things that have been written or said  about her, some of which actually did accuse her of wrongdoing, was  uttered on the floor of the Senate.   I happen to remember in 2004 when then-Senator Kerry ran for  President. Some pretty strong things were written and said about him. I  was here for that when he was nominated and confirmed to be Secretary  of State. And I don't recall a single statement being read into the  Record about the things that have been said about him.   Now, I want everybody to understand that at the end of the night,  this is not a partisan issue. It really is not. I can tell you this  with full confidence that if one of my colleagues on this side of the  aisle had done that, I would also like to think that I would have been  one of those people objecting, and here is why.   Turn on the news and watch these parliaments around the world where  people throw chairs at each other and throw punches, and ask yourself:  How does that make you feel about those countries? It doesn't give you  a lot of confidence about those countries. I am not arguing that we are  anywhere near that tonight, but we are flirting with it. We are  flirting with it in this body, and we are flirting with it in this  country. We are becoming a society incapable of having debates anymore.   In this country, if you watch the big policy debates that are going  on in America, no one ever stops to say: I think you are wrong. I  understand your point of view. I get it. You have some valid points,  but let me tell you why I think my view is better. I don't hear that  anymore.    Here is what I hear almost automatically--and let me be fair--from  both sides of these debates. Immediately, immediately, as soon as you  offer an idea, the other side jumps and says that the reason you say  that is because you don't care about poor people, because you only care  about rich people, because you are this or you are that or you are the  other. And I am just telling you guys, we are reaching a point in this  Republic where we are not going to be able to solve the simplest of  issues because everyone is putting themselves in the corner where  everyone hates everybody.   Now I don't pretend to say that I am not myself from time to time in  heated debates outside of this forum. I have been guilty of perhaps  hyperbole, and for those--I am not proud of it.   But I have to tell you, I think what is at stake here tonight and as  we debate moving forward is not simply some rule but the ability of the  most important Nation on Earth to debate in a productive and respectful  way the pressing issues before us. I just hope we understand that  because I have tremendous respect for the other Chamber, and I  understand that it was designed to be different. But one of the reasons  I chose to run for the Senate and, quite frankly, to run for reelection  is that I believed I served with 99 other men and women who deeply love  their country, who have different points of view, who represent men and  women who have different views from the men and women whom I may  represent on a given issue and who are here to advocate for their  points of view, never impugning their motives.   One of the things I take great pride in--and I tell this to people  all the time--is that the one thing you learn about the Senate is,  whether you agree with them or not, you understand why every single one  of those other 99 people are here. They are intelligent people, they  are smart people, they are  [[Page S858]]  hard-working people. They believe in what they are saying, and they  articulate it in a very passionate and effective way.   When I see my colleague stand up and say something I don't agree  with, I try to tell myself: Look, I don't understand why they stand for  that, but I know why they are doing it. It is because they represent  people who believe that.   I am so grateful that God has allowed me to be born, to live, and to  raise my family in a nation where people with such different points of  view are able to debate those things in a way that doesn't lead to war,  that doesn't lead to overthrows, that doesn't lead to violence. And you  may take that for granted.   All around the world tonight, there are people who, if they stood up  here and said the things that we say about the President or others in  authority, they would go to jail. I am not saying that is where we are  headed as a nation; I am just saying, don't ever take that for granted.   The linchpin of that is this institution. The linchpin of that debate  is the ability of this institution through unlimited debate and the  decorum necessary for that debate to be able to conduct itself in that  manner.   I know that tonight was probably a made-for-TV moment for some  people. This has nothing to do with censuring the words of some great  heroes. I have extraordinary admiration for the men and women who led  the civil rights effort in this country, and I am self-conscious or  understanding enough to know that many of the things that have been  possible for so many people in this country in the 21st century were  made possible by the sacrifices and the work of those who came before  us.   This has to do with a fundamental reality, and that is that this body  cannot carry out its work if it is not able to conduct debates in a way  that is respectful of one another, especially those of us who are in  this Chamber together.   I also understand this: If the Senate ceases to work, if we reach a  point where this institution--given everything else that is going on in  politics today, where you are basically allowed to say just about  anything, for I have seen over the last year and a half things said  about people, about issues, about institutions in our republic that I  never thought I would see ever--ever. If we lose this body's ability to  conduct debate in a dignified manner--and I mean this with no  disrespect to anyone else. I don't believe anyone came on the floor  here tonight saying: I am going to be disrespectful on purpose and turn  this into a circus. But I am just telling you that if this body loses  the ability to have those sorts of debates, then where in this country  is that going to happen? In what other forum in this Nation is that  going to be possible?   So I would just hope everybody would stop and think about that. I  know I have been here only for 6 years, so I don't have a deep  reservoir of Senate history to rely on. But I know this: If this body  isn't capable of having those debates, there will be no place in this  country where those debates can occur. I think every single one of us,  to our great shame, will live to regret it.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, first, I do appreciate the words of my  colleague from Colorado, and I thank him for them, and that topic  deserves more discussion on the floor of the Senate.   One of the things that always gives me extraordinary pride to be an  American and to be a Member of the Senate is the realization--as I sat  here today and listened to my colleague from South Carolina, Senator  Scott--that neither my ancestors nor his were participants in terms of  structuring this Republic. Yet this Republic is so grand that it has  plenty of room for people like me and him and so many others  participating--including here, as one of only 100 Americans who are  entrusted with the responsibility of representing our States and also  upholding our Constitution in this body.   The Senator from Colorado is also right in talking about the role of  the Senate not just in terms of passing laws but in conducting  oversight irrespective of who occupies the White House. It is a  difficult thing to do these days because everything in American  politics is covered through the lens of politics and of elections.  Almost immediately, whatever I say here on the floor today will be  analyzed through the lens and construct of elections past and elections  future. What is he trying to achieve or what are any of us trying to  achieve politically? There is a place for that. I think we are not  foolish enough to believe there is no politics in politics.   There is also something that is incredibly important, and that is the  Constitution that every single one of us is sworn to uphold. It is a  pledge I again took recently on these very steps a few feet away from  where I stand here now a few weeks ago.   Part of that is, in fact, to oversee the foreign policy conduct of  the United States. As many of us are aware, there has been recent  discussion in some circles, including in my party, about a desire to  achieve a better relationship with Vladimir Putin and with Russia. By  the way, I share that goal. I think it would be good for the world if  the United States and Russia had a better relationship and, in  particular, with the Russian people, with whom we have no quarrel. I  also think we have a responsibility to understand what the obstacles  are to better relations.   It is in that context that I come to the floor of the Senate today  because I had a lot of people ask me over the last week, over the last  few months: Why is it that you have such views about our relationships  with Russia on the way forward?   I want to take a moment to discuss that in the broader context, with  everything else that is happening here now. Even as we work through  these nominations, the world continues to turn, and events around the  world continue to have an impact on us here.   Let me begin by saying this. I don't think this is a fact that can be  disputed. Vladimir Putin today has amassed more power in Moscow and  Russia than any leader in Russia in about 60 years, if not longer. He  used to maintain that power through a pretty straightforward deal that  he had with both elites and the broader society.   Here is the deal he used to have with them. The deal was this: I will  help you--especially the elites--make a lot of money and become very  wealthy, and I will help society at-large by helping to grow our  economy. In return, however, I need complete power and complete control  of the government.   That was basically the arrangement he had up until just a few years  ago when a combination of falling oil prices and economic decline  forced them into a different direction. The new model that Vladimir  Putin is now pursuing in Russia is one in which he is basically trying  to gin up and rally public support, and he is largely doing it through  a foreign policy which is aggressive and which is designed to create an  impression among the Russian people that Russia has now been restored  to great power status--a status equal or on par with that of the United  States.   The first thing we have to understand is that much of what Vladimir  Putin does is not in pursuit of an ideology, like the Soviet Union did.  It is about domestic politics in Russia and about needing the Russian  people to believe that he and his strength are essential to what Russia  has. So much of it is about that.   What are the prongs of the strategy? The first is that he has sought  to make their military modern and strong, and you see evidence of that  in the fact that while Russia is going through crippling budget cuts as  a result of a downturn in the global economy, oil prices falling, and  sanctions against the Putin government, they are increasing defense  spending. They are modernizing. They are adding capabilities. They are,  for the first time, although in a limited way, beginning to conduct  naval exercises and projection of power in places they hadn't been in  for 25 years or longer.   The second is a crackdown in internal dissent. For that, I think the  evidence is overwhelming. I know we have all heard recently about the  case of Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is a Russian political opposition  leader. He is a vocal critic of Vladimir Putin. He works at something  called the Open Russia Foundation, an organization of activists who  call for open elections, a free press, and civil rights reforms in  Russia.    This is an interesting thing to talk about because there has been a  lot of discussion on this floor a moment ago about the press and a lot  of discussion about elections, of course, over the last year and  longer. There has been a lot of discussion about civil rights. Think  about this. This is what the Open Russia Foundation works for and on  behalf of in Russia.   In America, when you believe that civil rights are being violated at  this moment in our history or you think the election system isn't  working the way it should or you are defending the press, as my  colleagues have done here today in the right of a free press, you have  a bad blog post written about you, someone may run against you for  office, cable commentators will say nasty things about you from the  other side, maybe somebody will stand up on the floor and criticize you  for this or that.   Let me tell you what happens when you do that in Russia. They poison  you. Kara-Murza is believed to have been poisoned in February 2017;  after he experienced organ failure, and he is currently in the  hospital--just this month. This comes 2 years after another suspected  poisoning that nearly killed him in May 2015.   I want to take a moment to urge the administration to do everything  in their power to ensure that he is receiving the medical care he needs  and to help determine who was behind the latest apparent attempt  against him.   If this was an isolated case, you would say: Well, maybe something  else happened. There is an incredible number of critics of Vladimir  Putin that wind up poisoned, dead, shot in the head in their hotel  room, found in the street, and other things.   In other instances, just today we have this article from the Wall  Street Journal about someone who was thinking about running against  Vladimir Putin. Alexei Navalny was thinking about running for  President.   So what happens in America when somebody thinks you are going to run  for President? They do an opposition research file. They plant negative  stories about you. They start badmouthing you on cable news. That is  unpleasant, no doubt. He was found guilty by a kangaroo court of  corruption, which, of course, according to Russian law, finds him and  blocks him from running in next year's Presidential election.   Again, if this were an isolated case, you would say: Maybe this guy  did  [[Page S955]]  something wrong. The problem is, just about anyone who is either  thinking about running for office or challenging Putin winds up  poisoned, dead, in jail, or charged and convicted of a crime.   The second thing he has done is just completely crack down on all  internal dissent. There is no free press in Russia. I would venture to  guess that if I controlled 80 to 90 percent of the press reported about  me, I would probably have approval ratings in the eighties and nineties  as well. That is a pretty good deal for the leader but not for the  people.   The third thing that is part of this effort is that they are  basically doing everything they can--Vladimir Putin--to undermine the  international order that is built on democracy and respect for human  rights. I think the example of that is in various places.   Look at what has happened in Syria. Vladimir Putin gets involved in  Syria, not because he cares about humanitarian crises--because, in  fact, Russian forces have conducted airstrikes in civilian areas. We  have seen the images. It is undeniable that it happened. It is by every  definition of the word a war crime to target civilians with military  weaponry.   That is what has happened in Syria. But for Vladimir Putin, it has  been successful because his engagement basically changes the conflict.  He now has positioned himself in the eyes of the Russian people and  many people around the world as a power broker in the Middle East--in  fact, as an alternative to the United States in that region.   This is part of his strategy. It wasn't about Syria as much as it was  about his goal of being able to go to the Russian people and say that  we matter again on the global stage. In Ukraine, there was talk about  moving toward the European Union in terms of economic relations. There  was talk about joining NATO. Then he invaded Crimea, and he kept it. He  has funded separatists forces in eastern Ukraine. There is no more talk  of NATO, and there is no more talk of unifying the economy with Europe,  and they kept Crimea. The last few days we are starting to read open  press reports of mobilization and unusual activity among eastern  Ukrainian separatists backed, supported, trained, and equipped by the  Russians, and we fear that new fighting could be imminent at any moment  once again.   Then we have all heard the discussions about the elections in the  United States and the efforts of other governments to not just hack  computers. It is not about hacking alone. It is about the strategic  placing of information, gathered through cyber intrusion, for the  purposes of undermining political candidates and, therefore,  influencing the election.   There was something deeper here. It was part of a broader effort to  discredit our Republic and our democracy, to be able to go back to the  Russian people and to the broader world and say that the American  political system is corrupt. The American political system is not a  true democracy. The American political system is as bad as all these  other systems in the world that they criticize. They do not come to  this with clean hands.   I often wonder sometimes if we contribute to that argument in the way  we behave toward one another in our political discourse in this  country. That is something to think about in the long term. I hope  people understand that as we engage in these political debates in this  country, these things are being viewed around the world. For people who  may not have a clear perspective, or if this information is being used  negatively--by no means am I saying that we should not have vibrant  debate in this country; we should, but I also want people to  understand--that oftentimes gives off the perception that, in fact, our  Republic is on the verge of collapse.   We are in challenging times. We have some strong disagreements, and  oftentimes they become heated. I know for a fact that there isn't a  single Member of this body prepared to walk away from the Constitution  or the liberties that it protects and are enshrined therein.   By the way, I don't believe Vladimir Putin is done in this effort. I  think you are now going to see him continue to interfere in Yemen. He  can use that as leverage against the gulf kingdoms, against the Saudis.   I think you are going to see him continue to engage in Egypt. He will  go to the Egyptians and say: The Americans are always hassling you  about human rights. Why don't you just buy your weapons from us? Why  don't you give us a military base? We are never going to give you grief  about human rights. We are a much easier and low-maintenance partner.   I wouldn't even be surprised to see him start dabbling in Afghanistan  with the Taliban, in some capacity anyway, and couch it in terms of  fighting ISIS.   We will see. My point is, it is not done. I bring all that up in the  context of this suggestion among some, and I think it is important to  talk about it because I don't think we should dismiss viewpoints. There  are some, including in the administration, who believe that maybe we  can do a deal with Vladimir Putin where he helps us fight against ISIS  and in return we lift sanctions. The argument that I hear from people  is this: Why wouldn't we want better relations with Vladimir Putin and  enlist them in the fight against ISIS?   I come here today in the context of everything I have laid out to  tell you why I think that is unrealistic and deeply problematic.   Here is No. 1. Why do we have to do a deal with Vladimir Putin to  fight ISIS? He already claims that he is. In fact, that is the way he  describes their operations in Syria--as an anti-terror operation. There  is no more dangerous terrorist group in the world today than ISIS.  There is certainly no more dangerous terrorist group in the world today  than ISIS. There is certainly no more dangerous and capable a terrorist  group in Syria today than ISIS.   Isn't that what he is already doing? Why would we then have to cut a  deal to encourage him to do what he claims to already be doing? There  are only two reasons. Either No. 1, we think he should do more, which  in and of itself tells you that he is not doing it; or No. 2, because  he is not doing it now.   Here is the second problem: this argument that as part of this whole  effort with Russia, one of the things we would be able to achieve is to  break them from the Iranians, to create some sort of split between the  Russians and the Iranians.   I saw an article the other day talking about that as part of this  endeavor. My argument to you is that we don't really need to do that.  That is going to happen on its own. Say what you want, as soon as ISIS  is destroyed in Syria and Iraq or in both, the Iranians are going to  immediately not just push to drive the Americans out of the region but  drive the Russians out as well.   The Iranians are not interested in replacing American influence in  the region with Russian influence. They want to be the hegemonic power  in the region. As to this argument that we somehow can peel them apart,  my friends, that is going to happen all on its own. If we abandon there  tomorrow, the Iranians would immediately turn to driving the Russians  out as well because they want to be the hegemonic power. They have long  desired to be the hegemonic power in the region. That is going to put  them in conflict with the Russians sooner rather than later at some  point here, at least to some level.   The third thing I think we have to understand is that there is  absolutely no pressure, no political rationale why Vladimir Putin needs  a better relationship with the United States at this time, at least not  politically. He is not going to lose an election, because if you run  against him, you go to jail. He controls the press. He controls the  political discourse in the country. So one of the reasons we should  always be advocates for democracy is because democratic leaders act  much more responsibly because they have to answer to their people, but  in essence that is not what you have in Russia. There is really no  reason or rationale why he would be pressured to have a better  relationship with us.    Do the Russian people want a better relationship with America? I have  no doubt about that, but I want you to understand that everything they  learn about our relationship with them is largely derived through the  Russian press. If you never had the pleasure of watching, for example,  the RT Network on television, and you are interested in comedy and  satire, I encourage you to tune into that station from time to time so  you can see an alternative representation of events that would startle  you, and perhaps make you laugh.  [[Page S956]]  This is unfortunately the sort of media information that filters to the  Russian people that Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin completely control.   Here is the fourth and perhaps most important reason I think this  endeavor is unrealistic and perhaps even counterproductive. The price  you would have to pay is simply too high in return for the alleged  benefit that would come about.   No. 1, the Russian Federation under Vladimir Putin has basically  violated every agreement they have made now and in the past. They are  violating the cease-fire. They violated all sorts of arrangements with  regard to arms reductions, and they will continue to do that in any  deal anyone cuts with him.   The second is one of the first things he is going to ask for is the  lifting of all sanctions for both Ukraine and interference in our  elections, in return for no changes to the status in Ukraine and no  promise of not undertaking efforts like what happened here in the  future.   The third thing they are going to demand is recognition of a Russian  sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, especially in places that are  now countries that were once part of the Soviet Union. In essence, a  United States acceptance officially or otherwise that there are  countries in the world who are not allowed to enter into economic or  military engagements with the United States unless Russia allows it.   You think about that. They are basically going to ask us to play some  game of geopolitical chess, where we basically turn over the  sovereignty and future of other Nations and say to them there are these  countries in the world, and we are not going to try to do anything with  them, economic, political, cultural, socially or militarily, unless you  give us permission to do so. This would be a requirement. It is one of  the things he insists upon.   He would also require the United States to support pulling back NATO  troops and equipment and personnel and operations from Nations in  Europe, which would be devastating to the NATO alliance, which one of  his other goals is to render NATO feckless and irrelevant.   I just don't think that is a price worth paying in exchange for  alleged cooperation against ISIS--that he claims to already be  conducting--and in exchange for basically sending a message to the  world that America is your ally, unless there is a better deal with us  for someone else. That would be devastating. What do I think we should  do, and what I hope the Senate will do, if there is an effort now or  any time in the future, by anyone, to change or conduct a deal of this  magnitude?   I think the first thing we need to do is be committed to the  principle. These sanctions that are in place should remain in place  until the conditions in those sanctions are met, until the sovereignty  of Ukraine is respected, and until these efforts to undermine democracy  and spread misinformation are fully accounted for.   The second is, I think it is important for us to reaffirm our  commitment to NATO, and that includes the building up of defenses and  exercises, that we continue to do that firmly, not just with our NATO  allies but with any nation who seeks cooperation with us.   The third is careful but strategic engagement in the Middle East to  the Iraqis, to make very clear that the United States will continue to  be their partner after ISIS falls; that we want Iraq to be prosperous  and free and that we believe it is better for the world and we are  prepared to help them achieve that.   To the Egyptians, we will continue to press them on human rights, and  we should. We should also be willing at the same time--and, by the way,  with the argument that respecting human rights is actually good for  Egypt, that in the long term these conditions that exist will lead to  constant threats to their government, but we can do that while at the  same time continuing to partner with them on military sales. I think  they would welcome a conversation about trade and potentially a  bilateral trade agreement with them about opening up avenues for  business investment and so forth.   The fourth is to point out that if they are not going after ISIS,  then what exactly are they doing now? It is important for us to point  that out to the world. Again, I made this point numerous times. I want  to make it once again; this idea that we are going to get them to  cooperate much more against ISIS basically implies they are not doing  it now, but they claim that is why they are in Syria to begin with.   Finally, I think it is important for us to try to communicate  directly with the Russian people to the extent possible. It is hard to  do because the Russian Government, under Putin, also controls the  Internet with filters and the like. It is important for us to say our  quarrel is not with the Russian people; that for many years up until  this unfortunate turn of events over the last decade, the links with  the United States and the Russian people grew strong and those links  remain.   In my home State of Florida, there is a significant number of  Russians who live in Florida part time and so forth. I hope that will  continue. Our quarrel is not with the Russian people, and we desire for  Russia to be powerful and influential in the world. We want Russia to  be prosperous. This country does not view this as a zero-sum gain. In  order for America to be influential, Russia must be less influential.   Our quarrel is not with Russia but a leader who does view it as a  zero-sum gain, a leader who believes the only way Russia can be more  important is for America to be less important, a leader who has chosen  to try to undermine an international order based on democracy and free  enterprise and human rights that has kept the world out of a third  world war, and I think it is important for us to do that.   I think that is important and why we need at least to be prepared in  this body, if necessary, to move forward with legislation that doesn't  just codify existing sanctions but that prevents the lifting of those  sanctions, unless the conditions in those sanctions are met. This is  our job. It is true that Presidents and administrations have an  obligation, a duty, and a right to set the foreign policies of the  United States. There is no doubt about it. I think that is true, no  matter who is the President.    But it would be a mistake, and in my opinion, a dereliction of duty  for the Senate and the Congress to not recognize that we, too, have a  duty to shape the foreign policy of the United States and the power to  declare war in the budgets that we pass, in the laws and conditions  that we put in place, and in our ability to override vetoes, when  necessary, even in the process of nominating individuals to serve in  the U.S. Government and the executive branch.   We not only have the power, we have the obligation; the obligation to  shape and mold and direct the foreign policy of this Nation, and if we  don't, then we are not living up to the oath we took when we entered  this body, and that it is not a political thing. This is not about  embarrassing anyone. This is not about partisan issues. It should never  be. In fact, one of the traditions that has existed in this Nation for  a long time is that foreign policy, when it came to issues that  impacted the security issues of the United States, there was an effort  to make sure it was as bipartisan or nonpartisan as possible because  when America gets in trouble on national security, there is no way to  isolate on a bipartisan basis.   It is my hope, as we debate all these other issues, that we continue  to keep these issues in mind because it is critical to the future of  our Nation, critical to our standing in the world, and ultimately vital  and critical to the kind of world and Nation we will leave to our  children and grandchildren in the years and decades to come.   I, for one, in the midst of all of this debate about a bunch of  issues that divide us, will continue to work to ensure that this is one  that unites us and allows us to live up to our constitutional  obligation, to participate fully in shaping and directing the foreign  policy of this great Nation.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
