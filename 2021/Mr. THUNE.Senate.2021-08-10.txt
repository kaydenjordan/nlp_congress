 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in the time that I have been in the  Congress, which includes 6 years in the House of Representatives and  now in my 17th year in the Senate, I have been a part of or witness to  or voted on numerous spending proposals and appropriation bills, tax  bills, deficit reduction bills, and debt-limit increase bills through  the years, and I don't think I have ever seen in all my time in the  Congress a spending bill where Democrats didn't want to spend more and  Republicans wanted to spend less.   Maybe that is consistent with our overall governing philosophies.  Republicans historically believe in limited but effective government,  in personal freedom coupled with individual responsibility, in economic  freedom, and in peace through strength. Those are sort of guiding  principles.   So when you get into a debate about spending and budgets and  appropriation and taxes and all those sorts of things, in all the time  I have been here--and I say this with respect to the bill that we are  going to be voting on here in a few moments--Republicans try to spend  more efficiently, more effectively--less, because they know that every  dollar that gets spent here is coming from an American taxpayer.   So when the bipartisan legislation that the Senate will vote on here  momentarily was being considered, it started out at about $2.5  trillion. That is what President Biden wanted to spend on  infrastructure. Democrats in the Congress--in the Senate; for sure in  the House of Representatives but in the Senate here as well--wanted to  spend way more than what Republicans wanted to spend. Republicans, on  the other hand, wanted to come up with a bill that met the needs that  the country has, that was robust in addressing infrastructure concerns  out there but spent significantly less than what Democrats proposed   I say that simply because it has been my experience--I have observed  this, as I said, over the better part of 25 years now here in the  Congress--that every debate, every fight about spending, taxes, and  debt, Democrats want to spend more and Republicans want to spend less,  again with the recognition that every one of those dollars that gets  spent here in Washington, DC, is coming from an American taxpayer  somewhere across this country.   So, as we think about what we are going to do next, I have to just  say it is staggering to me, what we are talking about--the dimensions;  the scale; $3.5 trillion in spending on top of $2 trillion spent  earlier this year, much of which had nothing to do with the  coronavirus.   Much of the justification for a lot of the spending at one time, at  least, was that we had to deal with the pandemic, the coronavirus, but  that is not the case now. We still have ongoing issues there. We need  to make sure that we are investing in vaccines and all the things that  make sure that people in this country are able to combat and that we  are able to get this pandemic behind us. But what we are talking about  with this $3.5 trillion that the Democrats are intending and that we  are going to vote on later today--$3.5 trillion--their own estimate,  not ours. A lot of private estimates out there suggest that when this  is fully implemented over the full window, you are talking about $5.5  trillion. You add to that the $2 trillion that has already been spent  earlier this year--all put on the debt, by the way, all borrowed from  our children and grandchildren--and you are talking about a stunning,  staggering, insane amount of money.   I have heard the analogy used here on the floor and other places by  Democrats saying: Well, this is like the New Deal. This is the modern  New Deal for America.   Well, the New Deal occurred in the middle of a Great Depression,  where unemployment rates were running as high as 25 percent. The New  Deal happened at a time when--my dad grew up in the Depression. I have  heard him tell the stories through the years. People were struggling.  They were struggling enormously. The government stepped in with some  programs to help address that to get people back to work.   But what we are talking about here is double--double--the size of the  New Deal as a percentage of our economy--double--at a time when we  have, and the President was crowing about this the other day, 5  percent, 5.4 percent unemployment in this country and 900,000 new jobs  created in the last reporting.   So if you think about where the economy is, we are coming out of the  pandemic. People are investing again. People are getting out. They are  spending money. We are seeing growth get back in the economy. We are  seeing jobs created. It is literally, to me, the definition of  ``insanity'' to pour 3.5 trillion, by their estimate--by a lot of  [[Page S6198]]  other estimates, 5 trillion--more dollars into the economy to literally  give people free everything.   This isn't about addressing the pandemic or helping get people back  to work. We have programs that do that. We have unemployment insurance  that has been in place now for a long time. Many of us think the plus- up that the Federal Government provided was for too long because it was  keeping people from going back to work. But the fact of the matter is,  we are talking about a massive expansion of the Federal Government  literally to give people pretty much free everything.   Not only does that contradict, I think, what this country was all  about, which in its inception was about freedom and liberty, personal  freedom, economic freedom, individual responsibility, providing people  incentives to achieve and to do well, making sure that we have programs  in place, safety nets for those who need that help, but the idea that  at a time when the economy is growing and expanding and unemployment is  at a fairly low rate historically, we are creating jobs that the  Federal Government would think that it needs, in all its wisdom here in  Washington, DC, to infuse $5 trillion.   We already have inflation. It is at the highest rate in 13 years. Do  you think pouring a lot of--flooding the economy with a whole bunch  more money isn't going to exacerbate the inflation problem we already  have? Not to mention, they are talking about paying for it--I don't  think it will all be paid for. I think a lot of it will go onto the  debt.   By the way, under this budget that is being proposed today, that the  Democrats are, on a one-sided partisan procedure, going to vote on, is  the biggest thing that we have seen certainly in my lifetime and will  dwarf, as I said, anything we have seen in history. The debt at the end  of all that--at the end of all that, 2031, the 10-year budget window-- will be $45 trillion, 134 percent of our gross domestic product.   There was a day when we were worried about borrowing up to 100  percent of GDP. Well, we have blown past that. We have dwarfed that.  This is now completely out of control, completely out of hand. We are  talking about a massive amount of new spending to expand government  and, to the degree that it is paid for, paid for with taxes that are  going to hit individuals, that are going to hit businesses, that are  going to hit small businesses, and that are going to hit farmers and  ranchers.   When you go down the list of taxes, the tax increases in this  proposal, again, I mean, I don't know where you stop. The idea--the  suggestion by the administration that you are not going to hit people  who make less than $400,000 a year is just absolutely, again, I think,  insane. I don't know how you can raise $3.5 trillion in taxes and not  have an economic impact felt by people who are on the lower end of the  income scale.   I mean, think about it. When taxes go up on businesses, what happens?  Well, people work for businesses. Democrats think it is easy. We will  just raise taxes on businesses. Businesses are not paying enough. Well,  where do people in this country work? They work for businesses. That is  where they get their paychecks. That is where they get their benefits.  Wages go down when taxes on businesses go up, to a historical fact.   If you think about what also happens when taxes are put on  businesses, businesses obviously can do a couple of things. They may  reduce wages or not hire people or reduce the size of their workforce.  But they also pass that on with the cost of higher prices to people out  there in the economy who are paying the price for it. That is what we  are talking about here. It is just absolutely, absolutely stunning,  really, in my time in the Congress to observe something that is being  compared to, historically, the New Deal in a circumstance where the  economy is growing and expanding, people should be going back to work;  and in a time when we have already a $30 trillion debt, as I said,  headed in 2031 to $45 trillion in debt, and something that literally  dwarfs, as a percentage of the economy, what was done at the time of  the New Deal, parallel the analogy that is being used here by my  colleagues on the other side. There is just absolutely no rationale for  doing this.    But that is what it calls for, $3\1/2\ trillion. According to the  budget committee analysts, it includes $4.2 trillion in spending--on  discretionary spending--and increased interests on the debt are  included.   That bill, which was entirely unpaid for--and I am talking about the  $1.9 trillion bill that was passed in March, that was ostensibly COVID  relief, but, in reality, was more like a list of payoffs to Democrat  constituents.   There were billions and billions of dollars for schools, while  keeping teachers unions happy by omitting any requirement for actually  getting kids back in the classroom, even though schools have barely  touched the billions of COVID aid they have already been given.   And, by the way, handoffs to States with a distribution formula  heavily weighted in favor of blue States, included bailouts for union  pensions, loans for labor unions, and I could go on.   And when we talk about the money that is going to be, you know, in  the budget the Democrats are going to force us to vote on later today,  the additional spending that is going to be in there, that is on top  of--on top of--the trillions that we put out the door last year, much  of which went to State governments and many of which don't know how to  spend the money they already have. We are talking trillions, much of  which went to, as I said, blue States.   But while that bill wastes a lot of taxpayer dollars, the problem  with that bill pales in comparison to what is before us today. Today,  Democrats are taking the first step toward a massive and permanent  expansion of government that would be paid for on the backs of ordinary  Americans. And my colleagues, as I said, on the other side of the  aisle, will tell you they are just levying tax hikes on wealthy  Americans, but that is not the whole story.   Those corporate tax hikes that Democrats are proposing, that tax just  isn't going to be paid for by CEOs and the board members of  corporations. A huge part of that is going to fall on American workers  in the form of things like lower salaries and fewer opportunities.   The Tax Foundation notes that the share of the corporate tax burden  that falls on labor is, ``routinely found to be between 50 percent and  100 percent, with 70 percent or higher the most likely outcome.''   By substantially hiking taxes on corporations, Democrats will be  substantially increasing the burden borne by workers, not to mention  reducing our competitiveness in the global economy by once again giving  the United States one of the highest corporate tax rates in the  developed world.   With our economy still emerging from the challenges of coronavirus,  it is very difficult to understand why Democrats would decide that we  should make American businesses less competitive on the global stage.   And that is the impact of just one of the Democrats' tax hikes. I  haven't talked about the probable effects of their tax hike on small  businesses--that is right, small businesses--or the negative economic  effects of their huge tax increase on investment.   And then--then--there is the Democrats' new death tax. That is right,  new death tax to add to our already existing death tax, which will  reduce inheritances for middle-class Americans around the country, not  to mention threatening the very existence of family farms and ranches  and small businesses.   From the way that Democrats have been governing, you would think that  voters have given them a resounding mandate to permanently expand  government and implement the socialist fantasies of the far left.   In fact--we all know this--Democrats hold a narrow majority in the  House of Representatives, where they lost seats; and the Senate is  equally split between Democrats and Republicans.   And Democrats' far-left Presidential candidates couldn't make it out  of the Democrat primary. That is right, President Biden was able to win  the Democrat primary and the general election because he presented  himself accurately or inaccurately as a moderate.   But despite their lack of a mandate, Democrat leaders are apparently  more and more willing to let the far left of the Democrat party run the  show, which is why we are standing here today contemplating a $4.2  trillion  [[Page S6199]]  spending spree to permanently expand the size of government.   We don't yet know all the details of Democrats' budget-busting  spending legislation, but what we do know is not encouraging. In  addition to taxes that will burden hard-working Americans and hurt our  economy, Democrats are contemplating a new welfare benefit with no  associated work requirement. Lots and lots of free stuff, like 2 free  years of community college; elements of Democrats' most extreme  specialist fantasy, the Green New Deal; amnesty for individuals here in  our country illegally; funding for tens of thousands--yes, tens of  thousands--of new IRS agents; a tax cut for blue State millionaires and  billionaires; and more.   And, by the way, on that point, it is really ironic to me to hear  Democrats come down here and talk about Republicans wanting to cut  taxes for rich people when this proposal, in this legislation, 50  percent--50 percent of the tax cut, by doing away with the cap on  deductibility of State and local taxes; 50 percent of that benefit goes  to people making more than $1 million a year. So much for worrying  about people on the low income of the income scale.   Democrats want to spend taxpayer dollars to hire hundreds of  thousands of young people for a Civilian Climate Corps to fight climate  change--Civilian Climate Corps. There is no word yet on whether this is  actually an effective way to address our Nation's climate challenges,  but that isn't going to stop Democrats from spending billions of  dollars to find out.   I haven't even mentioned how all this new government spending is  likely to increase inflation. Americans are already facing significant  inflation, thanks in part to Democrats' earlier flooding of the economy  with government spending. Now Democrats want to come close to doubling  that spending. I don't even want to think about what inflation will  look like if they succeed in their spending plans.   Thanks to Democrats' decision to utilize special Senate budget rules  for their tax-and-spending spree, they have the ability today to force  through this massive spending package on a totally partisan basis.   But my Republican colleagues and I will do everything we can to  protect Americans from the consequences of Democrats' reckless,  reckless legislation. And I hope some of my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle--all it takes is one--will intervene before their  party's taxing-and-spending spree turns an economic recovery into an  economic disaster.

For decades, the Tax Code has allowed family-run businesses to be  handed down without imposing capital gains taxes on the appreciation in  value from the prior generation.  [[Page S6209]]    Changing this would hit generationally owned enterprises hard,  particularly in rural communities. And it could force families to sell  off part of the farm or business just to pay the new tax.   Congress tried something similar before and had to repeal the tax  before it took effect because it was unworkable.   Unlike amendment No. 3317, which is a side-by-side the Democrats will  be offering here temporarily, which would simply delay the tax, my  amendment would provide permanent relief by preserving step-up in basis  for all family-owned businesses, farms, and ranches.   I encourage my colleagues to support it and would add that I have  letters of support from the National Association of Manufacturers,  NFIB, Family Business Estate Tax Coalition, Taxpayers Protection  Alliance, Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, Americans for  Tax Reform, National Taxpayers Union, Center for a Free Economy, Family  Business Coalition, Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, and  CASE.

This amendment proposed by the Senator from Nevada dilutes that  support.   As I previously described, the administration's proposal would end  the existing step-up in basis tax treatment that protects  generationally owned businesses from tax liability when a business is  passed on to the next generation.   And I might add--I said this earlier--this was tried once in the  1970s. Chuck Grassley was here, and he was the guy who helped end this  because it was unworkable. So here we are trying to do this all over  again.   The administration suggested it might include arbitrary exemptions to  this ill-advised idea, which I think is what the Cortez Masto amendment  speaks to. But, unfortunately, these so-called protections for family- owned operations would not provide sustained relief and, in practice,  would be incredibly difficult to implement--the reason they didn't do  it in the 1970s.   We have never taxed unrealized gains in this country. This proposal  is a half measure that would still punish hard-working families and  businesses in this country, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.
