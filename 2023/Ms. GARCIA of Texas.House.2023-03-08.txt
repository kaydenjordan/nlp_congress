 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to lay out a few facts  about the debt ceiling.   Raising the debt ceiling is about meeting obligations the government  has already made and has nothing to do with new spending.   Since World War I, we have raised the debt ceiling under every single  President--every single President.   So let's remember a few facts: The national debt under the Trump  administration rose significantly by $8 trillion, a total of roughly 25  percent of the entire debt at the time he left office. That is one- quarter of the entire debt by President Trump.   Republicans voted three times--three times--to raise the debt limit  under the Trump administration.   So where was the Republican outrage then?   President Biden has lowered the deficit by $1.7 trillion during the  first 2 years of office and has a plan to reduce it even more.   Mr. Speaker, yet House Republicans used their very first bill to hand  a giveaway to big corporations and billionaires that cheat on their  taxes, adding an explosive $114 billion to the deficit, and still no  plan to reduce debt. House Democrats put people over politics,  solutions over rhetoric.                            ____________________
