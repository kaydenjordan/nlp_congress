 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a  long-overdue victory for our Vietnam veterans.   For decades, tens of thousands of Vietnam vets haven't got the  benefits that they deserve. Even though diseases like Parkinson's,  hyperthyroidism, and bladder cancer are scientifically linked to Agent  Orange, they still aren't covered by the VA.   But, today, I am thrilled to say that veterans exposed to Agent  Orange can finally stop fighting their own government because my bill,  the Fair Care for Veterans Act, is on track to become the law of the  land.   I want to dedicate this effort to Joshua Melendez of Modesto,  California, and Lyle Ducheneaux of Turlock, California, two local  veterans who will personally be impacted by this change.   Most of all, I want to dedicate this effort to my grandfather, First  Sergeant Albert Z. Simmons, whose life was cut tragically short by  Agent Orange. I wish he could be with us today to see this.   These veterans fought for us. It has been my honor to fight for them.  God  [[Page H6849]]  bless you, and thank you for your service.                            ____________________
