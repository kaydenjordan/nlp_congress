 Mr. President, I rise today in support of confirming  Michelle Bowman to fill the community bank specialist seat on the  Federal Reserve Board of Governors.   Miki is the perfect choice to be the first occupant of this seat on  the Fed's Board. She comes from a long line of community bankers.   In 1882, Miki's great-great-grandfather helped start her family-owned  bank, Farmers and Drovers, in Council Grove, KS.   She worked at Farmers and Drovers Bank from 2010 until January 2017,  when she assumed her current position as the State Bank Commissioner of  Kansas.   Prior to moving back to Kansas in 2010, Miki worked in Washington,  DC, for Kansas' native son, Senator Bob Dole.   Miki also has experience working in the executive branch.   She was appointed by President Bush to positions at the Federal  Emergency Management Agency and at the Department of Homeland Security.   This diversity of experience will serve her well in her upcoming role  with the Federal Reserve.   While we have made progress in providing regulatory relief to our  Nation's community banks, it is critical that we keep it up and build  on that work.   Community banks did not cause the financial crisis and should not be  regulated as if they did.   Miki understands where the pain points are for community banks and  will be a strong advocate for commonsense, risk-based regulation.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of her nomination when she  comes to the floor for a final vote this afternoon.   Thank you.
