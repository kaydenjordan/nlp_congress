Congratulating Kalayna Durr, 2023 Iowa State Fair Queen     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kalayna  Durr of New London in Henry County, Iowa, for being crowned the 2023  Iowa State Fair Queen this past August.   The annual Iowa State Fair Queen competition takes place during the  Iowa State Fair as county queens from across the State compete for the  coveted crown. Judging is based on personality, leadership, attitude,  citizenship, contribution to the community, as well as overall  appearance, demeanor, and poise. After 5 days of workshops,  evaluations, and interviews, Kalayna was able to beat out 103 other  contestants for the title.   In addition to the well-deserved crown, Kalayna Durr's triumph comes  with substantial awards, including $8,000 in scholarships, a $600 gift  card, a pair of cowboy boots, exquisite diamond earrings, an Iowa State  Fair brick, and, of course, a sash that signifies her role as the  State's ambassador of agriculture and community.   Her reign promises to be a symbol of grace, intelligence, and  leadership as she represents Iowa and its cherished traditions  throughout her term as the Iowa State Fair Queen.   Congratulations to Kalayna Durr on this outstanding accomplishment.                                time  1230                        Rest In Peace K9 Officer Kurly     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize retired  K9 Officer Kurly who passed away at the age of 12 due to natural causes  in August. Kurly served alongside Corporal Brian Schertz for 9 years in  the Davenport Police Department.   Kurly was more than just a dedicated member of the department. She  was a beloved member of the community who worked tirelessly in the  patrol division and contributed to countless cases on both sides of the  river. In retirement, Kurly enjoyed long walks, playing, and spending  time with the Schertz family.   As we bid farewell to this loyal and valiant K9 officer, we express  our gratitude for her years of service to the community. Kurly's memory  will live on in the hearts of those she protected and the lives of  those she touched.   May Kurly rest in peace. She will be deeply missed.                          Iowa Football Kid Captains     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 2023  Hawkeye football kid captains. Each season, the University of Iowa  Stead Family Children's Hospital designates current or former patients  as kid captains for each game of the football season.   These kid captains, who have faced challenges that most of us can  only imagine, will spend their game day immersed in the world of Iowa  football, experiencing the excitement and camaraderie that comes with  it. The highlight of their day, however, is the heartwarming wave they  initiate, sending love and encouragement to the children at the  hospital across the street. It is a simple gesture that carries  immeasurable meaning, symbolizing their triumph over adversity and  their enduring spirit of hope.   This year's kid captains are Gracelyn Springer, Nile Kron, Maggie  Larson, Gabby Ford, Wyatt Rannals, Max Schlee, Madi Ramirez, Bentley  Erickson, Lincoln Veach, Chloe Dinkla, Cooper Estenson, and Nathan  McDonald.   As we cheer the Hawkeyes on the field this season, let us also take a  moment to salute these kid captains. They are true champions.     Two Iowans Returning Home After Circumnavigation to Eradicate Polio     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary efforts of two Iowans, Peter Teahan and John Ockenfels,  who returned home in August after circumnavigating the globe as part of  Rotary International's End Polio Now initiative.   Their journey started at the Eastern Iowa Airport, taking them  through 19 countries on four continents. Along the way, they engaged  with local leaders, sparking crucial discussions about their mission.  Their unwavering dedication to eradicating polio and the impact of  their journey led to over $1 million raised for Rotary's Polio Plus  Program, which provides vital vaccines to those in need globally.   This self-funded expedition, costing approximately $100,000, served  as a poignant reminder that the fight against polio is ongoing, and  their efforts have brought it one step closer to its end. With ongoing  donations matched by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, their  mission continues to inspire and uplift, emphasizing that hope knows no  bounds when dedicated individuals join forces to make a difference.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Laulauga  Tausaga who became the United States first women's discus gold medalist  at the World Athletics championship in August. Laulauga graduated from  the University of Iowa in 2021 where she was the 2019 NCAA discus  champion.   In a stunning display of talent and determination, her throw of 69.49  meters to win the world championship marked a significant improvement  over her previous best. Laulauga's former Iowa track and field coach,  Joey Woody, expressed immense pride in her journey.   He noted her unwavering dedication and resilience in the face of  challenges, praising her as one of his best competitors the program has  ever seen.   Laulauga Tausaga's legacy is firmly cemented as an eight-time all- American, a regional champion, and now as a gold medalist at the World  Athletics--the first woman.   Mr. Speaker, I wish a very happy birthday to my husband, Curt Meeks.  Happy birthday, honey.                            ____________________
