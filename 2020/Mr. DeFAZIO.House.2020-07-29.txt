 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4686) to amend title 23, United States Code, to compel  States to require illuminated signs and other measures on ride-hailing  vehicles, to prohibit the sale of such signs, to require ride-hailing  companies to implement an electronic access system on ride-hailing  vehicles, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4686         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as ``Sami's Law''.       SEC. 2. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR RIDE-HAILING VEHICLES AND                     RIDE-HAILING COMPANIES.         (a) Requirements for TNC Platforms.--Not later than 90 days       after the date of enactment of this Act, each transportation       network company shall establish and implement a system and       policy within the transportation network company's TNC       platform that shall make available to each passenger a       digital method to verify that the driver with whom the       passenger has been matched through the transportation network       company's TNC platform has been authorized by the       transportation network company to accept the passenger's trip       request prior to the beginning of the trip. Such system shall       include--        (1)(A) an initial notification sent to the passenger's       personal mobile device, or otherwise communicated to the       passenger, containing verifiable information specific to the       TNC driver or TNC vehicle with which the passenger has been       matched;        (B) the ability for the passenger, driver, and TNC platform       to confirm the verifiable information matching the passenger       to the authorized TNC driver or TNC vehicle prior to the       beginning of the trip;        (C) a TNC platform restriction on a TNC driver from       commencing a trip via the TNC platform until both the       passenger and the TNC driver verify the other's identity       using the system; and        (D) a way for a passenger to use a non-visual arrangement       to verify the TNC driver under the system used in accordance       with this subparagraph; or        (2) as an alternative to implementing the system required       under paragraph (1), a transportation network company may       implement any successor technology-based system that enables       verification that the driver with whom the passenger has been       matched through the transportation network company's TNC       platform has been authorized by the transportation network       company to accept the passenger's trip requests received       through its digital network prior to the beginning of the       trip.        (b) Opt Out.--A transportation network company may offer a       passenger an option  [[Page H3922]]       not to use the system that the transportation network company       has implemented under subsection (a). Any trip completed by a       passenger who opts not to use the system shall not be a       violation of this section.        (c) Exemptions.--This section shall not apply to any trips       in which--        (1) a third party, including any third-party business, non-      profit, or government entity, facilitates the trip for the       individual who is transported in the TNC vehicle; or        (2) compliance with subsection (a) is impracticable due to       circumstances beyond a transportation network company's       control, including instances where a passenger's personal       mobile device has failed to operate or there is degraded,       reduced, or otherwise insufficient cellular connectivity in       order for the system to properly operate.       SEC. 3. SUCCESSOR TECHNOLOGY PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.         (1) Performance standards.--Not later than 180 days after       the establishment of the ``SAMI's Law Council'' pursuant to       section 4, such Council shall recommend to the Secretary of       Transportation performance standards for the successor       technology-based systems permitted under section 2(a)(2) and       the Secretary shall thereafter issue performance standards       consistent with the Council's recommendations and provide a       reasonable time for a TNC to comply. Such standards shall       require, at a minimum, that--        (A) any successor technology-based system that enables the       verification that the driver with whom the passenger has been       matched through the TNC platform has been authorized by the       transportation network company to accept the passenger's trip       request received through its TNC platform prior to the       beginning of the trip;        (B) confirmation protocols are visually and non-visually       accessible; and        (C) a transportation network company implement a system       incorporating a driver education and public awareness program       related to the use of its successor technology and its       required verifiable information.        (2) Updating performance standards.--Six months after the       establishment of the performance standards required by this       section, and, at a minimum, annually thereafter, the       Secretary shall solicit input from the SAMI's Law Council,       established under section 4, about whether the performance       standards need to be updated or expanded to incorporate new       technological developments. The Secretary may amend the       performance standards to account for new technological       developments.        (3) Interim standards.--Prior to the adoption of       performance standards, a transportation network company may       adopt and deploy any other successor technology-based system       that enables a passenger to verify that the driver with whom       the passenger has been matched through the transportation       network company's platform has been authorized by the       transportation network company to accept the passenger's trip       requests received through its platform prior to the beginning       of the trip. A successor technology-based system deployed       under this subparagraph shall be considered to fulfill the       requirements of section 2(a). A successor technology-based       system adopted under this section shall be presumed to meet       such requirements unless the Secretary determines otherwise.       If the Secretary makes such a determination, a reasonable       time to cure shall be provided.        (4) Reports.--Upon first issuing performance standards       under paragraph (1), and each year thereafter, the Secretary       shall transmit a report to the Committee on Transportation       and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Commerce of the Senate detailing the performance       standards recommended by the SAMI's Law Council, established       under section 4, and issued by the Secretary under paragraph       (1), including any updates to such standards and explaining       the rationale for issuing such performance standards.

Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to require ride-hailing      companies to implement an enhanced digital system to verify      passengers with their authorized ride-hailing vehicles and      drivers.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 4686, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4686, Sami's Law.  This legislation marks the first step in Federal oversight of the  safety of transportation network companies.   I particularly applaud the gentleman from New Jersey, Representative  Smith, and the gentleman from New York, Representative Suozzi, for  introducing legislation on this subject and tenaciously working through  many iterations of the bill in order to bring it to the floor of the  House with strong support.   Mobility and transportation patterns in cities have been upended in  recent years by companies that, through transformative technology  platforms, have revolutionized how we travel. In a very short time,  many people have come to rely on TNCs as a regular transportation  option. These services, however, have operated with little  transportation safety or regulatory oversight.   There are many aspects of TNCs that the Committee on Transportation  has examined, including their impacts on congestion, their impacts on  wages, their impacts on public transportation use. We held a hearing  last October in which a range of troubling aspects of the TNC model  were brought to light. We had hoped at that hearing to explore the  safety issues, but neither Uber nor Lyft would come to the hearing.   The committee included provisions in H.R. 2, as passed by the House  earlier this month, that focused on how to put some guardrails around  this new ``mobility on demand'' model to ensure these services  supplement, rather than compete, with transit services.   But today, in this legislation, we focus on the most critical and  challenging policy aspect of the TNC model: how to ensure the safety of  passengers and drivers who utilize a ride-hailing platform.   This bill is known as Sami's Law in honor of Samantha Josephson, a  21-year-old college student who was brutality murdered after she  entered a car which was mistakenly identified as the Uber she had  hailed.   I met with her parents, Seymour and Marci Josephson, and heard their  heart-wrenching story firsthand of how this split-second decision to  enter that vehicle cost their daughter her life. They have worked  tirelessly on the legislation before us today so that millions of other  ride-hailing services users can do so with safety protections in place.   It is appalling that it took this tragedy for TNCs to admit that  developing an app connecting passengers and drivers through technology  and hoping for the best is woefully insufficient as a safety protocol.  I am glad that Uber and Lyft were finally willing to come to the table  and agree to the basic safety precautions contained in H.R. 4686.   This bill requires TNCs, within 90 days of enactment, to establish  and implement a digital means for passengers to verify that the driver  has been authorized by the TNC to accept the passenger's trip request  prior to the start of the trip or the person entering the car.   Such a system must include the ability for the passenger, the driver,  and the TNC platform to confirm the information matching the passenger  and the authorized TNC driver or TNC vehicle and the ability to  restrict the trip from commencing until both the passenger and TNC  driver verify the other's identity using the system.   The bill further ensures that TNCs will be able to continue to  improve and innovate ways to maximize passenger and driver safety by  establishing a process for the Secretary of Transportation to issue  performance standards for successor verification technologies.   The bill also establishes an advisory council of Federal officials,  representatives of TNCs, TNC drivers, law enforcement, victims'  advocacy groups, and individuals with disabilities to develop  recommendations on successor technologies.   The bill further prohibits the sale of any signage that is designed  to help a passenger identify a TNC vehicle and contains a TNC's  proprietary trademark or logo, unless authorized by the TNC.   During our hearing last fall, I just went on to Amazon and I found I  could have had delivered by Prime, in 2 days, a lighted sign to put on  my dashboard that I would plug into the cigarette lighter saying I was  an Uber or Lyft driver. That has got to stop.   Finally, the bill directs the Government Accountability Office to  conduct a study on the incidence of assaults on TNC passengers, TNC  drivers, and  [[Page H3924]]  background checks conducted on prospective drivers of TNC vehicles,  including State and local laws which may require such background  checks.   I have been focused on the potential danger of pairing passengers  with poorly vetted drivers for years. In 2015, I wrote to then-Uber CEO  Travis Kalanick urging the company to conduct fingerprint-based  background checks.                                time  1345    In my district, dozens of applicants with serious criminal  convictions, including a convicted murderer, a registered sex offender,  and 10 people with serious DUIs, were cleared, they were cleared  through Uber and Lyft's screening process, and they were driving people  around. It wasn't until the local police department in my State--we are  the only State who hasn't been preempted by Uber and Lyft from going  further than their very cursory background checks--the police conducted  the same background checks that they would conduct for taxi drivers in  the city, and then they found the murderer, the sex offender, and the  others, and those people were removed from service. That just shouldn't  ever happen.   Strong and thorough vetting of potential drivers is the first line of  defense to ensure passenger safety. While the study initiated by this  bill will yield important data, I believe we will ultimately have to do  more to truly protect the ride-hailing community. It will do little  good to verify that you have the right driver if that driver has a  history and the desire to do harm to passengers.   Lawmakers at the State, Federal, and local level need to think beyond  whether ride-hailing gets people from point A to point B, and work to  ensure that TNCs deliver a public service equitably and safely, and it  is not a race to the bottom by exploiting drivers. This bill is an  important step in setting an appropriate regulatory floor.   I thank those I mentioned earlier for bringing this legislation  before the House, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.          Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of             Representatives,                                     Washington, DC, July 27, 2020.      Hon. Peter A.

Finally, this exchange of letters will be included in the       Congressional Record when the bill is considered on the       floor.        Thank you again, and I look forward to continuing to work       collaboratively with the Committee on Energy & Commerce on       this important issue.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,                                                             Chair.     Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the distinguished majority whip.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Suozzi), who was a key person in getting this legislation  moving through the House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I think we have said what we needed to say here today on the floor.  Nothing, nothing will ever totally heal Sami's parents and friends, but  this bill in her name will hopefully prevent there being any future  tragedies like her death.   Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote on this legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that debate under  clause 1(c) of rule XV on a motion to suspend the rules relating to  H.R. 7575 be extended to 1 hour at the request of the minority.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7575) to provide for improvements to the rivers and harbors  of the United States, to provide for the conservation and development  of water and related resources, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

SEC. 330. REGIONAL SEDIMENT MANAGEMENT.         The Secretary shall expedite the activities required to be       carried out under section 204 of the Water Resources       Development Act of 1992 (33 U.S.C. 2326) regarding the use of       improvement dredging of the Portsmouth Federal navigation       project in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, as a source of clean       beach fill material to reinforce the stone revetment at       Nantasket Beach, Hull,  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 7575, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, we continue the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee tradition by considering the fourth consecutive bipartisan  Water Resources Development Act since 2014, a tradition started by my  friend and predecessor, Bill Shuster. It is a great tradition, and it  is an incredible service to our Nation.   I am proud to be joined by Ranking Member Sam Graves, Subcommittee  Chair Napolitano, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Bruce Westerman in  sponsoring the Water Resources Development Act of 2020.   The bill under consideration today was developed in a bipartisan  manner with input from both sides of the aisle. The legislation was  considered in committee and favorably reported by voice vote.   H.R. 7575 includes projects and policy provisions that impact  communities across the Nation. It authorizes construction of 34  projects studied and approved by the chief of engineers since WRDA 2018  was signed into law.   It authorizes 36 new Corps of Engineers feasibility studies and  directs the Corps to expedite the completion of 41 ongoing studies,  which were submitted to the Corps by local sponsors willing to share  the costs of these project studies.   H.R. 7575 continues our work to ensure the full utilization of the  harbor maintenance trust fund by unlocking nearly $10 billion. This is  $10 billion under an initiative started by Ronald Reagan of taxes  collected from shippers that are ultimately paid by consumers in the  United States. So, for years, we have been taking money under false  pretenses and not spending that money on its designated purpose.   This bill will finally rectify that problem. There is ample need to  invest that $10 billion in our ports and harbors around the country.   The legislation also directs the Secretary of the Army to equitably  allocate maintenance funds to pay for harbor operation maintenance  needs, while addressing the ongoing needs of the Nation's largest  ports, the Great Lakes harbors, its emerging harbors.   This is especially important in communities like my district along  Oregon's southwest coast, where the difference between life and death  for those who both recreate or fish commercially is in the conditions  of our harbors, jetties, and breakwaters. It is literally life and  death in very cold water. So, this is incredibly important.   Before earmarks were banned, I used to get my harbors dredged by  earmarking. Since that was banned when the Republicans took over in  2010, I managed in the first WRDA bill in 2014 to get a 10 percent set- aside for small and emerging harbors. That has provided the critical  dredging for my district and many, many harbors around the United  States of America.   This bill, because we will have a lot more money, will provide  actually 20 percent to small and emerging harbors. We have delayed and  deferred projects all around the country.   This bill also recognizes the important role that inland waterways  play in our Nation and provides a cost-share shift to help in  completing construction of much-needed projects. I would give a shout- out to Conor Lamb from Pennsylvania as being a tireless advocate on  that, as well as other Members.   WRDA 2020 also includes specific policies that focus on climate  change,  [[Page H3952]]  natural infrastructure solutions, and affordability, and provisions  that assist minority, Tribal, and rural communities.   The bill recognizes the important role of resiliency in helping  communities meet the current and future challenges of changing  hydrologic conditions and repetitive and more frequent flooding events.  I am glad to include provisions in this bill that will ensure taxpayer  dollars are spent on infrastructure that will be resilient and will  contribute to the resiliency of communities across the country.   It also ensures that all communities, especially communities with  socioeconomic challenges, have a path forward in getting the tools they  need for flood protection and ecosystem restoration. H.R. 7575  continues this tradition with a 2-year extension of the process.   We accommodated many, many Member requests from both sides of the  aisle in this bill. There are some provisions in this bill, however,  that will need further review. This legislation continues in  conference.   For example, H.R. 7575 authorizes six projects where the studies were  developed by the non-Federal interest under section 203 of WRDA-86.   The committee has received letters of concern about whether these  projects have undergone sufficient environmental review, which would  include public input of an equivalent level to studies developed by the  Corps of Engineers. These are valid questions, and they may require  changes to the 203 process as we go to conference with the Senate.   I would like to recognize a few individual members on the Committee  on Transportation and Infrastructure for their valuable contributions  to this bill: Chairwoman Grace Napolitano, for her dogged support in  addressing the maintenance needs of our largest ports, particularly  southern California, and for meeting future water supply needs of arid  regions around the Nation, and the dedication of some of the newest  members of my committee.   The vice chairwoman of the subcommittee is Ms. Mucarsel-Powell from  Florida, and her dedication to getting provisions to protect and  restore the national treasure that is the Everglades was tireless.   I also recognize the work of the gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs.  Fletcher) for her incredibly strong advocacy for the Port of Houston  and their needs, and for the protection and sustainability of the  businesses and communities along the Texas Gulf Coast that depend upon  that navigable area.    I also recognize the new Member, the gentlewoman from Iowa (Ms.  Finkenauer), for her advocacy in addressing flooding risks of rural and  economically disadvantaged communities within the Mississippi River  Valley.   As I mentioned before, Conor Lamb contributed. Angie Craig, Mr.  Pappas from New Hampshire, Representative Delgado, Harley Rouda, and  Sharice Davids, they were all instrumental in bringing important issues  to the committee and contributed to the formation of WRDA 2020.   The Water Resources Development Act is essential to communities  throughout the country that depend upon the safe and affordable uses of  their ports, harbors, and inland waterways. Our economy, safety, and  environment will benefit from passage of WRDA 2020.   I am proud of our work on this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join  me in support of this legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                         Committee on the Budget,                                      Washington, DC, July 24, 2020.      Hon. Peter A. DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio: I write to confirm our mutual       understanding regarding H.R. 7575, the Water Resources       Development Act of 2020. H.R. 7575 contains provisions that       fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the       Budget. However, in order to expedite floor consideration of       this important legislation, the Committee agrees to waive       formal consideration of the bill.        The Committee on the Budget takes this action with the       mutual understanding that, in doing so, we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues within our jurisdiction. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment to any House-Senate       conference convened on this legislation or similar       legislation and requests your support if such a request is       made.        Thank you for agreeing to include our exchange of letters       in the Congressional Record. I appreciate your cooperation       regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to       work with you as this measure moves through the legislative       process.            Sincerely,                                                   John A. Yarmuth,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                     Washington, DC, July 24, 2020.      Hon. John Yarmuth,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Yarmuth: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R       7575, the Water Resources Development Act of 2020. I       appreciate your decision to waive formal consideration of the       bill.        I agree that the Committee on the Budget has valid       jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this important       legislation, and I further agree that by forgoing formal       consideration of the bill, the Committee on the Budget is not       waiving any jurisdiction over any relevant subject matter.       Additionally, I will support the appointment of conferees       from the Committee on the Budget should a House-Senate       conference be convened on this legislation. Finally, this       exchange of letters will be included in the Congressional       Record when the bill is considered on the floor.        Thank you again and I look forward to continuing to work       collaboratively with the Committee on the Budget on this       important issue.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,                                                             Chair.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Speaker, I included in the Record a letter from  Chairman   John Yarmuth from the House Committee on the Budget agreeing  to waive consideration of H.R. 7575, as amended, as well as my response  to Chairman Yarmuth expressing appreciation for his willingness to work  cooperatively on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record several letters of support  from organizations and stakeholders in support of H.R. 7575.                                                     July 28, 2020.        Dear Members of the U.S. House of Representatives,        The farmers, ranchers, food and beverage manufacturers,       processors, package suppliers and agricultural product       marketers that comprise our memberships are dedicated to       providing the safe, abundant and affordable food, fiber and       feed required to ensure our country stays healthy and fed.        Because American agriculture's competitive advantage       largely depends upon the quality, reliability, accessibility       and cost-effectiveness of the national transportation system,       our organizations commend Congress for consistently examining       water infrastructure projects every two years and write today       to urge your support of H.R. 7575, the Water Resources       Development Act (WRDA) of 2020.        As you know, agricultural commodities move via truck, rail,       barge and ocean-going vessels. Consistent and timely focus on       the U.S. inland waterways transportation network is vital to       agricultural stakeholders because 20 percent of a farmer's       income depends on exports. Inland waterway barge       transportation is the least expensive, most efficient and       most environmentally friendly mode, and U.S. locks and dams       help relieve congestion and wear-and-tear on highways as well       as discipline rail rates.        With respect to U.S. port and inland waterways       infrastructure, H.R. 7575 includes two notable provisions we       wish to highlight. Both Section 101 concerning the Harbor       Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) and Section 108 pertaining to       inland waterways projects would positively affect the ability       of our organizations' members to fulfill their role in the       agricultural value chain to serve American farmers and       domestic and global customers.        As you know, the intent of Section 101 of H.R. 7575 is to       ``unlock'' the more than $9 billion that's been collected and       deposited in the HMTF by those that pay the 0.125 percent ad       valorem tax based upon the value of  [[Page H3954]]       cargo imports. The inability thus far to access and spend       those dollars on much-needed port dredging further has eroded       the United States' comparative transportation advantage and       contributed to lost export opportunities to the detriment of       U.S. economic growth. Our organizations strongly support       Section 101, which would provide critical and overdue access       to the existing balance in the HMTF so that these funds can       be spent on dredging as intended.        In addition, we believe that adjusting the cost-share       formula for inland waterway construction and major       rehabilitation of navigation projects, as proposed in Section       108 of H.R. 7575, is a prudent policy that would help address       a critical problem facing our inland waterways transportation       system. As you know, the majority of U.S. locks and dams are       operating on borrowed time, having long outlived their 50-      year design life. Further, most are not of sufficient       capacity to handle modem 1,200-foot barge tows, and others       require more maintenance. Each of these factors costs       shippers valuable time and resources.        Section 108 amends the cost-share formula for the       construction and major rehabilitation of each inland       waterways navigation project from the current 50 percent       general revenue and 50 percent Inland Waterways Trust Fund       (IWTF) funding to 65 percent general revenue and 35 percent       IWTF. The policy is a step in the right direction that would       expedite completion of such projects and help bring the U.S.       inland waterways transportation system into the 21st century.       For these reasons, we support making permanent the cost share       formula adjustment in H.R. 7575 to provide certainty for       these projects, which reduces construction costs.        Our organizations strongly support passage of H.R. 7575       because Section 101 and Section 108 would enhance U.S.       agriculture's competitiveness, contribute to the overall       efficiency of the U.S. transportation system, and promote       overall U.S. economic growth and job creation. We urge you to       support and approve this critical infrastructure bill so that       negotiations can proceed with the Senate with the goal of       enacting a new WRDA law in 2020.            Sincerely,        Agricultural and Food Transporters Conference, Agricultural       Retailers Association, Agriculture Transportation Coalition,       American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean       Association, American Sugar Cane League, Corn Refiners       Association, Farm Credit Council, Florida Sugar Cane League,       Institute of Shortening and Edible Oils, National Aquaculture       Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, National       Cattlemen's Beef Association.

Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, House Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sam Graves,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, Washington, DC.      Re Water Resources Development Act of 2020.         Dear Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves: The       American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA) supports       passage of H.R. 7575, the Water Resources Development Act of       2020 through the House of Representatives. On behalf of our       78 United States member ports, AAPA appreciates that this       legislation expands the budget cap adjustment to all the       Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund revenues for the U.S. Army       Corps of Engineers (Corps) which would unlock approximately       $10 billion from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. We are       pleased to see that the legislation recognizes the needs of       donor ports, emerging harbors and Great Lakes navigation       projects and look forward to working with you prior to       enactment on these provisions.        The legislation also authorizes new navigation channel       improvement studies as well as authorizing projects to       proceed to construction. The legislation continues to improve       the efficiency and cost effectiveness of Corps study efforts       and product delivery. These efforts are essential for our       Nation's future economic growth as well as providing family       supporting jobs.        I thank you for your work on these issues and others       related to maritime infrastructure, both included in this       bill and otherwise. Our Association looks forward to working       with you, your Committee staff, and the rest of Congress on       passage of this legislation.            Respectfully,                                             Christopher J. Connor,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                     The Construction Association,                                                      July 28, 2020.      Speaker Nancy Pelosi,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Re H.R. 7575, the Water Resources Development Act of 2020.         Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: On behalf       of the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC)--the       leading association in the construction industry representing       more than 27,000 firms, including America's leading general       contractors, specialty-contracting firms, service providers,       and suppliers--I urge you to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 7575, the       Water Resources Development Act of 2020, which is expected to       be considered by the U.S. House of Representatives under the       suspension of the rules this week.        H.R. 7575 is an essential step forward as Congress works to       continue the biennial process of passing legislation that       invests in our nation's water resources infrastructure. The       predictability of the biennial passage of water resources       development acts is critical for all stakeholders invoked in       the planning and execution of water resources projects.       Through these investments, H.R. 7575 will create jobs,       improve the quality of life for all Americans, protect our       communities, facilitate waterborne commerce, restore       environmentally sensitive areas of the country, and help grow       our economy.        AGC appreciates that the bill will help ensure that the       U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) Civil Works Program is       appropriately responsive to the water resources needs       identified by local communities. Specifically, the bill       authorizes more than 30 pending Corps Chief's Reports, which       will facilitate important water resources projects across the       country, authorizes dozens of new feasibility studies, and       expedites the completion of many existing feasibility       studies. In addition, AGC supports the provisions of H.R.       7575 that ensure funds from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund       go towards their intended uses, extend a pilot program that       allows non-federal interests to carry out feasibility studies       and projects, and modify the cost share of projects funded by       the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, among others.        AGC applauds the bipartisan process used to develop H.R.       7575 and is hopeful that the House and U.S. Senate will reach       an agreement between their respective legislative proposals       this year. Again, AGC urges you to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 7575       and looks forward to working with the Congress as the       legislative process continues.            Sincerely,                                             James V. Christianson,      Vice President, Government Relations.                                   ____                                                             The Port                                                  of Los Angeles,                                                      July 16, 2020.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Garret Graves,      Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Grace Napolitano,      Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water Resources and           Environment, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio, Chairwoman Napolitano, Ranking       Member Graves, and Ranking Member Westerman: On behalf of the       Port of Los Angeles, I am writing to thank you for your       leadership in advancing the Water Resources Development Act       of 2020 and to express our strong support for its swift       enactment.        Combined, the San Pedro Bay ports of Los Angeles and Long       Beach handle more than one third of the nation's       containerized imports and exports. In fact, every single       Congressional district in the nation is reached by the goods       moving through the San Pedro bay, so maintaining the in-water       infrastructure at these ports is essential for American       competitiveness in the global economy.        In previous communications we noted that historically the       San Pedro Bay ports receive a disproportionately low return       of Harbor Maintenance Trust (HMT) revenues, and what we do       receive cannot be used for vital infrastructure maintenance.       We are grateful that you have recognized the importance of       equity for donor ports in your legislation and addressed       these priorities:        Fair share of HMT funding for donor ports.        Expanded uses for emerging harbors and donor ports.        Extension of the 2106 program for donor and energy transfer       ports.        A robust and healthy port industry is vital to our nation's       economy. Donor ports, such as the Port of Los Angeles, play a       fundamental role in supporting the national freight system       and the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. Full spend of HMT       revenues (including the trust fund balance), and fair and       equitable allocations, will ensure that this important       funding is used to enhance our nation's competitiveness.        Language in the recently passed CARES Act includes ``full-      spend'' to be implemented with either the passage of WRDA       reauthorization or in January 2021. This makes addressing       donor equity and expanded uses extremely urgent and I am       grateful for your work to address these vital issues and am       happy to express my strong support for this bi-partisan       legislation.        We applaud your efforts to address this vital       infrastructure need and hope to work  [[Page H3955]]       with you as this bill moves forward to address the unique       requirements of our nation's ports.            Sincerely,                                                  Eugene D. Seroka,      Executive Director.                                   ____            [From the National Wildlife Federation, July 15, 2020]  Water Resources Development Act Includes Wins for Wildlife, Communities         Washington, DC--The Water Resources Development Act of       2020, which is being marked up by the House Transportation       and Infrastructure Committee, includes numerous provisions to       advance ecosystem restoration and strengthen climate       resilience. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee       reported out a related bill, America's Water Infrastructure       Act of 2020, earlier this year.        ``Nature has long been an underutilized tool in the Army       Corps' toolbox. This bill takes important steps to remedy       this, with a suite of reforms that remove barriers to using       healthy rivers, floodplains, wetlands and shorelines to       protect communities from hurricanes and floods,'' said       Melissa Samet, senior water resources counsel at the National       Wildlife Federation. ``The National Wildlife Federation is       grateful for the strong leadership of Chairman DeFazio,       Subcommittee Chair Napolitano, Ranking Member Sam Graves and       Subcommittee Ranking Member Westerman for their bipartisan       efforts to advance important provisions to protect frontline       communities and vital ecosystems including the Everglades,       Mississippi River Delta, and Great Lakes.''        The National Wildlife Federation supports many important       provisions of this bill, including:        Provisions that remove barriers to, and drive use of       natural infrastructure, including by ensuring that natural       infrastructure solutions will benefit from the same cost-      share requirements as non-structural measures.        Careful evaluation of natural infrastructure solutions to       protect communities from storms and floods, including a       robust pilot program that provides full federal funding for       flood and storm risk reduction studies for economically       disadvantaged communities and ensures robust evaluation of       natural infrastructure solutions.        Implementation of the Water Resources Principles,       Requirements and Guidelines (PR&G) by the Corps, including       fully engaging the public in that effort. Effective       implementation of the PR&G will bring the Corps' water       resources planning process in line with 21st Century water       resources management principles, and improve water resources       planning across the board.        Comprehensive review of the Corps' mitigation record by the       Government Accountability Office. Ensuring full compliance       with mitigation requirements is critical for fish and       wildlife and for the communities and economies that rely on       these vital resources.                                   ____                                          Chamber of Commerce of the                                        United States of America,                                                      July 14, 2020.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sam Graves,      Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves: The U.S.       Chamber of Commerce applauds the bipartisan approach taken by       your Committee in advance of tomorrow's markup of the Water       Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2020. Reauthorization of       America's water resources programs is critical to economic       growth and environmental stewardship, and we support this       legislation.        WRDA would ensure the viability of the U.S. Army Corps of       Engineers' Civil Works programs including navigation, flood       risk management, recreation, and associated environmental       infrastructure. Enactment of this bill would provide critical       economic and environmental benefits to the United States.        Reauthorizing these programs prior to their September 30       expiration would provide the certainty of federal commitment       needed to allow state, local, and private partners to move       forward with needed planning and construction of modern,       resilient infrastructure. These important water projects       would bring economic benefits to both rural and urban       regions.        The Chamber also applauds the inclusion of 34 new project       authorizations, additional provisions to ensure modern,       resilient infrastructure, improvements in water supply       delivery, and increased investment from the Harbor       Maintenance Trust Fund, a long-time priority of both your       Committee and the Chamber.        With less than three months until the current authorization       expires, the Chamber is pleased that House leadership       anticipates floor consideration of the bill later this month.       We appreciate your Committee moving promptly to ensure timely       action on these critical issues.            Sincerely,      Neil L. Bradley.                                   ____                                          Waterways Council, Inc.,                                      Washington, DC, July 28, 2020.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sam Graves,      Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves: The       members of Waterways Council, Inc. (WCI) thank you for your       leadership and commitment to the Water Resources and       Development Act (WRDA) biennial process.        America's inland waterways system includes 12,000 miles of       commercially operated and maintained navigable channels that       directly affect 38 states. The inland waterways system is       tasked with transporting the nation's bulk commodities that       keep America competitive in the most energy-efficient and       environmentally friendly way. In 2016, 558 million tons of       commodities valued at $300 billion transited the waterways,       supporting 541,000 American jobs.        WCI thanks you for Section 108. This section adjusts the       cost-share formula for the construction and major       rehabilitation of inland waterways navigation projects from       the current 50 percent general revenue and 50 percent Inland       Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) to 65 percent general revenue and       35 percent IWTF for seven years. The policy is a step in the       right direction and will help expedite the completion of       inland waterways construction and major rehabilitation       projects during the applicable years. WCI looks forward to       working with the Committee as they proceed to conference on       making the cost-share permanent.        Passing this legislation in regular order is critical to       ensuring waterways reliability in order to keep America       competitive. WCI offers its support of passing WRDA 2020.            Sincerely,                                                      Tracy Zea,                                                  President and CEO,      Waterways Council, Inc.                                   ____                            WRDA 2020 Support List         American Shore and Beach Preservation Association,       Agricultural Working Group, American Association of Port       Authorities (AAPA), American Society of Civil Engineers,       Associated General Contractors of America (AGC), Association       of California Water Agencies, Association of Marina       Industries, BOAT US, Earthjustice, Future Ports, Great Lakes       Metro Chambers Coalition (GLMCC), Healing Our Waters-Great       Lakes Coalition, Laborers International Union of North       America (LIUNA), Lake Carriers' Association, Marine Retailers       Association of America.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Garcia), who is a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Lamb), who is a member of the committee and who was  key in getting the additional investments in the inland waterways.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Barragan).

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kind words. We find many  opportunities to work together. There are times when we have  significant policy differences, and we get through it. And we will keep  plugging.   This bill is great for our Nation. On a daily basis, of our Nation's  58 largest ports, they only have about 40 percent of their capability  due to deferred dredging.   We have jetties failing around the Nation. We heard from Conor Lamb  from Pennsylvania. We did great engineering work in the 1800s and early  1900s. I viewed a lock in his district built in the early 1900s, but  these things do have a lifetime.   The increase in cost share for inland waterways is going to make a  great difference. We are finally going to spend the $10 billion that  the American people have put into an account for harbor maintenance on  harbor maintenance. Things take a long time in Washington, D.C. I  started on that with Bud Shuster in 1996, but finally, we are going to  get there.   This money can and will be very productively spent. It will put  people to work, and it will make our Nation more competitive.   We had, for quite some time, a dispute among the various ports,  large, small, and in between. We worked all of that out. It is easier  to do when there is more money. So, this bill is going to be good for  large, medium, and small ports, and emerging harbors. And just to be  parochial, it is going to be great for my district.   We have many, many dangerous bar entrances. Fishers, particularly  commercial, sometimes recreational, die there. The dredging needs are  always going to be there. Also, we have failing jetties that need  replacement, so the additional cost share there will help.   Then an additional cost share by statute for the Great Lakes,  although I did talk with Ms. Kaptur, and she feels that we didn't quite  get it right. We will work on that in conference.   I would like to thank staff: Ryan Seiger, who is chief counsel on the  subcommittee; Camille Touton; Alexa Williams; Navis Bermudez; Joe  Sheehy, who works for Grace Napolitano, who couldn't be here today; and  legislative counsel Kakuti Lin. Legislative counsel has been fabulous.  Then, the other side of the aisle: Ian Bennitt, Victor Sarmiento, Jon  Pawlow. Again, thanks to my friend and colleague, the ranking member.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
