 Madam President, I rise today to express my opposition to  President Biden's nominee to be Comptroller of the Currency, Dr. Saule  Omarova.   Although not the most publicly known office, the Comptroller of the  Currency is a prominent and influential position that regulates and  supervises all national banks. Given the undeniable importance of this  office to the economy and to Americans, it has long been kept free of  divisive politics and extreme views.   While I talk about the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and  I talk about banks, my concerns are certainly more than just the  financial institutions that are in our country's economy. It is the  people, their customers who are served, that bother me or worry me the  most.   Rather than offer practical ideas for strengthening our Nation's  banks, Dr. Omarova advocates for the elimination of all commercial  banks--the very financial institutions she should be interested in  partnering with. Instead, she wishes to replace them with one bank--one  bank--the Federal Reserve.   While the Comptroller might not have direct control of the Federal  Reserve's structure, the reach of the position cannot be understated.  The Office of the Comptroller is a member of the Federal Financial  Institutions Examination Council, the Financial Stability Oversight  Council, and even the Board of the FDIC, an Agency Dr. Omarova hopes to  eliminate.   Although the doctor claims to support community banks, her plan would  relegate them to mere franchises of the  [[Page S8429]]  larger Federal Reserve, and her comments have alarmed many Kansas  community bankers. They have grave concerns about her policies that  would ``end banking as we know it.''   One Kansas banker says:         I have severe concerns with the President's nominee to be       the Comptroller of the Currency. Her support of moving the       payment system entirely through the Federal Reserve and her       commentary in favor of abolishing the FDIC moves the entire       banking system toward a government-controlled financial       system. Eliminating the dual banking system would be       disastrous for entrepreneurs and consumers alike in the       marketplace.    Another banker from Kansas said:         We expect our regulator to supervise safety and soundness       for banks in the system, not to propose and force feed social       agenda items to us.    Local lenders--I certainly know this in the State of Kansas--are the  cornerstone of many small towns, and the Comptroller should appreciate  the value that community banking brings, what I call relationship  banking. They provide crucial lending services for the underbanked  populations in rural and urban areas alike. Eliminating the one-on-one,  personal approach that allows community banks to thrive will do  permanent damage to financial inclusivity and will further push people  out of the financial system.   I have often said to my colleagues in Washington, DC, that economic  development in many places in Kansas is whether or not there is a  grocery store in town. It didn't take me too long to realize that that  answer, of whether or not there is a grocery store in town, often  revolves around whether or not there is a community bank--a  relationship bank--in town, one that makes decisions, certainly, on the  wellness and the ability of the loan to be paid, but what is in the  best interest of the community? How can I make my community and my  customers better off for the way this bank operates?   Another Kansas banker noted it appears that Dr. Omarova is  comfortable with a banking model ``that lacks luster and the agility to  serve the diverse nature of the American banking industry.''   With a banking model that would provide no incentive to create  innovative new products, consumers would no longer benefit from the  financial modernization that has brought so many people into the  banking sector, so many customers to the banking sector. Consumers are  best served by a financial system that offers competitively priced  loans and lets lenders invest back in their local communities.   We must continuously work to improve our financial sector for  everyone, but forcing consumers to bank with the government would do so  much more harm than good. Kansans want less government in their lives,  not more, as this would be.   Under Dr. Omarova's proposal, the government would have mandatory  seats on bank boards and be able to control investments in ``socially  sub-optimal'' activities, a subjective definition that can be  interpreted to stifle investment. She believes Federal bureaucrats  should handpick who gains access to credit--all but ensuring leftist  ideas would be funded.   Confirming her to this office would provide Dr. Omarova with ample  opportunity to deny funding to industries she finds politically  unfavorable, including bankrupting our domestic energy companies,  something she spoke about.   While Dr. Omarova cheers on companies' bankruptcies, jobs disappear,  families go without income, and that American dream that is so  important to all of us is crushed.   Unfortunately, the doctor's confirmation hearing this morning only  deepened my concerns. Her views have no place in the role of the  Nation's top bank regulator.   She is entitled to her views. She is entitled to her radical views  but not as the Nation's top bank regulator.   By nominating Dr. Omarova, President Biden looks to fundamentally  reshape banking from a market-driven industry to a one-size-fits-all  government entity. The thought of a centrally planned economy and a  banking system like that is not only unworkable, but it is radical-- radically wrong.   Even if these ideas are just for the sake of some academic thought,  Dr. Omarova's suggestions have consequential impacts. This is a very  powerful position, and we cannot--we would take her views lightly at  our own risk.   I urge my colleagues to reject this nominee.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
