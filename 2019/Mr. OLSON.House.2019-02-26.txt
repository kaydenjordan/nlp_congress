 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Missouri for yielding,  as I want to share my thoughts on this purely political effort by the  new Democratic majority.   Mr. Speaker, the U.S. and Mexico border is 2,400 miles long. My home  State of Texas is half that border, 1,200 miles.   Texas knows something others in this Chamber apparently don't know:  We are at war on the southern border with the drug cartels.   I say it again. We are at war on the southern border with the drug  cartels from Mexico.   The drug cartels are at the heart of every single problem we have on  our southern border. They have a war going with our families, our kids,  and our schools with record numbers of heroin, cocaine, and deadly  fentanyl.   The drug cartels are at war with our world values by financing  modern-day sex slaves or forced laborers.   All of Texas, 254 counties--from Amarillo to Texarkana, to Beaumont,  to Brownsville, to Marfa--are impacted. They are at war with these drug  cartels.   The majority had better wake up and have no more figments of  imagination. It is time to put politics aside and admit we are at war  with the drug cartels.   Mr. Speaker, let's fight this war to win and vote against the  resolution that surrenders to the drug cartels.
