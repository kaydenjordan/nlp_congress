 Mr. President, yesterday I had the opportunity to respond  to the majority on my support for Tony Blinken to be the Secretary of  State. He is someone I have known for a long period of time. I think we  will see that with the new administration here and myself being a  conservative Republican, there will be some appointments that I will  not really be excited about and agree with, in which case I will state  it. But in the case of the Secretary of State, I expressed myself  yesterday and I want to do it again today for what I consider to be a  really critical first appointment--second appointment that the new  administration makes, and that would be for General Austin to be the  person in charge at a time that is very unique.   I agree with the Senator who just spoke about the qualities of this  general. We know that he rose through the ranks through the Army to  become the first four-star general and commander of Central Command  from 2013 to 2016. He has done everything right.   We, right now--I know the Presiding Officer is aware of this and  certainly the ranking member of the committee is aware of this--we are  in the most threatening times that we have ever been in. We have China  and Russia out there with capabilities that we didn't really believe we  would find ourselves with. So that is going to be the primary concern  of this new administration, and I can't think of a better person to  take the helm than General Austin to provide the leadership.    And it is true that we had to have a waiver yesterday. That waiver  was overwhelmingly supported in a bipartisan way. So everyone knows  that we gave a lot of thought to it. And this is at a time where we  really needed someone with the background of General Austin to take  that position, and I strongly support it and look forward to serving  with him.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at the  conclusion of the remarks from the Senator from Arkansas that I be  recognized.    Madam President, first of all, let me just compliment my  friend from Arkansas on his great remarks. People are not aware of the  threats we are facing in this country. I want to join him in  encouraging the new administration to understand and address these  threats                            ____________________     Madam President, since last week, there have been over  20,000 members of the National Guard stationed here at the Capitol.  They are here--and have been here and are still here--to keep us safe,  keep the Members safe, Senators safe, staff, press--all of us. It seems  that people are speculating that maybe this was overkill, maybe we  didn't really need this many people here. They are wrong. This was a  nice, successful inauguration and successful, peaceful transfer of  power because they were there. I made that very clear to the ones I  have been talking to in the field over the last 3 days. I know,  firsthand, that they are really outstanding professionals, these  guards.   We have about 400 guards here from the Oklahoma National Guard. I  visited with them--I guess it was on Wednesday--in five different  groups. I went around and talked to them because they weren't all in  the same location, and we thanked them for the service and the  sacrifices they are making. Long hours. These guys are having long  hours. They are the best of the best. The many I saw did deployments in  Afghanistan.   When I was talking to them, they would remember, and say: Well,  Senator Inhofe, I remember we were together in Afghanistan; we were  together in Ukraine. These guys--that was 10 years ago, and they are  still on the job working. I don't know what we could have done without  them.   In fact, I asked several of them, how many of you in this group, from  Oklahoma, in the Guard, have never been to Washington before, that this  is your first trip. More than half of them had never been to Washington  before. That was a great opportunity for them too. But I am really  humbled and grateful for what they are doing for us, and I am sure all  of our colleagues are.   That is why I was so shocked and really angry last night--and I  picked it up on TV--I didn't know anything about it--when I heard that  the guards were being made to feel like they were unwelcome by some  person in the Capitol Police, and they were to take their rest breaks  someplace else and actually sent to the parking garage, of all places.  Our Guard members are being lodged in hotels. They are working shifts,  12-hour shifts a day. They are long shifts, on their feet, so they need  to have rest breaks. And they can't do that lying in the Senate garage.   They have 2 hours on and 1 hour off, plus time for eating and that  type of thing. We can all agree they should be comfortable on their  breaks, a place to sit and lie down, eat, charge their batteries, and  things they have to do--talk to their families at home. That is what  they are supposed to be doing. That is precisely where they were. They  were using the buildings here in the Capitol before they were made to  feel unwelcome and pushed to the garage.   I understand, and I am glad that they have moved back in and they are  now well taken care of. And that is a good thing. But they should never  have had to go through this in the first place.   What we did, you have to find out--you get to the bottom of it. And  that is what we are doing now. We are getting answers. I called the  acting chief of the Capitol Police this morning. I called General  McConville. General McConville is the Chief of Staff of the Army, and  they are all working to find out how this happened. The acting chief,  Pittman, says the guards were never asked to leave yesterday.   I know that she believes that. But several--multiple members of the  military said, no, they were told to leave. We know one thing; that  whether it was confusion from the fog and the friction and the  environment or whatever it was, the troops didn't move on their own, so  they were asked by somebody.   This isn't a blame game. But I do want to know what happened to make  sure it doesn't happen again. This is what happened. There was one  uniformed police officer who issued an order without authority or  without going through the chain of command. I am glad that the U.S.  Capitol Police and the Guard are talking and trying to figure this out.  We are going to be  [[Page S101]]  able to identify who that person was, and we will make that public.  But, ultimately, one message for our National Guard up here: You are  appreciated. You are welcome. We are very, very grateful for the  sacrifices that you made. And if you are ever told at any point that  you need to vacate and don't have a comfortable place, just go to  Russell 205, and I will make sure that you will be very comfortable in  my office.   I know that there is bipartisan outrage about this, so I think you  will have plenty of places to rest. You have done a great job. You will  be returning home soon. And you will be able to say: Job well done   I yield the floor.
