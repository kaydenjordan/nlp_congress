 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of  [[Page H3497]]  Mr. Joe Bill Dickerson, who passed away on March 24 at the age of 88.   Mr. Dickerson was raised in Homerville, Georgia, in Georgia's First  Congressional District, and truly worked hard throughout his life to  make this world a better place.   After graduating from college with an agriculture degree, Mr.  Dickerson enlisted in the Air Force, training in chemical, biological,  and radiological warfare. He served in the Air Force until 1953, when  he went on to pharmacy school at the University of Georgia.   Mr. Dickerson served in many levels of pharmacy. He worked in  pharmaceutical sales, at a hospital, a local pharmacy, and even became  a pharmacy professor at the University of Georgia.   Today, pharmacists like myself work throughout the State of Georgia  who learned their craft under the watchful eye of an experienced Mr.  Joe Bill Dickerson. His expertise, colorful personality, and dedication  to the betterment of others will truly be missed.                            ____________________
