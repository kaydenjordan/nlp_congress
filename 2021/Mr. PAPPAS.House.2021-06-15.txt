 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the incredible  efforts of the staff at the Manchester, New Hampshire, VA Medical  Center, who worked long hours to resolve a massive backlog of unpaid  medical claims for community care.   In a district where veterans travel long distances to get to a VA  facility, community care has been a game-changer for vets to receive  the services they need closer to home. But in the early years of the  Choice Act, and now the Mission Act, provider payment delays and  bureaucratic errors threatened the stability of community care networks  and, ultimately, the access to critical lifesaving care for veterans.   One of the first providers who contacted our office was an  acupuncturist who provides care to veterans experiencing PTS and  debilitating pain. The acupuncturist was passionate about caring for  those who served, but the chronic billing delays were creating severe  uncertainty and financial hardship for her office.   She introduced me to a group of veterans that she cares for in her  office to learn a little bit more about their experience. They all had  a remarkable story about how their quality of life had improved since  accessing these services through VA community care. But they understood  that payment delays could disrupt that.   Countless other providers, including large hospital systems and small  care organizations, were also caught up in this claims backlog. The VA  was making it difficult, if not impossible, for many of these providers  to continue serving veterans.   The issue of unpaid claims was compounded in the Northeast region by  VA's multiple transitions between third-party administrators over the  last few years. It created confusion and frustration in both the  provider and the veteran communities.   I knew we couldn't let our veterans down, and that is why I am so  thankful for the efforts of the community care team at the Manchester  VA for working with our office, with providers, as well as the third- party billers to thoroughly address this issue.   Our office worked closely with the leadership at the Manchester VA  Medical Center and the New Hampshire Hospital Association and its  members. A plan was developed to painstakingly delve into the minutiae  of the claims backlog, line by line, so that providers could be paid  for legacy claims and receive timely payments for future services.  [[Page H2751]]    The Manchester VA Medical Center's Office of Community Care steadily  plowed through the backlog, giving specialized attention to each  provider. After more than 15 months of their hard work, I am proud  these diligent efforts have resulted in tens of millions of dollars of  paid claims to New Hampshire's VA Community Care providers. They were  so successful in this work that their internal process is now being  shared nationally across the VA system as a model.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to personally thank the team members at the  VA in Manchester who put in so many hours to address this backlog,  including:   Michelle Mercer, who spent considerable time dealing with each  member's hospital billing department;   Patricia Patterson, who also spent considerable time dealing with  each member's billing department;   Tracy Allaire, who worked closely with Tri-West on claims on behalf  of hospitals on the back end;   Charlene Eaton, who supervised and provided oversight to the VA  Office of Community Care staff;   Dr. Brain Phemester, who worked and provided leadership and served as  a conduit between VA Central Office and the New Hampshire Hospital  Association and its members;   And Daniel Wilson, who initially spearheaded the billing resolution  effort within the VA Central Office, and worked with our district  office and the Hospital Association.   These Manchester VA Medical Center employees went above and beyond  the call of duty for our veterans and the providers, as well as the  future of community care. I couldn't be more proud to be able to  recognize them for their efforts here today.                            ____________________
