 Madam Speaker, I take no joy in voting to impeach  President Trump, but this President has blood on his hands in the wake  of this attempted coup.   The fact remains, no President of the United States is above the law,  and this President has sadly violated his oath to support and defend  the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and  domestic.   As Members of Congress who have taken that same pledge, it is our  duty to take this action and impeach this unfit and dangerous  President.
