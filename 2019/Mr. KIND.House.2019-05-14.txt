 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California, first  of all, for recognizing me tonight but also for securing this Special  Order to honor one of our great friends and great colleagues in this  institution, Ellen Tauscher. I also thank   John Garamendi for helping  to organize tonight's Special Order as well.   Ellen was a true patriot. She was a great American, someone who loved  the congressional district that allowed her to represent them, loved  her home State, and loved our country even more.   I got to know Ellen as a member of the incoming class of 1997. We  were both present at the creation of the New Democrat Coalition. It  didn't exist back then, until we first joined. Then, with the help of  Cal Dooley, another California Representative; Tim Roemer; Jim Moran;  and Adam Smith, who is now chairing the Armed Services Committee and  was also one of the founding Members, we helped form the New Democrat  Coalition, where Ellen really excelled in her leadership. It was fun  getting to work with her on such a personal level.   The committees to which she was assigned were a perfect fit for her  and for the district and State she represented: the Armed Services  Committee, where she developed such great expertise and knowledge on  national security issues, but especially with the arms control issue  that she became world renowned over; the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, with all of the work that she did to help  rebuild America the way it should be, but especially the infrastructure  projects that were so crucial to her area of California that she would  fight doggedly over on that committee; and then her work on the Science  Committee, which really fit in well with her leadership role with the  New Democrat Coalition.    The New Dems were a group of Members here in the Democratic Caucus  who were more moderate, more pragmatic. To Ellen, being moderate and  pragmatic wasn't an ideology; it was a way of life, a way of being able  to get things done in an institution where it is sometimes very  difficult to get things accomplished.   She was always looking to find those bipartisan coalitions in order  to get things across the finish line, being respectful and listening,  especially to our colleagues across the aisle, knowing that there was  common ground to be had that we could work on together in order to  represent the interests that she represented in California but all our  interests here in this country.   On the Science Committee, she was devoted, as she was with the New  Democrat Coalition, to making sure that our country remained the most  innovative, competitive, and creative nation in the world, especially  at a time of great technological change.   She came in with me in the late 1990s during the information  revolution that was taking place, the dot-com era, with, of course, a  tremendous impact in California, as it had throughout the rest of the  country, being able to wrap our arms around that, understanding the  vast implications that this was going to have on American  competitiveness abroad. How to stay on that cutting edge of new  discovery in the global information technology economy while also  making sure that none of our citizens were left behind with that rapid  change and our role in that global economy, that was something Ellen  was deeply devoted to, something that she took up as chair of the New  Democrat Coalition over two terms, making sure that we were spending  time to understand the policy implications of the high-tech revolution,  artificial intelligence, robotics, and the role our country can play in  advancing that.                                time  2100    Again, how can we best empower all Americans so that they can be full  participants of that global economy and rapid change? We haven't always  done a good job at that, quite frankly.   I think that is one of the reasons there is so much consternation and  even anger back home, because many people feel that they haven't been  empowered with the skills they need to be full participants and to be  successful in this highly charged economy.   That was something that Ellen recognized and was devoted to trying to  find answers to when she showed up at work every day.   It was a great honor to be able to serve with her in that coalition  and to later assume the chair position from her in order to continue to  build it.   I know Ellen was particularly proud of last fall's election, the fact  that 41 of the new Democratic Members who joined Congress decided to  join the New Democrat Coalition, putting our number up to 101, which  was unfathomable at the time we were starting the coalition in the late  1990s, let alone just in recent years.   It shows that the New Dems have a very important role to play, as  Ellen recognized, in helping to shape the agenda and the policies that  will make sense and work for the people back home.   I appreciated being able to work closely with her in that capacity. I  learned a lot from the skills that she brought, with her varied  interests and backgrounds that she had before Congress. As was  mentioned earlier, she was one of the first women to hold a seat on the  New York Stock Exchange, a very accomplished business person herself.   I think that is, in a lot of ways, where she derived her political  pragmatism from, being able to get things done, and the role that she  played in the respective committees, in the coalition, and in the  friendships and partnerships that she was able to form so successfully  here in Congress.   She wasn't one who took no for an answer. She always felt that there  was a path to success in whatever endeavor she performed. That is why  it made perfect sense that, in the first Obama term, he, along with  Secretary Clinton, appointed her for Under Secretary for Arms Control  and International Security. It was perfect for her personal background  and portfolio, and she became the negotiating face of America when she  was out negotiating the arms control treaties.   Everyone knew, with great confidence, that when Ellen entered that  negotiating room, there would be no one more prepared, no one who had  done their homework more than she.   It even went beyond the intricacies and the complexities of arms  control and nuclear reduction. It was also getting to understand and  appreciate where the negotiators across the table were coming from, the  political constituencies that they had to answer to back home.   With her own political background, I think she brought that bigger  perspective to these negotiations. Because of that, the success that  she was able to  [[Page H3785]]  achieve on behalf of our country was something that she was able to  achieve with her negotiating counterparts from across the table. That  is a skill that we need to cherish and recognize more, quite frankly,  in our various agencies throughout government.   When she stepped down from that position, she immediately was sworn  in as Special Envoy for Strategic Stability and Missile Defense at the  State Department. It was just the next iteration of that skill set that  she brought in the course of these negotiations.   She represented us so very, very well. We were all so proud of her,  those of us who had gotten to know her throughout the years, seeing  what she was able to accomplish in her post-Congress career, still  finding a way to serve her Nation in a different capacity.   She will be deeply missed. She was loved by those who knew her in  this institution.   Of course, she had a daughter, Katherine, whom she adored above  anyone else. As much fun as it was serving with Ellen when we came in,  in 1997, and throughout the years, it was perhaps as much fun watching  Katherine grow up in our midst, seeing her become such the accomplished  and beautiful young woman that she is today. Ellen was so proud of  that.   On behalf of the Class of 1997, on behalf of the New Democrat  Coalition, we thank Katherine and the entire Tauscher family for  sharing Ellen with us through these years of her public service, first  in Congress and then during the Obama administration.   She was a great friend, great colleague, great Representative for her  district in California. More importantly, she was a great American and  a great patriot who believed in the future of our country.   She will be sorely missed but never forgotten, the accomplishments  that she was able to achieve throughout her distinguished career here  and throughout her entire life.   May God bless her and take her into His care.
