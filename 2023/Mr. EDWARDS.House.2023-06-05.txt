Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material into the Record on H. Con. Res. 43.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 43 authorizes the use of the Capitol  Grounds for the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby later this month.   Every year, we authorize the use of the Capitol Grounds for this  event.   The national All-American Soap Box Derby has been running since 1934  and provides opportunities for young people to demonstrate their  innovation and ingenuity through a family-friendly competition-- something we need much more of this day and age.   The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby is one of many local races that  will qualify winning competitors for participation in the national Soap  Box Derby .
