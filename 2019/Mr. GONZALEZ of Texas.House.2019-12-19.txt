 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my  support for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and also to sound  the alarm of an issue that should concern us all: violence.   To put things in perspective, since 2006, Mexico has lost as many  people to homicide as the United States has lost in every war since  Korea.   Just in the last 3 years, the number of homicides exceeded the number  of soldiers lost in Korea and Vietnam combined, all while we act as if  nothing is happening in our own backyard.   Negotiators worked tirelessly to get us here to today's vote, but  they failed to acknowledge the single greatest threat to North American  trade and prosperity: violence.   I rise today to say that we have missed an opportunity, and I cannot  be silent and will not let this go.   Mexican President Lopez Obrador ran on a promise to achieve peace,  end the war on drugs, and create a new civilian national guard to  tackle organized crime by fighting poverty.   While I have no doubt of his good intentions, he has failed  miserably. Mexico's crime rate continues to rise; the endemic mass  murders, disappearances, extortions, and assaults in Mexico show no  signs of slowing.   Madam Speaker, by accepting this as the status quo and staying  silent, we risk standing in the way of our own economic success.
