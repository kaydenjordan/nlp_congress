 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Strike sections 8094 and 8095.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Nadler) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment will strike sections 8094 and 8095 of  the bill that prohibit the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the  United States and prohibit the use of funds to construct or modify  facilities in the United States for Guantanamo detainees. These  provisions are designed to further delay the transfer of detainees out  of Guantanamo.   Guantanamo is costing us a fortune. It costs the American taxpayer  $10 million a year to keep a single detainee in Guantanamo, and only  $78,000 to keep a detainee in a Federal maximum security prison in the  United States. That is a waste of $440 million a year.   Perhaps, most importantly, it is a question of values. What is most  offensive is not that the prisoners are at Guantanamo, as opposed to  some prison in the United States, but that we are holding people  without any hearing, without any due process, essentially forever. That  is against all American values.   Mr. Chairman, we have debated Guantanamo amendments every year,  multiple times a year. The last time was 2 weeks ago. It is an issue I  care deeply about, and I offer this amendment again. However,  yesterday, the President took an action that is so egregious, and so  offensive, that I feel compelled to use a portion of my time to address  it directly.   Yesterday's attack by the Commander in Chief on our military's  Active-Duty transgender personnel is appalling. Transgender individuals  are part of the fabric of America and have always been part of our  military, whether we have historically acknowledged them or not.   The arguments against allowing transgender servicemembers to serve  openly in our military are the same arguments that have been used  against every other group that has been prohibited from serving in our  country's history--including Black and Latino men, women, gays,  lesbians, and bisexuals. Each time the doors of our military open  farther to better reflect the diversity of our Nation, the same tired  and discredited arguments are brought back: that any individual in the  new group, regardless of his or her ability, is unfit to serve and that  their service will disrupt unit cohesion.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself an additional 1 minute.   Not only should all willing and able Americans be allowed and  encouraged to serve--they already do. A report prepared for the  Department of Defense estimates thousands of transgender individuals  serve today, without issue.   The President must not impose blanket bans that prejudge  servicemembers based on their identity, rather than their own merits.  President Trump is attacking people who have shown a willingness-- indeed, an eagerness--to risk their lives in the service of our  country. It is apparent that the decision to ban transgender people  from military service was taken without consulting Secretary of Defense  Mattis, who seemed surprised by the tweets, or the military, which  seems at a loss as to how to implement the order.   Even if this bigoted order is motivated by political opportunism, it  disgraces our country and must be rescinded.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 2 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York  will be postponed.                                time  1530    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 39  printed in part B of House Report 115-261.   It is now in order to consider amendment No. 41 printed in part B of  House Report 115-261.                    Amendment No. 42 Offered by Mr. Foster    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 42  printed in part B of House Report 115-261.
