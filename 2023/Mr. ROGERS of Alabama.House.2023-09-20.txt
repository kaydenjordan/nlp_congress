 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this motion to instruct.  This motion seeks to strip language in the House bill that prohibits  the Department of Defense from spending taxpayer money to facilitate  abortion procedures.   DOD's abortion travel policy is a flagrant violation of Congress'  intent and our Nation's moral principles.   This is all part of the Biden administration's politicization of the  military.   For years, Biden's political appointees have been pushing  questionable policies on our troops just to satisfy their ideological  agenda. They understand that using military orders is the most  efficient way to usher in the rapid social change that they seek.   The military should not be used as a petri dish for social  experimentation. This is not the right thing to do. Our troops should  not be used as the vanguard for the left's social agenda.   The civilian leadership at DOD should be focused on building the  world's most lethal fighting force. Instead, they are doing somersaults  to try to satisfy the far-left's political agenda.   This misguided abortion travel policy is just another example. It is  a radical overreaction to a problem that doesn't exist.   Secretary Austin said that the policy was necessary to avoid  significant implications for the readiness of the force, but in the 6  months since this began, there have been less than a handful of people  who have exercised this policy.   Rather than helping readiness, radical policies like this one are  undermining readiness. They are driving away potential recruits, and  they are undermining morale and retention. It needs to end.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose this motion, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Jackson), an outstanding member of the Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson), a great new member of the Armed Services  Committee and a longtime champion of the unborn in America.    Mr. Speaker, I have one correction to make,  that this is a new policy. This was not existing policy. It was  announced on October 20 against the advice of the congressional  leadership and finalized on February 16. They didn't just take existing  policy and continue it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Self),  a great new freshman Member.    Mr. Speaker, I share the sentiment of the most  recent speaker. I think it is shameful that the DOD has been playing  games with the troops in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs.  Miller).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), a longtime champion of the  unborn in America.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time  I have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Fallon), an outstanding member of the Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Houchin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentlewoman from Indiana.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Alford), a great member of the Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. Boebert).    Mr. Speaker, this provision protects life and  restores sanity to the Department of Defense.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose the motion, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
