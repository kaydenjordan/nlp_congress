 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Dr. Chuck Rheem, who was a leader in the Korean-American community  and chairman of the U.S.-Korea Alliance Association.   Dr. Rheem had a special love for the United States and his home  country of South Korea and dedicated himself to advocating for policies  with numerous Presidential administrations to strengthen U.S.-Korea  relations.   As a veteran of the Korean war, Dr. Rheem also had a passion for  honoring our Korean war veterans and hosted numerous events to thank  them and honor their sacrifices.   While Dr. Rheem is no longer with us, I know that his legacy will  continue to live on through the efforts of the members of the U.S.- Korea Alliance Association.   I pray for God's peace for his family, friends, and anyone who knew  him.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this amendment would negatively  impact our ability to address the profound security conditions in  Central America's Northern Triangle countries.   As we know, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are leading source  countries of illegal immigration to the United States. Under this  administration, the migration crisis at the U.S. southern border has  reached the highest levels in recorded history.   U.S. Customs and Border Protection are overworked, underfunded, and  demoralized. They also lack the tools and resources to address  America's growing fentanyl crisis, now the leading cause of death for  Americans 18 through 45. Border agents are outmaneuvered by well- resourced criminal groups and human traffickers who exploit the  security conditions in the region.   In addition to needing effective border enforcement to address this  crisis, we also need a comprehensive approach to the root causes of  migration.   This amendment would diminish the Department of Defense's ability to  contribute to those efforts. This amendment would also undermine what  it seeks to achieve by impeding existing defense cooperation programs  grounded in promoting and improving human rights standards.   It is also duplicative. It is wasteful, as extensive vetting on  recipient forces is already extensively conducted.   In addition, much like the cuts in 2018, any additional suspensions  of assistance to the Northern Triangle will worsen the security  situation.
