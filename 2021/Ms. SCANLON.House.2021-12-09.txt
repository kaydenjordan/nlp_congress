 Mr. Speaker, if the last few years have taught us  anything, it is that we cannot take our democratic institutions for  granted. And to protect them in the future, we must codify many of the  rules of the road for good government which have been trampled in  recent years by those more interested in personal power than the public  good.   That is why I rise in support of the Protecting Our Democracy Act,  which would limit future abuses of Presidential powers, strengthen our  system of checks and balances, and protect against foreign interference  in our elections.   I am proud to offer my amendment to this important piece of  legislation which would increase the frequency with which the inspector  general of the Department of Justice must report to Congress any  improper communications between the Department of Justice and the White  House.   We all should be concerned about the threat it poses to our country  when the occupant of the White House, whether it is Nixon, whether it  is Trump, or whether it is anyone else, when they treat the Department  of Justice as their own personal law firm, using taxpayer dollars to  advance personal or political ambitions, or to block the investigation  of corruption.   We are learning more every day about the heroic public servants in  the Department of Justice and elsewhere who raised their voices to push  back against misconduct in the White House. My amendment would make it  easier for these individuals to alert Congress to misconduct and allow  us to better protect our democracy.   I urge my colleagues to do their patriotic duty to protect our  Constitution, and to support both my amendment and the underlying bill.
