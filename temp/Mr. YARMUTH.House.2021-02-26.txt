 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material in the Record on H.R. 1319.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday our Nation crossed an unfathomable milestone.  More than half a million Americans have now died from the coronavirus.  On top of this staggering level of loss is the reality that the virus  is evolving, and we are now dealing with variants that are more  contagious and highly infectious for both adults and children.   At the same time, our Nation faces a painful and unequal recession,  one from which we cannot fully recover until the coronavirus is  contained.   The resources Congress provided last year have been put to good use,  but they are not enough. Vaccines can stop this virus, but we don't  have the resources or infrastructure to get them out fast enough. Food  banks are still overwhelmed, and rental assistance is running out.  Unemployment benefits for millions of Americans will start to expire in  just a few days. And more and more small businesses are closing their  doors for good each day.   We are in a race against time and the American people are counting on  us and the American Rescue Plan.   This plan is tailored and targeted. It will address the urgent needs  of the American people: beating the virus, quickly and equitably  distributing vaccines, safely reopening schools, delivering immediate  relief to working families, and helping cities and States keep  essential workers on the job and critical services up and running.   The American people are painfully aware of the challenges we face,  and that is why the majority of them, the vast majority of them,  Democrats, Republicans, and Independents support this relief package.   If you don't think Congress has more work to do here, then you either  don't get what American families are going through, or you don't care.  I don't know how else to say it.   Relief cannot wait, and we aren't going to wait. We are going to pass  this legislation today, and we are going to provide the aggressive,  bold action needed to finally end this pandemic and rebuild our  economy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Higgins), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.                                time  2350     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle), another distinguished member from  the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nevada (Mr. Horsford), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Peters), another distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Sires), another distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is fascinating to stand here at almost 10 minutes  after midnight and debate this bill and have our Republican colleagues  say, ``There has been no debate on this bill.'' In fact, there has been  more than 100 hours of debate on this bill in committees. There have  been hundreds of amendments proposed, most by Republicans.                                time  0010    Mr. Speaker, the reason we are here so late tonight is because  Republicans proposed hundreds of those amendments today in the Rules  Committee, amendments that had already been debated and discussed in  the various committees.   This bill has had extensive discussion, and unfortunately, part of  this discussion has been a misrepresentation of much of what it does.  We hear constantly this figure of $1 trillion out there that has not  been spent. We tried to track that trillion dollars down. We can't find  it anywhere.   What we do know is that all the money that has been allocated and  deployed by prior relief measures is in the pipeline, has been  allocated, has been assigned, has been obligated. There is no money  wasted in this legislation.   Also, what we know is that about 85 percent of the adults in every  one of the speakers' districts, Democrat and Republican, will get  $1,400 to help them make it through this desperate economy that we have  been seeing. Every child will be granted a tax credit of $3,000. A  family of four, for instance, will get $5,600, plus the tax credits.  That is in everybody's district.   As the minority leader said, we can talk about a swamp. I think he  has been swimming in a swamp for about 4 years. Unfortunately, he needs  to knock his head and knock some of that water out of his ears because  he needs to stand on the Earth that we all occupy, the country that we  occupy, and understand the pain and the suffering that the American  people have been going through and for whom this bill is so essential.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, one of the things that we constantly have to remember is  where we have been over the last year and the depths to which this  economy has fallen, the pain and suffering that the American people  have experienced.   Mr. Speaker, 500,000 of our fellow citizens have perished by the  coronavirus.   That is why the polling on this bill is so overwhelming: 76 percent  of the American people this week, 60 percent of Republicans. That is  why 150 or more top CEOs from the country have said this is the right  thing to do at this time. This is why the chairman of the Fed has said  that we need to make this kind of investment in the country. That is  why several regional presidents of the Fed have said that. That is why  nonprofits have said this all over the country. That is why the U.S.  Conference of Mayors has said this is the right bill for the time.   We have met the moment with this legislation. We have met the moment  of need in this country. We are proud of the product we produced. We  will make sure that the American people get through this pandemic, this  economic crisis, this healthcare crisis, this personal crisis, and  restore their standard of living and the economy of this country once  we get to the other side.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that in the  engrossment of the bill, H.R. 1319, the Clerk be authorized to make  technical corrections and conforming changes to the bill.
