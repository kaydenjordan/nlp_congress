 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 546) to regulate monitoring of electronic communications  between an incarcerated person in a Bureau of Prisons facility and that  person's attorney or other legal representative, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 546         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H558]]            SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Effective Assistance of       Counsel in the Digital Era Act''.       SEC. 2. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN AN INCARCERATED                     PERSON AND THE PERSON'S ATTORNEY.         (a) Prohibition on Monitoring.--Not later than 180 days       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Attorney       General shall create a program or system, or modify any       program or system that exists on the date of enactment of       this Act, through which an incarcerated person sends or       receives an electronic communication, to exclude from       monitoring the contents of any privileged electronic       communication. In the case that the Attorney General creates       a program or system in accordance with this subsection, the       Attorney General shall, upon implementing such system,       discontinue using any program or system that exists on the       date of enactment of this Act through which an incarcerated       person sends or receives a privileged electronic       communication, except that any program or system that exists       on such date may continue to be used for any other electronic       communication.        (b) Retention of Contents.--A program or system or a       modification to a program or system under subsection (a) may       allow for retention by the Bureau of Prisons of, and access       by an incarcerated person to, the contents of electronic       communications, including the contents of privileged       electronic communications, of the person until the date on       which the person is released from prison.        (c) Attorney-Client Privilege.--Attorney-client privilege,       and the protections and limitations associated with such       privilege (including the crime fraud exception), applies to       electronic communications sent or received through the       program or system established or modified under subsection       (a).        (d) Accessing Retained Contents.--Contents retained under       subsection (b) may only be accessed by a person other than       the incarcerated person for whom such contents are retained       under the following circumstances:        (1) Attorney general.--The Attorney General may only access       retained contents if necessary for the purpose of creating       and maintaining the program or system, or any modification to       the program or system, through which an incarcerated person       sends or receives electronic communications. The Attorney       General may not review retained contents that are accessed       pursuant to this paragraph.        (2) Investigative and law enforcement officers.--        (A) Warrant.--        (i) In general.--Retained contents may only be accessed by       an investigative or law enforcement officer pursuant to a       warrant issued by a court pursuant to the procedures       described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.        (ii) Approval.--No application for a warrant may be made to       a court without the express approval of a United States       Attorney or an Assistant Attorney General.        (B) Privileged information.--        (i) Review.--Before retained contents may be accessed       pursuant to a warrant obtained under subparagraph (A), such       contents shall be reviewed by a United States Attorney to       ensure that privileged electronic communications are not       accessible.        (ii) Barring participation.--A United States Attorney who       reviews retained contents pursuant to clause (i) shall be       barred from--         (I) participating in a legal proceeding in which an       individual who sent or received an electronic communication       from which such contents are retained under subsection (b) is       a defendant; or        (II) sharing the retained contents with an attorney who is       participating in such a legal proceeding.         (3) Motion to suppress.--In a case in which retained       contents have been accessed in violation of this subsection,       a court may suppress evidence obtained or derived from access       to such contents upon motion of the defendant.        (e) Definitions.--In this Act--        (1) the term ``agent of an attorney or legal       representative'' means any person employed by or contracting       with an attorney or legal representative, including law       clerks, interns, investigators, paraprofessionals, and       administrative staff;        (2) the term ``contents'' has the meaning given such term       in 2510 of title 18, United States Code;        (3) the term ``electronic communication'' has the meaning       given such term in section 2510 of title 18, United States       Code, and includes the Trust Fund Limited Inmate Computer       System;        (4) the term ``monitoring'' means accessing the contents of       an electronic communication at any time after such       communication is sent;        (5) the term ``incarcerated person'' means any individual       in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons or the United States       Marshals Service who has been charged with or convicted of an       offense against the United States, including such an       individual who is imprisoned in a State institution; and        (6) the term ``privileged electronic communication''       means--        (A) any electronic communication between an incarcerated       person and a potential, current, or former attorney or legal       representative of such a person; and        (B) any electronic communication between an incarcerated       person and the agent of an attorney or legal representative       described in subparagraph (A).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the first thing I would like to do is thank our  distinguished chair of the Democratic Caucus, Mr. Jeffries, for working  with us and moving forward on this bill, along with the chairman of the  full committee, Mr. Nadler.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 546, the Effective Assistance of Counsel in the  Digital Era Act requires the Federal Bureau of Prisons to establish a  system that ensures the confidentiality of all privileged electronic  communications between incarcerated individuals and their attorneys or  legal representatives.   H.R. 546 is identical to bipartisan legislation sponsored by  Representative Hakeem Jeffries last Congress. Last September, the House  approved this bill by voice vote. However, the Senate failed to take up  the measure prior to adjournment. As we move forward today, I hope that  the House will approve this bill with broad support, again, so that the  Senate will take swift action and President Biden can sign this much- needed proposal into law.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 546 addresses important constitutional  protections for criminal defendants, and all of these I support. The  Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides the right to  counsel, to assist in the defense of those accused of criminal  offenses. In order to represent their clients in an effective manner,  defense attorneys must have the ability to communicate candidly with  their clients.   The attorney-client privilege, which keeps communications between  individuals and their attorneys confidential, exists in part to foster  open communications. This privilege is a fundamental component of the  effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Constitution. Of  course, this privilege does not protect communications between a client  and an attorney made in furtherance of or in order to cover up a crime  or fraud, also known as the crime-fraud exception. We understand that.   Outside of any custody setting, defendants are less constrained in  their ability to have candid conversations with their attorneys.  Generally, out-of-custody defendants can go to their attorneys'  offices, speak with them freely on the phone, or send written or  electronic correspondence without fear of interference or monitoring.  To an extent, in-custody defendants also have these protections.   For example, in the Federal system, Bureau of Prisons' regulations  ensure that inmates can meet with their attorneys without auditory  supervision. Current regulations also allow confidential phone calls  and letters between inmates and their attorneys. But these same  protections do not apply to email communications for the nearly 152,000  individuals currently in Federal custody, including those in pretrial  detention who have not been convicted of any crime.   I know that my colleagues can see that that is definitively a denial  of the civil rights, civil liberties, and the criminal justice rights  that these individuals should have access to.   H.R. 546 would ensure that all communications between attorneys and  their clients remain confidential, including email.   Madam Speaker, over a decade ago, the Federal Bureau of Prisons  recognized the growing importance of email, which is important in  providing efficient and swift communications between inmates and  individuals on the outside.   Since 2009, Bureau of Prisons' inmates have been able to access  emails  [[Page H559]]  through a system known as TRULINCS. However, TRULINCS requires inmates  and their contacts to consent to monitoring of all communications, even  email exchanges between inmates and their attorneys. That, I think we  all understand, is unfair.   Madam Speaker, during the last decade, email has grown rapidly and is  the primary means of communication between inmates and their attorneys.  During the current pandemic, emails have become even more important  given how difficult it is for attorneys to meet with their clients.   Without appropriate safeguards, the Bureau of Prisons risks severely  hindering the effective representation of inmates by limiting attorney- client privilege for electronic communications. Therefore, H.R. 546  would require the Bureau to implement an adequate system to ensure that  these attorney-client communications remain confidential--again, a  constitutional provision or principle of the right to counsel.   H.R. 546 also includes additional protections, including the  requirement of the contents of electronic communications be destroyed  when an inmate is released from prison, as well as authorizing the  suppression of evidence obtained or derived from access to information  that is in violation of the provisions set forth in the bill.   Madam Speaker, this is an important bill. Its time is now. I commend  our colleague, Representative Jeffries, for his effort and leadership  in developing this bipartisan legislation. This proposal has already  received broad support by the House during the last Congress, and now  we must act swiftly to see it enacted into law, moving to the United  States Senate, and seeing the United States Senate act quickly for it  to be signed by President Joe Biden.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join us in support of  this bill today, and I reserve the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary, Committee, I rise  in strong support of H.R. 546, the bipartisan ``Effective Assistance of  Counsel in the Digital Era Act,'' reintroduced by Congressman Jeffries  of New York, legislation that ensures that email communications between  people in Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) custody and their legal teams  are protected with the same privilege as legal visits, letters, and  phone calls.   This legislation was reported out of the Judiciary Committee  unanimously in the 116th Congress and was passed in the House twice-- once as part of a COVID relief bill and later without objection on the  House floor.   The principles of justice, fairness, and due process upon which our  legal system is built necessitate confidentiality between the accused  and their defense counsel.   Attorney client privilege is one of the oldest privileges for  confidential communications and has been an important part of the  American legal system for hundreds of years.   This privilege is critical when clients are in custody, and the form  of communication--whether it be in person, by letter, by telephone, or  by email--should have no bearing on that protection.   Currently, individuals held in BOP facilities are uniformly denied  the ability to have privileged communications with their lawyers  through TRULINCS, the only email system available to them.   In order to use the BOP system, incarcerated individuals must sign a  waiver acknowledging that their communications may be monitored.   Without signing the waiver, they cannot use the email system, cutting  off any opportunity to communicate electronically.   The need for access to privileged email is long overdue, and it is  more critical than ever today.   As the COVID pandemic has raged across the country and spread through  detention facilities, BOP has restricted in-person visits, and  unmonitored calls and legal mail are more difficult to use.   But incarcerated clients' need to have access to their lawyers is  undiminished, and in many instances is heightened by the delays and  fears brought on by the pandemic.   Email is the safest and most cost-effective means of communicating.   The Effective Assistance of Counsel in the Digital Era Act remedies  many of these concerns by striking the right balance between the  government's limited interest in accessing certain email communications  with a warrant and the need to properly protect communications subject  to the attorney-client privilege.   This legislation will only require the Department of Justice to  change procedures concerning attorney-client communications and still  maintains the ability for United States Attorneys to access other  emails.   Privileged communication is the cornerstone of attorney-client  relationships and inseparable from the due process rights on which the  U.S. legal system is founded.   It is past time for BOP to bring its policies into the 21st century  and ensure that electronic communications between people in custody and  their legal teams are protected.   I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 546, the ``Effective  Assistance of Counsel in the Digital Era Act.''    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), the sponsor and  author of this bill, the chairman of the Democratic Caucus.                                time  1700     Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Jeffries) an additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Let me thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop) for his  collegial response and his very important remarks on collaboration for  important legislation like this.   Let me also thank the distinguished gentleman from New York for  finding an Achilles' heel that would really and continues to undermine  the true sense of attorney-client privilege and to respect that  privilege, whether you are in custody or not, and also recognizes the  increasing utilization of the digital world to file briefs, to make  arguments, and, of course, to find that divide between those in-custody  inmates incarcerated and those that are not in custody. We are now  moving to extensive virtual court proceedings.   As we well know, individuals in custody are making a number of  efforts to prove their innocence. They are appealing. They are seeking  new trials. They, too, have rights that should be respected under both  the Criminal Code and the Constitution.   So, again, I thank the gentleman for his thoughtfulness and all the  bipartisan cosponsors that he has.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 546 would ensure that the attorney-client  privilege, again, is safeguarded in all communications between criminal  defendants and their attorneys. This bipartisan legislation addresses  an issue that is essential to the fair administration of the criminal  justice system.   During this ongoing pandemic, this measure has become even more  urgent when there is even more reliance on electronic communications  between attorneys and incarcerated individuals.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bipartisan legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1192) to impose requirements on the payment of  compensation to professional persons employed in voluntary cases  commenced under title III of the Puerto Rico Oversight Management and  Economic Stability Act (commonly known as ``PROMESA'').   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1192         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Puerto Rico Recovery       Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 2021'' or ``PRRADA''.       SEC. 2. DISCLOSURE BY PROFESSIONAL PERSONS SEEKING APPROVAL                     OF COMPENSATION UNDER SECTION 316 OR 317 OF                     PROMESA.         (a) Required Disclosure.--        (1) In general.--In a voluntary case commenced under       section 304 of PROMESA (48 U.S.C. 2164), no attorney,       accountant, appraiser, auctioneer, agent, consultant, or       other professional person may be compensated under section       316 or 317 of that Act (48 U.S.C. 2176, 2177) unless prior to       making a request for compensation, the professional person       has submitted a verified statement conforming to the       disclosure requirements of rule 2014(a) of the Federal Rules       of Bankruptcy Procedure setting forth the connection of the       professional person with--        (A) the debtor;        (B) any creditor;        (C) any other party in interest, including any attorney or       accountant;        (D) the Financial Oversight and Management Board       established in accordance with section 101 of PROMESA (48       U.S.C. 2121); and        (E) any person employed by the Oversight Board described in       subparagraph (D).  [[Page H561]]         (2) Other requirements.--A professional person that submits       a statement under paragraph (1) shall--        (A) supplement the statement with any additional relevant       information that becomes known to the person; and        (B) file annually a notice confirming the accuracy of the       statement.        (b) Review.--        (1) In general.--The United States Trustee shall review       each verified statement submitted pursuant to subsection (a)       and may file with the court comments on such verified       statements before the professionals filing such statements       seek compensation under section 316 or 317 of PROMESA (48       U.S.C. 2176, 2177).        (2) Objection.--The United States Trustee may object to       compensation applications filed under section 316 or 317 of       PROMESA (48 U.S.C. 2176, 2177) that fail to satisfy the       requirements of subsection (e).        (3) Right to be heard.--Each person described in section       1109 of title 11, United States Code, may appear and be heard       on any issue in a case under this section.        (c) Jurisdiction.--The district courts of the United States       shall have jurisdiction of all cases under this section.        (d) Retroactivity.--        (1) In general.--If a court has entered an order approving       compensation under a case commenced under section 304 of       PROMESA (48 U.S.C. 2164), each professional person subject to       the order shall file a verified statement in accordance with       subsection (a) not later than 60 days after the date of       enactment of this Act.        (2) No delay.--A court may not delay any proceeding in       connection with a case commenced under section 304 of PROMESA       (48 U.S.C. 2164) pending the filing of a verified statement       under paragraph (1).        (e) Limitation on Compensation.--        (1) In general.--In a voluntary case commenced under       section 304 of PROMESA (48 U.S.C. 2164), in connection with       the review and approval of professional compensation under       section 316 or 317 of PROMESA (48 U.S.C. 2176, 2177), the       court may deny allowance of compensation for services and       reimbursement of expenses, accruing after the date of the       enactment of this Act of a professional person if the       professional person--        (A) has failed to file statements of connections required       by subsection (a) or has filed inadequate statements of       connections;        (B) except as provided in paragraph (3), is on or after the       date of enactment of this Act not a disinterested person, as       defined in section 101 of title 11, United States Code; or        (C) except as provided in paragraph (3), represents, or       holds an interest adverse to, the interest of the estate with       respect to the matter on which such professional person is       employed.        (2) Considerations.--In making a determination under       paragraph (1), the court may take into consideration whether       the services and expenses are in the best interests of       creditors and the estate.        (3) Committee professional standards.--An attorney or       accountant described in section 1103(b) of title 11, United       States Code, shall be deemed to have violated paragraph (1)       if the attorney or accountant violates section 1103(b) of       title 11, United States Code.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, as I always do, let me thank the sponsor of this  legislation for her leadership, the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Velazquez), and all of those who have supported this important  leadership bill.   H.R. 1192, the Puerto Rico Recovery Accuracy In Disclosures Act, or  PRRADA, is commonsense legislation that would promote greater  transparency and integrity with respect to the ongoing financial  reorganization of Puerto Rico.   In response to dire fiscal issues facing Puerto Rico at the time,  Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic  Stability Act, or PROMESA, in 2016. That legislation established a  financial oversight and management board with control over Puerto  Rico's budget, laws, financial plans, and regulations and the authority  to retain professionals to assist the board in executing its  responsibilities.   Though largely patterned on Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code,  PROMESA did not incorporate all facets of Chapter 11 and other relevant  provisions of the code. Importantly, this includes the code's mandatory  disclosure requirements regarding actual or potential conflicts of  interest that professional persons seeking to be retained in a  bankruptcy case must make to the court prior to their retention.   This bill would close that loophole by conditioning the compensation  of professional persons retained under PROMESA upon certain disclosures  similar to those required under the Bankruptcy Code.   Additionally, the bill would require the United States Trustee to  review these disclosures and submit comments in response to the court  and also authorize the United States Trustee to object to compensation  requested by the professionals.   Finally, H.R. 1192 would allow courts to deny compensation for  services and reimbursement of expenses if the professional person did  not comply with the disclosure requirement, was not a disinterested  person, or represented or held an interest adverse to the bankruptcy  estate.   I thank Ms. Velazquez for her leadership in championing this bill and  for her relentless dedication, which we all have witnessed, to ensuring  that the people of Puerto Rico receive the fair, efficient, and  transparent restructuring process they deserve.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, which was passed out of  the House last Congress by a unanimous vote.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary, Committee, I rise  in strong support of H.R. 1192, the ``Puerto Rico Recovery Accuracy in  Disclosures Act of 2021'' or ``PRRADA Act,'' which conditions  compensation of professional persons retained under the congressionally  passed ``Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability  Act'' (``PROMESA'') upon the applicant providing certain disclosures  similar to those required under Bankruptcy Code section 327.   In response to dire fiscal issues facing Puerto Rico at the time,  Congress passed Pub. L. 114-187, the ``Puerto Rico Oversight,  Management, and Economic Stability Act'' or ``PROMESA'' in 2016,  legislation I strongly supported and cosponsored.   The Act established the Financial Oversight and Management Board  (Board), a fiscal control board comprised of seven members that would  have control over Puerto Rico's budget, laws, financial plans, and  regulations.   It empowered the board to propose a budget for Puerto Rico and  restructure its obligations owed to bondholders, estimated to be $6.5  billion, and other creditors.   Although largely patterned on chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code,  PROMESA did not incorporate all facets of chapter 11 and other relevant  provisions of the Code.   For example, although the Board is authorized to retain and  compensate professional persons in connection with its efforts to  reorganize Puerto Rico, PROMESA does not include certain restrictions  that the Bankruptcy Code requires for such purposes.   For example, Section 327 of the Bankruptcy Code, unlike PROMESA,  authorizes professional persons, such as attorneys, financial advisors,  appraisers, and others, to be retained in connection with the  administration of a bankruptcy case provided they meet the following  conditions: first, such a person must not hold or represent an interest  adverse to the bankruptcy estate; and second, the professional must be  a ``disinterested person.''   As I indicated at the outset, H.R. 1192, the ``Puerto Rico Recovery  Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 2021'' or ``PRRADA,'' conditions  compensation of professional persons retained under PROMESA upon the  applicant providing certain disclosures similar to those required under  Bankruptcy Code section 327.   In addition, it would require the United States Trustee to review  such disclosures and submit comments in response to the court as well  as authorize the United States trustee to object to compensation  requested by professionals. Further, the measure would apply  retroactively to professionals who have previously been awarded  compensation.   Finally, H.R. 1192 would authorize the court to deny allowance of  compensation for services and reimbursement of expenses accruing after  the bill's enactment date if the professional person did not comply  with the disclosure requirement, was not a disinterested person, or  represented or held an interest adverse to the bankruptcy estate.   I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 1192, the ``Puerto  Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 2021.''   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Velazquez), the author of this legislation and also  a champion, as all Members of the United States Congress know, during  the very trying and difficult times of our friends in Puerto Rico. It  is her voice that has been the most singularly powerful in their  advocacy, along with her wonderful colleague, the distinguished  representative, the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H563]]    Madam Speaker, let me indicate again, this is a very vital initiative  to continue to help in Puerto Rico's recovery. Let me thank the  gentlewoman from New York for her leadership and, of course, the  gentlewoman from Puerto Rico. This partnership and bipartisan  collaboration with the other cosponsors is very crucial as we continue  to work as a Congress to do our job for the people of Puerto Rico.   H.R. 1192 closes a loophole under current law by establishing  disclosure requirements regarding actual or potential conflicts of  interest in the bankruptcy process under PROMESA. In doing so, this  legislation promotes transparency and accountability in the Puerto Rico  restructuring process.   Again, I thank my colleague, Ms. Velazquez from New York, the author  of the bill, for her leadership on this issue, and Mr. Nadler and his  work.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure.  This, of course, along with the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico, is  helping the people of Puerto Rico, our neighbors and our fellow  Americans.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, just a few minutes ago, Members stood  on the steps of the United States Congress, reminiscent of the unity of  this Nation and the words of our Pledge of Allegiance that we stand  united.   I rise to offer words of condolence and remembrance for the 500,000  lives taken by COVID-19. The Nation, over the last 12 months, has faced  a crucible of suffering, death, and disease that has taken lives,  devastated the economy, and put millions at risk of greater hardship  due to the death of a loved one, unemployment, loss of healthcare or  forgone education opportunities.   I continue to remember the little 4-year-old boy in Texas who lost  both of his parents; or those who continue to mourn losing a mom, dad,  husband, wife, children, yes, and siblings.   Yesterday, as the news broke that this Nation has lost 500,000--more  than World War I, World War II, the Korean war, and the Vietnam war--my  heart was heavy, and this loss is a sad mark.   So I come today to this floor to say to those who have lost: You will  never be forgotten.   To those who remain: Your loved one will never be forgotten. Their  lives will not be in vain. Their deaths will not be in vain.   And though these are staggering proportions, our commitment as the  United States Congress should be to ensure this moment.   Madam Speaker, I end by a quiet moment of silence at this moment.   Madam Speaker, I rise to offer words of condolence and remembrance  for the five hundred thousand lives taken by COVID-19.   The Nation over the last twelve months has faced a crucible of  suffering, death, and disease that has taken too many lives, devastated  the economy and put millions at risk of greater hardship due to the  death of a loved one, unemployment, loss of health care or forgone  education opportunities.   Yesterday, as news broke that the Nation had reached the milestone of  losing five hundred thousand people to COVID-19, I was at the  dedication of a Community Vaccination Center at the NRG Stadium located  in Houston Texas.   Today, with a heavy heart our nation sadly marks the loss of 500,000  American lives to the coronavirus: an unimaginable human toll in our  modern era of medical and technological advances.   These deaths are of staggering proportions and cause incomprehensible  sadness, but we cannot think of them as the end of COVID-19.   As we have learned COVID-19 can surge again claiming even more lives.   This is why we cannot be complacent by accepting so much death  without continuing to fight to save lives and end this pandemic.   Every life lost is a profound tragedy and earth-shattering moment in  the lives of families, neighborhoods, and communities that touch each  of us in countless ways as we mourn and console our family members,  coworkers, neighbors and friends.   Today, I joined my colleagues of the House to observe a moment of  silence on the steps of the Capitol for the 500,000 lives lost.   Members of Congress will join tens of millions of Americans in prayer  for the lives lost or devastated by this vicious virus.   As we pray, we must commit ourselves to honoring those we have lost  by wearing face coverings, observing social distance, washing of  hands--and most important getting the vaccine when it is our time to do  so as a pledge to all who have been taken from us far too soon that we  will act swiftly to put an end to this pandemic and to stem the  suffering felt by so many.   My commitment is to save lives and also livelihoods through public  and personal action.   As Texans work to overcome the tragic winter disaster that befell the  state last week, I wrote to President Biden asking that he grant the  state's request for a Presidential Disaster Declaration, which he did  and today FEMA is on the ground providing water delivery, food  distribution, and other vital services to help Texans get back on their  feet.   I also encourage those who have lost health insurance during the  economic crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of  the extended enrollment period for getting health insurance through  healthcare.gov, which is open until May 15, 2021.   Currently, 36 states are using HealthCare.gov. Since President Biden  announced the creation of the Special Enrollment Period for  HealthCare.gov, all 14 states and D.C. that have their own state-based  marketplaces have announced that they would also have Special  Enrollment Periods.   President Biden has extended a lifeline to struggling small  businesses, to save American jobs and power the American economy, while  promoting equity and fairness across Main Street.   The reforms he had made will expand access to the Paycheck Protection  Program (PPP) to the hardest-hit businesses that anchor our low and  middle-income and communities of color.   Importantly, they will ensure that sole proprietors, which are  overwhelmingly women and minorities, and which also serve our immigrant  communities, are not left behind.   My unwavering support of these Biden Administration reforms will also  build on recent PPP successes that increase assistance to businesses  with ten or fewer employees in underserved and rural areas.   They also build on the work of increasing assistance through  community-based lenders that specialize in serving those markets.   As President Biden advances these actions, I can say with pride that  I participated in the Budget Committee's Markup of the American Rescue  Plan intended to end COVID-19 pandemic and save the nation's economy.   Real Help is on the way. We will win this battle against COVID and  save the economy by working together.   I conclude with these words ``Precious Lord take my hand'' and lead  me on. We will together win the battle.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, let me thank our illustrious leader  of the Congressional Black Caucus, whose visionary leadership is going  to carry us into the 117th Congress.   Congresswoman Joyce Beatty acts legislatively on her history. She is  from Ohio, one of the major stops of the Underground Railroad. In fact,  Cincinnati, Ohio, has one of the most monumental monuments, if you  will, to that freedom train, that courage, of Harriet Tubman. I might  say that our chairwoman's actions are in resemblance to Harriet Tubman.  We are grateful for her vision.   We will tomorrow, at the Congressional Black Caucus, unveil the  talent of tens upon tens of members of the Congressional Black Caucus  and lay out our legacy, Our Power, Our Message. I thank the gentlewoman  for her leadership.   It is as well my honor to be able to co-chair this with, if I might  with a degree of familiarity, a brother from the Bronx. I am delighted  that a working man's and woman's representative has come to be able to  shine, a man who is a product of public housing, public schools, and  public hospitals, and who had a dream of lifting up his community and  building back a better Bronx.   I am delighted that at 25, against all odds, he became the youngest  elected official in New York City and the first openly LGBTQ elected  official from the Bronx. He doesn't know that his reputation preceded  him as a dynamic get-her-done person.   I will repeat his motto before I begin my remarks, and that is  Ritchie Torres' remarks and life motto is as follows: ``My motto is  life is simple. If you do nothing, nothing will change.''   Wow, what a piercing message for all of us, Republicans and  Democrats, to do something good.   His motto is: ``If you do nothing, nothing will change. We can build  a better Bronx, and we will do it together.''   I am delighted to coanchor with Mr. Ritchie Torres for the 117th  Congress.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I am particularly delighted to begin  my remarks, as I continue to weave in and out tonight, and then, with  my remarks, will yield to Mr. Torres as well.  [[Page H574]]    This is a moment in history. Tonight, we will explore honoring our  50-year legacy, Our Power, Our Message.   As I was flying up today, I was very happy to find on the movie list  on an airplane ``Good Trouble,'' the movie about John Lewis, with so  many Members telling their story. I think I will just simply say: Good  trouble.   Tonight, we hope to exemplify good trouble as we honor the 50-year  legacy of the Congressional Black Caucus and emphasize Our Power, Our  Message. We want to be in good trouble.   I am honored in the 117th Congress to chair the Crime, Terrorism, and  Homeland Security Subcommittee and serve as a senior member on the  Judiciary Committee, where, in addition to the powers of Congressional  Black Caucus, we will seek to have justice rain down like righteous  waters.                                time  2045    We will do that, however, with the 55 members of the Congressional  Black Caucus, and I think our numbers are higher than that, and they  are all on different committees. Amazing. They will pierce the seams of  equality and justice in the 117th Congress. So we will have our past,  but we will have our future.   Let me briefly talk about where we were 400 years ago. Ships sailed  from the west coast of Africa and in the process began one of mankind's  most inhumane practices, human bondage and slavery. Approximately 4  million Africans and their descendents were enslaved in the United  States and colonies, that became the United States, from 1619 to 1865.   The institution of slavery was constitutionally and statutorily  sanctioned by the Government of the United States from 1789 to 1865,  and certainly American slavery is our original sin. But tonight you  will hear woven throughout the remarks of so many of my colleagues, how  out of these ashes of enslaved Africans, out of the toll of death from  those held in bondage, out of the heroes that fought in the Civil War,  who rose up out of the south and the north and came and bled for this  Nation, out of that death toll of American fighters who happen to be  present and former slaves and suffered indignities, and continue until  the end of the 1800s and into Jim Crow-ism, you will find the  overcomers.   You will find those who have climbed and clawed their way to  leadership. Of course, there will be those who say there is no need for  an apology, which is part of H.R. 40, no need for a commission to  pierce into these ongoing disparities because you have overcome. In  fact, this caucus was founded by overcomers, an array of talented men  and women who themselves are the cornerstone of democracy and  legitimacy.   Who would ever forget the Honorable Shirley Chisholm, the first woman  to run for the Presidency, an African-American woman, Black woman, and  a woman to run for the Presidency, never to be daunted, never to be  rejected, never to be denied?   Or William L. Clay, Sr., who chaired the Education and Labor  Committee, the first Black man, or the second, to do so.   George W. Collins, a pioneer and powerhouse out of Chicago, Illinois.   John Conyers, the dean of the United States Congress, and the first  Member of Congress to hire Rosa Parks, and a Member of Congress--I  think it is his distinction alone--to have Dr. Martin Luther King  endorse him.   Ron Dellums, he was a man that was told: You sit in the chair with  Pat Schroeder, in the Armed Services Committee. We are not interested  in you being here in the first place. And Ron Dellums rose to be chair  of the Armed Services Committee.   And how much of an overcomer they are: Charles Diggs, the leading man  on Africa.   Augustus Hawkins, the leading man on the empowerment of working  families.   Again, Ralph Metcalfe, one of the early pioneers of elected Black  Members of Congress, again, out of Chicago.   Parren Mitchell, the father of affirmative action.   Robert C. Nix, a pioneer out of Pennsylvania.   Charles B. Rangel, who worked his way up from the streets of Harlem  to the U.S. Attorney's Office to then be chair of the Ways and Means  Committee.   Lou Stokes, a major force on the Appropriations Committee and  healthcare in America.   And, of course, delegate Walter E. Fauntroy, who I met in South  Carolina with a commitment to defeat a segregationist who chaired the  District of Columbia Committee.   Overcomers, but each of them will say that this definition of who we  are should not be on the few, it should be on the many. That means  that, we, as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, stand here  today to be able to call as our mandate, our challenge, our power, our  message, is to be able to lift the opportunities of all African  Americans and Black people, and people of color, as we work to ensure  that anyone who is denied equality has us, we, the collective body  politics, as their champion. That is what tonight is about.   You will hear a number of descriptions of many persons, and you will  hear the words of many of us from different parts of the country.   Madam Speaker, I am delighted to kick-off this series of CBC Special  Order Hours for the 117th Congress with my colleague Congressman  Ritchie Torres (NY-15) who will serve as co-Anchor.   Tonight, we will explore Honoring our 50 Year legacy Our Power, Our  Message.   As chair of the Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism and Homeland Security and a senior member of the House  Committee on Homeland Security, and a member of the House Budget  Committee, I clearly understand the importance of history and why we  should take time to appreciate the path that has led us to this moment.   Four hundred years ago, ships set sail from the west coast of Africa  and, in the process, began one of mankind's most inhumane practices:  human bondage and slavery.   For two centuries, human beings--full of hopes and fears, dreams and  concerns, ambition, and anguish--were transported onto ships like  chattel, and the lives of many were forever changed.   The reverberations from this horrific series of acts--a transatlantic  slave trade that touched the shores of a colony that came to be known  as America, and later a democratic republic known as the United States  of America--are unknown and worthy of exploration.   Approximately 4,000,000 Africans and their descendants were enslaved  in the United States and colonies that became the United States from  1619 to 1865.   The institution of slavery was constitutionally and statutorily  sanctioned by the Government of the United States from 1789 through  1865.   American Slavery is our country's Original Sin and its existence at  the birth of our nation is a permanent scar on our country's founding  documents, and on the venerated authors of those documents, and it is a  legacy that continued well into the last century.   The framework for our country and the document to which we all take  an oath describes African Americans as three-fifths a person.   The infamous Dred Scott decision of the United States Supreme Court,  issued just a few decades later, described slaves as private property,  unworthy of citizenship.   And, a civil war that produced the largest death toll of American  fighters in any conflict in our history could not prevent the  indignities of Jim Crow, the fire hose at lunch counters, and the  systemic and institutional discrimination that would follow for a  century after the end of the Civil War.   The mythology built around the Civil War has obscured our discussions  of the impact of chattel slavery and made it difficult to have a  national dialogue on how to fully account for its place in American  history and public policy.   While it is nearly impossible to determine how the lives touched by  slavery could have flourished in the absence of bondage, we have  certain datum that permits us to examine how a subset of Americans-- African Americans--have been affected by the callousness of involuntary  servitude.   We know that in almost every segment of society--education,  healthcare, jobs, and wealth--the inequities that persist in America  are more acutely and disproportionately felt in Black America.   This historic discrimination continues: African-Americans continue to  suffer debilitating economic, educational, and health hardships  including but not limited to having nearly 1,000,000 black people  incarcerated; an unemployment rate more than twice the current white  unemployment rate; and an average of less than 1/16 of the wealth of  white families, a disparity which has worsened, not improved over time.   These conditions gave rise to a strong believe by Congressman Charlie  Diggs that black members of Congress needed a way to make a difference  by working together.  [[Page H575]]    The idea for an organization of black elected Members of Congress  came from Representative Charles Diggs (D-Mich.) who created the  Democracy Select Committee (DSC) in an effort to bring black members of  Congress together.   Diggs noticed that he and other African American members of Congress  often felt isolated because there were very few of them in Congress,  and he wanted to create a forum where they could discuss common  political challenges and interests.   Diggs believed that ``The sooner we get organized for group action,  the more effective we can become.''   The DSC was an informal group that held irregular meetings and had no  independent staff or budget, but that changed a few years later.   As a result of court-ordered redistricting, one of several victories  of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act joined by the force of  the Civil Rights Movement, the number of African-American Members of  Congress rose from nine to 13, the largest number since the end of the  Civil War brought reconstruction that paved the way for voting rights  for former slaves.   The Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) was established in 1971 by the  following 13 founding members:   1. Rep. Shirley A. Chisholm (D-N.Y.);   2. Rep. William L. Clay, Sr. (D-Mo.);   3. Rep. George W. Collins (D-Ill.);   4. Rep. John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.);   5. Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Calif.);   6. Rep. Charles C. Diggs, Jr. (D-Mich.);   7. Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Calif.);   8. Rep. Ralph H. Metcalfe (D-Ill.);   9. Rep. Parren J. Mitchell (D-Md.);   10. Rep. Robert N.C. Nix, Sr. (D-Pa.);   11. Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.);   12. Rep. Louis Stokes (D-Ohio); and   13. Del. Walter E. Fauntroy (D-D.C.).   Few recall that before these storied luminaries were elected to  Congress, there were other African American Members of Congress  immediately following the end of the Civil War who also served in this  august body.   1. Robert Brown ELLIOTT 42nd (1871-73), 43rd (1873-75)   2. Jefferson Franklin LONG, 41st (1869-71)   3. Joseph Hayne RAINEY, 41st (1869-71), 42nd (1871-73), 43rd (1873- 75), 44th (1875-77), 45th (1877-79)   4. Hiram Rhodes REVELS, 41st (1869-1871)   5. Robert Carlos DE LARGE 42nd (1871-1873)   6. Robert Brown ELLIOTT, 42nd (1871-73), 43rd (1873-75)   7. Benjamin Sterling TURNER, 42nd (1871-1873)   8. Josiah Thomas WALLS, 42nd (1871-73), 43rd (1873-75), 44th(1875-77)   9. Richard Harvey CAIN, 43rd (1873-75), 45th (1877-79)   10. John Roy LYNCH, 43rd (1873-75), 44th (1875-77), 47th (1881-83)   11. Alonzo Jacob RANSIER, 43rd (1873-75)   12. James Thomas RAPIER, 43rd (1873-75)   13. Blanche Kelso BRUCE, 44th (1875-77), 45th (1877-79), 46th (1879- 81)   14. Jeremiah HARALSON, 44th (1875-77)   15. HYMAN, John Adams 44th (1875-77)   16. Charles Edmund NASH, 44th (1875-77)   At the end of reconstruction, many of these Black members of Congress  lost their office and many others who sought elected office or  attempted to vote in public elections lost their lives.   It would take nearly another hundred years until a sufficient number  of Federally elected black candidates would return to Congress.   But as too many African Americans know, in some ways, the civil war  has never truly ended.   On January 6, 2021, we saw the raw, savage face of the lingering  confederacy attempt to put a dagger into the heart of our democracy.   On that day, every belief expressed by this preamble to the  Constitution of the United States was at risk of being lost to the  hands of a wellcoordinated attack hidden within the ranks of a riotous,  murderous mob that invaded and laid siege to U.S. Capitol during the  constitutionally required but ministerial act of counting the ballots  submitted by the presidential electors of each state and declaring  publicly the persons who were by their ballots elected President and  Vice-President of the United States.   We all knew the outcome of the 2020 Presidential Election long before  January 6, 2021 because of the transparency of each state's election  administration and that the Joint Meeting of Congress would simply  confirm that Joe Biden had won more than a majority of the electoral  votes, along with winning the national popular vote by more than 7  million votes.   The riot came immediately after then-President Trump promoted a march  on the Capitol and called his supporters to `stop the steal,' `never  give up, never concede,' and to `fight like hell' during a speech that  day, asserting that they would not `have a country anymore' if they did  not act.   During the breach, Members of Congress were voting to certify then- President-elect Joe Biden's election victory, and many participants in  the attack intended to thwart this effort.   Violent participants, incited by the former President's rhetoric,  injured scores of D.C. Police and U.S. Capitol Police officers--killing  one, while four civilians also died.   The level of violence and passions demonstrated are out of character  for a nation that is accustomed to the peaceful transfer of power,  especially when the results were so clear--the President had been  soundly defeated for reelection.   We did not appreciate how powerful a lie could be in the domain of  social media where people can wall themselves off from alternative  views and news.   A nation accustomed to the peaceful transfer of power from one  presidency to another was unprepared for the enemy within; from a Chief  Executive who would attempt to strike at the heart of lawful authority  to destroy the union so that he could remain in office.   The underlying currents that led to the siege of the Capitol on  January 6, 2021 began with the Compromise of 1876, which ended  Reconstruction.   We must have an account of the crimes committed and the exacting of  justice to those whose violent acts of rebellion against the authority  of the United States resulted in the deaths of six Americans and the  desecration and defilement of the Citadel of Democracy.   The injury done to the nation by white supremacists on January 6,  2021, can be linked to the harm they have done to this nation for well  over 100 years beginning with the end of Reconstruction.   The withdrawal of Union troops from the defeated and seditious  southern states in 1877 effectively put an end to Reconstruction and  ushered in the era deconstruction of any efforts to normalize equal  rights under law to former slaves.   This period of American history is obscured by time and characterized  by a willful ignorance by governments, media, and academia, of the  scale of murder mania that gripped the South during the period before  Jim Crow de jure segregation, when the lines were being drawn in the  blood of black people that outlined what black people would and would  never be allowed to do in American society.   Before they were written into law, the `Black Codes' were shaped by a  series of violent acts that occurred in communities large and small  throughout the South, leading to tens of thousands of murders and  attacks that maimed many because of arbitrary rules of social conduct  such as a black man did not tip his hat, get off the sidewalk, spoke to  a white person without first being spoken to, or other perceived  slights.   The reign of terror visited upon former slaves and their communities  began near the end of Reconstruction and resulted in a secret history  of the United States that almost erased the gains made by former slaves  during the period 1865-1876 that included over 1,500 elected offices  held throughout the South.   There were former slaves elected to serve in the 41st and 42nd  Congresses of the United States, most of whom were denied reelection to  office once Jim Crow laws limited access to voting for former slaves.   It was unnatural for black communities to have gone silent in the  body politic after the strides made by newly freed slaves in engaging  in political discourse but that silence was caused by the tens of  thousands of singular and mass murders and lynchings that occurred  after the end of Reconstruction and continued well into the 20th  Century.   The 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre that killed hundreds of blacks is  another example of what a mob stirred by racial amanous can do to  African Americans who only crime was living a prosperous and  economically independent American Dream.   African American history has a long, painful and bloody path that  clearly exhibits how violent the Confederacy was, and we have fought a  cold civil war for over 156 years, which today is on the verge of  turning hot.   Evidence of the desperation of black people to escape the drudgery of  the south is evident by the greatest self migration of people within  the United States known as the Great Migration, which saw the  relocation of more than 6 million African Americans from the rural  South to the cities of the North, Midwest and West from about 1916 to  1970.   The push to leave family and communities in the south was motivated  by a deep desire to escape the yoke of the cold civil war; and the pull  to go to other parts of the nation was a chance to live free of fear,  which translated into black people who were allowed to pursue the  American Dream.   This is why for millions of Americans it was shameful, painful and a  disgrace that the Confederate battle flag was paraded in the Capitol of  the United States by Trump's motley band of disloyalists, something  that hundreds of  [[Page H576]]  thousands of true patriots gave the last full measure of devotion to  prevent in the crucible years of the civil war from 1861 to 1865.   The lynchings, beatings, rapes, burnings, joined with roadblocks to  advancements that would afford African American people basic human  rights such as fair wages, food, shelter, education, economic  opportunity, healthcare, due process and equal treatment under the law,  were denied for much of our history.   The goals of this cold civil war were simple: it was to end or  frustrate any effort by society to create a world where black people  are free and have full rights as citizens of the United States.   The threat of a hot civil war comes from the majority of Americans  accepting that African Americans have a place in America, and a right  to pursue the American Dream.   The shift in American values and views regarding race have come very  slowly with advances and setbacks until the passage of the Civil Rights  Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 created space and time to  reestablish voting rights for black voters that continues to be under  threat.   In this latter respect, the Insurrection of January 6 sought to  duplicate the Compromise of 1876 because in both cases adherents of  white supremacy sought to retain and monopolize political power by  disenfranchising and disempowering millions of black Americans,  throughout the South in 1876 and in the urban centers of Pennsylvania,  Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia in 2020.   The threat of a hot civil war stems from the fear of white  supremacists that a growing majority of Americans accept that African  Americans have an equal right and entitlement to the blessings of  liberty because they are full members of the American political  community.   January 6, 2021, was not the first time that white supremacists  attacked to overthrow duly elected white and black public officials. In  1898, in Wilmington, North Carolina and again in Colfax, Louisiana in  1873, the election of diverse slates of statewide candidates to public  office triggered violent white mobs to attack and murder newly elected  officials.   The Colfax Massacre, sometimes referred to euphemistically as the  Colfax Riot, occurred on Easter Sunday, April 13, 1873, in Colfax,  Louisiana, the seat of Grant Parish, where between 62 and 153 black men  were murdered by racist white vigilantes calling themselves a militia.   Three white men also died in the confrontation, with at least one  said to have been shot by his own ally.   In the wake of the contested 1872 election for governor of Louisiana  and local offices, a group of white Democrats armed with rifles and a  small cannon, overpowered Republican freedmen and black state militia  occupying the Grant Parish courthouse in Colfax.   Most of the freedmen were murdered after they surrendered; nearly 50  were killed later that night after being held prisoners for several  hours.   Estimates of the number of dead have varied, ranging from 62 to 153.  The exact number of black victims was difficult to determine because  many bodies were thrown into the Red River or mass gravesites.   Reconstruction ended in 1877 and by 1898 the protection afforded  newly freed slaves to participate as equal citizens in casting ballots  in public elections that allowed for the election of black and white  candidates ceased to exist.   White supremacists who ran as candidates in 1898, but lost their  elections used mob violence to take the offices from the duly elected  officials, sparking the Wilmington insurrection, also known as the  Wilmington Massacre of 1898 or the Wilmington Coup of 1898.   The similarities between what happened on January 6, and the events  of 1898 are striking in that both featured a mass riot and insurrection  carried out by white supremacists.   The mass riot carried out by white supremacists on January 6, 2021,  sought to overturn an election where black voters played a significant  role in electing Joseph Biden and Kamala Harris as President and Vice  President of the United States.   Furthermore, to add injury to their racist sensibilities, the  preceding day, January 5, 2021, the state of Georgia elected its first  African American and Jewish U.S. Senators during a special election.   Today, we see the potential for the 1898 level of violence against  the entire Congress, which has become the most diverse deliberative  body in our nation's history.   Since the attack, the FBI has identified more than 400 individuals  out of an estimated 800 who illegally entered the Capitol on January 6,  2021. As of January 27, 2021, the FBI's Washington Field Office has  confirmed that more than 150 criminal cases against those individuals  have been filed.   Although some reporting initially contradicted Justice Department  officials' public statements regarding aggressive efforts to charge all  those involved in the criminal activity, acting U.S. Attorney Michael  Sherwin reaffirmed the Department's commitment on January 26, 2021,  stating ``[r]egardless of the level of criminal conduct, we're not  selectively targeting or just trying to charge the most significant  crime . . . [i]f a crime was committed we are charging you, whether you  were outside or inside the Capitol.''   The long and blood history of white supremacy requires an approach  that holds individuals accountable for their actions as a means of  ending the lure of the mob as a tool of violence against targets of  interest.   Reports that cite that over a hundred current or former members of  the military were involved in the riot at the Capitol are shocking to  some.   Unfortunately, this aspect of white supremacist violence was evident  by violence committed by Proud Boys and Boogaloo adherents made clear  their objectives.   My efforts to focus the attention of the military on this link was  evident in an amendment I offered to the NDAA for FY2021 that was  adopted.   This Jackson Lee Amendment included in the House version of the NOAA  directed the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress the extent, if  any, of the threat to national security posed by domestic terrorist  groups and organizations motivated by a belief system of white  supremacy, such as the Boogaloo and Proud Boys extremists is reflected  in the Conference bill.   The NDAA conference identified that the FBI is under statutory  obligation, established by Section 5602 of the NDAA FY 2020 (Public Law  116-92), to complete a report that would better characterize the  domestic terrorist threat by requiring the FBI and the Department of  Homeland Security in consultation with the National Counterterrorism  Center (NCTC), to produce a set of comprehensive reports over 5 years.   The report is to include: a strategic intelligence threat internal to  the United States; metrics on the number and type of incidents, coupled  with resulting investigations, arrests, prosecutions and analytic  products, copies of the execution of domestic terrorism investigations;  detailed explanations of how the FBI, DHS and NCTC prioritize the  domestic terrorism threats and incident; and descriptions regarding the  type and regularity of training provided by the FBI, DHS, or NCTC to  other Federal, State and local law enforcement.   The conferees noted that the report has not been delivered to the  appropriate committees, and they urged the FBI Director to deliver the  report without delay.   The Jackson Lee Amendment to the NDAA FY 2021 sought the same  information that is required under the NDAA FY 2020 because of the  threat posed by accelerationists and militia extremists who comprise a  range of violent anti-government actors, movements and organizations,  some of which branch out of decades-old ideologies and others of which  are relatively new has led to violent engagement of law enforcement.   My concern is that in the aftermath of a historic national election,  the activity of violence influencers like Boogaloo Boys or Proud Boys  will increase and lead to attacks becoming more frequent.   In 2018, we saw too many instances of violent extremists searching  for opportunities to sow violence and disrupt democratic processes.   Boogaloo and Proud Boys are targeting constitutionally protected  activity for cooption or to provide cover for attacks.             honoring our 50-year legacy: our power, our message             List of Unfinished Business in the 117th Congress:    The work of the 117th Congress is just begun, but the list of  unfinished business is long:   Ending the COVID-19 by Ending Healthcare Disparities;   Passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act;   Criminal Justice Reform;   Funding to complete the restoration of a safe drinking water system  for Flint, Michigan;   Enactment of the John Lewis Voting Rights Act;   Immigration Reform.   The United States is a work in progress, as stated in the preamble to  the Constitution:         We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more       perfect Union, establish Justice, ensure domestic       Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the       general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to       ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this       Constitution for the United States.    African Americans have fought in every war this nation has faced  knowing that they were not afforded the same rights and freedoms of  white Americans.   We comprise thirteen percent of the population of the United States,  and yet experience a higher rate of incarceration, health disparities,  more vulnerable to economic slowdowns, and even more likely to get  COVID-19 and have much worse health outcomes.  [[Page H577]]    Disparities tell the story of living while black in America.   Disparities in maternity mortality, in the care we receive from  doctors when we are in pain caused by Sickle Cell anemia, or present  with serious symptoms like Ebola as was the case with Thomas Eric  Duncan who went to a Dallas Area hospital for treatment.   Disparities in the spread of COVID-19 are killing Black people at a  much higher rate than our percentage of the population in states  reporting demographic data.   Since that time, we have seen a pandemic sweep the country, taking  more than 500,000 souls in its wake and devastating the African  American community.   According to the latest estimates from the U.S. Centers for Disease  Control, Black people get COVID-19 at a rate nearly one and a half  times higher than that of white people, are hospitalized at a rate  nearly four times higher, and are three times as likely to die from the  disease.   Interestingly, a recent peer-reviewed study from Harvard Medical  School suggests that reparations for African Americans could have cut  COVID-19 transmission and infection rates both among Blacks and the  population at large.   Their analysis, based on Louisiana data, determined that if  reparations payments had been made before the COVID-19 pandemic,  narrowing the wealth gap, COVID-19 transmission rates in the state's  overall population could have been reduced by anywhere from 31 percent  to 68 percent.   I include in the Record an article detailing the results of a Harvard  Study that found that reparations for slavery could have reduced COVID- 19 infections and deaths in US from between 31-68 percent.   There are disparities in every aspect of African American life and  death.   Between 1980 and 2015, the number of people incarcerated in America  increased from roughly 500,000 to over 2.2 million.   Today, the United States makes up about 5 percent of the world's  population and has 21 percent of the world's prisoners.    1 in every 37 adults in the United States, or 2.7 percent of the  adult population, is under some form of correctional supervision.   In 2014, African Americans constituted 2.3 million, or 34 percent of  the total 6.8 million correctional population.   African Americans are incarcerated at more than 5 times the rate of  whites.   The imprisonment rate for African American women is twice that of  white women.   Nationwide, African American children represent 32 percent of  children who are arrested,   42 percent of children who are detained, and 52 percent of children  whose cases are judicially waived to criminal court.   Though African Americans and Hispanics make up approximately 32  percent of the US population, they comprised 56 percent of all  incarcerated people in 2015.   In African Americans and Hispanics were incarcerated at the same  rates as whites, prison and jail populations would decline by almost 40  percent.   We will have special orders throughout this Congress that can delve  more deeply in the aspect of live in America through discussions on  H.R. 40.   In 1989, Congressman John Conyers introduced ``The Commission to  Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act, which later  became known as H.R. 40, in remembrance of the Gen. Sherman's 1865  Special Field Order No. 15 to redistribute 400,000 acres of formerly  Confederate owned coastal land in South Carolina and Florida,  subdivided into 40 acre plots.   In 2019, I reintroduced an updated H.R. 40 entitled ``Commission to  Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act,''  noting that in the 30 years since the bill's original introduction,  sufficient evidence has been assembled to not just study but also  develop proposals for a remedy.   H.R. 40 allows for the first constructive scholarly conversation on  race that is clearly needed in the U.S. today and the ability to take a  moment in 250 years for a full discussion or analysis of economic,  political, psychological, scientific, and sociological effects of  slavery in the U.S. It acknowledges the fundamental injustice and  inhumanity of slavery in the U.S. and establishes a commission to study  and consider a national apology and proposal for reparations for the  institution of slavery, its subsequent racial and economic  discrimination against African Americans, and the impact of these  forces on living African Americans. The Commission is also charged to  make recommendations to Congress on appropriate remedies.   H.R. 40 follows the successful model of the reparations campaign for  Japanese-Americans interned during WWII. The campaign began with a 1980  congressional bill establishing a commission to investigate the  internment, evaluate and consider the amount and form reparations would  take, and make recommendations to the Congress for remedy. Based on the  Commission's findings, President Reagan signed into law the Civil  Liberties Act of 1988. The bill formally apologized to Japanese- Americans, authorized the payment of $20,000 to each Japanese-American  detention camp survivor; instituted a trust fund to educate Americans  about the suffering of the Japanese-Americans; and issued pardons to  all those who resisted detention camp internment.   The nation over the last twelve months has faced a crucible of  suffering, death, and disease that has taken too many lives, devastated  the economy, and put millions at risk of greater hardship due to the  death of a loved one, unemployment, loss of health care or forgone  education opportunities.   Hidden in these numbers are the health disparities that have plagued  African Americans for generations.   Today, with a heavy heart our nation sadly marks the loss of 500,000  American lives to the coronavirus: an unimaginable human toll in our  modern era of medical and technological advances. These deaths are of  staggering proportions and cause incomprehensible sadness, but we  cannot think of them as the end of COVID-19. As we have learned COVID- 19 can surge again claiming even more lives. This is why we cannot be  complacent or accepting of so much death without continuing to fight.   Every life lost is a profound tragedy and earth-shattering moment in  the lives of families, neighborhoods, and communities that touch each  of us in countless ways as we mourn and console our family members,  coworkers, neighbors and friends.   Today, I joined my colleagues of the House to observe a moment a  silence on the steps of the Capitol for the 500,000 lives lost. Members  of Congress joined Americans in prayer for the lives lost or devastated  by this vicious virus. As we pray, we must commit ourselves, in memory  of those we have lost, to wearing face coverings, observing social  distance, washing of hands-and most importantly getting the vaccine  when it is our time to do so as a pledge to all who have been taken  from us far too soon that we will act swiftly to put an end to this  pandemic and to stem the suffering felt by so many.   My commitment is to save lives and also livelihoods through public  and personal action. As Texans work to overcome the tragic winter  disaster that befell the state last week, I wrote to President Biden  asking that he grant the state's request for a Presidential Disaster  Declaration, which he did and today FEMA is on the ground providing  water delivery, food distribution, and other vital services to help  Texans get back on their feet.   I also encourage those who have lost health insurance during the  economic crisis created by COVID-19 pandemic to take advantage of the  extended enrollment period for getting health insurance through  healthcare.gov, which is open until May 15, 2021. Currently, 36 states  are using HealthCare.gov. Since President Biden announced the creation  of the Special Enrollment Period for HealthCare.gov, all 14 states and  D.C. that have their own state-based marketplaces have announced that  they would also have Special Enrollment Periods.   Questions about how justice is served to different communities in our  nation came into stark focus with the horrifying killing of George  Floyd on May 25, 2020 by a Minneapolis police officer, which shocked  and awakened the moral consciousness of the nation.   Untold millions have seen the terrifying last 8 minutes and 46  seconds of life drained from a black man, George Floyd, taking his last  breaths face down in the street with his neck under the knee of a  police officer who, along with his three cohorts, was indifferent to  his cries for help and pleas that he ``can't breathe.''   In direct response, civil protests against police brutality occurred  in cities large and small all across the nation.   It is clear that the times that we find ourselves in demand action,  and that is precisely what my colleagues in the Congressional Black  Caucus, on the House Judiciary Committee, and Congressional Democrats  did by introducing H.R. 7120, the Justice in Policing Act of 2020 in  the 116th Congress.   The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act will be reintroduced this  Congress to complete the work this nation has already begun in bringing  justice to the criminal justice system.   And every day, we use our power and our message to lift up these  important issues that are facing our nation, and we ask those who are  listening and watching to make these efforts your own.   Criminal Justice Reform is a pressing issue that Congress must  address.   As Judge Learned Hand observed, ``If we are to keep our democracy,  there must be one commandment: thou shalt not ration justice.''   Reforming the criminal justice system so that it is fairer and  delivers equal justice to all persons is one of the great moral  imperatives of our time.  [[Page H578]]    For reform to be truly meaningful, we must look at every stage at  which our citizens interact with the system--from policing in our  communities and the first encounter with law enforcement, to the  charging and manner of attaining a conviction, from the sentence  imposed to reentry and collateral consequences.   House Democrats, led by House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold  Nadler and myself, as Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, have accepted and  embraced the challenge of reforming the criminal justice system and  developed many innovative legislative remedies to correct many of the  most glaring inequities and racial disparities in the most critical  areas of the system.   This is an important topic and one that Congress must turn its  attention to with urgency and unity of effort to:   address the harms caused;   get an accounting of what happened;   understand how the water was poisoned;   make the lives of people damaged by this tragedy whole;   find justice for those lives that may have been lost; and   determine and provide for the long-term health needs of those  impacted.   Today, the water in Flint, Michigan is not safe to drink and we have  no concrete answer on when it may be safe to drink in the future.   Flint, Michigan like so many communities across the nation really  felt the brunt of the financial crisis created by the abuse of new home  lending practices and deceptive investment schemes that hid the  weaknesses in the economy until the great recession spread across the  nation beginning in late 2008.   The financial damage done to communities like Flint in the form of  steep declines in property values, which caused significant declines in  property tax income.   This was not just Flint's problem, but a national reality--for  financially strapped cities, towns, school boards, and municipal  governments who rely on Congress to fund all 12 Congressional  appropriations bills to provide them with much needed revenue to meet  the needs of their citizens.   In the 51 years since its passage on August 6, 1965, the Voting  Rights Act has safeguarded the right of Americans to vote and stood as  an obstacle to many of the more egregious attempts by certain states  and local jurisdictions to game the system by passing discriminatory  changes to their election laws or administrative policies.   In signing the Voting Rights Act on August 6, 1965, President Lyndon  Johnson said:         ``The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by       man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible       walls which imprison men because they are different from       other men.''    But on June 25, 2013, the Supreme Court decided Shelby County v.  Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA,  and paralyzed the application of the VRA's Section 5 preclearance  requirements, which protect minority voting rights where voter  discrimination has historically been the worst. Since 1982, Section 5  has stopped more than 1,000 discriminatory voting changes in their  tracks, including 107 discriminatory changes in Texas.   Although much progress has been made with regard to Civil Rights,  there is still much work to be done in order to prevent systemic voter  suppression and discrimination within our communities, and we must  remain ever vigilant and oppose schemes that will abridge or dilute the  precious right to vote.   H.R. 885, `VOTING RIGHTS AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2015,' of which I am an  original co-sponsor, repairs the damage done to the Voting Rights Act  by the Supreme Court decision and is capable of winning majorities in  the House and Senate and the signature of the President.   This legislation replaces the old `static' coverage formula with a  new dynamic coverage formula, or `rolling trigger,' which effectively  gives the legislation nationwide reach because any state and any  jurisdiction in any state potentially is subject to being covered if  the requisite number of violations are found to have been committed.   For millions of Americans, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is sacred  treasure, earned by the sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary  Americans who showed the world it was possible to accomplish  extraordinary things.   I want to thank my colleagues, Chairwoman Beatty of the CBC, and my  co-Anchor, Representative Torres, for participating in this Special  Order on these important topics.   [From the Harvard Civil Rights--Civil Liberties Law Review, June 10,                                   2020]                             Why We Can't Wait                               (By Mo Light)         In May 1920, Henry Scott, a middle-aged Negro, was working       as a Pullman porter in Florida when a mob seized and lynched       him because a white woman said he insulted her.[1] Scott said       that she had asked for his help arranging her seat on a train       while he was busy arranging another woman's seat. He asked       her to wait. The white woman called the police and told them       that Scott had insulted her. From there the story followed       the usual lynching pattern: A deputy sheriff arrested Scott       and then a white mob ``overpowered'' the deputy sheriff and       took Scott from police custody. The mob then riddled Scott       with ``forty or fifty bullets.''[2] The jury returned the       typical verdict: not guilty.[3]        Recently, another middle-aged Black man was working when he       was seized and lynched. George Floyd was lynched by police       officers after a store employee accused him of buying       cigarettes with counterfeit money. He protested to the store       employee that this was not true. But the teenage employee       refused to believe him and proceeded to call the police. From       there the story followed the all-too-common policing pattern:       Police officers who swore an oath to serve and protect       lynched a Black man while their colleagues stood by in       silence.        Two stories, one hundred years apart. In this time, America       has shot forward scientifically and technologically. America       put a man on the moon, found vaccines and cures for deadly       diseases, invented the computer, and revolutionized       technology. But throughout this time, America has left Black       Americans behind in the shadows. For Black Americans, too       little has changed in the last sixty or so years. They are       still dreaming that one day they will be judged by the       content of their character and not the color of their skin,       all while living through a constant nightmare. Henry Scott is       George Floyd and George Floyd is Henry Scott. And that is why       we can't wait.        Black Americans have been and will continue to be severely       disappointed with the slow pace of change. Before the Civil       War, Richard Allen, Robert Purvis, Frederick Douglass, and       many other Negro abolitionists and leaders were told to wait.       After Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in       1863, slaves still toiled the fields through at least       1865.[4]        The government promised the Negro ``forty acres and a       mule'' but instead gave the Negro ``separate but equal.''[5]       The Negro knew that in 1954 the Supreme Court called for the       desegregation of schools ``with all deliberate speed'' but       was met with all deliberate delay.[7] The Voting Rights Act       of 1965 has all but failed to live up to its potential.[7] In       2020, police officers are still disproportionality killing       Black people.[8] If we respond to this oppression with the       same methods we have used in the past, we will sing the same       chants, march through the same streets, and demand the same       justice in 20, 40, 60 years. For over 100 years we have heard       ``change will come.'' Words that consistently ring hallow.       The People must do everything they can to prevent another       innocent person from dying at the hands of the police or       white supremacists.        The idea that the People must engage radical methods of       change, change that accepts all action except violence as       legitimate, has generated a great deal of apprehension to       many Americans. But lest we forget our history, one should be       reminded that America's birth and continued existence is a       never-ending dance with radicalness and extremism. Ideas that       were once shunned as too radical are now lauded as examples       for others. Was not Patrick Henry an extremist: ``Give me       liberty or give me death.''[9] Was not the Declaration of       Independence radical when it stated that it is ``the Right of       the People to alter or abolish'' the government if it became       destructive to equality.[10] Our Founding Fathers listed in       the Declaration the King of England's crimes that spurred and       legitimatized the American Revolution--including the Crown's       ``protect[ion] of [his soldiers], by a mock Trial, from       punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the       Inhabitants of these States.''[11] Was it not Thomas       Jefferson who wrote to William Smith and said, ``what country       can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from       time to time that their people preserve the spirit of       resistance?''[12] Was not Abraham Lincoln called radical when       he said, ``I believe this government cannot endure,       permanently half slave and half free.''[13] And was not Dr.       King considered one of the most radical and most hated men in       America?[14] History has been kind to these men and so, too,       will history be kind to us.        Black Americans and their allies can't wait for perfect       adherence from their movement on how one should engage in       radical change. ``No revolution is executed like a       ballet[,]'' said Dr. King, ``[i]ts steps and gestures are not       neatly designed and precisely performed.''[15] There will be       violent elements in every revolution, but the majority of       those revolting are doing so nonviolently. And more       importantly, the oppressor is responsible for the violence of       the oppressed. The oppressor is responsible for the American       Revolution and the Civil Rights Movement. The Revolutions of       1848 were formed by ad hoc groups of the middle-class,       workers, and commoners. They did not act with perfect       discipline, but we nonetheless celebrate those radicals'       tenacity and vision.[16]        The necessity of Black Americans and their allies forming a       movement for radical change is difficult for many to swallow.       It is difficult because too many Americans do not understand       the centrality of radical change to American history. They       sit in the shade of trees they did not plant, warm themselves       by fires they did not light, and drink from wells they did       not dig.[17] They profit from persons they do not know, and       they build upon  [[Page H579]]       foundations that they did not lay.[18] But Black Americans       know this difficult truth: radical change is the only       acceptable change. They are keenly aware that their struggle       for equality and justice is a never-ending battle. Black       Americans are resentful because after all these years they       must constantly push for change or be pushed back into the       shadows. Black Americans are the seeds that go unwatered and       still rise. The soil not toiled but still fertile. You can't       ask us to be patient with change anymore or to play by your       rules because Black Americans have been patient from John       Castor to Henry Scott to George Floyd to ---- .

Dr. Peter S. Raible).        [18] Id.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the  distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Torres).    Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentleman very much  for his powerful words and his very prominent focus on the idea that  you are from the Bronx, but the spirit of the Bronx cannot be taken  from you, and that your commitment and your assessment of this country  will be defined in your way, not in the way of white supremacists,  domestic terrorists, or insurrectionists.   Madam Speaker, I think more than ever he has captured an important  moment by saying he has hope, and that is what the Congressional Black  Caucus represents for the millions of Americans that we represent. He  is right, our constituency is multicultural, they come from many  different perspectives, they are Black, they are African American--as  they may be desired to be called--they are Latinx, they are Hispanic,  they are Anglo, they are White, they are Southeast Asian, they are  Asian Pacific, they are LGBTQ, and they are varied. That is what we are  here today to stand for.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jones), a  distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee, among other  committees, and a scholar in his own right, a lawyer, and someone who  has been able to be trained in the ways of the law, but whose heart is  vested in the ways of justice. I am delighted to yield to my colleague  for his time on the floor in this wonderful momentous occasion.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Jones so very  much for that powerful statement. A powerful statement, obviously, a  lawyer's lawyer to bring to our attention the great leadership of  Justice Thurgood Marshall, civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall,  from a lawyer whom we know will continue to promote justice now as a  legislator.   Madam Speaker, I want to take a moment to just put in the Record  really the historical description of the Congressional Black Caucus.   Since its establishment in 1971, the Congressional Black Caucus has  been committed to using the full constitutional power, statutory  authority, and financial resources of the Federal Government to ensure  that Black Americans and other marginalized communities in the United  States have the opportunity to achieve the American Dream.   As part of this commitment, the CBC has fought in the past 50 years  to empower citizens and address their legislative concerns by nursing a  policy agenda that is inclusive, pragmatic, effective, and resonates  with the American people.   Just for a moment, I would like to comment on the dangerous  interrelatedness of race and the insurrectionist day of January 6.   We are on the floor because we have a unique history. We are a  multiranged people and a multicultural people. We are individuals whose  heritage is intertwined with other backgrounds. We are African  Americans. We are Caribbean Americans. And in terms of African  Americans, we are Caribbean Blacks, if you will. We come from all over  the world, but we come to America and we are described by a singular  history.   And if we have come with a singular history, I think it is important  to intertwine what happened on January 6. Shockingly, Madam Speaker,  those who came to object--so they say--to the duly qualified and  legitimate election of President Joe Biden and, of course, Vice  President Harris, they, of course, came allegedly with that  proposition. But, at the same time, I am stunned by the words of a  police officer by the name of Mr. Harry Dunn--courageous and brave with  so many others--who indicated: The rioters called me the n-word dozens  of times.   So here we are 50 years celebrating the Congressional Black Caucus.  Here we are defenders of democracy. Many of our Members are former  members of the United States military, having gone into battle, or our  family members have. Many fell in as early a war as World War I, World  War II, the Korean war, the Vietnam war, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and  other wars in between. We shed our blood for this country.   And the so-called people who came and said they just wanted some  democracy, they believed that their candidate won, but they took enough  time to call the sons and daughters of enslaved Africans, who wear the  uniform defending democracy, the n-word.   They took time to carry a fake flag, calling it the Confederate flag  when it is a symbol in the 1960s of the harshness and brutality of  segregation and the Klan. They took time to bring that flag to the  United States Congress, in the midst of the highest number of elected  persons of color, persons who are descendants in many different ways of  enslaved Africans.   But here I wanted to mention Mr. Dunn's name. There were many others  who were beaten that day. I honor them, and we will honor them as time  goes. This night, tonight, we mention this gentleman who said most  powerfully--Harry Dunn recalled the sickening events of January 6--when  he says that the level of racist abuse he suffered caused him to break  down in tears, but he was not broken. His quote was: ``Y'all failed.''   That is my message today. All of the brutality that we may have  experienced, which I will talk about in a moment, all of it failed.  That is why we are here today fighting in the Education and Labor  Committee; fighting in the Science, Space, and Technology Committee;  fighting in the Ways and Means Committee; fighting in the Energy and  Commerce Committee; the Judiciary; the Interior; the Armed Services  Committee; the Oversight and Reform Committee; and the Budget  Committee, where you will see our presence.   We are fighting for America, but we are the conscience that drives  the reality that there are more people to be concerned about than those  of us in this Chamber. That there are mothers and father who work every  day, who don't see the fruit of their labor. There are children who  clamor for education, but it is not there.   There are soldiers who need to have the line of hierarchy and the  route to promotion and elevation, who don't get it. There are  businesspersons who have brilliant ideas, but can't access the capital.  There are incarcerated persons who are not guilty, but are still  incarcerated.   There are doors of college institutions closed. There are people who  want to do better with a new house, but still, in the 21st century, are  redlined. And there are many who want to go places and cannot go, who  are African American.   No, we are not complaining. We are trying to explain how much has  been done by people who have had this kind of history. It is important  to take note of that.   Madam Speaker, may I have the time remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Torres), if he will carry forth.    Madam Speaker, my coanchor has very powerfully  captured the many heroes in our community, historical heroes as well,  and heroes who pushed against the edge, walked right up to the line,  never failed to be courageous, never failed to work on behalf of people  who were voiceless and powerless.   Harriet Tubman was that woman. She was General Moses, and she told  slaves that it was not going to be their task to stop along the  railroad, they were going to get to their destination--and I guess she  was a little harsh--dead or alive.   That is the push of the Congressional Black Caucus. We are not  violent people, so I won't say dead or alive. But we are consistently  engaged in pushing the envelope, pushing the margins, and pushing the  conscience of this Congress led certainly over a huge number of years  by the late John Robert Lewis and John Conyers, who headed the  Judiciary Committee and fought against every civil rights injustice.   So many leaders. As I indicated, Shirley Chisholm, who ran for the  Presidency. And Barbara Jordan, who sat on the impeachment committee as  a young Member and said, We, the People. She denied any right of anyone  to undermine the Constitution.                                time  2115    Her voice was strong and powerful. I am glad to call her my mentor  and my predecessor.   And so I just want to give these words. I want to capture some words  here on that insurrection.   Everyone knew the outcome of the 2020 Presidential election long  before January 6, 2021. We also knew that the States had gone to a lot  of traversing, even they were sued, and they still came back as each  State leader said, no fraud: This is the outcome.   Because of the transparency of each State's election administration  and that of the joint meeting of Congress, it would simply confirm that  Joe Biden had won more than a majority of the electoral votes along  with winning the national popular vote by more than seven million  votes.   We all know that this was a historic election; more votes than we had  ever counted, I believe, in the history of the United States. There was  such a sense of exhilaration because democracy was alive. There were so  many young people that voted. So many people of the potpourri of  America, all backgrounds.   We felt so good about voting together, many of us voting the same way  for the same candidate, as evidenced by his victory. States that we had  lost 4 years ago, enthusiastically voting for change, for goodness, for  a spirit of unity. We knew something was on the horizon.   But isn't it interesting that after that election, for months, people  had been told a complete lie, which allowed them to stay in places that  we did not know and conspire to come and attack this place, this holy  place, this place of democracy, this place that has, Madam Speaker,  above you, In God We Trust.   They attacked this place and the riot came immediately after then- President Trump promoted a march on the Capitol and called his  supporters to stop the steal; never give up; never concede, and to  fight like hell, during a speech that day, asserting that they would  not have a country anymore if they did not act.   I read these into our message of our power hour message, 50 years of  the Congressional Black Caucus, because I think history will tell.  Reading the annals of the Congressional Record, you will see that  members of the Congressional Black Caucus, when they were tiny, until  we have expanded, have consistently gone to the floor on questions of  justice and expanding opportunity and ensuring that justice is a  respecter of color or age or region. We fight for justice no matter  what the color of your skin, what your background is.   We are purists as it relates to justice. We love the Constitution,  because--even though we were three-fifths of a person, we were not a  human being when it was finalized--it was a document that grew and  continues to breathe rights, from the First Amendment to the 13th  Amendment, 14th Amendment, 15th Amendment, to the right for women to  vote, to the amendments that deal with a right to a trial by jury, to  the Fifth Amendment, due process, and the protection of your property.  These are all breathing documents and words, breathing amendments that  have allowed a people who were in bondage to scrap their way out of the  devastation of hatred. We use this Constitution.   But shamefully, that fight has to continue. And on January 6, that  fight, that scab was torn off again. That rug was burning again. Those  who came to say that they were fighting for Trump and fighting to  overturn the election, but more importantly, they are fighting because  the election was theirs, they called a Black officer the N word more  times than he can remember, caused him to break down, among others. And  he had the courage to say, all that they tried to do failed.   Let me just show these depictions of our journey. I will start with  this one. This year, 2021, is the 100th anniversary--I hate to even use  that term--of the Tulsa riot. Allegedly, a young Black man in an  elevator was alleged to have touched a White woman. I think when he  finally got out of the elevator it was alleged rape, or it was rape, a  typical story, over and over again.   That is why we have such pain for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor,  Walter Scott, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin, Ahmaud Arbery, Pamela Turner,  Sandra Bland, Jacob Blake, and Elijah McClain in Colorado, and names  beyond, Sean Bell, Eric Garner, the mothers who have become friends,  Michael Brown, that is why we have such pain.   And I guess my constituent--the family that has become America's  family, along with all the other mothers and fathers--George Floyd grew  up in Houston, Texas, in the Cuney Homes, public housing. His mother  was the queen of public housing, took in children, fed children. They  felt like they were at home in the Floyd family.   Big George is what he was called. Big man. Took his brothers and  sisters under his wing. George Floyd played basketball--my recollection  is--in China with Yao Ming when they were young players, not pros. We  never know who someone is.   So this is the 100th anniversary of probably some of the likes of  those names that I called. Life cut down.   And this depiction is Captured Negroes on way to Convention Hall  during the Tulsa race riot. They were captured. There was no justice.  300 Negroes, Black Americans were buried in an unmarked grave, as we  are told. This is how it was. This is how it was. This is how it was.   The Congressional Black Caucus will be commemorating that this year.  And I will introduce legislation with Senator Warren, on the Tulsa race  riots next week.   4,000, 4,000-plus Blacks were hung. And as you can see, there were  smiling faces in the crowd. It was entertainment. Come to the town  square.   No, this is not a depiction of some dastardly person who did violent  acts and raided through the community. This could have been someone  walking along a dark road. It could have been the three boys in  Mississippi during the civil rights movement; they were just driving,  trying to get to their destination.   These folks could have been walking. We had one woman who had a  dispute with a storekeeper. She was a businesswoman. She was ultimately  hung; never came back home. The family was looking for where she might  be.  [[Page H582]]    It looks like another celebratory occasion, hanging. We will hear  more of this when we proceed to discuss our commission to study and  develop reparation proposals.    But let me--before I yield to my good friend and co-anchor, I just  want you to see this one. This gentleman's name was--I am going to call  him Mr. Gordon. He is a slave--was a slave, deceased. And clearly,  those are markings of a very bad beating. But that is not the end of  his story.   This gentleman came out of slavery and fought in the Civil War on  behalf of the Union. This is what we did. We always rise to the  occasion.   You will hear more about our story. But I wanted to make sure that we  just got a sense of how we have been overcomers. But even with being  overcomers, we know there is more to do.   Madam Speaker, I am very delighted to be able to yield to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Williams), and she is, in her own right,  a leader, a new member of this body, has civil rights in her blood, she  is a mother, and she is here ready to fight for our children's  education and she will succeed.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her words  and certainly her powerful words on the importance of our Vice  President, the Honorable Vice President Harris. We are grateful for  her.   It is my pleasure to yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Torres), my co-anchor.                                time  2130     Madam Speaker, we are humbled by the gentleman's  words. We are humbled by this moment in history.   I will conclude my remarks by building on Congressman Torres', that  we are humbled, but we are honored, but we are ready to work.   I will leave you with these words from our colleague and others. John  Lewis said we are in a very difficult time in our country. I am afraid  we may wake up one day in America, and our democracy is gone. But he  went on to say that when you see something that is not right, say  something, do something, get into good trouble.   One of our ancient fathers, Frederick Douglass, said that there is no  power without struggle.   Tonight, we have laid the landscape of genius, contributions,  sacrifice, brilliance, and the commitment to civil rights that is the  Congressional Black Caucus. Our message, our power, Our Power, Our  Message. We will continue to work. We will not yield, not give in, not  give out, and not give up.   Madam Speaker, let me thank my colleagues for joining the CBC Special  Order tonight, and I thank the Speaker.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
