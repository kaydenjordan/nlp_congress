 Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of National Mentoring  Month and in recognition of the great contributions that mentors make  to young people and to communities across the country.   Every young person deserves and needs a mentor, someone with  experience and perspective to help them overcome challenges and  navigate uncertainties. I would not be here today without the guidance  that I received from my mentors, including Supreme Court Justice and  former Mayor Frank Flaherty, former Mayor Joe Walsh, the late State  Senator Eleanor Slater, and the late Senator Claiborne Pell.   Mentorships like these can be life-changing, and I applaud  organizations like MENTOR Rhode Island, which pairs mentors with at- risk youth. Vulnerable young people with mentors are more likely to  maintain better attendance and positive attitudes toward school, and  they are 55 percent more likely to go to college than their peers.   Mr. Speaker, it is with deep appreciation for my mentors and the  power of mentoring that I recognize January as National Mentoring  Month.                            ____________________
