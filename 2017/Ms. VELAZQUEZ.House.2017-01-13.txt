 I rise in strong opposition to this resolution. Mr.  Chairman, if Republicans go forward with this plan to dismantle the  Affordable Care Act, 30 million Americans will lose health insurance.  In New York State alone, 1.6 million of our neighbors--who gained  coverage through ACA--will lose their health insurance and will see  their health insurance taken away, and 2.7 million New Yorkers who have  enrolled in Medicaid could lose coverage.   But this is not just about Medicaid, and it is not just about who  obtained coverage through the exchanges. This is about the young person  just out of college who can stay on their parents' insurance until they  turn 26, giving them time to secure employment and coverage on their  own. It is about patients with preexisting conditions who, until the  ACA, were blocked from securing quality medical insurance. It is about  women who have faced gender discrimination in the insurance market.  These are the people Republicans will harm with their irresponsible  attack on our healthcare system.   Now, let me also note this: the Republican slogan, repeal and  replace, is a sham. What are they going to replace the ACA with? They  have never, not once, put together a realistic, defensible plan to  replace the ACA. Their plan should be called repeal and displace  because it will displace millions of Americans from their health  coverage. Reject repeal and displace. Vote ``no'' on this bill.
