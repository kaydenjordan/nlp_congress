 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, elections have consequences. Our fellow Americans used  their vote to choose who will work for them. So I ask you all a simple  question--especially to my colleagues: Is that what is happening here  today?   Are we gathered in these final moments, before we depart for a week,  to fund our government or to pay our troops?   Are we gathered today to approve a new trade deal? Or are we gathered  to debate the critical national security issues regarding China or  Iran?   That answer would be unanimously ``no.'' We are not working for the  American people.                                time  1045    Those items would resemble the achievements of a productive Congress,  a Congress that truly works for the people.   But do you know what this Congress counts?   This Congress' record is more subpoenas than laws. That is the  legacy. It is not just devoid of solutions for the American people; it  is now abusing its power to discredit democracy.   By using secret interviews and selective leaks to portray the  President's legitimate actions as an impeachable offense, Democrats are  continuing their permanent campaign to undermine his legitimacy.   For the last 3 years, they have predetermined the President's guilt,  and they have never accepted the voters' choice to make him President.  So for 37 days and counting, they have run an unprecedented,  undemocratic, and unfair investigation. This resolution today only  makes it worse.   I have heard Members on the other side say they promise rights to the  President, but only if he does what they want. That is the equivalent  of saying in the First Amendment that you have the right to the freedom  of speech, but you can only say the words I agree with. That is what  you call due process, Madam Speaker.   The amendment offered by my colleague, Mr. Cole, would help correct  some of the transparency concerns we have witnessed over the last few  weeks. But today is about more than the fairness of the impeachment  process. It is about the integrity of our electoral process. Democrats  are trying to impeach the President because they are scared they cannot  defeat him at the ballot box. Those are not my words. Those are the  words from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have  offered impeachment three different times.   This impeachment is not only an attempt to undo the last election, it  is an attempt to influence the next one as well.   This is not what Democrats promised when they entered the majority 11  months ago. In this Chamber, we heard from our Speaker. While we all  sat here, we heard what the Speaker said when she talked about words of  optimism and cooperation.   It was said that we would work together to make America stronger,  more secure, and more prosperous. We were told our mission was to  return power to the people. In fact, our new colleagues on the other  side of the aisle were sent to Washington with a mandate to do just  that.   So what has happened?   There is nothing like that today.   Not long ago, Democrats recognized that a partisan impeachment would  put politics over people and harm our Nation.   That exact same Speaker talked about cooperation and talked about and  promised the American people that they would be different if you  trusted them with the majority.   Madam Speaker, you have failed in that promise.   That Speaker said: ``Impeachment is so divisive to the country that  unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and  bipartisan''--the word bipartisan--``I don't think we should go down  that path, because it divides the country.''   What has changed since those words have been spoken?   Alexander Hamilton wrote that:         There will always be the greatest danger that the decision       to use the impeachment power would be driven by partisan       animosities instead of real demonstrations of innocence or       guilt.    This sham impeachment by Democrats has proven Hamilton right, and it  betrays the Speaker's own words.  [[Page H8695]]    I know emotions are high. I know Members would even run for positions  of chair simply on the fact that they would be a better chair for  impeachment right after the election. But when we all stood that day  and listened to the words of the Speaker of cooperation, we all raised  our hand to uphold the Constitution.   Tomorrow is November 1. We are 1 year away from an election, not just  for this House but for the highest office of Presidency.   Madam Speaker, why do you not trust the people?   Why do you not allow the people to have a voice?   Why, in a process that America lends their voice to all of us, do you  deny us the opportunity to speak for them?   Has animosity risen that high?   Has Hamilton been proven correct again?   Madam Speaker, there is a moment in time that you should rise to the  occasion. This is that moment. This is the moment that history will  write. History will ask you, Madam Speaker, when you cast this vote to  justify something that has gone on behind closed doors, I want you to  ask the historian and answer the question: What do you know that  happened there?   Madam Speaker, have you read anything that took place that you just  justified?   What do you believe the definition of ``due process'' is?   What do you think the First Amendment is, that you have the right to  have a voice or only say the words that you agree with?   Madam Speaker, you may get elected in a primary, but in a general  election, you are elected to represent the people of America, not to  deny their voice.   This House is so much better than what is transforming today. I  believe everyone who runs for this office runs to solve a problem. But  when you go back to the American public with the achievement of more  subpoenas than laws, that is not why you ran. That is not why we are  here.   That is why I agree with my colleague, Mr. Cole, who believes in the  power of the people and people before politics, that we believe and  know we can do better, that we believed the Speaker when she spoke  about cooperation, we believed her when she said that if you trusted  them with the majority then they would be different.   Madam Speaker, I guess it is only fitting you take this vote on  Halloween.
