 Madam President.    Madam President, I am reserving the right to object.   I want to speak today on behalf of my amendment, Risch No. 4794,  which is not included on that list, which I have introduced with  cosponsors Senators Portman, Cruz, Barrasso, Johnson, Cotton, Daines,  and Wicker.   This amendment is the Senate companion to bipartisan language that  already is included in the House-passed NDAA which would sanction Nord  Stream 2, Putin's premier energy weapon against Ukraine and Europe.   The timing could not be more important. Ukraine stands on the brink  of an invasion, and Europe is in the throes of an energy crisis created  by Russia.   There is a reason Ukraine's President Zelensky tweeted an urgent  request last week regarding this amendment, which said:         [A]ll friends of Ukraine and Europe in the US Senate       [should] back this amendment.    We are now seeing the consequences of the administration's decision  to waive mandatory PEESA sanctions and refusal to impose CAATSA  sanctions.   Russia has deliberately cut gas transmission to Europe through  Ukraine and is using high energy prices to pressure the EU into  approving Nord Stream 2 as quickly as possible. Putin has publicly  stated as such.   Meanwhile, Russian forces have built up along the border of Ukraine  in preparation for what could be a full-scale invasion, just as they  did to the Crimea.   Remember, Nord Stream 2 is designed to replace Ukraine's gas transit  system, meaning Russia no longer has to worry about destroying its own  infrastructure in the event of full-scale war.   We cannot allow Putin's blackmail to succeed. Nord Stream 2 has  always been a bipartisan issue here in the Senate, and it should  continue to be. Not a single Member of Congress supports the completion  of this pipeline. I would like to think a similar number of us don't  think we should ignore our friends in Europe, particularly Central and  Eastern Europe, who stand to lose the most from Nord Stream 2.   Our amendment would impose mandatory sanctions against Nord Stream 2  AG, the company responsible for the project, as well as the companies  involved in testing and certifying the pipeline before it can become  operational.   We do provide the administration with a pathway to lifting these  targeted sanctions, pending, of course, congressional review. This  pathway is the exact same process for congressional input that 98  Senators voted for in CAATSA just a few years ago.   Nord Stream 2 is not set to become operational for months so there is  still time to stop it, but we need to act quickly.   I urge my colleagues to join our distinguished colleagues in the  House of Representatives on this important endeavor and to vote yes on  this amendment.   Therefore, I ask unanimous consent to modify the request of the  distinguished Senator Reed and include my amendment No. 4794.    I object.    Madam President, I object.
