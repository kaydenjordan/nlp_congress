 Mr. Speaker, let me state a simple fact that has evidently  been forgotten in Washington: The Federal workforce's primary  imperative should always be to promptly serve the American people.   Unfortunately, what the American people have experienced over the  past 2 years is the exact opposite of what they deserve. Thanks to the  Federal Government's pandemic-era telework policies which were  instituted by bureaucrats in Washington, delay and disarray might as  well have become hallmarks of Federal agencies and departments.   According to a Federal Times report from October of last year, just  one in three Federal workers has returned to his or her office in a  full-time capacity. It is abundantly clear that something must change,  and House Republicans have the solution.   Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased to serve as a cosponsor of  H.R. 139, the SHOW UP Act, that is sponsored by Oversight and  Accountability Committee Chairman   James Comer. Under this  legislation, the Biden administration would be prevented from cementing  pandemic-era telework policies for the Federal workforce until it  provides Congress with a viable plan to avoid the negative impacts of  remote work.   Yet again, House Republicans are acting on our commitment to the  American people to ensure a government that is accountable.   Mr. Speaker, it is time that the entire Federal workforce returns to  its in-person capacity and fulfills its responsibilities to the  American people. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 139.
