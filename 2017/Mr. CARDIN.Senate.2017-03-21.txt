 Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to  extend my appreciation to a dedicated public servant at the  Congressional Research Service, CRS, of the Library of Congress, Ms.  Nina M. Serafino. Ms. Serafino recently retired after more than 35  years of service to Congress. This length of public service is not only  a credit to Ms. Serafino, but also a demonstration of the dedication  that she and many other CRS employees bring to support our work here in  Congress.   During Ms. Serafino's 35 years with CRS, she provided Congress with  many types of assistance to help inform national policymaking on a  variety of war and peace issues. From 1981, when she joined CRS,  through the 1980s, she was deeply involved in bipartisan efforts to  evaluate U.S. policy in Central America. Her work focused on providing  a common understanding of the problems and possibilities in the region  in order to shape U.S. options and alternatives. Particularly  noteworthy was her original research on aspects of the Central American  conflicts where there was a little or no information available from  other sources. Responding to a congressional request, she conducted  field research and delved into the Library of Congress's historical  materials to provide a unique report on the many parties of the civic  opposition to the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. Similarly, her  field research on the Latin American ``Contadora'' effort significantly  informed congressional deliberations regarding the peace process to end  the conflicts in Nicaragua and El Salvador.   With the advent of U.S. military involvement in peacekeeping  operations in the Balkans and elsewhere beginning in the 1990s, Ms.  Serafino contributed to congressional efforts to comprehend the  plethora of institutional and budgetary considerations relevant to our  government's ability to bring its full toolbox to bear in those  operations. Providing information and analysis through reports,  briefings, and several comprehensive conferences and workshops for  Members and staff, Ms. Serafino assisted Congress in understanding the  possibilities, constraints, and options for legislating and overseeing  military and civilian tools and the development of interagency  resources and mechanisms.   As Congress sought to comprehend and deal with the post-9/11 world,  Ms. Serafino supplemented targeted CRS work on Afghanistan and Iraq  with conferences and reports that brought an historical perspective to  congressional deliberations. The conferences and reports provided  insights on a wide variety of international experiences in dealing with  terrorism and contained historical information and pertinent analysis  on previous U.S. interventions and occupations.   Over the past decade, Ms. Serafino also developed a number of  products on security assistance and cooperation. Most recently, as the  U.S. Government has expanded U.S. military efforts to build partner  capacity among foreign security forces worldwide, Ms. Serafino  contributed an historical perspective on U.S. security assistance and  cooperation development in the post-World War II period to inform our  deliberations on an evolving legislative framework for such assistance.  Her written work on post-9/11 topics has enlightened both Congress and  the broader foreign policy and defense communities.   Throughout Ms. Serafino's career, she won the respect and admiration  of her colleagues for her geniality and expertise on Latin America and  international security affairs. She won a Distinguished Service Award  and several Merit Service and Special Achievement awards. Her steadfast  dedication to serve Congress and her commitment to the highest  standards of research made a lasting contribution to congressional  policy discourse. I have said many times that the Federal workforce is  a critical national asset. Ms. Serafino and the other talented and  dedicated public servants at CRS are yet another example. While we will  miss her contributions, I know my colleagues will want to join me in  sending our best wishes to Ms. Serafino for a happy retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the three  decades of distinguished service journalist Steve Hammond has provided  to the citizens of Maryland's Eastern Shore and the viewers of WBOC-TV  16 in Salisbury, MD, ``Delmarva's News Leader.''   Steve Hammond is a Maryland native, raised in Towson's Rodgers Forge  neighborhood. He learned many of life's lessons on the football and  lacrosse fields before graduating from the University of Delaware with  a degree in mass communications. Since his mother, sister, and brother  have all been involved in television production, it is no surprise,  perhaps, that Steve gravitated toward the business of broadcasting and  interned for several stations. He discovered he felt most at home in  the newsroom and was drawn particularly to the variety of daily  reporting. In 1985, after working without pay for 2 weeks to illustrate  his potential value, Steve was hired by WHYY, a  [[Page S1888]]  PBS affiliate in Philadelphia, PA. Two years later, on March 23, 1987,  he joined WBOC-TV to serve as the first bureau chief for Dover, DE. It  was there that he first began to anchor news broadcasts. It was a role,  it turned out, which suited him perfectly.   Today Steve Hammond is WBOC-TV's main anchor and managing editor. He  has become a household name in the region, having covered countless  elections, major crisis, and natural disasters. Steve has flown with  the Blue Angels and interviewed U.S. Presidents. He also has filed  reports from several foreign countries to tell the stories of local  troops in harm's way in Iraq and Somalia. Steve is highly respected in  his field and has been widely recognized, winning innumerable awards,  including a prestigious national Edward R. Murrow Award and  distinctions from the Associated Press and Radio Television News  Directors Association; yet Steve is characteristically modest about his  accomplishments. If he were inclined to brag about anything, it  probably would be about his beloved family--his sons Graham and Hunter,  and his wife, Heather, who are his favorite companions for a day at the  beach.   Steve Hammond is deeply invested in his community and has volunteered  for many years for numerous charitable organizations, including Junior  Achievement, March of Dimes, Easter Seals, Big Brothers/Big Sisters and  The Salvation Army. He has helped spearhead The Salvation Army's Red  Kettle Holiday Campaign on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. He also  serves as a member of the board of trustees for Worcester Preparatory  School in Berlin, MD, and is a member of Trinity United Methodist  Church in Salisbury. Steve's coworkers, friends, and audience  appreciate the dedication, service, and leadership he shown  professionally and privately throughout his career. As he enters his  fourth decade at WBOC-TV 16, I ask my colleagues to join me in  congratulating Steve Hammond on 30 years of exemplary work and  community service and wishing him all the best in the years  ahead.                            ____________________
