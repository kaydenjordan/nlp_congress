 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my  uncle, Jerry Clark, who, sadly, passed away on May 5 at the age of 88.   Uncle Jerry was born and raised in Des Moines, Iowa, and graduated  from Johnstone High School in 1950. Soon after, he was drafted in the  U.S. Army and served until 1955. Following his discharge, he was a Des  Moines firefighter, retiring after 33 years of service. And while  working for the fire department, he also worked for Sears, and he  retired from Sears after 30 years.   He will be remembered for his kindness, his vibrant smile, and for  the love of his grandchildren.   I got a chance to see my Uncle Jerry back in August of 2019. And  before that, it was back in 1999, at my mom--his sister--my mom,  Sally's, funeral.   It is a sorrow loss for our family and everyone who had the pleasure  of knowing him. My wife, Shannon, our kids and I send our thoughts and  prayers to my Aunt Jeannene; my cousins Craig, Kevin, Jonathan; his  grandchildren Kaleb, Kayla, Rose, and Sterling; and his sister, my Aunt  Joyce.   Uncle Jerry, may you rest in peace.                            ____________________
