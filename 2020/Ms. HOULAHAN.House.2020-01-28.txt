 Madam Speaker, when I rise for women and girls around  the world, I do so with the awareness that the barriers that we face do  not exist in a vacuum, that a woman's right to education, to bodily  autonomy, and to self-determination are all connected. To combat these  barriers, we must enact comprehensive legislation that relies on years  of data, studies, and advocacy efforts to establish a truly equal world  across gender lines.   According to UN Women, every additional year of primary school  increases girls' eventual wages by 10 to 20 percent. It also encourages  them to marry later, to have fewer children, and leaves them less  vulnerable to violence.   In our effort to achieve gender parity, it is crucial that we work  with international partners and global organizations that are making  great progress on this issue. Initiatives like the U.N. Joint Program  to End Child Marriage are looking at this issue holistically, with the  understanding that social protection, health, education, and social and  behavioral change must all be addressed in order to spark sustainable  changes for women and girls around the world. That is why I cosponsored  the Keeping Girls in School Act, which would empower girls by  increasing their educational opportunities and economic security.   Girls and women deserve to be educated, to be economically  independent, and to be the deciders of their own fate, and that is what  we believe in the United States, and that is what we need to fight for  in all corners of this world. I encourage all of my colleagues on both  sides of this aisle to join me and to take a stand for women and girls  across the globe.   The first step on the path to a more peaceful world starts with the  empowerment of women and girls. A vote for the Keeping Girls in School  Act is a vote for equality, for empowerment, and for a safer and more  prosperous world for us all.    Madam Speaker, I thank the majority leader for bringing  us together this evening to talk about the economy.   January was Jobs Month for me in my district and my team. I spent  time home in my community in Pennsylvania and here in Washington  focused on three things: one, making sure that our economy is working  for everyone and that Pennsylvanians can afford to live where they work  and pay their bills while receiving fair pay; two, supporting our small  businesses, which are the backbone of our economy; and three, ensuring  our workforce is adapting to new technologies and to the future of  their work.                                time  1730    Earlier this month, we got the jobs report from December, and there  was a  [[Page H614]]  lot to be optimistic about. Unemployment rates remain low, and we added  more than 300,000 nonfarm jobs.   The administration also likes to point to the record-high stock  market as an indication of the impact of its economic policies. To be  sure, there are good signs, and this steady economic improvement began  well before the President and his administration took office and,  thankfully, it continues.   With this in mind, I would like to share, though, what I saw and  heard during Jobs Month in my community.   My community is in the enviable position of having a very low  unemployment rate. I hear more from employers who are struggling to  fill empty positions than from long-term unemployed people who are  looking for work.   But that doesn't tell the whole story. The rosy jobs report from  January doesn't tell the story of people who work in my community, or  who would like to, but can't afford to even live there.   Last week, I was in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, meeting with  affordable housing advocates and proponents for more mass transit  options near those affordable housing options. During that visit, I  learned that in our area, about a quarter of the people are renters.   Working an average wage for renters, a 9-5 job is not nearly enough  for a modest, two-bedroom home in my community. People are working  extra hours, holding down two jobs or more to be able to afford to live  where they work; or they are living elsewhere, where the cost of living  is lower, and they are commuting ridiculous amounts of time, using  inadequate road and rail infrastructure to get to their work. And they  are losing precious time with their families in the process.   A booming stock market is good for some, but it doesn't change the  daily math and daily experience of so many people in my community.   The House has passed legislation to raise the minimum wage and to  help workers save for retirement, and we need to see action in the  Senate to ensure that our economy is working for all Americans, not  just for those who have enough money to invest in the stock market.   Earlier this month, many in my community also celebrated progress on  the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal that was important for  many small businesses in my community, including our agricultural  producers. I was very proud to support that agreement.   But this administration's trade policies have also harmed my  community. The trade war in China has hurt small businesses as well as  larger manufacturers whose business models are built around global  trade in my community.   Although we now have a ``Phase 1'' deal with China, businesses in my  community are eager for a real and lasting agreement that doesn't harm  the American businesses in an effort to punish China.   Madam Speaker, I also want to highlight just one other aspect of the  January jobs report that stuck out to me. Just like here in Congress,  women are entering the workforce at historic rates. Like so many women,  and men, frankly, I have faced the real struggles of how to balance  both raising a family and excelling at work. Our policies need to be  adopted to support and encourage our changing workforce.   We have shown that we can work on a bipartisan basis to enact paid  parental leave, as an example, for Federal workers, setting the example  for other employers.   We need to examine how we provide for childcare for working parents.  We need how to examine how to ensure that pregnant workers have  protections if they need an accommodation in the job during their  pregnancy. And we need to ensure that we are paying equal pay for equal  work. All of these policies can help move our economy forward, and all  deserve the attention of our Senate and our counterparts in the White  House.   Over the last few weeks, I have learned a lot by visiting  manufacturing facilities in my community, like OmegaFlex in Exton,  Pennsylvania, or laying tile at the Chester County Intermediate Unit,  or working alongside the IBEW workers training newly-separated veterans  for work.   I have come away deeply optimistic about where we are headed, but  also armed with motivation to move forward with the bold policies that  we need to make sure our economy is working for everyone, for all of  us, to support our small businesses, and to prepare our workforce for  the future ahead. There certainly is work to be done.
