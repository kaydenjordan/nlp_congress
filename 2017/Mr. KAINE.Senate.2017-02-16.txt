 Mr. President, I also rise to oppose the nomination of  Scott Pruitt as EPA Administrator.   To summarize--and then I will go into some detail--Virginians are  pro-science people. The political figure we most venerate is still  Thomas Jefferson, who was the preeminent scientist of his day. We are  pro-science people. Second, the evidence from Mr. Pruitt's career  demonstrates he is anti-science in the climate area and possibly  others. Third, there is no position in the Federal Government that more  relies upon accurate science and scientistic judgement than EPA  Administrator.   I think the President is afforded significant discretion in  appointing members of the Cabinet, and I have voted to confirm a number  of President Trump's nominees even if I wouldn't have nominated them  myself because I think they meet the basic test of competence and  integrity. But I have voted against individuals if they can't satisfy  me that they meet our ethical standards or that they are qualified for  the position or that they are able to do the job fairly and  objectively.   The ability of the EPA Administrator to do this job fairly and  objectively requires an acknowledgement of the scientific reality of  climate change and other science. This isn't an abstract matter for  Virginia, and it is not an abstract matter for the EPA Administrator.   Next only to coastal Louisiana, Virginia is the most susceptible  State to sea level rise. Hampton Roads, VA, with 1.6 million people-- our second largest metropolitan area--not only is it a busy and  thriving metropolitan area, but it is the center of American naval  power and the largest base of naval operations in the world. It is the  homeport for the U.S. Atlantic fleet. What we are seeing throughout  Hampton Roads, VA, is that neighborhoods where you could sell and buy a  house 15 years ago, you now can't because normal tidal action renders  the homes impossible to sell. It affects businesses.   By 2040, the main road into the largest naval base in the world,  Norfolk, will be covered 2 to 3 hours a day just by normal tidal  action, not by storm surges, which make it more significant. So now the  cities of Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Chesapeake,  Newport News, and Hampton are all trying to figure out ways to make  resiliency investments to protect against sea level rise, and the  Department of Defense is having to contemplate the same kinds of  investments to protect our naval operations in Hampton Roads.   The EPA's mission and its entire existence revolve around science. To  enforce the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, to set limits on  pollutants that are stringent enough to have measurable benefits but  reasonable enough to avoid negative economic impacts to the degree we  can, and to pore over reams and reams of data and analysis and figure  out whether a chemical in a consumer product is harmful takes science.  To analyze whether fracking or some other method of extracting energy  is dangerous to drinking water or not dangerous or somewhere in the  middle or what the right limits should be takes science.   In an earlier iteration, I was the mayor of Richmond. My city has a  river in the middle of it that was so polluted--the James River--you  couldn't swim in it and you couldn't fish in it. There was no bird life  in it because it had been polluted over such a long time. Today, go to  Richmond, VA, and you will see people canoeing  [[Page S1237]]  and kayaking. You will see people fishing and taking the fish home to  eat. You will see people swimming. It has gone from the sewer of our  city to the front yard of our city, to the thing that has helped bring  population back into downtown Richmond and grow our population, and it  happened because of the Clean Water Act.   There is always a question in regulation--too hot, too cold, or just  right. But my city would not be what it is today had there not been a  Clean Water Act that required us--in some ways that were painful at  times--to save the river, and now it has herons, bald eagles, fish,  kayakers, and canoeists, and everybody's quality of life and the  economy are better too.   Mr. Pruitt has been asked repeatedly about his views on climate  science. Just 4 months ago, he stated:         We've done a lot [in reducing carbon emissions], and that's       not even addressing, guys, the fact that there's a tremendous       dispute, as you know, that's going on in the marketplace       about how much this global warming trend that the [Obama]       administration talks about, if it's true or not.        Is it truly man-made and is this simply just another period       of time where the Earth is cooling, increasing in heat? I       mean is it just typical natural type of occurrences as       opposed to what the Administration says?    That was just 4 months ago. This kind of skepticism--we don't know  whether humans cause it; we don't know whether it is natural--is  exactly the kind of thing we have seen in Congress before. There was a  famous hearing in Congress that was sort of emblazoned on people's  memories of a whole bunch of witnesses standing up and swearing to tell  the truth and saying: We don't know that there is a connection between  cigarette smoking and cancer. This kind of denial of the scientific  consensus from an Administrator of the chief agency that needs science  in this country is deeply troubling.    I don't think it should be going out on a limb to declare that  climate change is happening, driven largely by the burning of fossil  fuels, and is a problem we have to deal with in some way. How to deal  with it, how quickly to deal with it--those are tough questions, but  acknowledging the science should not be tough.   That acknowledgement of the science was the policy of a predecessor  of mine, Virginia Senator John Warner, a Republican, who introduced one  of the first climate bills in Congress with Democratic Senator Joe  Lieberman in 2006. This policy that we recognize science was the policy  of the George H.W. Bush administration, which negotiated the U.N.  Framework Convention on Climate Change more than 25 years ago. It was  the policy that underlay the Presidential campaign of one of our  colleagues, Senator John McCain, in 2008.   Acknowledging the science of climate change isn't a matter of  political views; it is a matter of science and reality. We can discuss  and debate what to do about it, and I think those are challenging  discussions to have. That is fair game. Differences of opinion about  what to do about--that is fair game. But denying an overwhelming  scientific consensus that climate change exists and that it is driven  by human activity in the burning of fossil fuels--something ExxonMobil  scientists were agreeing to in papers written in the 1980s, not 4  months ago--denying that is a denial of science.   I worry. If Mr. Pruitt denies science on this matter, what other  science will he deny? His record as attorney general in Oklahoma bears  me out on my worry to some degree. In virtually every decision, the  attorney general's office defended the interests of oil and gas, of Big  Agribusiness, and basically the interests of polluters against the  interests of clean air and water, which are the interests of our  families and our kids.   A New York Times article from 2 years ago--before Mr. Pruitt was  nominated for this position--identified that when the EPA was looking  at the potential impacts--potential, not guaranteed; we are trying to  determine if there are impacts--of fracking on water quality and  seismic instability, Attorney General Pruitt submitted comments on  behalf of the State of Oklahoma that expressed skepticism that fracking  was causing any problems. Well, why not do the investigation? Why not  get to the bottom of it? Was the opinion that he expressed backed by  science? Was it backed by a deep analysis that had been done by  scientists or smart attorneys in Mr. Pruitt's office? No. In this  instance, good investigative journalism determined that the comment  expressing skepticism about fracking having any effect on water quality  was actually written by an energy company, copied, and pasted onto  official Oklahoma letterhead and submitted to the EPA as representing  the views of Oklahoma public officials.   Would it be appropriate for the attorney general of Oklahoma--a State  that has significant oil and gas--to take into account the views of oil  and gas producers on something as important as fracking? Absolutely. In  fact, you would not be doing your job if you didn't take the views of  those companies into account. But considering industry views is very  different from taking their views and portraying them as coming from  you, a holder of a public trust who is supposed to be working for  everybody and not just one company or one industry.   Here is one more example I will give before I conclude, because I  take it personally. Virginia is one of the six States in the Chesapeake  Bay watershed. I worked on this matter as Governor of Virginia, along  with colleagues in the other States and the District of Columbia, and  we worked together with the EPA on how to clean up the bay. This is a  treasured resource for Virginians. It is about as bipartisan a thing as  there is in Virginia. Probably next to support for veterans, support  for the Chesapeake Bay would be a close second in bipartisanship. As  public officials, we worked out with the EPA a strategy we thought  would be conducive to cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay--which is not just  about enjoyment, not just about water quality, but also about  traditional Virginia industries, like watermen's industry tourism,  which is a big industry in our State.   We worked it out to our satisfaction, but when we did, there was a  lawsuit filed against this particular regulation by the Farm Bureau.  The attorney general of Oklahoma--not one of the six States in the  Chesapeake Bay watershed--the attorney general of Oklahoma intervened  and filed a friend-of-the-court brief to try to strike down the  regulation that the EPA and Virginia officials had worked on in tandem  for the good of the Chesapeake Bay, for the good of our Commonwealth,  for the good of our citizens.   I contend: Why would an attorney general in Oklahoma care so much  about a Chesapeake Bay rule that we had worked out together? I contend  that he and some other attorneys general who joined in this were  worried that if the EPA succeeded, then the EPA might try something in  other large watersheds, including those in their States.   The matter did go to the Federal appellate court. The Federal  appellate court upheld the Chesapeake Bay plan. The attorneys general  and others tried to take it to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court  wouldn't take the appeal, and so the Chesapeake Bay plan is in  operation. We were all struck about why an Oklahoma attorney general  would be going after something affecting the Commonwealth of Virginia,  and there is a point there.   The point was this. EPA scientists working in tandem with State  officials had analyzed the water quality in the bay, and they had  followed the State's progress, or lack thereof, over time, and they  finally said, again, working in tandem with many of us: The pollution  levels are so bad that we are never going to return the bay to what it  can be unless we need to take action.   It was that scientific consensus that Mr. Pruitt as attorney general  of Oklahoma was challenging. Science is the pursuit of truth. Science  is supposed to follow where the facts lead, no matter what the  scientist's initial views might be.   Mr. Pruitt's record does not tell me he will follow the data wherever  it leads. It tells me that whenever there is a menu of options, he is  going to take the option that is most beneficial to polluters rather  than beneficial to public health.   I will conclude with the point at which I started. There is no  Federal agency that needs to have somebody who accepts science and  scientific consensus more than the EPA. It matters  [[Page S1238]]  deeply to Virginia, but I don't think Virginians are unique to this. I  think it matters to the citizens of 50 States.   EPA regulations are not all wise, and some need to be dialed back. I  have seen the positive effects of wise EPA regulations in my city and  in my State. I am going to vote no on Mr. Pruitt because I don't  believe his first duty will be to follow science and enforce just laws  and regulations, appropriately governing the water we drink and the air  we breathe.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.    Mr. President, our Nation's continued economic  competitiveness relies on the education and skills of the American  workforce and its ability to meet and adapt to the 21st-century  economy. Career and technical education, CTE, programs are a critical  component to every student's education, creating diverse pathways into  further education and developing careers. Today, approximately 11.5  million students are enrolled in CTE, encompassing every State through  nearly 1,700 two-year and thousands more secondary CTE centers,  comprehensive high schools career academies and CTE high schools.   According to the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Career,  Technical and Adult Education, in 2012, the average high school  graduation rate for students concentrating in CTE programs was 93  percent, compared with the national average of 80 percent. These  students gain real-world skills through applied learning, and integrate  their academic curriculum with technical and employability skills. In  addition, our Nation's continued economic competitiveness relies on the  skill of the American workforce and its ability to meet and adapt to  the 21st-century economy.   CTE prepares students with education and training leading to  industry-recognized credentials, including certifications, licenses,  certificates and degrees, in a wide variety of fields. According to the  U.S. Department of Labor, of the top three fastest-growing occupations,  all will require real-world skills that can be mastered through CTE-- none require a bachelor's degree and all have median salaries above  $50,000 per year. By increasing opportunities for students to obtain  postsecondary skills training and meaningful credentials, CTE can  spread economic opportunity to all students who are willing to work for  it.   Today with my Senate CTE Caucus cochairs Senator Portman, Senator  Baldwin, and Senator Young and other colleagues in the Senate, I am  introducing a bipartisan resolution to designate February as Career and  Technical Education, CTE, Month. CTE Month provides a chance for  students, counselors, educators and administrators to learn more about  the educational opportunities available in their communities and  recognize the importance of CTE in preparing a well-educated and  skilled workforce in the United States. This year's resolution also  marks the 100th anniversary of the Smith-Hughes National Vocational  Education Act of 1917, the Nation's first major federal investment in  secondary CTE.   By formally recognizing CTE Month through this resolution, it is our  hope that we can build greater awareness for the importance of  strengthening access to high-quality CTE for millions of America's  students and our nation's continued economic competitiveness.                            ____________________
