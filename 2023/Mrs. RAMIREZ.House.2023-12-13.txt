 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, we are here talking about the work that  we have done, or tried to do, in this past year. This week is the last  week Members of this body will gather to work on legislative business  for 2023.   The last time I convened the Special Order hour, my colleagues and I  came to the floor to discuss the impact that the debt ceiling would  have on everyday, working people. We said over and over that a debt  ceiling agreement that shortchanged funding for vital programs  shortchanges everyday people.   I find that, much like in May, we are in the same place fighting to  protect and to preserve the programs our communities need. Just like in  May, I am here to remind this body why we were sent here and who sent  us here: Our constituents.   Let me be clear. Who sent us here are our constituents, not MAGA  extremists, not lobbyists, and definitely not Donald Trump.   This year, my colleagues and I on the Congressional Progressive  Caucus have been fighting like hell for policies that protect people,  including expanding healthcare for DACA recipients; addressing gun  violence; securing protections for the workforce; and centering our  policies around equity and justice.   I am proud to say that we have been able to deliver for our  communities, yes, even in the midst of chaos. While we were able to  accomplish so little--although I know that my colleague tried to talk a  little bit about what the GOP tried to do--I am convening this Special  Order hour to speak truth to power.   Madam Speaker, let me be clear and say that Republicans have held  progress hostage. It has been a year, and we have spent more time on  speakership elections--19 to be exact--pointless censures, and  political theater, jeopardizing the safety and the well-being of  people, instead of moving policy that improves their lives.   We have spent countless hours subjected to words that dehumanize and  devalue Brown and Black people, and I have witnessed firsthand as  Members across the aisle call immigrants vile names like infestations  over and over again, not just here but during my committee hearings;  denying their humanity.   I have spent more time attending vigils than celebrating life because  Republicans are intent on holding up bills that would address gun  violence.   I have spent more time voting ``no'' to protect my constituents from  harmful cuts and reckless policies than I have had the opportunity to  vote ``yes'' to legislation that prioritizes working people and  families.   I have spent more time on picket lines affirming that workers deserve  living wages, protection from retaliation, and the right to  collectively bargain than actually passing policies that ensure that  all workers are compensated well, respected, and valued.   When I was elected to Congress, I told my community that I was  committed to delivering results. I am here today to say that in the  face of everyday Republican-manufactured obstacles to progress, their  political games, their disorganization, and their opposition to  honoring our shared humanity, I remained true to my commitments and my  values as a Member of Congress.   I have remained focused on delivering results for Illinois' Third  Congressional District and honoring our diverse multicultural,  multigenerational community.   I am not alone.   My colleagues in the Congressional Progressive Caucus have also  remained true to their commitment and their values and focused on  delivering for their districts. I am grateful to be flanked by such  dedicated, persevering, and courageous leaders.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to welcome one of my colleagues to share  some of the progress that she has made and what Congress must still  continue to do to accomplish and deliver for the people.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Lee).    Madam Speaker, as the gentlewoman was talking, I  started asking myself that if our colleagues that are in the majority  were actually serious about delivering for their constituents, then  perhaps we would spend less time in censures; perhaps we would spend  less time fighting each other, doing whatever kidney-elbow situation;  arguing with each other on the corners, and all the games and all the  other things they do, and actually pass legislation that helps people's  experiences improve, like legislation around housing, making it more  affordable so that no one has to live in a tent.   It is interesting because Republicans seem to really care about  homelessness when it is someone that is undocumented, that is an  immigrant or asylum seeker, but they have had the opportunity in  leadership in these past 12 months to pass legislation to address  housing, and instead, they are cutting funds for housing.   They say they care about families and women and their wives and their  children, but they refuse to pass paid leave.   They say they care and are worried about healthcare, but are they  really? Because if they were worried about healthcare, we would be  doing less of the crazy theater here--19 elections for a darn Speaker-- and actually pass quality healthcare.   Let's talk a little bit more about what they haven't done and what we  should be focusing on.   I know that the gentleman from Utah attempted to talk about the GOP  accomplishments, but I couldn't figure out which one accomplishment he  was able to actually tangibly prove.   Let's talk about housing. It is no secret that housing prices are  skyrocketing.   In Chicago, for example, we have seen a 5.7 increase in the cost of  rent in 1 year. In some communities, it is as high as a 20 percent  increase.   As temperatures plummet, more people find themselves in tents  suffering cold nights in unsafe conditions, or they are just one  paycheck away from homelessness.   You would think that our colleagues would be concerned about  government shutdowns since so many people are just one paycheck away  from homelessness. While working families are struggling to pay rent,  we faced not one, but two threats of a Republican national shutdown.   I have to say it over and over. This is what my constituents ask me  about every time I go back home, or message me: We didn't elect you all  to spend your time fighting each other because you don't like each  other, or because one person said this thing that this other person  didn't like. All this time you spend censuring each other and fighting  instead of negotiating appropriation bills that would fully fund our  communities.   Yet, that is what 12 months in Congress have looked like. The  Republicans are leaving everyday American families literally out in the  cold.   In spite of Republican chaos, I, along with Representatives Rashida  Tlaib from Michigan-12, Ayanna Pressley from Massachusetts-07,   Jimmy  Gomez from California-34, and  Greg Casar from Texas-35 are delivering  when it comes to housing.   We introduced H.R. 5827, the Tenants' Right to Organize Act,  legislation that will protect the power of tenants with Federal  vouchers to organize.                                time  1915    We know that throughout our Nation, from big cities, like Chicago, to  smaller cities, tenants have recognized that when we fight, when we  come together and claim our power, we win.   Tenant organizing is not only winning battles against unfair housing  practices, unjustified evictions, housing discrimination, and  uncontrolled price hikes; it is also changing housing public policy.   The Tenants' Right to Organize Act, my bill, aims to amplify their  efforts by protecting the organizing rights of tenants with housing  choice vouchers and tenants living in low-income housing tax credit  properties. It also expands protections for mixed-status families and  those who may not be eligible for tenant-based rental assistance.   Currently, only public housing tenants have legally recognized the  right to organize. By extending this right to housing choice vouchers  and low-income tax credit tenants, the bill acknowledges that all  tenants deserve decent, safe, stable, and sanitary housing.   The fight for safe, stable, equitable housing must also include  tenants, and as we are encountering a worsening housing affordability  crisis, we understand that now, more than ever, all tenants must have  the right to organize.   Now, let's talk about immigration. This is a place where I find the  most dissonance. The same people that love to quote Scripture--God has  called me to love him above all things--and then they seem to forget  the second commandment: Love your neighbor as you love yourself--it  couldn't be more clear as it comes to immigration.   I cannot count the number of times the same people who quote  Scripture come to this podium to respond while scapegoating immigrant  communities, demonizing them, and then saying that they care about  them, ``poor immigrants.''   Well, if you cared about them and if you cared about humanity, and  certainly if we were living our Christian values, then we would be  looking for legal pathways so no one would have to endure what so many  people seeking asylum have to do every single day.   Republicans have repeatedly tried to introduce legislation and  resolutions that deport unaccompanied children. These are the same  people that say that they are the ones of family values, they are the  ones protecting life and children. They want to end asylum, and they  want to jail families.   They are trying again right now. They are seeking to extort immoral  and deplorable border provisions in exchange for aid for Ukraine. I  have said it before and I will say it again and again and again: It is  hypocritical, cynical, to target immigrants when many of the people who  serve in this Chamber, some of them with me right now, have reaped the  benefits of immigrant labor and become wealthy on the backs of  immigrant sacrifice.   It takes courage to cross the border, to seek a job, to pursue an  opportunity to raise your children in safety. The courage of our people  stands in stark contrast with the cowardice of my colleagues.   There is nothing people-centered, nothing noble, nothing redeeming  about their extremist approach to border immigration policy. Let's just  be clear. They are scapegoating immigrants right now so they can say to  their voters that they are doing something about the border, but they  are not going to want to do enough, because they want to take the  border conversation and issue to the polls in November.   Their unwillingness to negotiate, to actually get to the root cause  of migration, is mind-boggling. They don't want solutions. Because if  they wanted solutions, they would understand that actually addressing  immigration, passing comprehensive immigration reform, would actually  prioritize our economy. It would actually address the root causes of  migration in Central and South America by creating legal pathways, by  working with these countries, by ensuring that we help strengthen their  democracies.   Yet, in spite of all the Republican chaos, a number of us have  reintroduced the Dream and Promise Act, and we will work and work until  we deliver it.   In spite of my Republican colleagues' inability to act beyond the  border, we are here taking that first step in the right direction to  give Dreamers and immigrants in America an earned pathway to  citizenship that reflects our values as a Nation, a multicultural  democracy of diversity and inclusion. We are here moving the needle to  a real comprehensive immigration reform package that embraces our  values as a nation.   Now, let me talk a little bit more about that. There are 9.8 million  job openings right now. You can go to your local grocery store, go to  Aldi, because some of us shop there still, very proudly, or you can go  to absolutely any  [[Page H6934]]  other store. You talk about supply chain, and you realize that we don't  have the workforce we need in order to address the issues of economy of  the moment.   Now, just imagine, if the people that are here already, of the 11  million people living in the shadows, some of them for the last 30  years, if they were able to get a work permit, they would pay taxes,  generate revenue for the Federal Government, helping address our issues  of budget. They would address supply chain issues, our manufacturing,  hospitality, agriculture, and the list goes on in terms of the  different trades that are desperately needing workers that would get  the workers they need. They would actually extend Social Security by  decades if we passed comprehensive immigration policy, but that is not  what we want to do.   We are so insecure perhaps about ourselves that we are unable to see  the bigger picture of the economy for our country. Comprehensive  immigration reform is a solution to the economy. Comprehensive  immigration reform is the American way. This country was founded by  immigrants, and every single person in this Chamber right now comes  from a family who also migrated to this country, unless you are from  the original indigenous communities.   Let me say this. As the only Member of Congress married to a Dreamer,  this issue is extremely personal to me. I am committed to fighting this  fight until we have a humane immigration policy that doesn't question  the validity of people's lives and claims, that doesn't impose hurtful  limitations on our communities, or doesn't leave anyone behind. No  bans. No walls. No raids. Punto.    I want to talk to you a little bit about education and veterans.  While extreme Republicans have served up hate and fear from every  direction with no regard for the harm it causes our communities, I have  been focused on addressing the real issues everyday people face--people  like Army veteran Christopher Brown from Des Plaines, Illinois, who was  promised by ITT Tech that his GI benefits would cover his tuition, only  to be left with $95,000 in student loans, or Navy veteran Bryan Tario  from Lisle, Illinois, who was left with a significant debt after DeVry  failed to be clear about the amount of money needed to complete his  education.   Constituents in our districts have real problems that require real  policy solutions. There are bad actors who should be held accountable  and whose impact on our constituents can be minimized through  prevention and redress.   These are the problems we should be addressing. If we spent the  actual time addressing these issues, we would see the American people  feel the improvement in their day-to-day lives.   Too many veterans are defrauded by predatory, often for-profit  institutions that see the GI Bill education benefits and only see a  profitable exploit.   In spite of the Republican chaos, I, along with Representative   Mike  Levin from California, have introduced the Student Veteran Benefit  Restoration Act, my very first piece of legislation in United States  Congress.   H.R. 1767 establishes an across-the-board process for student  veterans to have their GI Bill education benefits restored in  qualifying instances, such as when a student veteran has been defrauded  by an educational institution.   While Republicans waste our time doling out impeachments and  censures, they deny veterans who have been defrauded justice, leaving  them without recourse or the ability to start again in a reputable  institution using the benefits they earned while serving our Nation.   It is time to bring H.R. 1767 to the floor, and I know that our  veterans are watching closely and deserve it.   Now, I want to talk about health. Every person in Illinois' Third  Congressional District has a right to achieve their dreams. As Members  of Congress, our policy choices should enable them to realize their  full potential.   Access to healthcare and healthcare services are critical supports to  that end. That is why, while Republicans have made it their mission to  cut funding for hospitals, healthcare providers, on-the-ground  organizations that support health equity efforts, and programs that  enable the healthcare ecosystem to function, my colleagues and I have  made expanding access to healthcare services a priority.   Republicans proposed a Labor-HHS appropriation bill that cuts vital  programs and services by 28 percent, equivalent to $64 billion.  Democrats held the line, and this bill did not pass. However, my  colleagues, of course, did not stop there.   In spite of their chaos, I, along with so many of my colleagues,  continue to deliver for our communities. Our fearless chair,  Representative Jayapal, also introduced the Medicare for All Act, which  would expand healthcare coverage to everyone, and I am a proud  cosponsor of it.   We advocated for and we are proud to see the proposed rule from the  Department of Health and Human Services that would grant eligibility  for healthcare coverage to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,  DACA, recipients.   I introduced an amendment to the Labor-HHS appropriation bill that  affirmed how critical it is for the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau to maintain its independence from congressional meddling so that  it can continue to address practices that harm consumers, especially  predatory lending that leads to medical debt.   Medical debt puts people in an impossible position, having to choose  between seeking necessary healthcare services and paying for their  basic needs, like housing, food, and heat.   We didn't do that work alone. Achieving health equity requires  collective action, which is why I am proud to highlight the work of the  AIDS Foundation of Chicago. In partnership with over 200 organizations  and with funding support from the Ryan White program, the AIDS  Foundation of Chicago served over 8,000 individuals last year through  case management, housing, emergency financial assistance, and food  support. Services include, but are not limited to, connections to  housing, medical care, transportation, and behavioral health support.   The last thing I want to talk about is appropriations, something that  this leadership doesn't seem to figure out. We are on our second  continuing resolution, and the way things are going, we might have to  go to a third one in January.   Let's not forget that Democrats have effectively kept the government  open amid Republican infighting and, goodness, so much disorganization.   If we remember their first attempt at a continuing resolution, it  included terrible anti-immigrant provisions and about a 30 percent cut  to government services, which would have meant that in Illinois' Third  District, 10,901 women and children would have gone hungry, 28,187  active and reserve servicemembers would have gone without payment in  Illinois, and 5,000 residents in Illinois' Third District would have  lost access to Federal help and vouchers.   These are not the goals of people who care about working families.  How can you say that you are the party of family and then do everything  you can to slash resources for them? To me, on the contrary, it is a  vicious attack on working families.   At that time we said that if the Republicans were serious about  averting a shutdown, they would bring a clean CR to the floor to keep  our government running and to continue bipartisan conversations about  funding priorities.   With less than 24 hours to avoid a shutdown, Republicans presented  another CR. In spite of the Republican chaos, I, along with so many of  my colleagues, delivered.                                time  1930    We defeated the extremist CR, and that victory made the clean CR that  averted a shutdown possible.   We forced them to, at least momentarily, back down from their anti- immigrant demands and their cold disregard for working families. Let's  remember that fight is not over.   You just heard a number of my colleagues, particularly the last one,  talk about H.R. 2. H.R. 2 is the most anti-immigrant bill we have ever  seen pass the Homeland Security Committee. We call it the child  deportation act.   They want to bring back draconian Trump-era border policy. In the  same sentence, they talk about how they are concerned about the women  and children crossing the border. If that is not dissonance and  hypocrisy, I don't know what is.   Let me say this loud and clear. It is our responsibility to deliver  for the  [[Page H6935]]  people who sent us here. We are looking like chaos under Republican  leadership. We must continue to double down, push back, and fight for  working families.   I am committed to continuing the fight for an appropriations package  that protects essential safety net programs and vital services, brings  Federal resources back to my district and the State of Illinois, and  prevents further cuts that threaten the well-being of our communities.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Summer Lee for joining me today  as we talked about the Progressive Caucus' Special Order hour, the  things that we continue to work on, and the victories in the midst of  the chaos.   Here is what I want to say as I wrap up. Two days ago, I got back  from Guatemala and Honduras. I went on my first committee delegation  trip. As I visited Guatemala as a United States Congressperson, I  couldn't stop thinking about my mother and how she has reminded me over  the years of the 1,800-mile journey she took, walking and suffering as  she was pregnant with me. She left poverty. She left a place she loved  to have a better opportunity for me, her daughter.   I think about the moment that we are in today. I am very proud that I  am the daughter of Guatemalan immigrants. I am very proud that I am the  very first Latina of many to come from the Midwest. But I am more proud  and honored to be able to be in this place, in this Chamber, fighting  every single day for working families.   I am fighting for women who deserve paid leave and for constituents  across the country who deserve quality healthcare.   I am fighting for clean water, clean energy, affordable housing, and  the ability of the American people not to have to worry about living  paycheck to paycheck.   I am fighting for that senior in my district who calls me crying:  ``If the government shuts down and I don't get my Social Security  check, at 74 years of age, I am out in the street.'' These are the  people who send us to Congress.   Madam Speaker, most of my colleagues, while celebrating and partying  at holiday celebrations, perhaps having many spirits, should be  reminded why they were sent to this Chamber. They were sent to  represent the people who see them as their voice.   I will say to women, women of color, immigrants, the working class,  children and our youth, Brown and Black people, the LGBTQ community,  advocates and activists, on-the-ground organizations providing critical  services, and anyone who feels afraid or invisible right now, to  friends and allies of the progressive movement, and to my constituents  in Illinois: I see you. I am fighting for you every single day.   There have been hard days in Washington, D.C., when I have been the  only woman, the only Latina, the only elected official with a mixed- status family where people are making decisions that will impact my  life and your life, things that will impact the people I care about and  the people you care about.   If there is ever a moment I falter, I think about my roots. I think  about who I was sent here to fight for, and I find my footing again. My  community is with me wherever I go, no matter how far away from home I  might be.   While Republicans and their destructive agenda seek to decay the  trust we have with one another, and they seek to divide us by holding  resources hostage, community holds us together.   I refuse to allow Republicans and their obstruction of justice stop  my colleagues and I from achieving true progress. I believe that  progress is possible and that we can build a country that honors and  respects the humanity and dignity of all marginalized people.   I believe that seeking asylum is a human right. I believe housing is  a human right. In a country as rich as ours, no one should ever go  hungry. No one should be trapped by crippling debt, whether it be  student loan debt or medical debt. Brown and Black people are not  disposable.   I fiercely fight for a world in which no one has to make impossible  choices between going hungry or keeping the lights on at home.   I fight for a world where my loved ones like my uncle, who has been  waiting for so long, can finally feel like this country is his home;  where the color of our skin isn't a death sentence; and where we don't  have to protest to ensure that climate change is taken seriously and  the land and the people who take care of it are respected.   I believe in a self-determined future where all Palestinians and  Israelis are free and safe. Our futures are intersected, and that  realization can provide a path to coexistence.   A more just and loving world is possible. Progress is possible. It is  possible because of the collective movement we are building--a  progressive movement that does not move in fear but moves in courage.   The work is nowhere near done. Whether Republicans like it or not, I  am here to stay and do the work that secures the future for all people.  May we be reminded in this new year why we are here, who sent us here,  and the responsibility we have to represent our constituents.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
