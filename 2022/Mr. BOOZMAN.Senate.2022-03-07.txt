 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the life  and service of former Hot Springs mayor Helen Selig.   Selig was a beloved member of the Hot Springs community and made a  substantial difference in the lives of so many Arkansans. She not only  served as mayor of Hot Springs from 1994-2000, but also played a  crucial role in fulfilling countless projects aimed at bettering the  city.   As mayor, Selig saw great success throughout her 6-year tenure, and  it was something that was recognized by citizens and leaders alike. Hot  Springs city manager Bill Burrough reflected that, ``Hot Springs is  truly a better place because of her passion, the work that she did, and  her influence. When Helen Selig was involved, people would listen.''   Selig has been praised widely for her involvement in a variety of  community projects, including the construction of the convention  center. In the recent weeks, dozens of local leaders have been  outspoken in their praise and gratitude for her dedication to Hot  Springs.  [[Page S1015]]    In 1992, Selig was already making waves as a well-known leader of a  group advocating for Hot Springs to be chosen as the location for the  Arkansas School for Mathematics, Science, and the Arts. This school did  end up being located in the so-called Spa City and has helped so many  students with bright minds flourish throughout our State.   Her lifetime of service to her community and neighbors extended far  beyond her time as an elected leader. She was a founding member of the  Arkansas Women's Leadership Forum, as well as the Women's Foundation of  Arkansas, in addition to volunteering for several organizations,  including Habitat for Humanity, Hot Springs Parks Board of Directors,  R.E.G.A.R.D., YMCA Board of Directors, Hot Springs Music Festival-- board of directors--Kappa Kappa Gamma fraternity, Catholic Church of  St. John the Baptist, the Lotus Book Club, and Hot Springs National  Park Rotary Club. Time and time again, Helen Selig exhibited her firm  commitment to the people of Hot Springs.   I am so grateful for Mayor Selig's dedication to serving her  community and truly making a difference in the lives of those around  her. I want to take this time to pray for her family in their time of  grief and reassure them that Helen's memory will live on through the  great work she has done for Arkansas.                            ____________________
