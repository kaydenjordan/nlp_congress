 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I received this  message from a very respected businessman in Knoxville, Randy Greaves.   He wrote:         I just received a letter from Humana stating that they are       leaving the State of Tennessee next year.        This leaves no one to write individual health policies in       the State. Aetna only writes group policies, and they may       withdraw, as well. Please let anyone with a vote know that       families are being failed miserably, as you already know.        The insurance that Humana wrote for my family, in 2017,       required that we pay the first $37,000 between premiums and       the deductible before insurance would contribute only 50       percent.        It was basically worthless, and now they won't even make       that lousy policy available because people on subsidies,       mostly with no personal accountability for their own health,       cost a fortune to the rest of us.    ObamaCare may have helped 20 million people, but it has hurt 200  million people in the process.   About a month ago, The Irish Times, the largest newspaper in Ireland,  reported that they had over 660,000 people on waiting lists for  healthcare. That is in a country of less than 5 million people. If you  multiply that times 60 or 65, you have got the United States.   Medicare, when it started, when it was first passed, there was a CBO  prediction that it would cost $9 billion after 25 years. Instead, it  cost 12 times that after the first 25 years, and now it costs six times  more than that, or about 70 times more than the original estimates.   California, as liberal and leftwing as that State is, a few days ago,  I read that they tried to pass a healthcare, or medical care for  everyone, bill. They had to withdraw the bill because they found out  that it would cost $400 billion for the first year. If you multiply  that times 10 or 11, you are talking about the whole United States. We  are having trouble affording the Medicare that we have now for 14  percent of the population, so Medicare for everyone is not going to  work in this country.   We took what was a very minor problem, for very few people in the  mid-sixties, and turned it into a major problem for everyone so that  now only Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, and people like that,  multibillionaires, can afford healthcare. And the reason is, is that  anything the Federal Government subsidizes, the costs just explode  because you remove the incentives and pressures to hold costs down.    The American people don't want a Russian or Cuban type of medical  system in this country. They don't want a totally federally run system,  like they have in so many countries, with medical care that is not even  a fraction of what we have.   We are still under ObamaCare today, and it is not working. These  insurance companies are pulling out all over the whole country, and The  Washington Times reported yesterday, or the day before, that, according  to the Department of Health and Human Services, premiums went up 63  percent in Tennessee in 2017 alone.  [[Page H5987]]    Mr. Speaker, this system is not working. We need to move more in the  direction of a free market medical system if we are ever going to hope  to bring down healthcare costs for the American people with the kind of  healthcare that everyone is demanding and wanting and that we want to  give to them.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, 2 days ago The Washington Times  published a chart from the Department of Health and Human Services  showing that medical premiums went up 116 percent last year in Arizona,  69 percent in Oklahoma, 63 percent in my home State of Tennessee, 59  percent in Minnesota, 58 percent in Alaska, and on and on and on.   President Obama promised, if we would pass his healthcare bill, that  people could keep their plans, yet millions were forced onto ObamaCare  because either their premiums went up too high or they lost their  insurance altogether. He promised that the average family would save  $2,500 a year. It has been almost impossible to find any family that  has saved that $2,500.   ObamaCare has been great: great in making healthcare unaffordable for  almost every family in America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this is the fourth year I have  had the privilege of chairing the Members and former Members golf  tournament to benefit Warfighters Sports and Tee It Up for the Troops,  two charities that work with the most severely wounded warriors. This  year, we had our biggest turnout ever. We had well over 200  participants, including 35 severely wounded golfers.   When I play golf, sometimes people ask me how I did. I tell them,  ``Unbelievable.'' It could be either way. But the most unbelievable  thing happened in this tournament. Finally, after many years of losses,  we Republicans decided to let the Democrats win one year. The Democrats  won by 4 points, and that is out of a several-thousand point system. So  it was a very close match.   I want to offer my congratulations to my co-chairman, Gene Green, and  thank every Member and former Member who participated. We had a great  turnout.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green).
