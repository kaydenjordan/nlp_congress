 Mr. Chair, my district includes 250 miles of  entirely public beaches on a coastline renowned for its pristine and  rugged beauty.   Our fishing community relies on clean oceans. It is our  responsibility to protect these waters that are vital for our coastal  economies and ocean ecosystems.   It is my duty to protect our oceans, the livelihood of the fishing  industry on the Oregon coast, and the way of life for the next  generation of coastal Oregonians.   The fossil fuel industry has 2,000 leases covering 12 million acres  for offshore drilling that are currently not being used. This is just  bait and switch by the oil companies who are making record profits  while they are price gouging Americans at the gas pump.   Mr. Chair, I strongly support Representative DelBene's amendment to  protect Oregon and Washington's coast for future generations.
