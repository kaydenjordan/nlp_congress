 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Katie Hearn for her appointment to the Georgia State Rehabilitation  Council.   Beginning as an intern for the Atlanta Braves, this year's world  champions, Katie's passion for the Braves community propelled her to a  full-time position within the organization. However, at the age of 28,  Katie was diagnosed with a rare brain disorder that caused her to lose  her sight.   Her illness forced her to step down from her position as she adjusted  to her new normal, but Katie is resilient and soon returned to the  Atlanta Braves, where she currently works as a senior coordinator for  digital and accessible services.   Katie has always been committed to ensuring every visitor has an  incredible experience in Truist Park.   In 2018 the Braves awarded her with the Walker Banks Award for her  extraordinary customer service.   Katie's passion for providing opportunities to Georgians with  disabilities to live, work, and thrive in our State is truly inspiring.   I am honored to recognize Katie for this prestigious accomplishment,  and I am grateful for her service.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, the spending spree continues  this week as Democrats continue to try to ram their ridiculous  reconciliation bill down our throats.   The radicals have been back-seat driving far too long. Our holiday  cheer is now being threatened by this administration's refusal to cut  up the credit cards. It is truly astonishing.   We are all set to experience the most expensive Thanksgiving in our  country's history, thanks to these reckless spending habits perpetrated  by the White House. Turkey prices are up 27 percent. Potatoes are up 13  percent. Carrots are up 47 percent. The beloved pumpkin pie from Costco  is up 17 percent.   The Consumer Price Index is up 6.2 percent overall. This is an  indicator of how much extra people are having to pay for their goods.   In addition, natural gas is up 40 percent, and home heating oil is up  60 percent. Americans are being forced to pay more to heat their homes  at a time when the weather is at its coldest. Nowhere in America should  hardworking taxpayers have to choose between heating their home and  putting food on the table.   These are not pandemic-related issues anymore. They are government- created issues. This is what socialism looks like. Joe Biden says: Get  used to it.   Empty shelves, runaway inflation, and government control--this no  longer looks like America. It looks like a failed socialist nation.  That is what it looks like.   We will not cave to the desires of the far left. We will push back.  America will remain free, and we will prevail.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I rise today in opposition of the President's unconstitutional  vaccine mandate.   Today, OSHA finally suspended enforcement of its vaccine mandate in  response to the Fifth Circuit Court's ruling earlier this month. The  only reason this happened is because Republicans and the people  demanded that our rights be protected and used the power given to us by  our Constitution to defend those rights.   And we can't stop now.   If these mandates are about public health, why do one-third of  physicians disagree with them?   If these mandates are responding to an emergency, why do they not  take effect until January 4?   If the mandates are based on science, why are we only looking at  vaccine status and not natural immunity?   It is because Washington Democrats are trying to control you, not  protect you.   Democratic leaders can't seem to follow their own rules and  expectations. They party and gather with no masks, yet they expect  their constituents to wear a mask at gatherings or even not gather at  all.   President Biden, hypocrisy is not a viable COVID-19 mitigation  strategy.
