 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, the new House Democratic majority has  passed several important bills, including bills to protect Americans'  healthcare. One of those important bills coming up is the Equality Act.   First as a State legislator and now as a Member of Congress, I have  supported the equal rights for LGBTQ people for over 20-plus years.   Today, in much of America, LGBTQ people can get married on Sunday and  fired on Monday. Our fellow Americans should not have to fear losing a  job or an apartment simply because of who they are.   I am proud that this House will pass the Equality Act today. I urge  the Senate to join us in passing this bill. Let fellow Americans be  free to be themselves, free from discrimination; and from sea to  shining sea, let freedom ring.                            ____________________
