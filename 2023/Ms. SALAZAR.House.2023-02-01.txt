 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule to bring up  H. Con. Res. 9, denouncing the horrors of socialism.   Why am I bringing this resolution to the floor of the United States  House of Representatives?   Because young people in America are being brainwashed by the news  media and academia into believing that socialism is an economic model  for the greater good of all Americans. The problem is that they are  falling for it. They are believing it.   Here is the proof: Almost 40 percent of Gen Z and millennials think  ``The Communist Manifesto,'' written by Karl Marx, the father of  Marxism, is a better defense of freedom and equality than the  Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson, one of the  creators of the American experiment, American exceptionalism, and the  document which gave birth to the most prosperous and resilient  democracy in the history of the world, ours, the United States of  America.   Worse yet, a recent poll shows that 40 percent of Americans of all  ages, not only the youth, 40 percent believe that socialism is good,  while 33 percent of them say that they are likely to support a member  of the Democratic Socialists of America, the organization that has  shaped the ideology of many of our colleagues with the poison of neo- Marxism. If you go to the Democratic Socialists of America website, you  will read their neo-Marxist positions with pride.                                time  1245    I represent the 27th District in Florida, the city of Miami, a  bastion of hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and  Venezuelans who have fled, who have escaped from the despicable horrors  that you cannot imagine produced by that ideology.   So why did the Venezuelans flee? Well, because Venezuela--why would  they do that, if Venezuela has almost 20 percent of the world's oil? In  other words, that means the largest reserves of oil in the world. The  Venezuelans have more oil than the Saudis in Saudi Arabia. In the 1950s  and 1960s, they had the same GDP as Germany. Now, inflation is 156  percent a year, the third largest in the world.   The average Venezuelan has lost 15 pounds for lack of food. In the  last 20 years, over 7 million Venezuelans have escaped the democratic  socialist paradise to anywhere they could go. That is more people than  have fled the violence in Syria. So that indicates that socialism is  more devastating than a civil war.   Another country who has lost everything is Nicaragua. In the 1970s,  it was the breadbasket of Central America. Then the Sandinistas  arrived, Daniel Ortega took power under the guidance of Fidel Castro in  Cuba. He expropriated almost 30,000 properties in a few years. Right  now, their citizens are poorer than they were in 1977. Ortega promised  democratic socialism but delivered a dictatorship.   In the last Presidential election, seven people dared to run for  President, and he put them all in jail. Still today, they are either  under house arrest or in jail.   Every socialist is a dictator in disguise.   In Cuba, after 60 years of living the socialist paradise, the average  Cuban, 70 percent of Cubans eat only once a day. The average Cubans  makes $23 a month. That is 40 cents a day. And the retirees, the  seniors, make $12.   Cuba, in 1960, had the highest per capita income in the hemisphere,  and it was comparable to Italy. We know that because there is hunger-- hunger is a very powerful motivator.   So today, Cubans by the thousands throw themselves to the sharks in  the Straits of Florida looking for freedom and hoping to get to the  district that I represent on this floor. That is just in this  hemisphere.   In China, 55 million died. In Cambodia, 1 million. In the USSR, 10  million froze to death in the Gulags.   Socialists are in the business of power, and it only takes one  generation to believe their false promise and lose their freedom. It is  a lie that socialism will solve your problems, economic or social.   Democratic socialism is socialism, and socialism is always socialism.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot let this evil ideology take hold in this  country. We are in the United States, the stronghold of freedom. That  is why we must pass this resolution.
