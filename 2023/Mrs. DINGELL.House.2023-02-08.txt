 Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition of H.R.  185.   Detroit Metropolitan Airport is a leading international hub with over  1,100 flights daily to and from four continents. Every year, the  airport welcomes more than 36 million passengers from across the world.   Southeast Michigan was hit hard by the coronavirus, and orders like  the COVID-19 vaccine requirement for global travelers entering the  United States helped mitigate its further spread into our communities.   Our nation is entering a new phase of our recovery, but COVID-19  remains a real public health threat. The emergence of new variants  globally continues to put our own nation at risk.   That's why legislation we are considering today is misguided. These  decisions must be rooted in science and made by our Nation's leading  public health experts, not politicians.   We know the best way to defeat this pandemic is for people within the  United States and around the world to get vaccinated, and this  legislation is contrary to this goal.   I urge all my colleagues to oppose this measure,
