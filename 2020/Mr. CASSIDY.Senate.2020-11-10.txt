 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am here today to pay tribute to three  brave law enforcement officers in Louisiana who were recently shot in  the line of duty, and, sadly, one died. I begin with the man who died.   While on duty, Mangham Police Officer Marshall Waters pulled over a  stolen vehicle on October 17. He was shot by the person in the car, who  fled the scene and eventually crashed the car. Officer Waters later  died from that injury on November 5.   Mangham Police Chief Perry Fleming says that Officer Waters was born  a servant. He was a paramedic and previously served as a firefighter in  nearby Franklin Parish.   Officer Waters' death will be felt throughout Northeast Louisiana.  Throughout his lifetime of service, he truly touched the hearts of  many. His community honored him last night with a candlelight vigil. He  will be laid to rest later this week.                            ____________________     Madam President, I would also like to recognize New  Orleans Police Officer Trevor Abney, who was shot in the face and  fortunately has survived.   Officer Abney and Officer Brooke Duncan were on patrol in New Orleans  on October 30. Without warning and for no reason, somebody walked by  and shot through the window, striking Officer Abney in the face. He was  taken to the hospital. He is said to be in good spirits, but, let's  face it, you get shot in the face, you have a road of recovery ahead of  you. Officer Duncan received a graze wound during the encounter.  Fortunately, both officers are expected to do well. Again, the motive  for the attack remains unknown, and the suspects are in custody.   These attacks are tragic reminders of the danger that law enforcement  officers face every day when they report for duty. They know it. They  accept the risk. Their family accepts the risk. Their children accept  the risk. Their spouse accepts the risk. They accept this risk because  it serves our greater good.   We owe a debt of gratitude to our law enforcement officers for their  willingness to put their lives on the line--even sacrificing it, as  Officer Waters did--to keep us safe.   I ask that all join in praying for Officer Waters' family as they  grieve his loss, and I ask you to join me in prayer for Officer Abney's  recovery. The road ahead will be difficult, but knowing that our  country supports them during these partisan times can make the  difference.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
