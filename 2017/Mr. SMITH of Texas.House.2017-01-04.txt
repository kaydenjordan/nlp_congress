 Mr. Speaker, the national liberal media continue  to promote a divided America. This is largely a result of their chosen  candidate not winning the Presidential election. Since 91 percent of  the media's coverage of President-elect Trump was negative, it is no  surprise that they still see America in a negative light.   But the media could play a much more constructive role. They could  report the good news that Americans are more confident about the future  than they have been in 20 years. They could report on President-elect  Trump's ability to attract individuals of competence and experience to  his administration. They could report on his fresh approach and new  ideas for, yes, making America great again.   Let's hope the media will put aside their bias and give the American  people the facts, untainted by personal animosity. If they do, our  country will be better for it.                            ____________________
