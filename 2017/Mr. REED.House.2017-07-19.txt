 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise awareness for the issue  of type 1 diabetes across America.   As co-chair of the Congressional Diabetes Caucus on the Republican  side with my good friend, Diana DeGette, on the Democratic side, this  is an issue I care deeply about. We must work together to find ways to  address this disease to improve the lives of families that are dealing  with this each and every day.   Mr. Speaker, my family is one of these families. My son, Will, at 17  years of age, has been fighting this disease 24/7, 365 days a year  since the age of 4.   This young girl, Kennedy, I had the honor to meet with and is  representing my district here in the congressional workshop being put  on by Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. She showed me the scars on  her fingers where she has to poke her fingers six to seven times a day,  Mr. Speaker, to control her blood sugar and monitor it on a regular  basis.   She is a true inspiration to all diabetics across the Nation and  should be an inspiration to each and every one of us to tackle this  disease in a way that will improve lives for generations to come.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 397.
