 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a great American  soldier, Staff Sergeant John Eade, a native son of Toledo, Ohio, of  whom our citizenry is very proud and eternally grateful.   As our Nation approaches Veterans Day 2021, I enter into the  Congressional Record the poignant story to honor John and his treasured  colleagues for their superhuman valor. They are all heroes.   John, as a highly wounded Vietnam veteran, persevered and led a  distinguished life as an architect and chief of the city of Boston's  inspection division.   Our Nation must revere his lifelong valor in the face of overwhelming  odds, terrible slaughter, and wounds endured from the deadliest single- day battle in the Vietnam war.   Sergeant Eade is held in the highest esteem by everyone who knows  him. He is a trusted confidant, a faithful friend, a true patriot, and  a very humble Purple Heart recipient. He would not seek that  recognition for himself but would be thinking only of his comrades.   In November 1965, John was deployed to Vietnam as a fire team leader  in the ill-fated 2nd Platoon, Alpha Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th  Cavalry, 1st Cavalry Division.   On November 14, he and his team were sent as reinforcements to the  Battle at Landing Zone X-Ray in the la Drang Valley made famous by the  movie ``We Were Soldiers.''   On the morning of November 17, Sergeant Eade and his small team were  marching to Landing Zone Albany. Only minutes after arriving, two much  larger North Vietnamese regiments ambushed his unit.   As the North Vietnamese swarmed them through the trees, John's  platoon was pinned down in ferocious hand-to-hand combat.   Sergeant Eade quickly rallied three of the only remaining soldiers  able to fight: Wilbert Johnson, Barry Burnite, and Oscar Barker, Jr.  Together, they fought valiantly to hold their position against the  attacking Vietnamese.   Their plight was unfortunately short-lived. Burnite was struck in the  chest by shrapnel, and Johnson pulled him to a position of cover to  save him. The two men fought until Burnite died and Johnson was killed.   As the fighting continued, John was shot multiple times and sprayed  with shrapnel. Barker tended to John's wounds. The rest of the platoon  had already been killed. John urged Barker to leave him and retreat,  but Barker refused. Moments later, Barker was killed.   Soon after, a napalm strike was dropped on John's position, leaving  him severely burned. Weak, but still alive, John managed to roll in the  dirt and extinguish the flames that had engulfed him, yet he continued  his efforts to hold his position.   That afternoon, John was surprised by enemy soldiers, shot in the  face, and knocked unconscious.   Despite the overwhelming odds and the horrific life-threatening  wounds he had received, John refused to withdraw and continued exposing  himself to the onslaught through the night, including throwing grenades  with his remaining good arm. When dawn came, he was grievously wounded  but remained alive.   Three days later, he was discovered by a recovery unit and awarded  the Purple Heart for his massive sacrifice for our Nation. I believe to  my core John and several of the men in his platoon have not been  appropriately recognized for their valor.   It is for this reason I and my colleagues have nominated him for the  Distinguished Service Cross.   John is now 78. He has lived with severe injuries sustained in battle  that impacted him throughout his life and are impacting him now.   His reflections on life as a soldier and an American hero remain  largely personal, but his valor endures. He is a soldier still, as he  is now scaling another battle related to his wartime service.   He is handling this with such dignity, resolve, and even good humor.  One can observe the raw courage that those of us who know him have  witnessed through his life.   John, what a truly great soldier you are in the military and in life.  America salutes you for your unyielding valor and for your deep  patriotism.   No matter the challenge, you and your life are the very definition of  courage. May God bless you and your fallen comrades, for surely you  have blessed America.                            ____________________
