 Mr. President, I call up my amendment  No. 944 and ask that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, my amendment is a very  simple amendment. It directs the Treasury Department to provide  transparency on the state of Chinese military donations to U.S.  universities. Every year, undisclosed sources within the People's  Republic of China sends millions of dollars in gifts, grants, and other  financial means to U.S. colleges and universities, and the sad fact is  we know too little about that. My amendment would be the first step in  understanding their impact.   I ask unanimous consent that the 60-vote threshold with respect to  this amendment be vitiated.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent  that we do this by voice vote as well.
