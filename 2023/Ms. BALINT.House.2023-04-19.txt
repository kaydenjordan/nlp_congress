 Mr. Chair, I rise in the strongest opposition to H.R.  734.   This is one of the most powerful bodies in our Nation. We should be  using our influence and our power for good. We should be alleviating  the suffering of our constituents and not fanning the flames of fear  and enabling discrimination.   What upsets me the most about this bill is that it is devoid of  compassion for the kids who just want to live their lives.   I was honored yesterday to meet with Rebekah Bruesehoff. This  wonderful 16-year-old girl spoke about the incredibly positive impact  sports and community have in her young life. To Rebekah and trans kids  everywhere, there are allies in Congress who care deeply about you, and  we will continue to fight for your rights.   We should not be choosing to use the power of this institution to  attack young kids who just want to live their lives.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote for the motion to recommit so  that I can offer an amendment to protect student athletes' sexual  privacy and keep schools accountable when sexual abuse occurs.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the text of this amendment.        Ms. Balint moves to recommit the bill (H.R. 734) to the       Committee on Education and the Workforce with instructions to       report the bill back to the House forthwith with the       following amendment:        Strike the text of the bill and insert the following:       SECTION 1. AMENDMENTS TO TITLE IX OF THE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS                     OF 1972.         Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C.       1681 et seq.) is amended--        (1) in section 901 by adding at end the following:        ``(d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this title shall be       construed to limit or restrict a female athlete's right to       privacy over her personal reproductive or sexual health       Information.        ``(e) Liability for Sex-based Harassment.--        ``(1) Harassment by agents, employees, and other persons       authorized by the recipient to provide an athletic program or       activity.--Subject to subsection (f), a recipient shall be       liable if its agent, employee, or other person authorized by       the recipient to provide an athletic program or activity       under the recipient's program or activity, engages in sex-      based harassment against a person who participates in or       receives any benefit, service, or opportunity from such       program or activity, or who attempts to receive such benefit,       service, or opportunity, regardless of where the harassment       occurs, if--        ``(A) the harassment is enabled or assisted by the       authority exercised as an agent, employee, or other       authorized person of the recipient; or        ``(B) the recipient receives notice of the harassment.        ``(2) Harassment by non-agents, non-employees, and other       non-authorized persons.--Subject to subsection (f), a       recipient is liable for sex-based harassment if a person who       is not its agent, employee, or other authorized person,       engages in sex-based harassment against a person who is       participating in an athletic program or activity, or who is       attempting to do so, regardless of where the harassment       occurs, if the recipient receives notice of the harassment.        ``(f) Affirmative Defense.--        ``(1) In general.--A recipient is not liable in a private       action for damages under subsection (e) for sex-based       harassment, if the recipient demonstrates that it exercised       reasonable care to prevent sex-based harassment and to       promptly remedy the effects of the sex-based harassment at       issue, including through a demonstration by the recipient       that it--        ``(A) established, adequately publicized, and enforced an       effective and comprehensive sex-based harassment prevention       policy, training, and complaint procedure that is likely to       provide redress and to avoid harm without exposing the person       subjected to such harassment to undue risk, effort, or       expense;        ``(B) if requested by an aggrieved person subjected to sex-      based harassment (or the parent or guardian of such person,       if such person is a minor), or otherwise necessary to protect       such person or other persons in such program or activity from       a significant ongoing threat of harm, undertook a prompt,       thorough, and impartial investigation of such harassment;        ``(C) provided supportive measures that have the purpose       and effect of preserving and restoring a person subjected to       sex-based harassment's equal access to the recipient's       education program or activity (including any athletic program       or activity), regardless of whether such person requests an       investigation; and        ``(D) took other necessary, immediate, and appropriate       corrective action designed to stop such harassment and remedy       its effects.        ``(2) Not establishing reasonable care.--A showing that the       harassment did not recur after the recipient received notice       of the harassment does not establish reasonable care absent       the demonstration required by subparagraphs (A) through (D)       of paragraph (1).        ``(g) Notice.--A recipient receives notice of sex-based       harassment if an agent, employee, or other authorized person       of the recipient, or in the exercise of reasonable care       should have known, about the harassment and--        ``(1) has the authority to take action to redress the       harassment;        ``(2) has the responsibility to report to an administrator       harassment or similar misconduct by others; or        ``(3) receives a report of such harassment from an       individual who could reasonably believe that the agent,       employee, or other authorized person is as described in       paragraph (1) or (2).''; and        (2) in section 903--        (A) in the 1st sentence by inserting ``(a)'' before       ``Any''; and        (B) by adding at the end of the following:        ``(b) Any person aggrieved by the failure of a recipient to       comply with section 901, or a rule issued under this title,       may bring a civil action in any court of competent       jurisdiction.        ``(c) In a civil action brought for a violation of section       901 by or on behalf of a person aggrieved by a violation of       section 901, such person may recover equitable and legal       relief (such as compensatory damages, including for emotional       distress, and punitive damages), and attorney's fees       (including expert fees).''.
