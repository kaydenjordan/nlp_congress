 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring more attention to  the censorship of conservative voices from Big Tech corporations,  particularly with DIRECTV and AT&T's decision to remove Newsmax, the  second conservative-leaning news channel in 12 months, from their  programming lineup and their customers' televisions.   The fact that conservatives have this very important outlet stolen  from them is simply unacceptable. This is just another great example of  the Big  [[Page H615]]  Tech censorship that we have seen time and again and we should not  stand for this as Americans.   The American people deserve to hear all sides of political  discussions to be able to form their own opinions on any given issue.  Corporations should not have free rein in dishing out their woke  agendas to censor content their paying customers consume. I will fight  to get more answers on this as a member of the House Oversight and  Accountability Committee.   DIRECTV and AT&T will be hearing from many of my colleagues and  constituents that are on our side in this argument, as well as their  customers from around the country to reverse this decision and prove to  the American people that they are advocates of the First Amendment, not  an obstacle for a fair and balanced political program.                            ____________________
