 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on a topic that  should continue to be in the forefront of our agenda here in Congress:  workforce training and development.   Before coming to Congress, I owned and operated a small construction  company in Lancaster County, and when we worked to expand our footprint  in central Pennsylvania and sought out new markets to expand the  business, we faced a serious problem: Many times, there just simply  were not workers available to fill the jobs that we needed to fill in  order to expand. Qualified or trained workers were just simply  unavailable.   Just recently, I met with half a dozen of the Nation's largest  staffing agencies. They told me today that this has reached crisis  proportions. They are seeing companies all across the country being  faced with the same problem that I was faced with as a business owner,  and companies now are making decisions on where to locate new  facilities, where to expand based on the available workforce in that  area. Sometimes, that is offshore rather than right here in America.   I have seen the skills gap firsthand. I have managed through it,  understood the impacts of it, and so now, in Congress, I am working to  try to fix it. One of the best ways that we can lift people up, improve  their standard of living, and create more opportunity is to connect  them with a good-paying, family-sustaining job. Let's be honest: the  best antipoverty program is a job.   Right now, our economy is booming, consumer optimism is rising, and  American manufacturing has risen in each of the last three quarters. We  have sustained economic growth, and jobs are being created all across  the country. In fact, there are roughly 6 million jobs available right  now.   Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady said it best when he said,  recently: ``We have gone from a nation that asks, `Where are the jobs?'  to one that asks, `Where are the workers?' ''   One of my priorities in Congress has been to work to expand  opportunities for work-based learning, where individuals get real  experience from real professionals as they are learning.   I was very happy to see the Strengthening Career and Technical  Education for the 21st Century Act just came back from the Senate. We  will be, hopefully, passing that onto the President's desk this  afternoon.   There is additional work that we can do; therefore, I have introduced  additional legislation that will continue this effort. H.R. 5153, the  USA Workforce Tax Credit Act, would address the urgent need to ensure  that current and future American workers are prepared for the jobs  available in today's 21st century economy.   By establishing a new Federal tax credit, this legislation would  encourage donations for community-based apprenticeship programs, career  and technical education, workforce development, and educational  preparedness, and it would encourage partnerships with companies  looking to sponsor these programs.   Encouraging investments in organizations and programs that are  preparing our workforce for the jobs of today means that more people  will be connected with a job. It means more families will be improving  their standard of living. It means that people will thrive off the  dignity that jobs provide.   But it is really more than just an investment in workforce training  programs. It is an investment in the American people.   There are so many different paths to obtaining a good-paying job. I  have my own experience of running my construction company during the  day while I was taking college courses at night. I never did quite  obtain that bachelor's degree, but I gained the skills necessary for my  industry.    My experience isn't that different from so many people in this  country. I know firsthand that there is no one-size-fits-all solution  to finding a good job or helping others get connected with one. We have  to ensure that our educational system is preparing workers to succeed  in the 21st century. We have to invest in our people. I believe that  this legislation makes a down payment and puts us on the right path.   It is my hope that Congress advances this legislation to change  lives, support families, lift people up, and support our growing  economy.                            ____________________
