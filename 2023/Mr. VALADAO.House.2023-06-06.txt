 Madam Speaker, June is National Dairy Month, and I want  to take this opportunity to thank all the dairy farmers in the Central  Valley for their commitment to supplying America with the dairy  products we all know and love.   Madam Speaker, if you are a fan of cheese, ice cream, yogurt, or just  a good old-fashioned glass of cold milk, there is a pretty good chance  it was produced in California's 22nd District.   California is the number one milk-producing State in the country,  housing over 1,100 dairies, and 99 percent of those are family owned.  Eighty percent of California's 1.7 million milk cows live in the  Central Valley. Tulare County alone houses about 450,000 milk cows.   As the Representative for America's largest dairy-producing counties  and Congress' only dairy farmer, I know firsthand the challenges the  men and women in the dairy industry face every day. However, like all  our agricultural producers in the valley, dairy farmers continue to  produce America's dairy products, care for their animals, and support  their local communities.   Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in raising a  glass of milk to our dairy farmers as we celebrate National Dairy  Month.                            ____________________
