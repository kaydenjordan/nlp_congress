 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1698) to expand sanctions against Iran with respect  to the ballistic missile program of Iran, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 1698         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Iran Ballistic Missiles and       International Sanctions Enforcement Act''.       SEC. 2. SANCTIONS RELATING TO EFFORTS BY THE GOVERNMENT OF                     IRAN WITH RESPECT TO BALLISTIC MISSILE-RELATED                     GOODS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231       (2015)--        (A) calls upon Iran ``not to undertake any activity related       to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering       nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic       missile technology''; and        (B) requires member states to ``take the necessary measures       to prevent, except as decided otherwise by the UN Security       Council in advance on a case-by-case basis, the supply, sale,       or transfer of arms or related materiel from Iran''.        (2) The United States maintains bilateral sanctions against       Iran for its efforts to manufacture, acquire, possess,       develop, transport, transfer or use ballistic missiles or       ballistic missile launch technology, and its acquisition of       destabilizing types and amounts of conventional weapons.        (3) According to the 2016 Worldwide Threat Assessment, the       United States intelligence community judges ``that Tehran       would choose ballistic missiles as its preferred method of       delivering nuclear weapons, if it builds them. Iran's       ballistic missiles are inherently capable of delivering       [weapons of mass destruction], and Tehran already has the       largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle East.       Iran's progress on space launch vehicles--along with its       desire to deter the United States and its allies--provides       Tehran with the means and motivation to develop longer-range       missiles, including ICBMs.''.        (4) Since the passage of United Nations Security Council       2231, Iran has conducted numerous tests of ballistic missiles       designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and has       acquired destabilizing types of conventional weapons.        (5) Iran has pursued the ability to indigenously produce       ballistic missile and cruise missile goods, services, and       technologies.        (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United       States to prevent Iran from undertaking any activity related       to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering       nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic       missile technology.        (c) Report on Supply Chain of Iran's Ballistic Missile       Program.--  [[Page H8169]]         (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the       appropriate congressional committees a report that contains       the following:        (A) An analysis of the foreign supply chain and domestic       supply chain in Iran that directly or indirectly       significantly facilitates, supports, or otherwise aids the       Government of Iran's ballistic missile program.

(C) An assessment of the Government of Iran's ability to       indigenously manufacture or otherwise produce the goods,       services, or technology necessary to support its ballistic       missile program.        (D) An identification of foreign persons that have, based       on credible information, directly or indirectly facilitated       or supported the development of the Government of Iran's       ballistic missile program, including the foreign and domestic       supply chain described in subparagraph (A).

The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1698         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Iran Ballistic Missiles and       International Sanctions Enforcement Act''.       SEC. 2. SANCTIONS RELATING TO EFFORTS BY THE GOVERNMENT OF                     IRAN WITH RESPECT TO BALLISTIC MISSILE-RELATED                     GOODS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231       (2015)--        (A) calls upon Iran ``not to undertake any activity related       to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering       nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic       missile technology''; and        (B) requires member states to ``take the necessary measures       to prevent, except as decided otherwise by the UN Security       Council in advance on a case-by-case basis, the supply, sale,       or transfer of arms or related materiel from Iran''.        (2) The United States maintains bilateral sanctions against       Iran for its efforts to manufacture, acquire, possess,       develop, transport, transfer or use ballistic missiles or       ballistic missile launch technology, and its acquisition of       destabilizing types and amounts of conventional weapons.        (3) According to the 2016 Worldwide Threat Assessment, the       United States intelligence community judges ``that Tehran       would choose ballistic missiles as its preferred method of       delivering nuclear weapons, if it builds them. Iran's       ballistic missiles are inherently capable of delivering       [weapons of mass destruction], and Tehran already has the       largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle East.       Iran's progress on space launch vehicles--along with its       desire to deter the United States and its allies--provides       Tehran with the means and motivation to develop longer-range       missiles, including ICBMs.''.        (4) Since the passage of United Nations Security Council       2231, Iran has conducted numerous tests of ballistic missiles       designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and has       acquired destabilizing types of conventional weapons.        (5) Iran has pursued the ability to indigenously produce       ballistic missile and cruise missile goods, services, and       technologies.        (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United       States to prevent Iran from undertaking any activity related       to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering       nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic       missile technology.        (c) Report on Supply Chain of Iran's Ballistic Missile       Program.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the       appropriate congressional committees a report that contains       the following:        (A) An analysis of the foreign supply chain and domestic       supply chain in Iran that directly or indirectly       significantly facilitates, supports, or otherwise aids the       Government of Iran's ballistic missile program.        (B) A description of the geographic distribution of the       foreign and domestic supply chain described in subparagraph       (A).        (C) An assessment of the Government of Iran's ability to       indigenously manufacture or otherwise produce the goods,       services, or technology necessary to support its ballistic       missile program.        (D) An identification of foreign persons that have, based       on credible information, directly or indirectly facilitated       or supported the development of the Government of Iran's       ballistic missile program, including the foreign and domestic       supply chain described in subparagraph (A).        (E) A determination with respect to each foreign person       identified under subparagraph (D) as to whether the foreign       person meets the criteria for designation under--        (i) paragraph (1) of section 5(b) of the Iran Sanctions Act       of 1996 (Public Law 104-172; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note), as amended       by this section;        (ii) section 104 of the Countering America's Adversaries       Through Sanctions Act (Public Law 115-44); or        (iii) Executive Order 13382 (2005).

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today the House of Representatives here considers four  measures that we have worked on in a bipartisan way, four measures that  are consistent with the President's call for an approach to Iran that  addresses the full range of threats that it possesses to not just the  United States, but to our allies, to our partners as well.   This legislation, which I have authored along with my colleague,  Eliot Engel, I am proud to say we now have 323 cosponsors to this bill.  This is the bipartisan Iran Ballistic Missiles and International  Sanctions Enforcement Act.   What this does is respond to the regime's continued pursuit of  intercontinental ballistic missiles and to dangerous conventional  weapons.   Mr. Speaker, I will begin by thanking my good friend, Mr. Engel, for  his hard work, his collaboration, along with Mr. Steny Hoyer and Mr.  McCarthy, in bringing this important legislation to this floor.   Iran has already developed an arsenal of short- and medium-range  ballistic missiles, and those missiles put our allies, our partners, as  well as U.S. forces in range.   Now Iran is working on intercontinental ballistic missiles. I think  to get the point across, I would just quote our former Secretary of  Defense, Ash Carter, because he testified before Congress on this  issue. What he conveyed to us is: `` . . . the I in ICBM stands for  intercontinental, which means having the capability from flying from  Iran to the United States, and we don't want that.''   That was the way he explained this.   One of the reasons that we don't want that is that intercontinental  ballistic missiles are inherently capable of carrying nuclear weapons.  In fact, as one expert told the Foreign Affairs Committee, ``no country  that has not aspired to possess nuclear weapons has ever opted to  sustain'' a lengthy and expensive missile program.   I would take issue with that. I do know of one exception to that  rule. That exception was South Africa under the apartheid regime, which  did develop the atomic weapon. It is an example of how sanctions can be  successful, because when we passed sanctions here, the consequence was  they made a decision to turn that weapon back over to the IAEA, as well  as to allow Nelson Mandela to leave jail, and they held elections. That  is the exception I know of.   So whether you supported the nuclear deal or whether you opposed that  nuclear deal, this other issue should concern you either way. By  developing the delivery system, Iran is keeping its options open.   So from those who worked on the deal, one of the architects, Jake  Sullivan of the former administration, made it clear to us--and this  was 2 weeks ago--that imposing costs on Iran for its continued pursuit  of ballistic missiles and other destabilizing activity is ``not only  necessary, but justified.''   That is one of the architects of the agreement itself.   That is what this bill does. It requires a comprehensive  investigation to identify and designate the companies, the banks, the  individuals inside and outside of Iran which supply the regime's  missiles and supply their conventional weapons programs, and it  sanctions them. In doing so, it shuts out Iranian and foreign companies  involved in Iran's missile program. It also shuts out the banks that  back them. It shuts them out from the global financial system.   This bill expands Iran sanctions that we passed and were signed into  law in August with H.R. 3364, the Countering America's Adversaries  Through Sanctions Act.   For example, while the bill that passed over the summer specifically  sanctions those who materially contribute to Iran's ballistic missile  program, the bill before us today goes a step further by sanctioning  those that are in the business of financing Iran's efforts.   The conventional weapons prohibition in the bill before us are also  stronger, and let me explain why. The August legislation referenced the  United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, which excludes such items  as Russia's recent sale of the S-300 air defense system to Iran. The  bill before us ensures that there is no such carve-out.   Mr. Speaker, Members have different views on how to handle Iran's  nuclear program, but when it comes to Iran's ballistic missile and  conventional weapons programs, all 323 cosponsors of this bill agree:  Iran has no business developing or acquiring intercontinental ballistic  missiles. That is why it is so important that we pass this bill and  give the administration the tools to respond.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions       in H.R. 1698 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Ways and Means, I agree to waive formal       consideration of this bill so that it may move expeditiously       to the floor. The Committee on Ways and Means takes this       action with the mutual understanding that we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       that fall within our jurisdiction. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of an  [[Page H8175]]       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation, and       requests your support for such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 1698.

Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 1698, the Iran Ballistic       Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act, so that       the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this resolution or similar legislation in the future. I       would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees from your committee to any       House-Senate conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 1698 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.

As a result of your having consulted with the Committee on       Financial Services concerning provisions in the bill that       fall within our Rule X jurisdiction, I agree to forgo action       on the bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House       Floor.

Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I write concerning H.R. 1698, the ``Iran       Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement       Act.'' This bill would expand sanctions against Iran with       respect to the ballistic missile program of Iran and contains       provisions within the jurisdiction of the Committee on       Oversight and Government Reform. As a result of your having       consulted with me concerning the provisions of the bill that       fall within our Rule X jurisdiction, I agree to forgo       consideration of the bill so the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.

Further, I request your support for the appointment of       conferees from the Committee on Oversight and Government       Reform during any House-Senate conference convened on this or       related legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding and ask that a copy of our       exchange of letters on this matter be included in the bill       report filed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, as well as       in the Congressional Record during floor consideration       thereof.

Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Gowdy: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 1698, the Iran Ballistic       Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act, so that       the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.

I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 1698 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), chairman of the Committee on  Homeland Security. He is a former Federal prosecutor and a senior  member of our Committee on Foreign Affairs.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, let me first commend Chairman Royce and  Ranking Member Eliot Engel for their strong bipartisan work on this  very important legislation that sanctions Iran's ballistic missile  program and the Iranian-backed terror group Hezbollah.   Over the last several decades, the tyrannical regime in Iran has been  racing to develop a nuclear weapons program that could threaten the  United States and our allies and potentially spark an arms race in the  Middle East.   Unfortunately, the extremely flawed JCPOA kept parts of Iran's  nuclear infrastructure in place and strengthened the regime's leader  with a windfall of cash. Because this toothless deal failed to address  Iran's other malign activities, such as support for terror and their  intercontinental ballistic missile program, we must now find other ways  to apply new pressure.   Fortunately, the House is taking action today. One of the bills we  are considering will require the President to impose additional  sanctions on enemies and individuals supporting Iran's development of  ballistic missiles. I sincerely hope that we can soon add even more  pressure on Iran by designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps  as a foreign terrorist organization, legislation I pursued in the last  two Congresses.   Going after state sponsors is an important part of winning this  fight, but we must fight also directly individual terror groups to  limit the resources to prevent future attacks. That is why I am pleased  that we also are considering measures to target Hezbollah.   This package would direct the President to impose new sanctions on  financial institutions and foreign governments that support Hezbollah  and affiliated organizations, as well as individual members of the  terror groups, that they have used civilians as human shields.                                time  1445    I will say it is Hezbollah that killed so many of our marines in  Beirut, Lebanon, let us not forget.   The chairman and ranking member and I recently visited Israel, Prime  Minister Netanyahu, who described the Shia Crescent of Iran going into  Iraq, into Syria, into Lebanon. He talked to us about the manufacturing  plant in Lebanon manufacturing rockets pointed straight at the State of  Israel.   These bills, I believe, will take us steps closer toward ridding the  world of this terrible threat posed by Islamic terror.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the esteemed majority leader  of the House.   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to  me. I want to thank the gentleman for his work as chairman of the  Foreign Affairs Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I stand on this floor thinking of the world and  America's place in it. What I desire most is peace. America has no  desire to fight those who do not harm us. I would gladly support any  international agreement that I thought would bring us to an honorable  and enduring peace.   But peace is not based on hope; it is not based on good intentions;  and it is not based on pieces of paper signed at well-planned  ceremonies. Peace is based on strength. America and our allies will  only be at peace if those who hate us fear us. This is where our  credibility matters.   When an American President agrees to a deal that is so obviously  unequal and untenable, everyone stops fearing us. They start to think  they can push us around.   Let me be clear. They may start to push, but no one can knock us  down. America will win any fight. Our enemies should know that. But,  frankly, I want our enemies to be so afraid of us they don't even want  to fight. That saves everyone a great deal of trouble.   When I look back to our nuclear deal with North Korea and our deal  with Iran, they aren't just flawed; they are dangerous. The displays of  weakness have consequences beyond nuclear weapons.   Our North Korea deal has failed. The Kim regime will soon have  nuclear warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles. These warheads  will be capable of hitting our homeland. In the meantime, they have  reportedly fired missiles over our allies South Korea and Japan and,  almost daily, threatened war.   The deal with Iran is on a path to failure, designed in such a way  that, even if it were followed, a regime that chants ``death to  America''--let me say that again, a regime that chants ``death to  America''--could have nuclear weapons the day after the deal expires.   Even ignoring the deal, Iran continues to destabilize the region for  its own goal, funding terrorism abroad and fueling violence between  Shia and Sunni Muslims that is tearing the Middle East apart.   The spread of nuclear weapons is a danger in and of itself. I do not  need to explain why enemies of the United States should be stopped from  gaining the power to level American cities, but the evil is made worse  when our enemies, with any weapons, think they can push America and our  allies around.   America will not be weak any longer. Today's sanction on Iran  undermines its ballistic missile program and the terrorist warriors of  Hezbollah whose pockets are filled with Iranian money,  [[Page H8177]]  just as their hands are covered with American blood. This is an  important part of our Nation's new Iran strategy.   Yesterday, we passed the most far-reaching sanctions we have ever  imposed on North Korea. Those who do business with North Korea support  a regime run on slave labor. They support a regime that deprives its  citizens of every freedom, even the freedom to think, and they support  a regime that tortured and murdered American citizen Otto Warmbier not  because he committed a crime or threatened their government in any way,  but because he was an American. If you do business with such a regime,  there will be severe consequences.   I had the honor of meeting Otto's parents, Cindy and Fred. They told  me about Otto's warmth, his joy, his love of life, and the great hopes  he had. In everything, he stood as a living example of the good in  humanity that the Kim regime seeks to destroy. We renamed that  legislation as the Otto Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanctions Act. It  won't bring him back, but it will remind North Korea that evil has  consequences.   Otto's murder was a crime we cannot accept, but it is a crime, I  fear, our enemies would repeat on a much larger scale if we do not  start stopping them now. Let's remind them who they are up against.  America will not fail.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, and she is  the author of multiple laws addressing the Iranian threat.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for authoring  this bill alongside our good friend Ranking Member Eliot Engel, the  dynamic duo of Foreign Affairs. I want to thank them for their  leadership and their continued effort in holding Iran accountable.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill is called the Iran Ballistic  Missile and International Sanctions Enforcement Act, authored by our  chairman and ranking member. It is a strong and important bill. It  sanctions Iranian and foreign persons and entities that support, that  facilitate, that finance Iran's ballistic missile program. It is a  necessary measure because, as we know, Iran has felt emboldened to  continue advancing its missile program since the P5+1 and Iran  concluded the weak nuclear deal.   Tehran has taken advantage of this deal and the U.N. Security Council  resolution that endorsed the agreement. Despite language that prohibits  Iran's ballistic missile testing in U.N. Resolution 2231, Iran has  actually increased its missile activities, violating both the spirit  and the letter of the resolution.    With the President having made his determination 2 weeks ago that  Iran is not in compliance with its commitments under the Iran Nuclear  Agreement Review Act, we now have an opportunity to address the  weakness in the nuclear deal and also Iran's illicit activity.   We must continue to press forward on a dual track. We must continue  to hold Iran accountable for its nonnuclear illicit activity, while  also looking to address our concerns with the nuclear deal. They are  not mutually exclusive, Mr. Speaker. Both are extremely important for  our national security. This is an important step.   I thank the Members for their great leadership. I support passage of  Chairman Royce and Eliot Engel's measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe). He is the chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe). He is the chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to submit any statements or any  material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all our members who worked on this bill.  Over the last few years, the Foreign Affairs Committee has conducted  dedicated oversight of the threats posed by Iran, and we have had  dozens of hearings. And whether the topic was the nuclear program, or  the missile program, or Iran's support for terrorism, or the regime's  human rights abuses, the conclusion was clear. The United States must  respond to the full range of threats, and with this bill and the others  before us, that is what we are doing here today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3342) to impose sanctions on foreign persons that  are responsible for gross violations of internationally recognized  human rights by reason of the use by Hizballah of civilians as human  shields, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3342         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Sanctioning Hizballah's       Illicit Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Human shields are civilians, prisoners of war, and       other noncombatants whose presence is designed to protect       combatants and military objects from attack, and the use of       human shields violates international law.        (2) Throughout the 2006 conflict with the State of Israel,       Hizballah forces utilized human shields to protect themselves       from counterattacks by Israeli forces, including storing       weapons inside civilian homes and firing rockets from inside       populated civilian areas.        (3) Hizballah has rearmed to include an arsenal of over       150,000 missiles, and other destabilizing weapons provided by       the Syrian and Iranian governments, which are concealed in       Shiite villages in southern Lebanon, often beneath civilian       infrastructure.        (4) Hizballah is legally required to disarm under both       United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006) and       the Taif Agreement (1989).        (5) Hizballah maintains an armed military force within       Lebanon's sovereign territory in direct violation of United       Nations Security Council Resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1680       (2006), thus preventing Lebanon from exerting its lawful       control over its internationally recognized borders.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It shall be the policy of the United States to consider the       use of human shields by Hizballah as a gross violation of       internationally recognized human rights, to officially and       publicly condemn the use of innocent civilians as human       shields by Hizballah, and to take effective action against       those that engage in the grave breach of international law       through the use of human shields.       SEC. 4. UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL.         The President should direct the United States Permanent       Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote,       and influence of the United States at the United Nations       Security Council to secure support for a resolution that       would impose multilateral sanctions against Hizballah for its       use of civilians as human shields.       SEC. 5. IDENTIFICATION OF FOREIGN PERSONS THAT ARE                     RESPONSIBLE FOR GROSS VIOLATIONS OF                     INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HUMAN RIGHTS BY                     REASON OF USE BY HIZBALLAH OF CIVILIANS AS                     HUMAN SHIELDS.

(B) Each foreign person, or agency or instrumentality of a       foreign state, that the President determines has provided,       attempted to provide, or significantly facilitated the       provision of, material support to a person described in       subparagraph (A).        (2) Updates.--The President shall transmit to the       appropriate congressional committees an update of the list       required under paragraph (1) as new information becomes       available.

(2) Aliens ineligible for visas, admission, or parole.--        (A) Visas, admission, or parole.--An alien who the       Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security       determines is a foreign person on the list required under       subsection (b) is--        (i) inadmissible to the United States;        (ii) ineligible to receive a visa or other documentation to       enter the United States; and        (iii) otherwise ineligible to be admitted or paroled into       the United States or to receive any other benefit under the       Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.).        (B) Current visas revoked.--  [[Page H8179]]         (i) In general.--Any visa or other documentation issued to       an alien who is a foreign person on the list required under       subsection (b), regardless of when such visa or other       documentation was issued, shall be revoked and such alien       shall be denied admission to the United States.        (ii) Effect of revocation.--A revocation under clause (i)--         (I) shall take effect immediately; and        (II) shall automatically cancel any other valid visa or       documentation that is in the possession of the alien who is       the subject of such revocation.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each  will control 20 minutes.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members might have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am rising in strong support to this Shields Act, as we  call it, which sanctions Hezbollah, sanctions them for their use in  southern Lebanon of not only families, but entire villages as human  shields; and let me explain this.   As we have discussed today, the Iranian-backed terrorist  organization, Hezbollah, has constructed an entire military apparatus  in the nation that sits just north of Israel's northern border in  Lebanon. It is now complete with missile production facilities that are  intended to strike at Israel's civilian centers.   I do want to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher) for  his leadership because he has helped bring this critical attention to  us today.   But, in the process, as we talk about Hezbollah, they have placed  Israeli and Lebanese civilians directly into the path of the conflict.  If you go to that border, as I have done, you can see command post  after command post, not manned by the Lebanese Armed Forces. Those  flags you see are not Lebanese flags, they are Hezbollah battle flags.  And they man those posts, surrounded by antitank and infantry  positions, surrounded by underground tunnels and rocket launchers and  arms depots. In short, countless Lebanese villages are, in effect,  military bases, the ones that are right along that border, financed and  equipped by Iran.   No one has the right to sacrifice the lives of innocent women and  children, and certainly not those dedicated to the twisted and evil  goals of destroying the State of Israel.   When I say I have seen this firsthand, in 2006, I was in Haifa during  the war that Hezbollah was conducting with Israel, and Hezbollah forces  used human shields extensively in a cowardly effort to protect their  rocket launchers from counterattacks by Israeli forces. I watched as  those rockets came into civilian populations in Haifa and exploded  there, and sent those civilians to the trauma hospital.   In Rambam trauma hospital, as they were bringing people in, I asked  for the count that day. There were 600 victims, wounded victims of  those attacks, being treated in that hospital--Arab Israelis, Jewish  Israelis, Druid Israelis, all of them victims of those Hezbollah  attacks.   It seems--and by the way, when you see the devastation, every one of  those Iranian-made missiles has 90,000 ball bearings in it, and that is  what they are launching on schools, civilian areas. They attempted to  hit the hospital itself.   It seems that Hezbollah and its Iranian backers are willing to fight  to the  [[Page H8180]]  last villager there in their quest to annihilate the people of Israel,  yet neither Hezbollah nor Iran has been held to account by responsible  nations for these egregious crimes.   While Foreign Minister Zarif of Iran was coddled by the EU, this  issue was never raised, not by us, not by the EU. We never raised this  with the Iranians as a serious issue. We have to because the  willingness to overlook these human rights violations is why we find  ourselves in the position that we are in today and why this legislation  is critically important.   This bill calls on the U.S. and its partners to hold Hezbollah and  Iran accountable through targeted sanctions and appropriate action at  the United Nations Security Council.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 3342, Sanctioning Hizballah's       Illicit Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act, so that       the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this resolution or similar legislation in the future. I       would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees from your committee to any       House-Senate conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 3342 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.

Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: I am writing with respect to H.R.       3342, the ``Sanctioning Hizballah's Illicit Use of Civilians       as Defenseless Shields Act.''        As a result of your having consulted with us on this       measure, I agree not to seek a sequential referral on this       bill so that it may move expeditiously to the floor. The       Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the mutual       understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       the bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues that fall within our       jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the right to seek       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this or similar       legislation, and requests your support for such request.

Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to forgo a sequential       referral request on H.R. 3342, Sanctioning Hizballah's       Illicit Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act, so that       the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.

I       would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees from your committee to any       House-Senate conference on this legislation.

Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher). He is a member of the Armed  Services and Homeland Security Committees. He is also the author of  this bill, along with Mr. Tom Suozzi of New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), the chairman of the  Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), the chairman of the  Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lethinen), who chairs the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank our dynamic duo once again for  this wonderful legislation and for bringing this bill before us this  afternoon. I rise in strong support of H.R. 3342, Sanctioning  Hizballah's Illicit Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act,  authored by our friends, Congressmen Gallagher and Suozzi. I thank the  gentleman for their leadership.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I applaud  our effort here in the House to take up several measures, as you have  heard, that address a variety of threats that Iran and its proxies pose  to our national security and the security of those in the region.   The use of human shields is unconscionable, morally unacceptable, and  a clear violation of human rights. Yet for terrorist groups such as  Iran proxies, Hezbollah, and Hamas, the use of human shields is an  acceptable tactic. It is a tactic used because they engage in terror  activity and asymmetric warfare. They don't have the same beliefs and  morals of the United States or Israel.                                time  1530    It is an attempt to cause innocents to be dragged into their conflict  and to cause as many casualties as they can with no regard whatsoever  for human life.   Iran and Hezbollah know that if they engage in hostilities with  Israel, the world will be quick to blame Israel for civilian deaths  despite the great precautions Israel takes to not only save human  lives, but to only go against belligerents.   Responsible nations must condemn this tactic by Hezbollah and by all  of its state sponsors of terrorism. We must take action to hold anyone  who engages in such actions accountable.   Iran and Hezbollah will continue to take advantage of our morality-- what they perceive to be a weakness on our part--and they will continue  to employ the use of human shields during armed conflicts until the  world sends a strong and unified message, and that is what this bill  does.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and I thank the ranking member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Garrett), who is a member of the Foreign  Affairs and Homeland Security Committees.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from  Virginia an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, I did want to say I have had the opportunity to travel  extensively with Mr. Engel and to observe him and his work here in this  House for many years. He has always transcended partisanship in my  view, but, more importantly, from my standpoint, he has been a servant  of the national interests here and the core values of the United States  of America and our attempt to represent those core values around the  world.   I want to take this moment, especially given his eloquent statement  here about these values as he spoke about Hezbollah. These are values  that I think all of us should share.   The Geneva Convention, itself, establishes standards for  international law, and it does so for the protection of civilians in a  war zone. They specifically prohibit, under that Geneva Convention, of  course, the use of civilians as human shields. It is article 58 of the  Convention's additional protocols that require parties of any conflict  to avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated  areas.   So, to date, Hezbollah's arsenal is well over 100,000. As I shared  with you, all of them are manufactured today by Iran. Those rockets and  missiles of various ranges today include precision-guided missiles.   I spoke earlier of 2006, the second Lebanon War. That actually should  be called the Hezbollah war. At that time, as I talked about the 600  victims that were in the trauma hospital, they were down to an  inventory of 10,000 missiles. Today, they have, in the hands of  Hezbollah--again, because of Iran--over 100,000 such rockets and  missiles.   So I think, yes, Hezbollah has blatantly violated the well- established laws of armed conflict. It has targeted civilians for more  than two decades in both Lebanon and Israel. As a result, both peoples  are victims of Hezbollah's--and, frankly, of Iran's--brutality, and it  is high time we hold them accountable. This we try to do in this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, Mr. Engel, and I yield back the balance  of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 3342, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3329) to amend the Hizballah International  Financing Prevention Act of 2015 to impose additional sanctions with  respect to Hizballah, and for other purposes, as amended.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today we will consider legislation targeting Hezbollah,  Iran's leading terrorist proxy, with tough, new sanctions.   It was 34 years ago this Monday that a truck bomb filled with  explosives  [[Page H8189]]  detonated outside the United States Marine Corps barracks in Beirut,  Lebanon, killing 241 of our servicemen. Between 1982 and 1984, we had  272 marines, soldiers, and sailors from 39 States and Puerto Rico lose  their lives while serving as peacekeepers in Beirut. Hezbollah was  behind those attacks.   Since that fateful day, Hezbollah has collaborated with Iran to  expand terror throughout the region, taking hundreds of thousands of  lives if we count the lives of human beings lost in Syria, in Yemen, in  Iraq, and in Gaza.   Today, as a leading Iranian proxy, Hezbollah continues to be Iran's  front line against Israel. Since its 2006 war with Israel, Hezbollah  has dramatically grown its supply of rockets and missiles, allowing it  to strike throughout Israel with great precision and force.   It is by putting that military power to very effective use that it  has gleaned through what it has learned on the ground in Syria. In  Syria, its fighters are key to Tehran and its efforts to prop up the  Assad regime, working with the Revolutionary Guard and also working  with Russian troops there.   So now Hezbollah and Iran are reportedly working to introduce game- changing weapons into Lebanon and Syria, and that is what brings about  this particular bill. What they are trying to do is produce facilities  for sophisticated rockets and missiles there on the ground, on the  border in Syria, on the border, also, in Lebanon, and that could lead  to another war.   It is not a cheap effort to do this. That is why the committee is  focused on dismantling Hezbollah's financial networks. In 2015, we led  the way to enact the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act  to target those that facilitate financial transactions for Hezbollah.   Now this bill builds on that effort to further ramp up pressure on  the Iranian proxy, Hezbollah. It sanctions regimes, including Iran and  Syria, that provide weapons to Hezbollah--in other words, an attempt to  stop the transfer of these weapons. It targets Hezbollah's innovative  fundraising and recruiting efforts, including its attempts to  crowdsource small donations to support its fighters, which is the  latest evolution of Hezbollah's efforts.                                time  1545    Hezbollah launched an online crowdsourcing campaign entitled: ``Equip  a Mujahid,'' which calls for donations, large or small, payable in  installments or in one sum, to equip suicide bombers and Hezbollah  fighters.   This bill recognizes that Hezbollah is no longer only a terrorist  group, but is also a global criminal organization, which has developed  a global criminal network that profits from drug trafficking, money  laundering, counterfeiting, and cigarette smuggling, and it gives the  administration the tools to respond accordingly.   Mr. Speaker, for years, this body has led the way in calling for the  need to respond to the full range of threats from Iran. Hezbollah, the  regime's leading terrorist proxy, ranks among the top of those threats,  in terms of what is being encountered right now.   So I urge my colleagues to support this effort to ensure that the  United States has the tools to respond.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
