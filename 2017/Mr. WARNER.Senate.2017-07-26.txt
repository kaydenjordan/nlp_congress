 Mr. President, first of all, I thank my friend, the  Senator from Massachusetts, for her comments today and for her  relentless willingness to take on this fight and so many other fights  that are so important to our country.   I come to join her call to point out some of the challenges in this  legislation but also to make an appeal to my friends on the other side  that this does not have to be the way we go. I have been one who has  acknowledged for many years that there are challenges in the Affordable  Care Act and that there are areas in which there could be common  interests in finding solutions, but what we have before us now is a  series of ``bad, badder, and baddest'' choices. In effect, we have a  series of options that ask: Do we want to pass legislation that would  take 16 million Americans off healthcare? Do we want to pass  legislation that would take 22 million people off healthcare? Do we  want to pass legislation that would take 32 million Americans off  health insurance?   What parts of these choices do my Republican colleagues really  embrace?   I think that in the 8 years I have been here, I have never seen a  series of pieces of legislation that have been so unpopular, even  before they are passed, than this litany of options from full repeal to  skinny repeal and all of the variations in between.   As has been said by the Senator from Massachusetts and I know by the  Senator from Washington State as well, the American people know this.  That is why our phones are ringing in our offices and I know in our  Senate Republican colleagues' offices. People are saying do not pass  this kind of legislation.   I think about the fact that in the last couple of weeks, the parents  of a number of children and young adults who have enormous disabilities  have come to my office. In Virginia, we run a very skinny Medicaid  Program. Frankly, it has not been very generous. Some of the  individuals who have come to my office have waited 5, 6 years--one  person has waited 10 years--to get a Medicaid waiver. These families,  these children, in any of the proposals that have been put forward,  would be the first to lose their coverage.   Family after family talked about the fact that, right now, both  parents can work because they have a little bit of relief to take care  of their disabled young adults in certain cases. In many cases, it is  because the young adults can at least find someplace to do some  productive work themselves. Yet, if they were to lose the Medicaid  waiver, one of the parents would have to stop working, and the child  would have to stop his form of employment. Net-net, it would be a loss  not only to that family, but it would be a loss to our economy.   I mentioned that I used to be the Governor of Virginia. In 2016,  Virginia received about $4 billion in Federal Medicaid funds--51  percent of the State's funding for people covered by Medicaid. As I  mentioned, we are ranked one of the skinniest programs in the country.  Unfortunately, we rank about 47th, I believe, in terms of our payments.  Yet, under any of these proposals that decimate Medicaid, Virginia  would be penalized for running an efficient program.   Again, one of the ironies of this is that the States that are the  least penalized in the Republican proposals, in terms of the $700  billion-plus of Medicaid cuts, are actually the States that have more  generous programs. They are often States that are represented by  Democratic Governors. In what way do these proposals help our  Republican colleagues or, for that matter, their constituents?   We have heard, as well, that the American Cancer Society, the  American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the  American Hospital Association, and AARP--a who's who of groups  affiliated with healthcare--have come in and pleaded: Please, do not do  this, this way--any one of these litany of proposals that we will be  dealing with over the next few days.   From what I have heard on an individual basis--and I take enormous  pride in the fact that in my time here--and sometimes it has even  gotten me crosswise with the ranking member of the HELP Committee--I  have tried to reach out on virtually every piece of legislation I have  worked on to find a Republican partner. I actually got put in a timeout  by a previous leader for doing too much of that.   What I hear from my Republican colleagues is, they do not want to own  this. They know, in many ways, that this is walking the plank on what  is both bad policy, bad politics, bad for their constituents, but the  notion that somehow they have to provide a win for a President who has  provided zero leadership before they can take some kind of August  recess is literally the worst reasoning I have heard in my 8 years in  the Senate as to why to pass a piece of legislation, particularly a  piece of legislation that affects one-sixth of our economy. In many  ways, it is almost one-third of the people who will be affected by some  of these changes.   I think many of us were touched yesterday when we saw Senator McCain,  who is an American hero and who himself is having to grapple with  enormous healthcare challenges, come back to the floor and, frankly,  admonish us appropriately but also say that while he was going to vote  to start debate on this bill, the real way we ought to go about doing  this is to roll up our sleeves, in a bipartisan fashion, and take this  legislation back to where it should start, which is in the HELP  Committee, where the Senator from Washington serves, in the Budget  Committee, whose chairman is on the floor, and in the Finance  Committee. Two of those three committees I have the honor of serving  on.   I commit to my Republican colleagues that I will work with them. I  have laid out a series of ideas, some of which they have endorsed in  terms of there potentially being cheaper options, in terms of  selections; the idea, as long as we protect consumers, of allowing  insurance policies to be sold across State lines and other ideas in  terms of reinsurance that other colleagues have worked on. There are a  host of ideas we all agree on. Let's start with that premise, in terms  of coming to a solution, not coming up with legislation that is cooked  up behind closed doors that even my strongest Republican colleagues  have acknowledged they cannot vote on when they only get an hour to  look at it.   Think about all of the same criticisms--some of them valid--that were  made against the Democrats when we passed the ACA; although I would  continue to remind my friends that we had, literally, hundreds of  amendments which were Republican amendments that were accepted into  that legislation. It was not a perfect process, but let's learn from  that and take this advantage right now. Listen to the American public,  and let's work together to get this right.   The other item that will come about from any of this Republican  legislation put forward, even from the skinniest of their proposals,  would dramatically affect those individuals with preexisting  conditions. I have three daughters. One of my daughters has juvenile  diabetes. She has had it for 18 years. Another daughter has asthma and  a very strange set of allergic reactions that have actually caused her  to have been hospitalized 38 times in the last 40 months.   I am an extraordinarily lucky individual. I know that both through  health insurance and because I had the resources, every time my two  children got sick, I could make sure they got the medical attention  they deserved. I cannot imagine talking to any Virginia family or  Washington family or Wyoming family or Arkansas family who has a child  with those same afflictions and trying to explain to them that my kids  who have juvenile diabetes, asthma, and allergic reactions--through no  fault of their own and that have caused this number of  hospitalizations--have a right to healthcare and that their kids who  have preexisting conditions do not have that right.   Our country is much better than this. We can figure out a way to get  this right, but we are not going to get it right if we continue to have  this ploy of one closed-door, cooked-up deal after another that is put  forward, with no review and no real attempt to find a common solution.   I do not come to the floor that often, and I do not often talk about  the medical needs of my family. This is for the sake of not only my  kids who get the coverage they need and deserve but for  [[Page S4233]]  all the kids who now get the coverage they did not have prior to the  ACA and who have it now. It is the idea that insurance companies cannot  discriminate against you because you have preexisting conditions.   Let's see if we can make sure we maintain that commitment. In the  greatest country in the world, as Senator McCain so eloquently put it  yesterday, let's see if we can work through to a way that makes this  body, once again, the greatest deliberative body in the world. Let's  see if we can find that common ground that would allow us to put  forward legislation that at the end of the day, we would all be proud  of. That is a goal worth working on.   My hope is, over the coming days, we will find that common group of  Senators who will say we are going to take that path rather than the  path we are on right now.   I yield the floor.
