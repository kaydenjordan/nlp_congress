 Madam Speaker, I rise today for my mother, my sister- in-law, and the millions of Americans living with diabetes.   Diabetes is an epidemic in which one in five healthcare dollars in  the United States is spent caring for patients with this disease.   Communities of color are disproportionately affected by the disease.  I know because, in my congressional district, we have the highest rate  of diabetes, higher than any other congressional district in the State  of California.   Those with diabetes use insulin to maintain blood sugar levels.  Without it, it becomes a matter of life and death. This is why I am  especially appalled at the skyrocketing cost of this lifesaving drug.   At this very moment, the Committee on Energy and Commerce is having  an oversight hearing about the rising cost of insulin. Tomorrow, the  whole committee will mark up legislation, which, if passed, will help  reduce the cost of prescription drugs.   This should not be a partisan issue, and I call on my Republican  colleagues and the President to work with us to help all Americans and  work for the people.                            ____________________
