 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks 2 years  since the previous administration capitulated to the dangerous Iran  deal, a one-sided agreement that rewarded the regime in Tehran with a  $1.7 billion ransom of pallets of unmarked currency for four hostages  and put our allies, including Israel, at risk. The Iran deal emboldened  the authoritarian regime.   Just last month, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley correctly  pointed out that Tehran has engaged in destructive and destabilizing  actions, both testing ballistic missiles and engaging in arms  smuggling.   This week, Senators Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and David  Perdue, sent a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urging him  not to certify Iran's compliance with the Iran deal as the deadline  approaches.   Refusing to certify Iran's compliance with the Iran deal would send a  clear message that President Donald Trump is committed to peace through  strength and refuses to comply with a ridiculous deal that puts  American families at risk.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
