 Mr. President, I have a motion to commit at the desk,  and I ask that it be reported.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2  minutes of debate equally divided.    Mr. President, one of our top priorities will be the  surface transportation reauthorization bill.   Our EPW Committee has already kicked off bipartisan efforts to meet  our Nation's transportation needs. Every State needs the certainty of a  long-term reauthorization plan to complete projects. Paying for  infrastructure is a difficult challenge. A status quo reauthorization  bill would require at least $70 billion in new funding for the highway  trust fund, which we all know falls short, and we all want to make sure  that we make robust investments in our roads and bridges.   The bill on the floor provides $350 billion to State and local on top  of the $150 billion that was provided in the CARES Act. This motion  instructs the Finance Committee to divert some of that $350 billion to,  instead, help pay forward for a bipartisan surface transportation  reauthorization bill. Funds would still go to our States and  localities, but the dollars would be better spent on road and bridge  projects that create a safer and more efficient transportation system.   I urge my colleagues to support the motion to commit.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
