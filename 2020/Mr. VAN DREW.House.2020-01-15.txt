 Mr. Speaker, today I would like to recognize John  Walczak. He is retiring after an impressive 37 years and 2 months at  the FAA. He started working at the FAA in 1982 as a student through  Stockton State College now called Stockton University.   He learned three computer languages: Ultra, JOVIAL, and Basic  Assembly Language. He started working full-time in 1984 as a computer  programmer and worked his way up the ranks over the years to become  STARS DT&E Test Director, which eventually would become IDQT Test  Director. He was also the application lead for requirements. John  retired on January 3, 2020.   I thank John, his community thanks him, and his country thanks him  for his service. Our world is safer because of John and the work that  he has done.   We are so unbelievably proud of your accomplishments, John.  Congratulations, and may God bless you.                            ____________________
