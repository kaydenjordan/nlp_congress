 Madam Speaker, I strongly support the Emmett Till  Antilynching Act. I will be proud to vote in favor of it on the House  floor today. I have continuously fought against racial violence and  racial discrimination, and this legislation is an important step  forward.   This bill recognizes the federal role in directly confronting this  type of racial violence. In his case, Emmett Till, an innocent African  American boy, lost his life. His death came to symbolize the continual  threat of violence that hung over the African American community and  helped spark the Civil Rights Movement. But this bill, named for Till,  goes beyond his circumstances. It also provides some modicum of justice  for the victims of the People's Grocery Lynching in Memphis. Thomas  Moss, Calvin McDowell, and Will Stewart were falsely accused and killed  in Memphis on March 9, 1892. These three men were killed because they  ``were becoming economic competitors to whites.'' For my district and  the country, this vote is recognizing all the men and women who were  lynched and never received any justice.   In passing this bill, the House of Representatives will clearly say  these types of actions--this type of hate--have no place in our  country.   Unfortunately, this isn't a historic phenomenon. Now, in the year  2020, we still struggle with bias motivated crimes, racial violence,  and vigilantism. We see the continuation of racial violence directed at  African Americans and other minorities today.   I will continue to fight for equality and racial justice. I am proud  to support this legislation and thank Rep. Bobby Rush, Speaker Pelosi,  Leader Hoyer, and Chairman Nadler for their leadership.
