 Madam Speaker, when I arrived here in Congress in  2005, there was a necessary facility, also known as the men's room,  right across diagonally from me outside of this Chamber. There was no  such facility for women. In fact, it was the Parliamentarian's office  to my left, just outside of this facility.   Madam Speaker, it was under the leadership of the Honorable Nancy  Pelosi that we now have equal facilities for men and women just off the  floor of the House. Things change, but they don't change on their own  volition. The arc of the universe, the moral universe, bends because of  the hands of women and men.   Today, we have an opportunity to again treat women with the same  level of dignity and respect who are in the military as we do those who  are without the military, and, to a certain extent, the same way we  were treating men when I arrived in this Congress.   Things change. This is an opportunity to be a part of an historic  change. It may seem small to you, but  [[Page H3097]]  to the people who have to bear the burden of this invidious  discrimination, it is not the same.    Madam Speaker, I greatly appreciate it. I shall  be terse and laconic and pithy and concise.   It is time for change to again come to the House of Representatives.  I support this legislation, and I beg that my colleagues would do so.  It is time for change.    Madam Speaker, it has been a preeminent privilege  to serve under Chair Waters' leadership on the Financial Services  Committee. I think I can say without question, reservation, hesitation,  or equivocation that, under the gentlewoman's leadership, we have seen  great change. But I also know this: that under her leadership, there is  greater change to come. It is my honor to serve under the gentlewoman's  leadership.   And still I rise, Madam Speaker, and I rise today to support H.R.  1443, the LGBTQ Business Equal Credit Enforcement and Investment Act.  And I rise to thank the ranking member for his support of this  legislation. He has been steadfast, and he has been true to his word.   I am honored to support this legislation, and I think that it is  appropriate for me to address, first, the question of whether invidious  discrimination exists.   Madam Speaker, if you deny that invidious discrimination exists, then  you have to deny the existence of the KKK. To deny the existence of  invidious discrimination would necessitate a denial of those who were  in Charlottesville screaming: ``Blood and soil,'' ``Jews will not  replace us.''   I believe the case is self-evident: invidious discrimination exists.   Currently, we have a system that allows us to collect the empirical  evidence necessary to not only identify the invidious discrimination  but also help us to prevent the invidious discrimination. This  legislation is absolutely necessary to acquire the empirical  intelligence so that we may go forward and prevent invidious  discrimination.   By acquiring this intelligence, I might add, we will also deter some  of the people who have good sense such that they won't commit invidious  discrimination because they will be aware of the intelligence  acquisition.   How do we do this? Here is how it happens: Currently, when you make  your application, Madam Speaker, there is a place for you to indicate  whether you are a minority person. If I  [[Page H3099]]  am filling out the application, I would probably indicate that I am a  minority person, although I don't like the term. I use it only to  communicate. I do not like the term ``minority.'' But for the purpose  of communicating today, I would indicate that I am a minority person.   The only thing this bill will do, as it relates to acquiring the  intelligence, is give us another space so that we can now indicate  that, if you so choose, Madam Speaker, you are a member of the LGBTQ- plus community.   In filling out this form, if I chose not to indicate I was a minority  person, I wouldn't have to. I would just sign it, completing the other  aspects of it, and I would be done with it.   It only allows for the placement of additional language on the  document so that persons who desire to--and it is important to note,  Madam Speaker, that you must have the desire; it is with  intentionality, and you voluntarily do this--would indicate, if you  choose to, that you are a member of the LGBTQ-plus community.                                time  1315    I must say, candidly, I really don't see how this can become the  debate that it has become. At some point in this country, we have to  understand that discriminating against people because of who they are  is inappropriate. It is unlawful.   I am the son of a segregated South, where I was lawfully  discriminated against. I know what it looks like. I know what it smells  like. I know what it sounds like. I know what invidious discrimination  tastes like. I drank from filthy colored water fountains in my  lifetime.   I don't wish any of this type of behavior that I had to endure on  anyone else, so I rise today in support of this legislation as a  continuation of my mission to do all that I can to help others avoid  the horrors of invidious discrimination.   I am so grateful to Chairwoman Waters for all she has done. She has  always been a friend, not only to me, but to those who are among the  least, the last, and the lost. And I thank the gentlewoman for all that  she has done.    And still I rise, Madam Speaker. Again, I thank  the chairwoman for the time and the opportunity.   I would say to all, I recall the debate around the yield spread  premium, wherein a loan originator could say to a person, ``Here is a  loan, you are lucky to get it for 10 percent'' when the person  qualified for a loan at 5 percent.   We eliminated the dastardly yield spread premium and the harm that it  caused. We have a similar circumstance with the rent-a-bank scheme that  steals the American Dream, such that people who qualify for better  loans will likely get higher loans because they don't always understand  the scheme.   So I rise today, and I thank Mr. Garcia for what he has done to bring  this bill to fruition. I thank the Chairwoman, and I absolutely support  the legislation.
