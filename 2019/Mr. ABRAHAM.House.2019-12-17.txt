 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate five State  championship football teams from Louisiana's Fifth District.   On December 13 and 14, the Louisiana High School Athletic Association  held its State championship at the Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.   The Ouachita Christian Eagles won the division IV State championship.  The Ferriday Trojans won the class 2A State championship, and the Oak  Grove Tigers won the 1A State championship.   In mid-November, the Midsouth Association of Independent Schools held  its high school football championships. The Riverfield Academy Raiders  won the 4A championship, and Briarfield Academy won the 8-man 1A  championship.   These five teams have made their communities in northeast Louisiana  proud. Please join me in congratulating them on a job well done.                            ____________________
