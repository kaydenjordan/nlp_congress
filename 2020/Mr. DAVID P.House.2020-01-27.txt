 ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I express support for  H.R. 943, the Never Again Education Act. Today, January 27, marks  Holocaust Remembrance Day, as well as the 75th anniversary of the  liberation of Auschwitz. We, as a society, have an enduring obligation  to not only educate ourselves, but also future generations, on the  atrocities that took place from 1933 to 1945 so that they are never  repeated again. As Nobel Peace Prize winner, and Holocaust survivor,  Elie Wiesel stated, ``For the survivor who chooses to testify, it is  clear: his duty is to bear witness for the dead and for the living. He  has no right to deprive future generations of a past that belongs to  our collective memory. To forget would be not only dangerous but  offensive.''   Since its opening in 1993, the United States Holocaust Memorial  Museum has served as a reminder for the American public, as well as all  other visitors to Washington, DC, on the horrors suffered during the  Holocaust, in which Adolf Hitler systematically persecuted and murdered  six million Jews. H.R. 943, introduced by my good friends Reps. Carolyn  Maloney and Elise Stefanik, would reinforce the work the Holocaust  Memorial Museum performs by providing school systems around the country  access to resources to incorporate Holocaust educational materials into  their curriculums. This legislation will help ensure our nation's next  generation never forgets the horrible actions the Nazis committed, and  is better prepared to fight efforts like this in the future.   Unfortunately, almost 75 years after the end of World War II, anti- Semitism still exists today, with cases of violence and harassment  frequently in the news. It is my hope that the Never Again Education  Act will help stem the tide of this cowardice and bigotry.   Once again, I applaud the House of Representatives for taking up this  vital piece of legislation, and look forward to working with my  colleagues to promote religious tolerance in the U.S.
