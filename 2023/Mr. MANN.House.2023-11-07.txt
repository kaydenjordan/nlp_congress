 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss my priorities for  protecting America's future. We need to reduce and reprioritize  government spending, secure the border, and end the weaponization of  the Federal Government.   The Biden administration's spending has created massive inflation and  increased our national debt to $33 trillion, and $2.4 trillion of that  debt has accrued over just the last 365 days. That is over $76,000  every second.   The Biden administration's spending is out of touch with what  Americans want, and it is crushing our economy. We are all feeling it,  especially in middle America where new and costly regulations are  forcing small businesses to close, gas is nearly $4 a gallon, and  people's paychecks are overtaxed.   House Republicans have offered commonsense solutions to these  problems. We have passed the Limit, Save, Grow Act to stop wasteful  taxpayer spending, reclaim unspent COVID relief money and promote pro- growth economic policies, and we must stand firm in our commitment to  reducing and reprioritizing government spending.   While the Biden administration is burning through taxpayer dollars  like there is no tomorrow, there is also a humanitarian crisis raging  at our southern border, and it is getting worse every day. This is a  national security emergency. As we speak, fentanyl is flooding American  streets, victims of human trafficking rings are getting abused and  killed, and our brave border patrol agents are overwhelmed.   The funding to secure the border had already been appropriated by  Congress before President Biden even took office, and then he killed  the completion of the border wall by executive order. In response,  House Republicans passed H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, which would  force the Biden administration to resume construction of the border  wall, increase the number of Border Patrol agents, protect  unaccompanied children from human trafficking, and terminate catch-and- release policies.   We also passed the Schools Not Shelters Act and the HALT Fentanyl  Act. We must keep pressing to secure the border and protect Americans.   In addition to wasting taxpayer dollars and ignoring the border  crisis, the Biden administration is overseeing and directing an  unprecedented weaponization of the Federal Government. President  Biden's Department of Justice refuses to apply justice equally, and  House Republicans are constantly fighting back against overreaching  government regulations that are hurting agricultural producers and  small business owners.    Even the Supreme Court had to step in and declare the Biden  administration's definition of Waters of the United States was  unconstitutional.   When government grows, freedom shrinks. So we must stop the  weaponization of the Federal Government to protect our freedoms. The  appropriations process is a critical opportunity to address all of  these concerns. We must restore fiscal sanity. Americans deserve to  have their taxpayer dollars used wisely, and giving the President  endless, no-limit credit cards is no way to govern in a democracy.   It is hard for me to imagine how anyone would love $33 trillion of  debt or love the open border or love losing to China or love $200  billion of unaccounted for COVID relief dollars so much they would be  willing to shut down the Federal Government to maintain them.   We have 10 days to pass the remaining appropriations bills in a  fiscally responsible way. We owe it to the American people to work  tirelessly toward that end and to get our country back on track.                            ____________________
