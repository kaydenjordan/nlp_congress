 On November 10, the 160th Special Operations Aviation  Regiment lost five soldiers when their helicopter crashed during a  training flight over the Mediterranean sea. Their names are CW3 Stephen  R. Dwyer of Clarksville, TN; CW2 Shane M. Barnes of Sacramento, CA; SSG  Tanner W. Grone of Gorham, NH; SGT Andrew P. Southard of Apache  Junction, AZ; and SGT Cade M. Wolfe, of Mankato, MN.   In honor of the brave Night Stalkers of 1st Battalion, Charlie  Company, I want to recite a few portions of the Night Stalker Creed for  the record.         Service in the 160th is a calling only a few will answer       for the mission is constantly demanding and hard. And when       the impossible has been accomplished the only reward is       another mission that no one else will try.         . . . I serve with the memory and pride of those who have       gone before me for they loved to fight, fought to win and       would rather die than quit.    I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the complete  Night Stalker Creed.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                            Night Stalker Creed         Service in the 160th is a calling only a few will answer       for the mission is constantly demanding and hard. And when       the impossible has been accomplished the only reward is       another mission that no one else will try. As a member of the       Night Stalkers I am a tested volunteer seeking only to       safeguard the honor and prestige of my country, by serving       the elite Special Operations Soldiers of the United States. I       pledge to maintain my body, mind and equipment in a constant       state of readiness for I am a member of the fastest       deployable Task Force in the world, ready to move at a       moment's notice anytime, anywhere, arriving time on target       plus or minus 30 seconds.        I guard my unit's mission with secrecy, for my only true       ally is the night and the element of surprise. My manner is       that of the Special Operations Quiet Professional, secrecy is       a way of life. In battle, I eagerly meet the enemy for I       volunteered to be up front where the fighting is hard. I fear       no foe's ability, nor underestimate his will to fight.        The mission and my precious cargo are my concern. I will       never surrender. I will never leave a fallen comrade to fall       into the hands of the enemy, and under no circumstances will       I ever embarrass my country.        Gallantly will I show the world and the elite forces I       support that a Night Stalker is a specially selected and well       trained soldier.        I serve with the memory and pride of those who have gone       before me for they loved to fight, fought to win and would       rather die than quit.        Night Stalkers Don't Quit!    On behalf of all Tennesseans, I want to offer my  prayers and support to those soldiers' families and to the brave men  and women of the 160th. Their motto is ``Night Stalkers don't quit.''  And I would encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting them as  they bring the spirit of those words to bear against our enemies around  the globe.    I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
