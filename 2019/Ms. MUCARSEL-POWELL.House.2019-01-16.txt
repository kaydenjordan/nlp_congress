 Madam Speaker, Daniel Garcia-Barbon has been an  air traffic controller for 10 years at Miami International Airport. It  has been his life's dream to help passengers travel our skies. But last  Friday Daniel was one of thousands of Floridians who received a pay  stub in the amount of zero. He was forced to cancel his 4-year-old's  birthday, and he is unsure how much longer he can afford to support his  family.   Our government is failing our public servants.   I would like to ask this President and the Republican Party if they  understand the value of the work that Daniel and thousands of other  Floridians do to keep us safe.   We Floridians have weathered many storms, including this shutdown,  but we always come together. Just this weekend, I witnessed kindness  from an owner of a creole restaurant in the airport who was offering  lunches to Federal employees.   This shutdown must end. It is preposterous to punish thousands of  Americans for political gain. The Senate has a constitutional duty, and  it must rein in this reckless President.   Madam Speaker, today, once again, I stand here before you to implore  the Senate to reopen the government.                            ____________________
