 Madam President, I will speak later this afternoon, at  about 3:30--prior to the vote on the Articles of Impeachment--about  impeachment, but this morning, I would like to briefly respond to  President Trump's third State of the Union Address. It was a sad moment  for democracy.   The President's speech last night was much more like a Trump rally  than a speech a true leader would give. It was demagogic, undignified,  highly partisan, and, in too many places, just untruthful. Instead of a  dignified President, we had some combination of a pep rally leader, a  reality show host, and a carnival barker. That is not what Presidents  are.   President Trump took credit for inheriting an economy that has been  growing at about the same pace over the last 10 years. The bottom line  is, during the last 3 years of the Obama administration, more jobs were  created than under these 3 years of the Trump administration. Yet he  can't resist digging at the past President even though the past  President's economic number was better than his.   He boasted about how many manufacturing jobs he has created.  Manufacturing jobs have gone down, in part, because of the President's  trade policies for 5 months late last year. There was a 5-month-long  recession last year. Farmers are struggling mightily. Farm income is  way down. Bankruptcies are the highest they have been in 8 years. Crop  prices are dwindling, and markets may never recover from the damage of  the President's trade war as so many contracts for soybeans and other  goods have gone to Argentina and Brazil. These are not 1-year  contracts; these are long-term contracts.   The President talked at length about healthcare and claimed-- amazingly at one point--he will fight to protect patients with  preexisting conditions. This President just lies--just lies. He is in  court right now, trying to undo the protections for preexisting  conditions. At the same time, he says he wants to do it, and all the  Republicans get up  [[Page S873]]  and cheer. His administration is working as hard as it can to take down  the law that guarantees protections for preexisting conditions. The  claim is not partly true; it is not half true; it is not misleading. It  is flatly, objectively, unequivocally false. It reads on my notes  ``false.'' Let's call it for what it is--it is a lie.   In 3 years, President Trump has done everything imaginable to  undermine Americans' healthcare. He is even hoping to drag out the  resolution of the lawsuit past the next election. If President Trump  were truly interested in shoring up protections for people with  preexisting conditions, he would drop this lawsuit now. Then he would  be doing something, not just talking and having his actions totally  contradict his words. Until the President drops his lawsuit, when he  says he cares about Americans' healthcare, he is talking out of both  sides of his mouth.   When he talks about being the blue-collar President, he doesn't  understand blue-collar families. It is true that wages went up 3  percent. If you are making $50,000 a year, that is a good salary. By my  calculation, that is about $30 a week. When you get a medical bill of  $4,000 and your deductible is $5,000, when your car has an accident and  it is going to cost you $3,000 or $4,000 to fix it and you don't have  that money, the $30 a week doesn't mean much.   When asked, ``Is it easier for you to pay your bills today or the day  Trump became President?'' they say it is harder to pay their bills  today. That is what working families care about, getting their costs  down--their college costs, their education costs, their healthcare  costs, their automobile and infrastructure costs--not these vaunted  Wall Street statistics that the financial leaders look at and think:  Oh, we are great.   They are great. Their 3-percent increase in income--and it has been  greater--puts a lot of money in their pockets. Working people don't  feel any better--they feel worse--because Donald Trump always sides  with the special interests when it comes to things that affect working  families, like health care, like drug costs, like college.   In so many other areas, the President's claims were just not true. He  claimed he has gotten tough on China. He sold out to China a month ago.  Everyone knows that. Because he has hurt the farmers so badly, the bulk  of what happened in the Chinese agreement was for them to purchase some  soybeans. We don't even know if that will happen, but it didn't get at  the real ways China hurts us.   He spoke about the desire for a bipartisan infrastructure bill. We  Senate Democrats put together a $1 trillion bill 3 years ago, and the  President hasn't shown any interest in discussing it. In fact, when  Speaker Pelosi and I went to visit him about infrastructure, he walked  out.   This is typical of Donald Trump. In his speech, he bragged about all  of these things he wants to do or is doing, but his actions belie his  words. Maybe the best metaphor was his claim to bring democracy to  Venezuela. There was a big policy there. It flopped. If the policy were  working, Juan Guaido wouldn't have been in the balcony here. He would  have been in Venezuela. He would have been sitting in the President's  palace or at least have been waging a fight to win. He was here--and  the President brags about his Venezuela policy? Give us a break.   He hasn't brought an end to the Maduro regime. The Maduro regime is  more powerful today and more entrenched today than it was when the  President began his anti-Maduro fight--the same thing with North Korea,  the same thing with China, the same thing with Russia, the same thing  with Syria.   The fact is, when President Trump gets over an hour to speak, the  number of mistruths, mischaracterizations, exaggerations, and  contradictions is breathtaking. No other President comes close. The old  expression says: ``Watch what I do, not what I say.''   What the President does will be revealed on Monday in his budget.  That is what he wants to do. If past is prologue, almost everything in  that budget will contradict what he will have said in his speech. In  the past, he has cut money for healthcare, cut money for medical  research, cut money for infrastructure, cut money for education, cut  money to help kids with college--every one of those things.   Ladies and gentlemen, I have faith in the American people. They will  not be fooled. They are used to it. They can tell a little show here--a  nonreality show--when they see one. They know it is a show. It is done  for their amusement, for their titillation, but it doesn't improve  America. Working people are not happy. The middle class is struggling  to stay in the middle class, and those struggling to get to the middle  class find it harder to get there. Their path is steeper.   Far more than the President's speech, the President's budget is what  truly reveals his priorities. The budget will be the truth serum, and  in a few days, the American people will see how many of the President's  words here are reality. I expect very few will be.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, the Articles of Impeachment before us  charged President Donald John Trump with offenses against the  Constitution and the American people.   The first Article of Impeachment charges that President Trump abused  the Office of the Presidency by soliciting the interference of a  foreign power, Ukraine, to benefit himself in the 2020 election. The  President asked a foreign leader to ``do us a favor''--``us'' meaning  him--and investigate his political opponents.   In order to elicit these political investigations, President Trump  withheld a White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars in  military assistance from an ally at war with Russia. There is extensive  documentation in the record proving this quid pro quo and the corrupt  motive behind it. The facts are not seriously in dispute. In fact,  several Republican Senators admitted they believe the President  committed this offense with varying degrees of ``inappropriate,''  ``wrong,'' ``shameful.'' Almost all Republicans will argue, however,  that this reprehensible conduct does not rise to the level of an  impeachable offense.   The Founders could not have been clearer. William Davie, a delegate  to the Constitutional Convention, deemed impeachment ``an essential  security,'' lest the President ``spare no efforts or means whatever to  get himself reelected.''   James Madison offered a specific list of impeachable offenses during  a debate in Independence Hall:   A President ``might lose his capacity'' or embezzle public funds.   ``A despicable soul might even succumb to bribes while in office.''   Madison then arrived at what he believed was the worst conduct a  President could engage in: the President could ``betray his trust to  foreign powers,'' which would be ``fatal to the Republic.'' Those are  Madison's words.   When I studied the Constitution and the Federalist Papers in high  school, admittedly, I was skeptical of George Washington's warning that  ``foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican  government.'' It seemed so far-fetched. Who would dare? But the  foresight and wisdom of the Founders endure. Madison was right.  Washington was right.   There is no greater subversion of our democracy than for powers  outside of our borders to determine elections within them. If Americans  believe that they don't determine their Senator, their Governor, their  President, but, rather, some foreign potentate does, that is the  beginning of the end of democracy.   For a foreign country to attempt such a thing on its own is  contemptible. For an American President to deliberately solicit such a  thing--to blackmail a foreign country into helping him win an  election--is unforgivable.   Does this rise to the level of an impeachable offense? Of course it  does. Of course it does. The term ``high crimes'' derives from English  law. ``Crimes'' were committed between subjects of the monarchy. ``High  crimes'' were committed against the Crown itself. The Framers did not  design a monarchy; they designed a democracy, a nation where the people  were King. High crimes are those committed against the entire people of  the United States.   The President sought to cheat the people out of a free and fair  election. How could such an offense not be deemed a high crime--a crime  against the people? As one constitutional scholar in the House  Judiciary hearings testified: ``If this is not impeachable, nothing  is.'' I agree.   I judge that President Trump is guilty of the first Article of  Impeachment.   The second Article of Impeachment is equally straightforward. Once  the President realized he got caught, he tried to cover it up. The  President asserted blanket immunity. He categorically defied  congressional subpoenas, ordered his aides not to testify, and withheld  the production of relevant documents.   Even President Nixon, author of the most infamous Presidential  coverup in history, permitted his aides to testify in Congress in the  Watergate investigation. The idea that the Trump administration was  properly invoking the various rights and privileges of the Presidency  is nonsense. At each stage of the House inquiry, the administration  conjured up a different bad-faith justification for evading  accountability. There is no circumstance under which the administration  would have complied.    When I asked the President's counsel twice to name one document or  one witness the President provided to Congress, they could not answer.  It cannot be that the President, by dint of legal shamelessness, can  escape scrutiny entirely.   Once again, the facts are not in dispute, but some have sought to  portray the second Article of Impeachment as somehow less important  than the first. It is not. The second Article of Impeachment is  necessary if Congress is to ever hold a President accountable--again,  Democratic or Republican. The consequences of sanctioning such  categorical obstruction of Congress will be far-reaching, and they will  be irreparable.   I judge that President Trump is guilty of the second Article of  Impeachment.   The Senate should convict President Trump, remove him from the  Presidency, and disqualify him from holding future office. The guilt of  the President on these charges is so obvious that here, again, several  Republican Senators admit that the House has proved its case.   So instead of maintaining the President's innocence, the President's  counsel ultimately told the Senate that even if the President did what  he was accused of, it is not impeachable. This has taken the form of an  escalating series of Dershowitzian arguments, including ``Abuse of  power is not an impeachable offense''; ``The President  [[Page S909]]  can't be impeached for noncriminal conduct, but he also can't be  indicted for criminal conduct''; ``If a President believes his own  reelection is essential to the Nation, then a quid pro quo is not  corrupt.'' These are the excuses of a child caught in a lie.   Each explanation is more outlandish and desperate than the last. It  would be laughable if not for the fact that the cumulative effect of  these arguments would render not just this President but all Presidents  immune from impeachment and therefore above the law.   Several Members of this Chamber said that even if the President is  guilty and even if it is impeachable, the Senate still shouldn't  convict the President because there is an election coming up--as if the  Framers forgot about elections when they wrote the impeachment clause.  If the Founders believed that even when a President is guilty of an  impeachable offense, the next election should decide his fate, they  never would have included an impeachment clause in the Constitution.  That much is obvious.   Alone, each of the defenses advanced by the President's counsel comes  close to being preposterous. Together, they are as dangerous to the  Republic as this President--a fig leaf so large as to excuse any  Presidential misconduct. Unable to defend the President, arguments were  found to make him a King.   Let future generations know that only a fraction of the Senate  swallowed these fantasies. The rest of us condemn them to the ash heap  of history and the derision of first-year law students everywhere.   We are only the third Senate in history to sit as a Court of  Impeachment for the President. The task we were given was not easy, but  the Framers gave the Senate this responsibility because they could not  imagine any other body capable of it. They considered others, but they  entrusted it to us, and the Senate failed. The Republican caucus  trained its outrage not on the conduct of the President but on the  impeachment process in the House, deriding--falsely--an alleged lack of  fairness and thoroughness.   The conjured outrage was so blinding that the Republican majority  ended up guilty of the very sins it falsely accused the House of  committing. It conducted the least fair, least thorough, most rushed  impeachment trial in the history of this country.   A simple majority of Senators denied the Senate's right to examine  relevant evidence, to call witnesses, to review documents, and to  properly try the impeachment of the President, making this the first  impeachment trial in history that heard from no witnesses. A simple  majority of Senators, in deference to and most likely in fear of the  President of their party, perpetrated a great miscarriage of justice in  the trial of President Trump. As a result, the verdict of this kangaroo  court will be meaningless.   By refusing the facts, by refusing witnesses and documents, the  Republican majority has placed a giant asterisk--the asterisk of a sham  trial--next to the acquittal of President Trump, written in permanent  ink. Acquittal and an unfair trial with this giant asterisk--the  asterisk of a sham trial--are worth nothing at all to President Trump  or to anybody else.   No doubt, the President will boast he received total exoneration, but  we know better. We know this wasn't a trial by any stretch of the  definition. And the American people know it, too.   We have heard a lot about the Framers over the past several weeks,  about the impeachment clause they forged, the separation of powers they  wrought, the conduct they most feared in our chief magistrate. But  there is something the Founders considered even more fundamental to our  Republic: truth. The Founders had seen and studied societies governed  by the iron fist of tyrants and the divine right of Kings, but none by  argument, rational thinking, facts, and debate.   Hamilton said the American people would determine ``whether societies  of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from  reflection and choice, or . . . forever destined to depend on accident  and force.'' And what an astonishing thing the Founders did. They  placed a bet with long odds. They believed that ``reflection and  choice'' would make us capable of self-government; that we wouldn't  agree on everything, but at least we could agree on a common baseline  of fact and of truth. They wrote a Constitution with the remarkable  idea that even the most powerful person in our country was not above  the law and could be put on trial. A trial--a place where you seek  truth. The faith our Founders placed in us makes the failure of this  Senate even more damning.    Our Nation was founded on the idea of truth, but there was no truth  here. The Republican majority couldn't let truth into this trial. The  Republican majority refused to get the evidence because they were  afraid of what it might show.   Our Nation was founded on the idea of truth, but in order to  countenance this President, you have to ignore the truth. The  Republicans walk through the halls with their heads down. They didn't  see the tweet. They can't respond to everything he says. They hope he  learned his lesson this time. Yes, maybe, this time, he learned his  lesson.   Our Nation was founded on truth, but in order to excuse this  President, you have to willfully ignore the truth and indulge in the  President's conspiracy theories: Millions of people voted illegally.  The deep state is out to get him. Ukraine interfered in our elections.  You must attempt to normalize his behavior. Obama did it, too, they  falsely claim. The Democrats are just as bad.   Our Nation was founded on the idea of truth, but this President is  such a menace--so contemptuous of every virtue, so dishonorable, so  dishonest--that you must ignore--indeed, sacrifice--the truth to  maintain his favor.   The trial of this President--its failure--reflects the central  challenge of this Presidency and, maybe, the central challenge of this  time in our democracy. You cannot be on the side of this President and  be on the side of truth, and if we are to survive as a nation, we must  choose truth because, if the truth doesn't matter, if the news you  don't like is fake, if cheating in an election is acceptable, if  everyone is as wicked as the wickedest among us, then hope for the  future is lost.   The eyes of the Nation are upon this Senate, and what they see will  strike doubt in the heart of even the most ardent patriot.   The House managers established that the President abused the great  power of his office to try to cheat in an election, and the Senate  majority is poised to look the other way.   So I direct my final message not to the House managers, not even to  my fellow Senators, but to the American people. My message is simple:  Don't lose hope. There is justice in this world and truth and right. I  believe that. I wouldn't be in this government if I didn't. Somehow, in  ways we can't predict, with God's mysterious hand guiding us, truth and  right will prevail.   There have been dark periods in our history, but we always overcome.  The Senate's opening prayer yesterday was Amos 5:24: Let justice roll  down like water, righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.   The long arc of the moral universe, my fellow Americans, does bend  toward justice. America does change for the better but not on its own.  It took millions of Americans hundreds of years to make this country  what it is today--Americans of every age and color and creed who  marched and protested, who stood up and sat in; Americans who died  while defending this democracy, this beautiful democracy, in its  darkest hours.   On Memorial Day in 1884, Oliver Wendell Holmes told his war-weary  audience: ``[W]hether [one] accepts from Fortune her spade, and will  look downward and dig, or from Aspiration her axe and cord, and will  scale the ice, the one and only success which it is [yours] to command  is to bring to [your] work a mighty heart.''   I have confidence that Americans of a different generation--our  generation--will bring to our work a mighty heart to fight for what is  right, to fight for the truth, and never, never lose faith.   I yield the floor.    Mr. Chief Justice, I join the Republican leader in  thanking the personnel who aided the Senate over the past several  weeks. The Capitol Police do an outstanding job, day in and day out, to  protect the Members of this Chamber, their staffs, the press, and  everyone who works in and visits this Capitol.   They were asked to work extra shifts and in greater numbers provide  additional security over the past 3 weeks. Thank you to every one of  them.   I, too, would like to thank those wonderful pages. I so much enjoyed  you with your serious faces walking down right here and giving the  Chief Justice our questions. As the leader noted, the new class of  pages started midway in this impeachment trial. When you take a new  job, you are usually given a few days to take stock of things and get  up to speed.   This class was given no such leeway, but they stepped right in and  didn't miss a beat. Carrying hundreds of questions from U.S. Senators  to the Chief Justice on national television is not how most of us spend  our first week at work, but they did it with aplomb.   I would also like to extend my personal thank you to David Hauck,  Director of the Office of Accessibility Services; Tyler Pumphrey,  supervisor; and Grace Ridgeway, wonderful Director of Capitol  Facilities.   Everyone on Grace's team worked so hard to make sure we were ready  for impeachment: Gary Richardson, known affectionately to us as  ``Tiny,'' the chief Chamber attendant; Jim Hoover and the cabinet shop  who built new cabinets to deprive us of the use of our electronics and  flip phones during the trial; Brenda Byrd and her team who did a  spectacular job of keeping the Capitol clean; and Lynden Webb and his  team, who moved the furniture, and then moved it again and again and  again.   Grace, we appreciate all your hard work. Please convey our sincerest  thanks to your staff. Thank you all, the whole staff, for your diligent  work through many long days and late nights during this very trying  time in our Nation's history.   Statement Of The Chief Justice Of The United States On The Senate Floor    The CHIEF JUSTICE. At this time, the Chair also wishes to make a very  brief statement.   I would like to begin by thanking the majority leader and the  Democratic leader for their support as I attempted to carry out ill- defined responsibilities in an unfamiliar setting. They ensured that I  had wise counsel of the Senate itself through its Secretary and her  legislative staff.   I am especially grateful to the Parliamentarian and her deputy for  their unfailing patience and keen insight. I am likewise grateful to  the Sergeant at Arms and his staff for the assistance and many  courtesies that they extended during my period of required residency.  Thank you all for making my presence here as comfortable as possible.   As I depart the Chamber, I do so with an invitation to visit the  Court. By  [[Page S939]]  long tradition and in memory of the 135 years we sat in this building,  we keep the front row of the gallery in our courtroom open for Members  of Congress who might want to drop by to see an argument--or to escape  one.   I also depart with sincere good wishes as we carry out our common  commitment to the Constitution through the distinct roles assigned to  us by that charter. You have been generous hosts, and I look forward to  seeing you again under happier circumstances.   The Chair recognizes the majority leader.                            ____________________
