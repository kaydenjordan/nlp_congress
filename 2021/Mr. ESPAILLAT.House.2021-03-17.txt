 Madam Speaker, it is well past time for VAWA  reauthorization. It should have never been allowed to lapse to begin  with.   I stand here in support of this bill in honor of Gladys Ricart, a  dear constituent of mine, who, 22 years ago, was murdered by her  jealous ex-boyfriend on her wedding day, in her wedding gown. Madam  Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation in her memory.   Now you have the Brides' March, an international movement across this  continent and across the world that honors the memory of Gladys Ricart.  They were right here in this Capitol, and they will continue to come  back until further legislation is enacted to protect women all across  our country, all across the world.
