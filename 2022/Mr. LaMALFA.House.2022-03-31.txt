 Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of talk about energy  and energy costs in this country and, of course, in my home State of  California, where you can easily find fuel over 6 bucks a gallon. Let  me translate this conversation into what it means for farmers and what  farmers mean for food supply.   Now, we know the United States farmer provides the best, the  cleanest, the most efficient process, more grown per acre per unit than  anywhere else in the world. So, it is amazing to me that, just a few  days ago, President Biden announced that we are going to have food  shortages in the world and even here. We are already seeing the empty  shelves. We are already seeing the high prices--supply and demand for  everything.   In the United States of America, food shortages make me ask: What are  our priorities as a country and as a government here or in my home  State, the government of California?  [[Page H4020]]    We are looking at energy costs. Everything requires energy when we  have a product that goes from a field, from a mine, or from a  manufacturer to your home, Mr. Speaker. The fuel costs to operate a  tractor, a combine, the trucks that bring you fertilizer and that bring  you seed, the trucks that take away the grown product to the processor,  to the mill, and finally bringing it to your store shelf or even if you  have it delivered to your house, Mr. Speaker. All those energy costs  ripple through everything we do and have as citizens of this country.   What is being done about energy costs? Well, I just saw a blurb a  minute ago that the President wants to tap into our energy reserve, the  stored oil that we have someplace that always seems to be a political  football around here to solve some problem when it is really supposed  to be a reserve for very acute times of danger for our country. Now,  they are using it as an economic flattener or what have you.   We have reserves in the ground in this country that we are not  tapping, but our tone-deaf government here and our State of California  won't do anything about that. Instead, let's export it from Venezuela,  and let's export it from the Middle East. Maybe we will do something  about Russia. We will see if that takes effect.   We are not doing anything to help our own people with the energy  crisis and energy costs here. We are dancing around that collectively  as a government in this administration. Why? What is their priority?  When John Kerry says he hopes this thing Putin is doing in Ukraine  doesn't stop our ability to reach our climate change goals, how tone- deaf are these people? Are you kidding me?   We are going to continue to enjoy even emptier shelves for our food,  tires, and everything else because of high energy costs and a  government in Washington and in Sacramento unwilling to do anything  about it other than half measures or zero measures.   What does this do to our food supply, as we talked about? My  colleagues in the State legislature proposed a sales tax holiday, a  fuel tax holiday, which would knock about 51 cents off of a gallon of  fuel. It is not the be-all or fix-all, but it can do something  temporarily to help while we get our energy going again, supposedly. It  would help. They turned that down. Instead, they proposed a tax  increase on production of fuel in California. Unbelievable. Damn, who  are you guys working for? Amazing.   In my home State, as we try to produce food, tens of millions of  acre-feet of water and snow fall upon our State each year. We hear  drought, drought, drought, record drought. Yes, it is lower than  normal, but we are not capturing the water we can.   We could raise Shasta Dam, a Federal project, which Federal dollars  were put toward. We could build Sites Reservoir in northern California  and add 1.5 million-acre feet of stored water.   But no. They are letting the water get away out through the delta for  salinity and for fish populations that don't even exist. The delta  smelt is gone.   The Klamath Basin up in the north, zero allocation for agriculture  last year and this year. Statewide, we are looking at probably 70  percent of irrigated acres by the time it is all added up. They are  going to be idle this year.   What does that mean to the American people? That is California's  problem; you guys don't know what you are doing out there anyway. Well,  tomato production is going to be down quite a bit, so that means less  tomato sauce for New York, less olives and olive oil for New York.   This is what we are doing to our food production. Fertilizer costs  are going to drive costs even more, and we will not be farming in  California much longer.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, President Biden has been promising recently  empty shelves, food shortages in the United States of America.   American farmers are the most efficient and the best in the world at  what they do, but they can't do it very well with these high energy  costs.   Fertilizer takes energy to produce. It takes oil to produce. When you  see the cost increasing 51 percent, this isn't just going to hit the  farmers; it is going to hit all consumers.   Energy costs ripple through everything: planting, harvesting,  delivering, everything. So what are we doing? What is our focus going  to be?   In my home State of California, water is being taken away from  agriculture. We need the Bureau of Reclamation and our own State water  resources to be focused on producing food for people.   In Ukraine, those farmers are trying to plant amidst bombs from Putin  and Russia. In our own country, in my own home State, the bombs are  being dropped by the government on farmers, having their water taken  away, having their energy costs go through the roof.    We have to focus on producing energy and food for Americans that is  affordable instead of this direction that the Federal and my own State  government are doing to the people and not for them.                            ____________________
