 Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues on  the floor to very strongly support the Congressional Review Act  resolution to restore net neutrality and maintain a free and open  internet. I applaud Senator Ed Markey for his leadership in introducing  this Congressional Review Act resolution.   Restoring net neutrality is especially critical to small businesses  and startup companies in New Hampshire and across the United States.  Small businesses are the backbone of our Granite State's economy. They  represent 99 percent of our employers. The internet continues to  provide opportunity for these small businesses because it levels the  playing field. It makes it easier to find new customers and grow  online, but that level playing field is now in jeopardy because of the  Federal Communications Commission's decision to end net neutrality  protections.   Last Thursday, I convened a field hearing of the Senate Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship at the University of New Hampshire.  I wanted to hear concerns of our small business owners about what the  net neutrality rollback would mean to them. In particular, they are  concerned that net neutrality will impede their ability to expand and  create jobs.   In conversations with small business owners and leaders across my  State, they tell me this rollback is a direct threat to their  businesses. They say it would be like watching their large competitors  take the highway while they are forced to take the slow roads. Without  net neutrality, broadband providers could charge more for fast lanes--a  cost that many small businesses simply can't afford. This would put  them at an even greater competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis large  corporations that have the resources to pay for those fast lanes. In  the digital age, speed is critical.   Witnesses at our field hearing pointed to research showing that even  small delays of a second or less--just think about that, a second or  less--can lead to the loss of significant sales. Customers today expect  a fast, easy online experience. It is clear, small businesses operating  at slim margins would lose out to big firms that can afford the fast  lane.   Josh Cyr, who testified at our hearing, is an executive with Alpha  Loft. Alpha Loft is a startup incubator that is based in Manchester and  Portsmouth, NH. At the field hearing, he had a stark warning. He said:         The repeal of net neutrality protections enables a small       handful of very powerful internet providers tremendous       control over what is delivered to consumers' homes and the       speed with which it is delivered. Without net neutrality, the       power and control these internet providers have will allow       them to create artificial market barriers.    The repeal of net neutrality would pose even greater challenges for  small businesses in rural areas. As Senator Klobuchar said, she has a  lot of rural areas in Minnesota. Well, so does New Hampshire. A 2015  survey by the University of New Hampshire showed that nearly 40 percent  of New Hampshire residents who were polled said they were using their  current provider because it is the only option available to them. Many  rural small businesses will have nowhere else to turn if their  broadband provider decides to charge more or slow down the connection.  Our witnesses noted that net neutrality could heighten the rural urban  divide, making it more challenging for small businesses and rural  communities to reach customers, attract workers, and stay connected.   One of the other people testifying at the hearing was Nancy Pearson.  She is the director of the New Hampshire Center for Women and  Enterprise. She testified that net neutrality is a matter of equality.  She said:         New Hampshire small businesses and microbusinesses rely on       the equalizing force of the internet, and just to put that in       perspective, women start businesses at five times the rate of       any other entrepreneur--  [[Page S2587]]       and for minority women and veterans, that number is even       higher. So when we start putting barriers in the way of these       entrepreneurs, it can have a significant and, I think,       disastrous effect.    The FCC's rollback of net neutrality rules is also creating  tremendous uncertainty, especially for startup businesses that are  looking to plan ahead. It could have major ramifications on sales,  marketing, and internet costs that small businesses just can't predict.   Participants at the field hearing warned that the FCC's decision will  affect not only businesses but also institutions of higher education.  It will also negatively impact efforts to provide telemedicine  consultations to patients who don't have access to services locally.  Again, we have a big rural population in New Hampshire--well, a small  population but a lot of rural areas.   I am concerned, for instance, about the impact on the Veterans'  Administration's outpatient clinic in Littleton, NH. It relies on  telemedicine to provide psychiatric care to veterans in remote  locations. What will happen if they can no longer provide that service  because they don't have the ability to pay for those lanes anymore?   Small businesses, consumers, and all Americans who care about a level  playing field on the internet have every reason to be concerned by the  FCC's repeal of net neutrality protections, but their ill-considered  rollback doesn't have to be the last word. We can bring to the floor a  bipartisan resolution to prevent the FCC's rollback from going forward.   A coalition of more than 6,000 small businesses across the country  sent a letter to Congress asking us to protect them by overturning the  FCC's decision to repeal net neutrality. Further, at my field hearing  last week, Granite State small businesses offered compelling testimony  about the importance of net neutrality to their competitiveness and  their ability to expand and hire new workers. We must not ignore this  groundswell of opposition to the FCC's rollback of rules that ensure  equal access to the internet.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the  Congressional Review Act resolution. Let's restore net neutrality  protections and ensure a free and open internet, with access on equal  terms, for all businesses and consumers.   I yield the floor.
