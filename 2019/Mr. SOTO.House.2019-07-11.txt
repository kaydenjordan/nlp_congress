 Madam Chair, I would like to acknowledge that my amendment,  floor amendment number 357, rules amendment number 117, included in en  bloc package number 14, increases funding for the Defense-Wide  Manufacturing Science and Technology program by $5 million for anti- tamper heterogeneous integrated microelectronics.   Microelectronics support nearly all Department of Defense activities,  enabling capabilities such as the global position system, radar,  command and control, and communications. Ensuring secure access to  leading-edge microelectronics, however, is a challenge. The changing  global semiconductor industry and the sophistication of U.S.  adversaries, who might target military electronic components, require  us to update our domestic microelectronics security framework.   Defense-Wide Manufacturing Science and Technology is an investment  mechanism that allows the Department of Defense to advance state-of- the-art, defense-essential, manufacturing capabilities through the  development of technologies and processes necessary to produce defense  systems. This amendment would provide additional funding resources,  through the use of a public-private-partnership structured  microelectronics cybersecurity center, to support anti-tamper devices,  hardware security, and other evolving new concept technologies that  support trusted and assured manufacturing, combined with advanced  system integration and packaging technologies.   I support the rapid modernization of domestic state-of-the-art  foundry operations that produce trusted microelectronics and thank the  Chairman and the Committee for all their work on this amendment.
