 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Reverend Jeannette  Phillips who passed away last month. She devoted decades of service to  the healthcare needs of the disadvantaged in the Hudson Valley,  culminating in her founding of the Peekskill Area Ambulatory Healthcare  Center in 1975.   Over the course of her life of service, Reverend Phillips received  myriad of awards and recognitions, including the New York State  Governor's Award for African Americans of Distinction in 1994, the  CHCANYS Catherine M. Abate Memorial Award in 2018, and Crain's Notable  Women in Healthcare in 2019.   She also received the Sojourner Truth Award as well as the Harriet  [[Page H4949]]  Tubman Award for her work as the Westchester District president of the  Harriet Tubman Home Historical Society.   Reverend Phillips is survived by three daughters, two sons, and more  than 100 grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great- grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to enter her name into the Congressional  Record and recognize Reverend Jeannette Phillips, a trailblazing  humanitarian, historic preservationist, and a proud matriarch.                            ____________________
