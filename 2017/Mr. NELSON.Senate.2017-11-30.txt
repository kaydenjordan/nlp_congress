 Mr. President, I intend to call up my motion to commit  the bill to the Finance Committee, which is at the desk, and it is  supported by Senator Harris.   Mr. President, while we are working out the consent, the tax bill  before us is not for the middle class. As a matter of fact, this is a  big cut for corporations. This is not a cut for you. It is not a cut  for hard-working families. It is so lopsided as a cut to big  corporations.   The fact is that it is not for the middle class. We need to be frank.  The truth is that the bill treats the corporations much better than  regular people. For example, over a 10-year period, if you make $75,000  or less, you will be hurt by this bill. If you are a small business  owner and your taxes are a passthrough at the individual rate, your  taxes are going to be much higher than large, multinational  corporations. If you buy your health insurance in the individual  market, there is a good chance that you are going to lose access to  affordable health insurance. These are the facts, and it is just plain  and simple.   Sure, there are tax cuts for some of the middle class, but those tax  cuts go away after 8 years. In 2026, they are gone. By contrast, the  tax cuts for big corporations are made permanent, and that is simply  not treating people fairly.   So what I am suggesting is that we send this bill to the Finance  Committee to work out a bipartisan compromise on how to make middle- class tax cuts permanent. There were 17 of us that stood up in the  press gallery yesterday and said we are for a bipartisan compromise. I  would hope a majority of my colleagues would support that, and I ask  for your support.
