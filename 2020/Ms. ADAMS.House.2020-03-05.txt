 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the women of the United  States House of Representatives for Women's History Month.   This Women's History Month marks the 100th year of women's suffrage  in the United States.   While the first Congresswoman joined the House in 1917, the first  woman of color didn't join our Chamber until Hawaii sent Patsy Mink to  Washington in 1965. And the first African American Congresswoman didn't  arrive until the unbossed and unbought Shirley Chisholm joined us in  1969.   Our colleague, Nancy Pelosi, became the first and only woman Speaker  of the House in 2007.   In 2014, I will never forget, I was honored to be elected by the  people of North Carolina's 12th District to serve as the 100th woman in  the 113th Congress.   In 2018, a record 127 women were elected to Congress, with over 100  women in the House alone.   However, there is still work to be done. 127 out of 535 is just 24  percent, and that is not what our country looks like.   We need more women Members because, despite the fact that women have  had the vote for 100 years, we still don't have equal justice under the  law.   To this day, we are still paid less for our work, face workplace  harassment, and are discriminated against simply because of being who  we are. Women work full time, year-round still only making 82 cents on  the dollar for the earnings men make.   Fighting against these disparities and ensuring our Federal  Government and policies are reflective of the whole country is why  having women in Congress is so important.   So, as we honor women's history, let's remember that all of us have  not only the ability, but also the obligation to make history.                            ____________________
