 Mr. Chairman, passing a farm bill that delivers a better  deal to our growers could have and should have been a bipartisan  process. But when Democrats arrived ready to work, the doors were  shackled shut. Instead of coming together to help our producers  struggling with a downturn in the agricultural economy, this  hyperpartisan bill hurts everyone from pasture to plate.    It cuts $23 billion from a program that feeds children, seniors, and  veterans in addition to eliminating mandatory funding for rural  development programs which are proven job creators in rural America.  This bill also strips farmers, who are facing tightening market  conditions, of crop insurance options.   This ``harm'' bill is another step in the wrong direction for rural  America. At a time when farmers are already feeling the pain of  President Trump's impulsive trade war and Secretary Pruitt's attack on  ethanol, I urge my colleagues: abandon this ``harm'' bill and work  together on a farm bill that will strengthen rural America.
