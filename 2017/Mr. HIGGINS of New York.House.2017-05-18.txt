 Mr. Speaker, it was reported in The New York  Times on Monday that UnitedHealthcare and four of the Nation's largest  health insurance companies concocted a scheme to defraud the Medicare  program and the American people out of tens of billions of dollars each  year over the past decade.   The United States Department of Justice yesterday joined the lawsuit  and is investigating these serious charges against UnitedHealthcare and  the others. The Justice Department should conduct an investigation  aggressively and thoroughly to get to the truth and to exact justice.   If these allegations are true, these actions would represent among  the most egregious schemes of fraud perpetrated against the American  people.   Shockingly, the House Republican health bill gave a $78 million tax  cut to the executives of the very companies that are under  investigation, including a $15.5 million tax cut to UnitedHealthcare  and their chief executive officer.   This information can easily be found on page 67 in 3 lines of the  Republican healthcare bill.   This is, Mr. Speaker, a blatant violation of the public trust that  this Congress took an oath to protect and to uphold.                            ____________________
