 Mr. Chairman, I am going to address on this bill  something that I assume has been addressed before but, nevertheless, of  all the provisions of the bill I find most offensive.   Under this bill, the employers are required to give the telephone  number, the email, and the address of each employee. I do believe in  the importance of protecting people's privacy, and to say that, by  wanting to have a union election, you have the right to find out where  every possible person lives I think is offensive, not to mention I  think it would be very scary to have somebody come home one night and  they find somebody there waiting for them to talk about the union  election.   You have to wonder what are these people doing here. And then you  are: Oh, they are here to deal with this.   It is hard for me to believe that a party that purports to look out  for women and that sort of thing is going to turn around and pass a  bill saying we are going to hand out everybody's address.                                time  1645
