 Mr. Speaker, 115 people in America die from  opioid overdose every day--115. While we are spending the next 2 weeks  passing bipartisan legislation to combat the opioid crisis, President  Trump's Department of Justice is abandoning the Affordable Care Act and  its popular rule that protects Americans from preexisting conditions  like opioid addiction. According to the Department of Health and Human  Services, nearly 130 million adults under the age of 65 have  preexisting conditions.   This action taken by the Justice Department is bad policy, and it  will do more harm to Texas, which already has the highest population of  uninsured in the Nation.   In fact, it will add more uncertainty to the Affordable Care Act  markets at a time when Americans throughout the country will witness  double-digit rate increases for the ACA plans next year. We can't  combat the opioid crisis if we deny treatment and access to care for  Americans with substance abuse.   I urge my colleagues to do the right thing, speak out, and oppose the  huge health insurance premium increases.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5752, the Stop Illicit Drug  Importation Act of 2018.   In 2016, 42,000 Americans died from opioid-related overdoses alone,  including more than 2,800 victims of opioid addiction in my home State  of Texas.   One of the contributing factors to the opioid epidemic is the illicit  importation of opioid drugs. According to Commissioner Gottlieb: ``FDA  investigators are the last line of defense at the international mail  facilities'' when it comes to preventing illicit drugs from entering  our country.   Despite the fact that more than 2 million packages are received each  day at our international mail facilities, FDA only has the capacity and  resources to inspect 40,000 of these. More must be done to equip the  FDA, both from the resource perspective but also with the law  enforcement perspective.   This is why I was also pleased to support the SCREEN Act, which was  passed yesterday, and would authorize additional resources for FDA to  take on this fight and grant FDA greater authority to destroy and  recall drugs that pose harm to public health.   The Stop Illicit Drug Importation Act of 2018 empowers the FDA to  refuse admission and destroy imports identified as items of concern by  the FDA and the Drug Enforcement Administration.   The bill will also help streamline seizure procedures and debar  individuals and companies that repeatedly violate Federal law from  being able to import in the United States.   This commonsense measure passed by the Energy and Commerce Committee  by voice vote last month will help stem the tide of illegal and illicit  products, including opioids, from entering our country from  international mail facilities. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I want to join our chairman in thanking our staff. We couldn't be  here today without our staff working on these.   But this bill is so important. I have been on the docks of the Port  of Houston and watched these containers come in off the ships and them  being inspected. The FDA agents there are frustrated with it, even in  our international mail facilities that are actually in our district in  Texas. So that is why this bill is so important, and I am glad for my  colleague from Tennessee to be sponsoring this bill.   I have no other speakers, Mr. Speaker, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
