 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding and for his strong and important leadership on  this historic bill.   I rise in strong support of the Build Back Better Act and thank the  Democratic leadership for their historic investment into the American  lives and the lives of their families.   We have no future if we don't get serious about combating climate  change, and this bill is transformative in this area and so many other  areas.   The Oversight Committee's title would make the Federal Government a  leader on combating climate change by electrifying the Federal  Government's vehicle fleet. Our title includes nearly $3 billion for  GSA and $6 billion for the Postal Service to purchase tens of thousands  of electric vehicles and build the infrastructure necessary to support  them.   Electric vehicles are a sensible and cost-effective investment that  will reduce emissions and help save our planet.   The title also includes $4 billion for GSA to expand the use of  emerging green technologies and to green Federal buildings.   I am especially pleased that we have included dedicated funding for  OMB to track labor equity and environmental standards and performance.   It is critical that the House pass this bill as quickly as possible.  Congratulations to everyone who is supporting this critically important  bill.
