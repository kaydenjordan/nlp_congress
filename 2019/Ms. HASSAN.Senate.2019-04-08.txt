 Mr. President, today I would like to recognize Mr.  John Barthelmes of Hopkinton, NH, and celebrate his well-deserved  retirement after years of service to New Hampshire and America.   In 1976, John began his career in public service as a State trooper  in New Hampshire's North Country, where he fell in love with his  wonderful wife, Jadean. He then rose through the ranks to become  colonel of New Hampshire State Police, a position he held from 1996 to  1999. After retiring from the State police, John served as the director  of the New England High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area agency, until  2007 when Governor Lynch appointed him to serve as commissioner of the  department of safety. I am proud and honored that, as Governor, I had  the opportunity to reappoint this exceptional public servant to lead  our department of safety.   As commissioner, John has focused on maintaining New Hampshire's  status as one of the safest States in the Nation and on improving  services for our citizens. Under his leadership, the department has  effectively managed severe weather events and other emergencies. He  also oversaw the merger of the State police and highway patrol and the  overhaul of the State police officer recruitment process.   Additionally, under John's leadership, the department has  dramatically reduced wait times at the Division of Motor Vehicles,  given citizens the option to renew their drivers' licenses online, and  undertaken a number of other improvements.   Underscoring his commitment to helping the people of New Hampshire,  John is an outspoken advocate for treatment options for behavioral  health and has served on the board of Riverbend Community Mental  Health. John also serves on the New Hampshire Advisory Council on  Emergency Preparedness and Security and the Governor's Commission on  Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery.   But as impressive as John Barthelmes' service, effectiveness, and  achievements are, it is his insight, even-keeled demeanor, and  extraordinary kindness that distinguishes him the most. A man of  impeccable character and deep understanding of the human condition,  John Barthelmes broadened the outlook of everyone he worked with and  gave hope to all he served.   Ensuring the safety of our people and communities is the most  important role of government. Doing it with the skill, professionalism,  and wisdom that John Barthelmes exhibited throughout his career is  extraordinary.   I thank John for his dedication to keeping our people and communities  safe, and I thank John's family for their willingness to share him with  the people of New Hampshire.   I hope you will join me in honoring a dedicated Granite Stater, John  Barthelmes.                            ____________________
