 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Walker for  yielding, and I appreciate him offering this. It is providing a  different take that we are not getting in the meeting anywhere.   Go back real quickly: a few months ago, the first week of the  session, the House comes in and does what it promised. It says it is  going to take on regulatory reform. It is going to take on the burdens,  and one of the first bills out of the chute was the REINS Act.   The REINS Act is very simple. It has a $100 million impact on the  economy. It comes back to the people's House, into the Senate for  approval. Instead of bureaucrats in cubicles down the street thinking  they know what is best for our districts and for our country, it is  back to the people that were elected.   You see, when it was first brought up, they said: Well, this is going  to put a burden on our bureaucrats, our government workers. They are  doing all these things.   Well, if they want to run for Congress, then pay the fee and run for  Congress.   The REINS Act puts it back where it is supposed to be. This is an  accomplishment that I am proud of. The Senate just recently passed  their version. This is something that President Trump has said he would  sign. This is about moving forward on the promises we have.   Congressman Walker does a great job highlighting where we have been  and where we are going. This is a promise kept. If anybody wants to  know what the American agenda looks like, look to the Republican  majority, look to the past 5 months. And all I can say  [[Page H4908]]  is that the promises are being kept, and there is more to come.
