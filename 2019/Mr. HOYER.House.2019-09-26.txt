 Mr. Speaker, read the bill, read the amendment that they  offered.   Eric Cantor called MTRs a gimmick. This is the gimmick of gimmicks.  It  [[Page H8040]]  does nothing for veterans' healthcare, not a single thing. You know it.  I know it. Everybody in this House knows it. All it does is try to  delay this bill for 10 years, and they are going to all vote against  the bill.   Mr. Speaker, this does nothing for veterans' care. If the gentleman  cared about veterans' care, he would have offered it.
