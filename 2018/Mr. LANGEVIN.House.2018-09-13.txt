 Mr. Speaker, last week, the Justice Department unveiled  the latest in a string of criminal complaints against America's cyber  adversaries. The extremely detailed document lays out a damning case  against Park Jin Hyok, a North Korean hacker, and the regime that  supports him.   From the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack to WannaCry to attempts to  undermine the global financial system, the North Korean regime is a  destabilizing presence in cyberspace. I commend the members of the law  enforcement community who are working this case.   Mr. Speaker, cyberspace is often thought of as a domain where bad  actors can act with impunity. This indictment shows that this is not  the case. America is getting more and more sophisticated at being able  to track down and unveil and unmask these cyber bad actors.  [[Page H8250]]    To those who would attempt to target our networks and systems, I have  a message for you: We will find you. Malign activity in cyberspace that  targets critical infrastructure or causes immense property damage is  not the behavior of responsible nations, and we will not tolerate it.                            ____________________
