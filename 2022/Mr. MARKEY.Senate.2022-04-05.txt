 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as an Associate  Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. When confirmed, Judge Jackson, who  currently serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  [[Page S1960]]  District of Columbia Circuit, will take the seat on the Supreme Court  that Justice Stephen Breyer has held for almost three decades, so I  would like to first offer a few words about Justice Breyer as he  prepares to step down from the Bench.   Justice Breyer has served the Court and the Nation with grace,  expertise, humility, brilliance, and an unwavering dedication to  justice. He has worked tirelessly to build consensus among his  colleagues, and he has always kept in mind the real-world impacts of  the Court's decisions on the American people.   Justice Breyer knew that ``justice for some'' was a failure of the  Court. From his opinions on voting rights to reproductive rights, to  the Affordable Care Act, he has been a key voice in many historic  decisions that have affected so many Americans. We owe him a great debt  of gratitude. And I am honored and privileged to call Justice Breyer a  dear friend, and I wish him the best in his retirement.   Now, in looking for Justice Breyer's successor, President Biden said  that he wanted to nominate a ``persuasive'' Justice, someone in the  mold of Justice Breyer, and with Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President  Biden has found that person.   I am confident that Judge Jackson--who clerked for Justice Breyer on  the Supreme Court--will follow in his footsteps as a Justice who will  make a lasting contribution on the Court through her pragmatism,  evenhandedness, and deep understanding of the Constitution and the  impact that the Court's decisions have on all Americans.   And as the first African-American woman Justice on the Bench, Judge  Jackson's historic nomination is an important and long overdue step  toward making the Supreme Court better reflect the Nation whose people  the Court serves.   Fifty-four years ago yesterday, our Nation, our world, lost the  guiding light of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to assassination. That  loss was incalculable. We can only imagine the society we would live in  if Dr. King were still with us, preaching, marching, teaching, and I  have no doubt that Dr. King would be on the steps of the Capitol as the  loudest and proudest voice in support of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to  be our next Supreme Court Justice and the first Black woman to serve on  our highest Court.   He would know that with the appointment and confirmation of Judge  Jackson, we would take the long overdue step to make the Nation's top  Court look more like and better represent all of the American people.   The legacy of the more just, more equal society that Dr. King pushed  us to create is alive and it is well in this confirmation and on the  floor and hearing rooms of the U.S. Senate this week.   The Judiciary Committee held 4 days of hearings on Judge Jackson's  nomination, including 2 days of testimony from the judge herself. As we  all saw, some of the questioning of Judge Jackson from some of my  Republican colleagues was nothing short of offensive, distorting her  record, and tinged with racism and sexism. But Judge Jackson responded  with poise. She responded with brilliance. She calmly addressed and  corrected her questioners' false and misleading premises.   And she did so while demonstrating deep knowledge of the law and the  Constitution, respect for precedents, and displaying precisely the kind  of temperament we expect of someone sitting on the Nation's highest  Court.   The hearings showed the Nation that Judge Jackson possesses all of  the essential qualities of a jurist committed to the words engraved  above the entrance to the Supreme Court itself ``Equal Justice Under  Law.''   Of course, to anyone who knew Judge Jackson before her introduction  to the Nation as a Supreme Court nominee, none of this was surprising.  Judge Jackson's qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court are second  to none. She holds broad experience across the legal profession--as a  Supreme Court clerk, as a Federal public defender, as an attorney in  private practice, and as a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, as  a Federal district court judge, and as a Federal appellate judge.   It was, therefore, surprising to no one that she earned a unanimous  ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association. Let me  speak for a moment about one aspect of Judge Jackson's background that  stands out, and that is her experience as a public defender.   When confirmed, Judge Jackson will become the first-ever Justice with  background as a public defender and the first Justice with significant  criminal defense experience since the service of Justice Thurgood  Marshall, who retired in 1991. That work as a Federal public defender  has unjustly come under attack from my colleagues across the aisle who  suggest that being a public defender means that she is soft on crime.   But my Republican colleagues--who far too often focus singularly on  the constitutional right to bear arms--would do well to remember that  among the Constitution's other enshrined rights is the Sixth  Amendment's right to counsel in criminal cases. Without that right,  criminal defendants who cannot afford an attorney would find it  difficult or impossible to navigate the Court system with their rights  protected, including the fundamental right to a speedy and fair trial.   My Republican friends may also want to consider that Judge Jackson  comes from a law enforcement family, with a brother and uncle serving  as police officers, and that she has won the endorsement of the  Fraternal Order of Police, the Nation's largest police union.   Now, let me remind my colleagues that public defenders do not select  their client. They take on every assigned case because they are  committed to preserving and defending constitutional rights for  everyone. As a Federal public defender, Judge Jackson represented the  most vulnerable among us. She represented the clients other lawyers  avoided, and in doing so, she followed a long and honorable tradition  in the American legal profession that began with John Adams stepping  forward in 1770 to represent the British soldiers who committed the  Boston Massacre because he feared that they would not receive a fair  trial without adequate representation.   By confirming Judge Jackson, we will affirm that the rights of those  who cannot afford a lawyer are just as important as the rights of those  who can pay lawyers charging $1,000 an hour; that the rights of the  indigent and powerless are just as important as those of the rich and  the powerful.   Public defenders also experience firsthand and, therefore, understand  better than other lawyers just how our justice system treats the  accused, how it treats people of color, how it treats low-income  people. Every day, public defenders see the systemic biases and  prejudices that permeate our criminal justice system.   At a time when the United States holds more people behind bars than  any other Nation on Earth--including authoritarian regimes like North  Korea and China--the highest Court in the land would greatly benefit  from a Justice with a public defender background. Public defenders  serve as a unique bulwark of liberty and racial justice. So we should  welcome a public defender on the Supreme Court, especially one as well  qualified as Judge Jackson. Her singular perspective and voice are  sorely needed.   Judge Jackson's service as a trial judge on the U.S. District Court  for the District of Columbia is also of particular note in this  nomination. Only one of the current Supreme Court Justices--Justice  Sotomayor--has ever served on a trial court. And as a trial court  judge, Judge Jackson worked to ensure the parties before her understood  her approach to deciding cases.   Judge Jackson has explained that, as a trial judge, she emphasized  speaking directly to the individuals who appeared before her, not just  to their lawyers. She used the parties' names and treated them with  respect. She sought to ensure that those whom her rulings would  directly impact clearly understood the proceedings in which they were  involved, what was happening, and why it was happening.   This approach speaks to a judge who understands the importance of  accessibility to the law, to a judicial process that isn't shrouded in  mystery, and to a system that fulfills its promise of equal justice  under the law to everyone. We will be fortunate to have such a Justice  on the Supreme Court of the United States.   I have had the opportunity to meet with Judge Jackson one-on-one. I  came  [[Page S1961]]  away deeply impressed and convinced that President Biden has made a  great choice. The Senate has already confirmed Judge Jackson three  times on a bipartisan basis--most recently in June of 2021, when she  was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit. The Senate should again confirm her  with bipartisan support.   And when Judge Jackson is confirmed and becomes Justice Jackson, the  first African-American woman ever to take a seat on the High Court, she  will be an inspiration to so many across our country and around the  globe. She will especially be a role model for young Black girls  everywhere, showing them that in the United States of America, nothing  is beyond their reach.   Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall once said:         Sometimes history takes things into its own hands.    History says it is time for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, and I am  honored to help her and the Court and our country make history with her  confirmation.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown  Jackson to the Supreme Court of the United States of America.   I yield the floor.
