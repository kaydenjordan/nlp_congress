 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Florida for  managing this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3317, the SAFE Act,  legislation that will increase the Federal penalty for female genital  mutilation from 5 years to 15 years.   This past April, just north of Detroit, reports of this appalling and  brutal practice surfaced in my district. As a lifelong resident of  southeast Michigan, I was horrified to learn that three local  residents, including two physicians, professionals we trust with our  children, were charged for allegedly performing and participating in  this barbaric practice.   The subsequent Federal prosecution has shed light on an evil practice  that has no place in southeast Michigan or the United States. This  person who claims to be a physician is a monster and has reportedly  committed this heinous act hundreds of times.   This despicable practice has no place in our society, and we must  ensure our Federal laws reflect this principle. We must make it clear  to Americans and the rest of the world that this practice will not be  tolerated.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that over  500,000 girls in the United States have undergone or are at risk of  FGM. That is 500,000 girls too many. We must set a zero tolerance  against this practice. This is gender violence and oppression, and it  is time for the government to punish such egregious behavior  accordingly.   My bipartisan SAFE Act will increase the Federal penalty from 5 to 15  years, putting it more in line with other developed countries. We need  to protect our girls right here at home, and increasing the penalty  will go a long way toward accomplishing this goal.   I want to thank the coauthor of this bill, the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), my friend and colleague, for her work.  I also want to thank Chairman Goodlatte for his effort and leadership  in moving this bill through the committee process.   Mr. Speaker, today we can step toward eradicating this barbaric  practice, and I urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 3317.
