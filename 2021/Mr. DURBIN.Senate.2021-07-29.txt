 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, late last night, there was a vote on the  floor which was historic. I will address the subject matter in a  moment. But 17 Republicans joined the Democrats in an amazing  commitment to building America's infrastructure. I will speak to the  specifics of that in a moment.  [[Page S5150]]  But I wanted to recount another event this morning which was not as  widely published but could be very important to many American families.                           Prescription Drug Costs    Madam President, if you ask families across the United States to list  the top three things they are worried about in terms of pocketbook  issues and things that Congress can address, I will bet you that they  will end up putting the costs of prescription drugs on that list every  time. They know what happened. These prescription drug costs have gone  through the roof. For many people, it is a real hardship.   I was looking this morning at some of the information we have about  insulin, and, you know, for millions of Americans that is literally a  life-and-death drug. Insulin was discovered decades ago. The gentleman  and those who did the research to find it basically gave away all of  their patent rights--the rights to make any money off of insulin--for  $1. They said you can't take a life-and-death drug and put a pricetag  on it. It has to be shared by people.   Jonas Salk did exactly the same thing when it came to the polio  vaccine in the 1950s. He found this breakthrough vaccine--and I was one  of the early schoolkids to sign up for it--and said: I don't want to  make a penny off of this. This means too much to America and the world.   Bless both of those individuals for that kind of selflessness.   Yet when it comes to drugs like insulin today, and Sanofi, one of the  largest producers of insulin, in the year 2000, was charging $35 for a  dose of insulin. It has now had the price rise 25 times since then. The  price of an insulin vial is $350, creating a real hardship and a real  strain for many families who are dependent on insulin to keep  themselves or their children alive.   So, this morning, we had a meeting in the Senate Judiciary Committee.  We considered four pieces of legislation on a bipartisan basis--let me  underline that: bipartisan basis--and passed all four measures  unanimously with voice votes. I could tell you, having served on that  committee for over 20 years, it is a rare day that everything goes  through with bipartisan support on an issue of consequence. Today was  one of those days.   One of the bills, the Stop Significant and Time-wasting Abuse  Limiting Legitimate Innovation of New Generics Act--the Stop STALLING  Act--by Senators Klobuchar and Grassley, was advanced by a voice vote.   What we are finding is that the pharmaceutical industry is designing  new ways on a regular basis to delay the surrender of their patents. As  long as they have patents--and most of those are for 20 years--they  have the exclusive right to sell that drug, and no one can compete with  them. At the end of 20 years, the theory goes that the generic drug  companies step in, make the same drug for a much lower cost, and the  consumer finally gets a break.   Well, you can imagine the lawyers and businessmen in many  pharmaceutical companies who are trying to delay that moment of when  the generics step in for as long as possible. This bill that we passed  this morning, which will be coming to the Senate floor, addresses that.   We want to have access to generics and biosimilar treatments. We want  to make sure that the loopholes and tricks that the pharmaceutical  industry is using now to delay the generic drugs coming onto market  come to an end. This was an amazing array of drugs that, I think, will  have a direct impact on America and its future.                                  H.R. 3684    Speaking of impact, Madam President, what happened last night was  historic.   As I mentioned, 17 Republicans joined the Democrats in passing a  bipartisan infrastructure bill. It is rare that we come together on  something that significant, with that much bipartisanship. We are now  in the midst of the debate on that bill, on the cloture vote, and our  time is running. I hope, soon, that we can get to the merits of the  bill and get it enacted as quickly as possible.   This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rebuild our Nation's  roads, railways, and bridges; to make high-speed internet and clean  water realities for every home in America; and to create millions of  good-paying, family-supporting, and, in many cases, union jobs across  the country.   President Biden said he wanted to build back better when it came to  America. He sure showed it last night. We never could have reached that  point without his leadership. The White House has been a partner in  this bipartisan effort from the start, and 67 Members of the Senate  coalesced around this approach. This economy needs to work fairly for  everyone and protect our kids and grandkids from climate catastrophe,  and a major part of this bill addresses it.   This is a moment the American people have been waiting for. It  couldn't have come sooner. Right now, many of our roads and bridges are  in terrible disrepair, and our infrastructure is crumbling before our  eyes. Every week brings word of a new climate-related crisis:  devastating drought and wildfires in the West; melting power lines in  Oregon; rolling blackouts in Texas; and, 2 weeks ago, there was a  bridge collapsing in my State of Illinois.   Take a look at this picture. Let me describe what you are seeing  here.   This was a scene in a small, rural town in Illinois, in Seneca, when  a bridge on the River Road gave way to extreme flooding. As you can see  down here, the pavement comes to an end, and you can see all the way  through. When that bridge came apart, typically and in good fashion, a  group of Illinoisans stepped up as Good Samaritans and pulled the  driver out of this vehicle that was straddling this breaking highway. A  local police officer said the driver was ``really lucky that he didn't  end up in the creek under the bridge.''    I am grateful that nobody was harmed that evening. I thank the first  responders, as well, for coming to the rescue. But now, 2 weeks later,  that bridge is still broken, and the taxpayers in my home State are  stuck paying the tab. Repairs are going to cost over a million bucks.   This is just one example of the failure to invest in our Nation's  roads and bridges that is costing us. Every 4 years, the American  Society of Civil Engineers gives a report card on our roads and bridges  and their safety. For decades, it has been filled with the kind of  grades that you wouldn't want your kids to bring home from school. The  overall grade this year was a C minus, in the United States of America,  for the wealthiest nation and the largest economy on Earth. Imagine.   If we continue to neglect the arteries of our economy, the situation  will get worse. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that  the continued underinvestment in our Nation's infrastructure could cost  $10 trillion of loss in GDP over the next two decades, a major drain on  city and State budgets, but, more importantly, a threat to families and  their safety when they travel.   This truckdriver had no idea that he would take his truck out on this  road and, at the end of the day, be lucky to still be alive. Our Nation  has one of the highest road fatality rates in the world. And nearly 1  in 12 bridges in America is considered structurally deficient. This is  one of them. That means that they are at the risk of being compromised  by extreme weather, which is becoming more and more common with climate  change. Any of us could become that man on the bridge in Seneca, IL,  who was saved by his neighbors.   The infrastructure proposal we are considering at this very moment  would eliminate this threat across America, rehabilitate our roads and  bridges, keep our economy growing, and make our families safe. With  this historic infrastructure proposal, we are removing the hazards from  our communities and establishing a better foundation for our economy.  Let's take a glance at some of the achievements under this bipartisan  proposal.   It is the largest ever investment in public transit in America's  history. I called the mayor of the city of Chicago yesterday, and I  said: I think I have some good news for you. We are going to be able to  build that transit system out, make it more accessible for those with  disabilities, have safer stations, and expand the reach of transit in  the city of Chicago.   I called downstate, to the Springfield Mass Transit District, to tell  them the good news as well: more buses that are fuel-efficient,  electric buses, and buses that really acknowledge that we need a  response to the climate situation.  [[Page S5151]]    A historic expansion in electric vehicle infrastructure is part of  this bill. Electric vehicles are the future. Don't believe me when I  say it, and don't wait for some government spokesman to say it. Just  turn on your TV and watch the advertisements.   The Ford F-150 Lightning--this electric truck--is so popular in  America and has an electrifying ad. To say that it is available now is  an overstatement. But it will be soon. They put on the ad, if you look  at the very end of it: If you want to reserve one of these trucks, here  is the website you should contact.   That is happening more and more--an electrified Mustang, for example.   All of these suggest that the private sector is racing ahead of those  of us in government, realizing that electric vehicles are the future.  This plan will help automakers win the race worldwide, and it will be  the most important auto race in our history to make sure that electric  vehicles have the American imprint on them.   This bipartisan plan is a move for the future. For families in  Illinois, the funding means parents won't have to worry about a bridge  collapse while taking their kids to school, and it means they can trust  the water coming out of the faucet to be clean and safe. For parents in  the city of Chicago, with more lead service lines than any city in the  United States, it could be a lifesaver.   These are the investments we need if we want America to win the 21st  century. By making them today, with interest rates now at a historic  low, we can reap the benefit for decades to come, and that is not just  my assessment. Last week, Moody's chief economist said that President  Biden's plan to build back better ``will lift the economy's longer term  growth potential and ease inflation pressures''--two things that all of  us endorse.   Let me say that again for my fellow Senators. Many on the other side  of the aisle who can't wait to give a looming inflation speech. This  package, according to Moody's chief economist, ``will lift the  economy's longer term growth potential and ease inflation pressures.''   Earlier this morning, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported for  the first time our Nation's economic output has surpassed the pre- pandemic high.   We are back in the saddle. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, people  feel safe and more financially secure. They are heading back out into  the world, shopping and dining at restaurants and traveling.   Let me add quickly: The incidents we are finding of infections,  hospitalizations, and deaths are almost exclusively from people who are  not vaccinated--not vaccinated. They are the ones who are the most  vulnerable, and they make innocent people, like our children, more  vulnerable because of their decision not to be vaccinated.   This growth in our economy reflects a simple truth: Relief for  working families benefits all Americans and drives our economy forward.  We have a lot of work to do to build this economy, but this is where we  should start.   I want to thank the bipartisan group of Senators who came together to  produce this package. In many ways, it is miraculous. This agreement  can do more and enable us to repair America's roads and bridges. It can  show us the way a divided Senate can come together for the good of this  country.   Just remember, there wasn't a single infrastructure bill--major  infrastructure bill--in the last 5 years, under the previous President,  not one. We are doing it now on a bipartisan basis that is long  overdue.   I want to thank President Joe Biden for his determined leadership.  Nothing this big and important is ever accomplished with a President  standing on the sidelines.   Joe Biden promised to work with both parties to make America work for  all Americans, and he has. This is an achievement we can be proud of.                                 Immigration    Madam President, let me conclude by saying that the Senate Republican  leader, Senator McConnell, came to the floor this morning to speak of  immigration. I am glad he did because it is a topic we cannot ignore  and must not ignore.   We have not passed a significant immigration bill in the United  States of America in 36 years. Ronald Reagan was the President. And  when you come with a list of horribles with the current immigration  system, it is almost endless--the unfairness of the system.   But the Senator from Kentucky took a position which I take exception  to. He believes that if we allow any immigrant into this country, it is  a green light, as he called it, for others to try to come in legally or  illegally.   I think he is dead wrong, because every year--every year--in the  United States of America, with a population of over 320 million, we  legally allow 1 million new immigrants to become this country, every  year. That is what America is all about. We are a nation of immigrants,  and we understand the value of immigrants to our country.   We had a hearing last week on farm workers. We have 2.4 million farm  workers who pick the crops and process the food that we enjoy at every  single meal--2.4 million. And, sadly, many of them are in horrible  circumstances under our immigration laws. They are subject to  deportation and arrest at any moment. For what? For being here picking  the crops that our kids eat for breakfast and things that we count on  every single day.   So the House of Representatives took a step forward, a bipartisan  step forward. Thirty Republicans joined the Democrats to pass a farm  worker bill. I want to give special credit to Senator Mike Bennet, who  has been a leader in this area. We have an agreement in this bill, for  both growers and workers, to give those who do that back-breaking  labor, day in and day out, a chance and a path to citizenship.   One of the critics came to our committee and said: Oh, mass amnesty  for farm workers--why would we want to do that? These people come in  and pick a few crops and we are going to give them citizenship.   I wish he would have taken a minute to read the bill. You know how  many years it takes picking that farm crop to be eligible for  citizenship under this bill? Fourteen to 19 years. Nineteen years. Does  that sound like somebody stealing across the border, pretending to be a  farm worker to become a citizen? Nineteen years of your life and then  you are eligible.   It is only common human decency for us to do that.   We need workers in so many areas. In a hearing yesterday on meat  processing, I asked the major companies that process meat in this  country: What percentage of your workforce processing that meat are  immigrant labor?   Well, they weren't sure. I know the number. The Migration Policy  Institute tells us that 40 percent of the people who are processing  poultry and meat in this country are immigrants.   Why? Why are they attracted to this job? Because so few Americans are  attracted. They need to have immigrant labor to make up the difference.  It is hard, hot, dangerous, back-breaking labor, and they do it every  darn day so we can enjoy our meals.   And to say that we are going to ignore that reality, that we don't  need a single immigrant in this country, is mindless.   I would just invite those who don't believe we need immigrants in  this country going to work to make this a better nation, skip a few  meals, because what is on your table is there because of immigrant  labor.   Face the reality. Be honest about it, be fair about it, and don't  label all of these people who are working in our country as would-be  terrorists who are taking away valuable American jobs. They are an  important part of America's past and an important part of our future.   I yield the floor
