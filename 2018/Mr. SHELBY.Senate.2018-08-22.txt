 Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, I just say that the Senator from  Connecticut has a worthy amendment. We are all concerned about what is  going on in Yemen. I would have hoped that we would not do it on this  bill because we are trying to keep out a lot of riders and things, but  this is something we are going to have to address.   I and others on both sides of the aisle would like to work with him  because what has been going on in Yemen is atrocious. I object, though,  at this point in time.
