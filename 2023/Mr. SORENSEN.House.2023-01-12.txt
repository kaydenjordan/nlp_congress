 Madam Speaker, it is an honor to be here serving as  Illinois' 17th Congressional District trusted neighbor in Congress.   I spent more than 20 years of my life as a broadcast meteorologist,  making sure that people had the right information to make good  decisions in times of dangerous weather.   Now I am here in Congress to serve my constituents as their trusted  voice in government. I am focused on delivering results for my  constituents, whether it is lowering food, energy, or prescription drug  costs, increasing good-paying jobs in our communities, or protecting  access to reproductive healthcare.   I promise to work with anyone on either side of the aisle, Democrat  or Republican, on commonsense solutions that solve the problems central  and northwestern Illinois families face every day.   I am ready to put partisan politics aside and get to work in the  118th Congress.                            ____________________
