 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in opposition to H.R. 803, the Protecting America's  Wilderness and Public Lands Act.   Contrary to the name, this bill will damage our environment, while  simultaneously killing jobs in rural America.   The proponents of this bill will say it is broadly supported. Listen  to the Members who represent the districts most affected by this bill.  They don't want it.   Listen to the groups opposed: American Farm Bureau, American Forest  Resource Council, or the Grand Junction, Colorado, Chamber of Commerce.  They don't want this bill.   This bill creates nearly 1.5 million of acres of new wilderness,  withdraws 1.2 million acres from mineral production, and designates  over 1,200 miles of wild scenic and recreational rivers. For  perspective, the wilderness designated in this bill is the same size as  President Biden's home State of Delaware.   This Chamber has bypassed the committee process and circumvented the  will of Members who represent districts directly impacted by this  legislation. It was scheduled for the floor before the Committee was  ever organized.                                time  1730    The consequences of this bill on the four Western States it impacts  will be far-reaching. For example, if you live in Colorado and you  enjoy recreating on mountain biking and ATV trails like the people  pictured here on the Tabeguache Trail, this bill will shut down your  ability to recreate on those lands. The same goes for snowmobilers, OHV  users, and parents with strollers.   It is very concerning that these wilderness areas will now be off- limits to active forest management. 2020 was sadly another record- breaking fire season. We have a problem on our national forests that is  not going to be solved with handsaws and shovels. Now is not the time  to rely on century-old management techniques stipulated by wilderness  designations when over 80 million acres of U.S. Forest Service land is  in desperate need of treatment.   If that wasn't enough, this bill also designates lands as wilderness  in the wildland-urban interface. This is a matter of life and death.   Mr. Speaker, I want to clear up some misconceptions about the last  title of this bill, the Grand Canyon Protection Act. Nobody is mining  in the Grand Canyon; nobody wants to mine in the Grand Canyon; and  nobody will mine in the Grand Canyon--ever. Proponents of the bill  would have you believe that this is happening right near the Colorado  River. In fact, there are already buffer zones in place. It is called  the Grand Canyon National Park.   The only saving this bill will do is saving Chinese and Russian  uranium mining jobs. In 2019, we only produced 0.5 percent of the  domestic uranium needed for commercial reactors. This bill goes far  beyond the park's boundaries and the boundaries of the sponsor's home  district to simply kill jobs to the direct benefit of our adversaries.  This bill will make us more dependent on hostile nations like Russia,  Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, and Chinese-owned mines in Namibia.   In conclusion, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this terrible,  horrible, no-good, very bad bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the following  letters from multiple organizations in opposition to H.R. 803.                                Independent Petroleum Association                                                     of America,                                  Washington, DC, February 23, 2021.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Madam Speaker: The Independent Petroleum Association of       America (IPAA) is opposed to H.R. 803, the ``Protecting       America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act.'' This bill       creates nearly 1.5 million acres of new wilderness and       permanently withdraws 1.2 million acres from mineral       production. It is in direct opposition to the multiple use       mandate given to the Department of the Interior to manage the       federal estate. Many of the local communities impacted by       this measure, including Garfield County in Colorado which has       existing mineral leases and planned for further development,       have raised significant concerns due to the elimination of       multiple use of the land and the overall threat to local       economies and rural jobs.        Further, many of the lands under consideration in H.R. 803       do not meet the basic characteristics for consideration as       wilderness. Instead, the legislation arbitrarily designates       areas as wilderness and wild and scenic rivers despite       official testimony provided by the relevant land management       agencies to previous Congresses that many of these       designations are inappropriate and not recommended. To       declare areas that do not possess these characteristics       undermines the integrity of the Wilderness Act and the Wild       and Scenic Rivers Act.        The process by which H.R 803 is coming to the House floor       is also concerning. The bill did not go through regular       order, receiving no hearings or mark-ups in the 117th       Congress. In fact, the bill was scheduled for floor       consideration before the Natural Resources Committee had even       organized. Local input, especially with regards to managing       active mineral leases which affect jobs, should have been       solicited in an effort to allow the House to better       understand the broad impacts of the bill.        For these reasons, IPAA is strongly opposed to H.R. 803.        Sincerely,      Dan Naatz,          Senior Vice President of Government Relations and             Political Affairs, Independent Producers Association of             America.                                   ____                                                  February 23, 2021.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Chairman, House Natural Resources Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Ranking Member, House Natural Resources Committee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Westerman: The       signatories to this letter urge you to vote in opposition to       the ``Grand Canyon Protection Act'' (H.R. 1052), as stand-      alone legislation or as part of the Protecting America's       Wilderness and Public Lands Act under consideration in the       U.S. House of Representatives this week. H.R. 1052       perpetuates false claims of mining in one of our nation's       most beautiful national parks. It also fails to acknowledge       our nation's alarming reliance on foreign sources of minerals       and would further weaken the already vulnerable supply chains       for key U.S. industry sectors, including manufacturing,       infrastructure, energy, and defense.        Federal lands--predominantly in the western U.S.--are the       source of much of our nation's mineral endowment. Of these       federal lands, half are either off limits or under       restrictions to mineral development. While mining is       certainly not appropriate on all federal lands, maintaining       responsible access to the very resources that drive       innovation, feed economic growth and improve our nation's       quality of life is essential. Given the vast amount of       federal lands already closed to mining operations, caution       should be exercised when determining whether additional lands       should be placed off limits.        H.R. 1052 targets more than a million acres of mineral rich       lands, including world-class uranium ore deposits that are       located well outside the boundaries of the Grand Canyon       National Park. The park, as created, already includes a       built-in buffer zone to protect park resources from       activities taking place outside the park boundaries and an       additional million-acre buffer zone is not justified. H.R.       1052 deliberately disregards our dangerous dependence on       countries like Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan to meet our       nation's need for uranium to fuel our nuclear Navy and supply       20 percent of our nation's electricity.        Furthermore, H.R. 1052 ignores not only the comprehensive       framework of federal, state, and local environmental       regulations that govern every aspect of mining, but the       findings of the Department of the Interior that the park was       not at risk from mining given these existing protections. In       fact, the U.S. Geological Survey recently concluded that the       nine uranium mines that have operated in northern Arizona       since the 1970s (since modern environmental laws took effect)       have caused no adverse impact to environmental or health.       This unwise and unwarranted mineral withdrawal is bad public       policy that ignores the vast sectors of our economy that       depend upon a reliable and secure supply chain of responsibly       sourced minerals and metals. It also puts President Biden's       renewable goals at a risk, forcing domestic manufacturers of       clean energy technologies to rely on increased imports of       these materials.        Access to our nation's vast and diverse resources and fair       regulatory policies that promote certainty in the mine       permitting process are the elements of sound public policy       that should be considered when addressing resource       development on federal lands. We urge you to vote against       this misguided bill and support policies that promote       responsible resource development.            Sincerely,        American Exploration & Mining Association, Arizona Chamber       of Commerce & Industry, Arizona Mining Association, National       Mining Association, Women's Mining Coalition, Wyoming Mining       Association.                                   ____                                              NSSGA, National Stone,                                       Sand & Gravel Association,                                                  February 19, 2020.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Natural Resources,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Westerman: On       behalf of the 400 members of the National Stone, Sand &       Gravel Association (NSSGA), I am writing to express our       concern with certain provisions included in H.R. 803, the       ``Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act''. Our       members take extraordinary strides to responsibly produce       construction materials and we oppose legislation that       arbitrarily and permanently prohibit the development of       aggregates operations on millions of acres of federal lands.        NSSGA represents aggregates producers and those who       manufacture equipment and services that support the       construction industry. Our members are essential to the work       of this country, and we represent more than 90 percent of the       crushed stone and 70 percent of the sand and gravel consumed       annually in the United States. Our members employ more than       100,000 hard-working men and women and are responsible for       the essential raw materials found in every home, building,       road, bridge and public works project.        NSSGA is most concerned with Section 802 that would       permanently ban aggregate production on millions of acres of       land in Arizona. Such a ban would severely diminish the       ability for communities to access key resources that are       necessary for building roads, bridges, schools, hospitals,       homes and businesses. Allowing this ban to proceed would have       a significant impact on the cost of public works projects due       to the necessity for stone, sand and gravel required to       develop and repair infrastructure and buildings to be       imported into the area. These products are expensive to       transport and would further strain the budgets of local       communities and federal entities that are seeking to make       infrastructure investments in Arizona including improvements       to National Parks like the Grand Canyon.        Further, permanently banning aggregate operations on these       federal lands would greatly impact the region and our       nation's energy development. Industrial sand is a key       component in energy production. Under the proposal access to       these essential materials would be limited, driving up       production costs that would likely be passed along to       customers--families and businesses that are facing       uncertainty during the pandemic.        While this legislation will clearly create a competitive       disadvantage that has negative economic impacts for the       families in the impacted communities, it will also have       significant environmental impacts. Delaying and increasing       the cost of improvements to congested roads or eliminating       access to a material that is needed to develop a new clean       water project and cleaner energy sources will have real       environmental impacts on establishing cleaner air and water       and access to public lands.        Instead of taking broad, unilateral actions to withdraw       access to these lands, NSSGA urges Congress to consult with       local stakeholders and communities to find more tailored       approaches to preserve treasured lands.  [[Page H696]]       NSSGA members strongly promote conservation in both their       business practices and personal lives. Our member companies       have advanced award-winning environmental stewardship       projects to build critical habitats, promote biodiversity and       drive greatest access to recreational activities. Further, as       most NSSGA member quarries and plants have literally served       as the bedrock of their communities of decades, they take       great pride in engagement and are actively involved to giving       back to their local communities.        Rather than rushing through the legislative process to       advance H.R. 803 on the floor of the House of       Representatives, NSSGA urges the Committee to move this large       public lands package through regular order in order to allow       more input, dialoged and discussion of these important issues       from all involved stakeholders.        We appreciate your consideration of our views and please do       not hesitate to reach out if NSSGA may be of any assistance.            Sincerely,                                             Michael W. Johnson,                                                  President and CEO,      National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association.                                   ____                                                  February 25, 2021.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the nearly six million       Farm Bureau member families across the United States, we       write in strong opposition to H.R. 803, the Protecting       America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act. Collectively this       package of bills impacts lands in California, Colorado,       Arizona and Washington by creating nearly 1.5 million acres       of new wilderness, the most restrictive federal land use       classification. Additionally, it would designate 1,200 miles       of wild and scenic rivers and create 110,000 acres of       National Monument expansion. Further, many of the wilderness       and wild and scenic river designations contained in this bill       are not suitable for these restrictive designations. To       declare areas that do not possess these characteristics       undermines the integrity of the Wilderness Act and the Wild       and Scenic Rivers Act as well as the lands that possess those       features.        Farmers and ranchers rely on federal forests and rangelands       for economic and recreational opportunities. Livestock       grazing on federal lands forms an integral part of ranching       operations across the United States, especially in the West.       But farmers also use national forests and rangelands       throughout the United States in a variety of other ways.       Federal lands throughout the country are important components       of our nation's watersheds that provide water to a large       number of Americans. Active land management practices such as       timber production and livestock grazing are critical to       protect against wildland fires which devastate range       resources, damage watersheds, threaten wildlife and put rural       communities at great risk.        American farmers and ranchers have a genuine interest in       healthy and productive federal forest and rangelands. At the       same time, we have a genuine interest in seeing lands managed       in an environmentally sound manner. Farmers and ranchers       understand and appreciate that active management of our       federal lands is critical to the long-term viability of the       ecosystem, the resource, and the communities they support.       Designations included in H.R. 803 threaten multiple use areas       by prohibiting the employment of motorized tools and       mechanized vehicles in watershed management, trail       maintenance, soil treatment, noxious weed control, waste       management and fire protection.        Our nation's federal forests are facing serious threats       from fires, insects and disease due to a lack of active       forest management. The poor health of our federal forests       also threatens wildlife populations and neighboring non-      federal lands, as well as the vitality of rural, forested       communities across the country. A vibrant livestock and       forest products industry helps diversify rural economies in       ways that compliment ranching and agricultural operations.       Wilderness and National Monument designations eliminate       federal land management agencies ability to effectively       protect against the threat of catastrophic wildland fire.        Farmers, landowners, and grazing permitees should be fully       involved as affected partners in any process to execute       federal land use designations which restrict public use and       access. Federal land use designations that lack local       stakeholder input from agricultural and resource management       professionals often generates significant controversy and       economic hardship at the local level. The detrimental effects       of a federal land use designation frequently causes       residents, elected state and county officials, and local       stakeholders significant reductions in economic activity and       the loss of jobs in rural communities. Past designations have       also affected water rights, public lands grazing and access       to State and private lands.        Farm Bureau supports the multiple-use concept of federal       lands, recognizing that definable land areas have dominant-      use capability, which should be recognized with the concept       of multiple uses without the total exclusion of other uses.       The Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act       stands in clear violation of AFBF policy. Additionally, the       California, Colorado, Arizona and Washington Farm Bureau's       oppose passage of this legislation.        Farm Bureau urges you to oppose passage of H.R. 803, the       Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act.            Sincerely,        American Farm Bureau Federation, Arizona Farm Bureau,       California Farm Bureau, Colorado Farm Bureau, Washington Farm       Bureau.                                   ____       Raul Grijalva,      Chairman, House Natural Resources Committee, Washington, DC.      Bruce Westerman,      Ranking Member, House Natural Resources Committee,           Washington, DC.        Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Westerman:        The National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the American       Sheep Industry Association and the Public Lands Council are       deeply concerned about the potential immediate and long-term       impacts of H.R. 803, the Colorado Wilderness Act. NCBA is the       nation's largest and oldest trade association representing       America's cattle producers, with other 250,000 producers       represented directly and through its 46 state affiliate       associations. Since 1865, ASI has been the national trade       organization representing the interests of more than 100,000       sheep producers located throughout the country who produce       America's lamb and wool. The Public Lands is the only       national organization dedicated solely to representing the       roughly 22,000 ranchers who hold federal grazing permits and       operate on federal lands. H.R. 803 's passage would be       detrimental to public lands ranchers who utilize federal       grazing permits.        While this bill obviously seeks to appeal to the desire to       protect a landscape's natural state, the impact of       designating lands as wilderness, especially such vast swaths,       significantly compromises long-term ecological health.       Currently, federal lands managed for multiple use provide       valuable opportunity for livestock grazing, which is a tool       to manage fuels that contribute to the risk of catastrophic       wildfire. Further, grazing helps to cultivate landscapes that       are more suitable and healthier wildlife habitat. The       objectives the sponsors profess that they seek to achieve are       immediately undermined by designating these millions of acres       of wilderness. Designations limit management options, making       it more difficult for land managers and stewards to protect       these landscapes and their valuable attributes.        Like ``wilderness,'' ``preservation'' is often a term used       to convey the prioritization of maintaining an area's natural       state, regardless of impact. While preservation may seem       optimal, federal lands provide significantly greater benefit       to all who utilize it when the conservation of resources is       prioritized. While preservation seeks protection of nature       from any use or change, conservation seeks the proper use of       nature, providing opportunity for ecological enhancement.       Grazing, for example, is a vital conservation tool to curb       invasive species growth, promote improved soil and forage       health, and reduce wildfire fuel load.        Beyond general concerns about promoting wilderness       designations as a land management tool, H.R. 803 fails to       follow established criteria for ``wilderness,'' instead       arbitrarily designating areas as ``wilderness'' and ``wild       and scenic rivers'' despite official testimony from relevant       land management agencies. At a minimum, wilderness       determinations must be grounded in science and fact.        As Congress continues to develop natural resources and       federal lands policy, it must prioritize legislation that       recognizes that conservation, not preservation, is the key to       effective land management and continued enjoyment for future       generations. We urge you to oppose H.R. 803, the Colorado       Wilderness Act, and seek more engaged, thoughtful management       of our precious natural resources.            Sincerely,        American Sheep Industry Association,        National Cattlemen's Beef Association,        Public Lands Council.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Newhouse), the chair of the Western Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  [[Page H700]]  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), the ranking member on the Subcommittee on  Energy and Mineral Resources.     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Herrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Fulcher), the ranking member on the Public Lands  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Mrs. Boebert), whose district is more affected by this bill  than anyone else.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is left on  both sides.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Montana (Mr. Rosendale).  [[Page H702]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Obernolte).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might  consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we adopt the motion to recommit, we will instruct the  Committee on Natural Resources to consider our cancel the Biden ban  amendment to H.R. 803.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    The amendment is simple. It will nullify Executive  Order No. 14008 and Secretarial Order No. 3395 issued during the  President's first weeks in office.   The Biden administration wasted no time in imposing their extremist  environmental agenda. On day one, political appointees created a  nightmare for our energy operators and a never-ending bottleneck for  approvals necessary to keep our energy economy running.   Just a few days later, President Biden halted all new energy  production on our Federal lands and waters, jeopardizing the  livelihoods of thousands of Americans in the middle of a pandemic and  economic crisis.   The administration has tried to downplay the impact of these actions,  but we are already feeling the consequences of what I like to call the  Biden ban. The economic impact of the decisions will be far-reaching,  impacting thousands of companies, many of which are small businesses.  Recent studies have concluded that a long-term ban on onshore leasing  would cost 72,000 jobs annually, and a long-term ban on offshore  drilling would cost 145,000 jobs.   Federal energy development represents a sizable portion of State  budgets. Can we afford to cut off this crucial source of revenue as our  communities are struggling to recover from the pandemic? Our schools  need funding to buy PPE that they need to reopen. Yet, the Biden ban  would disrupt a critical source of revenue that our K-12 schools rely  on.   In addition, these actions will bankrupt programs like the Land and  Water Conservation Fund.   The ramifications of these actions by the Biden administration will  be devastating to our rural communities. Americans who work hard every  day to keep the lights on and our gas prices low deserve better than a  pink slip from out-of-touch political appointees.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, recommit  H.R. 803 to the Natural Resources Committee, and put Americans back to  work.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1830     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, today we heard concerns from our Members, including  Members most affected by this legislation.   Tomorrow, we will debate amendments that include 15 new unrelated  matters to make the total amount of bills in this one bill 23. This  will make this bill three times worse after we consider amendments.   I believe we have the responsibility to leave our environment better  than we found it. We talk about the economy so often that many people  think that we forget about the environment. That couldn't be further  from the truth, we all breathe the air and drink the water.   H.R. 803 would attempt to preserve our resources, locking them up and  throwing away the key. Congress' focus should be on conservation and  conserving these resources instead, using them in sustainable,  responsible ways that every American can enjoy.   Since we weren't given any opportunity to debate this bill in  committee, I would like to remind my colleagues that this bill will  harm the environment; it will kill jobs; it will limit access to  outdoor recreation; it will hurt State water rights; it will imperil  our national security and American energy independence; it will impede  necessary forest management; and make us more reliant on hostile  foreign nations.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
