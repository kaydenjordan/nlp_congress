 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and sacrifice  of one of Utah's finest. Master Officer Joseph Shinners of the Provo  Police Department was, tragically, killed on Saturday night in the line  of duty.   At the time, he was responding to assist in the arrest of a dangerous  fugitive with a history of violence towards citizens and police  officers when he was struck by gunfire and died as a result of his  injuries.   Joe leaves behind his loving wife, Kaylyn, and 1-year-old son, Logan.   Mr. Speaker, my heart aches every time an officer is killed in the  line of duty, but this one is personal. When Joe made his decision to  work for Provo PD, I was his mayor. In a very real way, I feel  responsible for his training, his work at Provo City, and his safety. I  am deeply saddened by this terrible news.   I stand here on the floor of the House of Representatives, and I  speak for the entire Provo community when I say that Joe is a true  hero. He gave the ultimate sacrifice to protect us, and we owe him  and his family our deepest gratitude.    The chief of the Provo Police Department, Richard Ferguson, described  him as intelligent, honorable, hardworking, and one of his all-stars.  Chief Ferguson described him as the officer you would like to show up  at your door in your crucible moment.   He was born in Boston and graduated high school in Springfield. He  grew up in a home that valued and respected public service, with his  siblings serving as policemen and his father, a retired fire captain.   During his 3 years of service at the Provo Police Department, he  worked mostly in Provo's thriving downtown and on the SWAT team. He  also served on the bicycle patrol and as a field training officer.   Most importantly, he was a good man, husband, and father. One of his  fellow officers remembered that there was a time that he arrested  someone and gave them a hug just as he was arrested to offer them  comfort. That was the type of cop he was.   My wife, Sue, and I offer our deepest sympathy to Provo PD, the  family and friends of Joe, and hope that they know we will never forget  their sacrifice--especially to Kaylyn and Logan.   Our brave policemen and -women face serious potential danger every  time they say good-bye to their families and leave their homes to go on  patrol, and they know that it is possibly the last time they see them  and it could be their final good-bye.   I take this moment to express my sincere appreciation to all of our  Nation's first responders and police officers, but today, especially,  to those of Provo City. We love you, respect you, and thank you.                            ____________________
