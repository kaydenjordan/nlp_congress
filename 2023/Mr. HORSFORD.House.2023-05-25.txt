 Madam Speaker, do you see what I see?   No Republicans.   They are not here to do their job, so America's jobs are at risk.   Madam Speaker, 8.3 million American jobs can be lost because  Republicans want to hold us hostage and force a default.   Madam Speaker, 30,000 Nevadans who are struggling right now to keep  their jobs, to pay their rent, to afford their mortgage, will see the  effects if Republicans are successful in causing a default on America;  60,000 veterans in my district could lose their health benefits; 73,000  families and children in Nevada could lose SNAP food benefits; 253,000  kicked off health insurance on Medicaid; and 1,300 preschool and  childcare slots, which are vital.   Madam Speaker, I would have time if the Speaker of this House would  call us back into session. I will continue to do my job to speak on  behalf of my constituents who sent me here to work on their behalf.   Madam Speaker, call this House back to session. Let's do our job.                            ____________________
