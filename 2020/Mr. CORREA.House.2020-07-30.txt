 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am  proud to support the Trahan-Correa amendment.   Our most precious gifts that we have in life are our children. As  parents, nothing is more important than the well-being of our children.   Today, parents across the country are very concerned about their  children's health, as they should be. Parents across this country are  also concerned about their children's education and how to move  forward.   Parents and local school boards, elected by the local voters, are in  the best position to make the decisions on when to open those schools,  and under what circumstances, not Washington bureaucrats.
