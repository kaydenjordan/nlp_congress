 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to talk about one of the great  service-based programs in America, the AmeriCorps program.   Since 1994, more than 1.1 million Americans have served in  AmeriCorps. Today, more than 75,000 AmeriCorps members serve each year  at over 21,000 locations across the country, including nonprofits,  schools, public education agencies, and community and faith-based  groups.   AmeriCorps members come from all across this country. They are young  men and women looking to learn leadership and give back to our country  and our communities.   They serve critical needs like fighting poverty, sustaining national  parks, responding to and preparing for disasters, and mentoring youth.   They mobilize and coordinate millions of volunteers to serve  alongside them, which promotes a lasting impact on the volunteers and  the communities that they serve.   I was recently fortunate to speak at the induction ceremony for the  AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps, one of three AmeriCorps  programs. AmeriCorps NCCC members are assigned to one of four regional  campuses, one being Sacramento, California, the district I represent.   Before becoming AmeriCorps members, the inductees have to take the  AmeriCorps member pledge; and, as I read that pledge, I thought this is  something that we ought to think about as Members of Congress.   Mr. Speaker, let me read that pledge to you right now. It says:         I will get things done for America, to make our people       safer, smarter, and healthier.        I will bring Americans together to strengthen our       communities.        Faced with apathy, I will take action.        Faced with conflict, I will seek common ground.        Faced with adversity, I will persevere.        I will carry this commitment with me this year and beyond.        I am an AmeriCorps member, and I will get things done.    Imagine, if these young Americans can take that pledge, what if we  just changed that last line to ``I am a Member of Congress, and I will  get things done''?   We can learn something from these young people. Let's come together  as a body. Let's emulate what we are teaching that next generation, and  let's get things done, Congress.                            ____________________
