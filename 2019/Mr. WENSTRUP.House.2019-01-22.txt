 Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the 200th  anniversary of the founding of the University of Cincinnati, my alma  mater.   University of Cincinnati began as the two original chartered colleges  by the State of Ohio. In January of 1819, the two merged into the  esteemed university we know today.   Cincinnati is recognized as a Carnegie Research 1 university, with  over 300,000 alumni across the Nation, and is the home to top programs  in both the liberal arts and the sciences.   In 1969, Cincinnati was the first college to implement a co-op  program, setting the stage for universities around the country,  enhancing workforce development across America.   It is incredible to see how far this fine institution has come: from  two small colleges so long ago, to the home of the Nation's first  teaching hospital, to the fourth oldest continuously operating law  school, to its glory today.   I know the University of Cincinnati will continue to inspire those  who are lucky enough to call her home.                            ____________________
