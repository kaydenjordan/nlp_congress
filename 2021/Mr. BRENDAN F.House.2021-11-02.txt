 BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise to  recognize the November 1984 anti-Sikh riots in India, also commonly  referred to as the ``Sikh Massacre.''   Sikhism, which originated in Punjab, India, saw its followers first  begin immigrating to our shores nearly 130 years ago. The Sikh  community is one of the largest in the world, with roughly 30 million  followers globally and more than half a million here in the United  States.   The massacre against the Sikhs began in the capital territory of  Delhi and a number of other major Indian cities on November 1, 1984,  following the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The  first Sikh life was tragically taken early that morning in East Delhi.   The violence, which lasted 3 days, resulted in thousands upon  thousands of casualties among the Sikh community. In the aftermath of  the massacre, it was reported that nearly 20,000 were forced to flee  the city, leading to countless displaced people.   Madam Speaker, remembering the Sikh Massacre is a pivotal and  historic step in the fight for justice and accountability for the  families of all those victims.                            ____________________
