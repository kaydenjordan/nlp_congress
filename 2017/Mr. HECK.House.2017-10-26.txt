 Mr. Speaker, Bryan Black was the kid in Puyallup,  Washington, with boundless potential, always striving to do more. He  excelled in the classroom and, get this, both on the wrestling mat and  at State chess tournaments. Go figure.   When he grew up, he took his potential to the United States Army,  where Staff Sergeant Bryan Black conquered Ranger School and Special  Forces Selection.   Sergeant Black was not just a warrior and a protector, he was a  healer. As a Green Beret in the elite 3rd Group, he served as a medic,  always encouraging and caring for those around him.   On October 4, Sergeant Black was killed in Niger.   Our hearts ache for his wife, Michelle; for his sons, Ezekiel and  Isaac; and for his parents, Hank and Karen. Their son, husband, father,  friend, and patriot will be remembered.   Precious few among us dedicate our God-given ability to protection of  our country, but as Sergeant Black's father, Hank, so eloquently said:  Some people could, would, should. Others do. Bryan did.                            ____________________
