 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor news anchor Sherri  Jackson, who is celebrating her 25th anniversary today as a trusted  voice of the CBS 42 family in Birmingham, Alabama.   Sherri Jackson is an award-winning journalist who currently serves as  a managing editor and a member of the CBS 42 investigative team.   Sherri hails from St. Louis, Missouri. She made her home in  Birmingham in 1998 and has blazed trails reporting on the critical  issues affecting Birmingham and central Alabama.   Sherri's career has earned her praise and recognition, including Best  News Anchor by the Alabama Broadcasters Association.   I am grateful to Sherri for traveling to Washington, D.C., in 2013 to  cover one of my proudest moments in Congress, awarding the  Congressional Gold Medal to the four little girls.   I know that my constituents in Birmingham are eternally grateful for  her consistent and trusted voice.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Sherri Jackson for her  extraordinary career and congratulating her on 25 years of exceptional  work at CBS 42.                            ____________________
