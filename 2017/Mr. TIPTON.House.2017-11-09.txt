 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in  support of the gentleman from Minnesota's legislation, the Micro  Offering Safe Harbor Act.   As I have traveled through my district back in Colorado, I have often  been dismayed by the ever-increasing number of storefronts, once  thriving businesses, which now have ``for sale'' and ``for lease''  signs out front.   Small businesses are essential to job creation and job innovation,  but they have been so hamstrung by the burden of compliance with  regulations intended for large public companies that their ability to  be able to create jobs and innovate has been stifled.   The Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act will exempt certain micro  offerings from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of  1933, thereby removing obstacles to obtaining funding in capital  markets for Main Street businesses. It is hard for capitalism to work,  Mr. Speaker, without capital.   This legislation tackles that problem and creates opportunities for  hardworking small businesses to be able to go public to raise that  initial capital in the early stage and to be able to develop that seed  capital that is needed. Growth is often contingent on capital. Without  investment, it is easy for small businesses to falter.   By defining the ``nonpublic offering'' exemption under the Securities  Act, this legislation will provide small businesses with much-needed  clarity and a renewed confidence in what the proper procedure is for a  nonpublic offering that does not violate the law and helps to be able  to grow businesses.   Removing this confusion will provide small businesses with much- needed certainty and allow them to be able to focus their resources on  growth, rather than on compliance.   For this reason, I support the measure that is before us today, and I  would encourage my colleagues to do the same. I commend Mr. Emmer for  introducing this legislation to alleviate the burdensome compliance  environment that is imposed on small businesses. Again, I encourage my  colleagues to support this legislation.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the North American Securities Administrators Association  sent this letter of concern. They said that H.R. 2201 would result in  an overly broad Federal exemption that would allow public solicitation  and sales to any investor, regardless of sophistication or financial  wherewithal, subject only to the requirement that there be a previously  existing relationship, a standard that is not difficult to establish.   In practical terms, this means that Main Street investors could be  solicited and sold up to $500,000 in private security by bad actors,  including persons having been convicted of crimes or subject to one or  more previous State enforcement actions, without any disclosure to the  investor and without any notice to State or Federal regulators.   There is no valid basis for Congress to prevent State officials  charged with protecting their constituents from making decisions about  purely local or regional issues that would rely on the exemption  established by H.R. 2201.   Further, preemption of State review or even notification for the type  of small, localized offerings contemplated by H.R. 2201 would  effectively handcuff the regulators best positioned to oversee such  offerings.   Public Citizen said this bill ``would permit small offerings with no  investor protections, such as notice of the offerings. It will enable a  type of affinity fraud, where the seller can unload dubious securities,  provided there is some relationship between seller and purchaser. This  bill assumes that a preexisting relationship will deter abuse, which is  a tenuous foundation, at best. Further, the relationship can begin with  the offer.''   They don't have to have a previous relationship. It would start when  the offer takes place.   Public Citizen further stated that ``the bill says the relationship  must only exist before the purchase.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from these groups, as  well as a letter from Americans for Financial Reform.                                           North American Securities                                Administrators Association, Inc.,                                   Washington, DC, November 7, 2017.      Re H.R. 2201--The Micro-Offering Safe Harbor Act.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the North       American Securities Administrators Association (``NASAA''), I       write to express concern and raise specific objections to       certain provisions of H.R. 2201, The Micro-Offering Safe       Harbor Act, which is scheduled to be considered by the House       of Representatives this week. The legislation would amend       securities laws in ways that could be profoundly detrimental       to investors, and detract from the viability of the       marketplace for offerings from new or smaller issuers that       are compliant with securities law.        The Micro-Offering Safe Harbor Act amends Section 4 of the       Securities Act of 1933 to create a new exemption from       registration. To qualify for the exemption, an offering would       have to meet certain criteria regarding the number of       purchasers, their relationship to the issuer, and the amount       of capital raised. However, as more fully discussed below,       the legislation fails to include critical investor protection       measures and would preempt state regulatory authority.        State securities regulators understand the need of small       businesses to efficiently raise capital and the role strong       investor protection plays in facilitating this goal.       Unfortunately, the changes embodied in H.R. 2201, while well       intended, are ill-advised and potentially quite dangerous.       For example, unregistered securities purchased under the       exemption established by H.R. 2201 would not be       ``restricted,'' and could thus be sold immediately, exposing       investors to classic ``pump and dump'' schemes. Furthermore,       NASAA is aware of no evidence to support the proposition that       Congress should create a ``safe harbor'' to permit       unregistered securities offerings to be offered and sold,       including through general solicitation, regardless of       investor sophistication or financial wherewithal. Even as the       bill stands to introduce new and totally unnecessary risk       into securities markets--failing to even disqualify ``bad       actors'' from these markets--the goal of the legislation       remains unclear and its necessity is, at best, not well-      established. It is clear, however, from the terms of the       exemption, and its failure to impose even the modicum of       regulatory oversight that exists for similar ``private''       offerings under SEC Regulation D Rule 506, that offerings       made under the new exemption are likely to be       disproportionately risky and illiquid. This fact alone should       be cause for concern by Congress.        Beyond stark new risks to investors, this legislation       threatens to jeopardize the continued viability of       established markets geared to smaller issuers, many of which       operate lawfully within existing federal and state securities       laws. Such markets include securities sold pursuant to SEC       Rule 506, new federal exemptions established by the JOBS Act,       and exemptions adopted in many states to permit intrastate       crowdfunding. Without effective investor protection measures       a potential effect of H.R. 2201 could be to cause investors       to abandon the markets for smaller issues.        In closing, NASAA reiterates strong opposition to the       preemption of state registration and notice filing authority       in H.R. 2201. There is no valid basis for Congress to prevent       states from making decisions about the local or regional       issues that H.R. 2201 seeks to encourage. Failure to register       or at the very least, to notice file with state regulators       results in unknown sales, by unknown actors of unknown       enterprises and result in no gatekeeper function to protect       retail investors whose only source of recourse for fraudulent       sales are the state securities regulators. At a minimum H.R.       2201 should:        1) Include bad actor disqualifications;        2) Establish a holding period to reduce the likelihood of       ``pump and dump'' schemes;        3) Provide at least a notice filing with state regulators       so that in the event of a fraudulent offering, state       regulators can begin an investigation to try and protect       retail investors;        4) Limit the sale amount to retail investors so that       investors are not ``encouraged'' to place all their eggs in       one basket; and        5) Prohibit or restrict general solicitation of what are       clearly high risk securities.        Thank you for your consideration of NASAA's views.            Sincerely,                                                    Joseph P. Borg,                                        NASAA President and Alabama                                               Securities Director.  [[Page H8675]]                                          ____                                                Public Citizen,                                                   November 7, 2017.      Hon. Member,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Honorable Member: On behalf of more than 400,000       members and supporters of Public Citizen, we urge you to vote       ``NO'' on three bills coming to the floor this week that       would weaken financial protections that were put in place to       protect American consumers. HR 3911 and HR 2148 will be       considered under suspension. HR 2201 will be considered under       regular order.              H.R. 2148, Clarifying Commercial Real Estate Loans         This bill would reduce the capital requirements for High       Volatility Commercial Real Estate (HVCRE). During the recent       financial crisis, this sector caused major losses, especially       at smaller banks. The U.S. Government Accountability Office       (GAO) found that failures of small banks ``were largely       driven by credit losses on commercial real estate (CRE)       loans, particularly loans secured by real estate to finance       land development and construction.'' Further, this sector has       grown rapidly in recent years, raising further concerns about       prudential lending standards. We must assure that this type       of lending remains properly capitalized to prevent against       failures that could become economic contagions.                  H.R. 2201, Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act         This bill removes basic protections from offering       securities provided that the purchasers have a preexisting       relationship with an officer, director, or shareholder with       10 percent or more of the shares of the issuer, and the       aggregate amount of all securities sold by the issuer does       not exceed $500,000 during a 12-month period. This would       permit small offerings with no investor protections, such as       a notice of the offering. It will enable a type of affinity       fraud, where the seller can unload dubious securities       provided there is some relationship between seller and       purchaser. The bill assumes that a pre-existing relationship       will deter abuse, which is a tenuous foundation, at best.       Further, the relationship can begin with the offer. The bill       says the relationship must only exist before the purchase.       Finally, the bill pre-empts state regulatory oversight.       Removing supervisors closest to potential problems is unwise       and leaves small investors exposed to exploitation.            H.R. 3911, Risk-Based Credit Examinations Act of 2017         This bill would allow the Securities and Exchange       Commission (SEC's) Office of Credit Ratings (OCR) to reduce       its oversight of nationally recognized statistical rating       organizations (NRSROs), also known as credit rating agencies.       Credit rating agencies essentially sold their high marks to       large banks that were securitizing loans, a major factor       leading to the financial crash of 2008. In response to the       inflated credit ratings for otherwise toxic securitizations,       Congress mandated creation of the OCR and directed it to       conduct annual examinations of each NRSRO and make its       reports public. It must examine eight areas: (i) whether the       NRSRO conducts business in accordance with its policies,       procedures, and rating methodologies; (ii) the management of       conflicts of interest by the NRSRO; (iii) the implementation       of ethics policies by the NRSRO; (iv) the internal       supervisory controls of the NRSRO; (v) the governance of the       NRSRO; (vi) the activities of the Designated Compliance       Officer (DCO) of the NRSRO; (vii) the processing of       complaints by the NRSRO; and (viii) the policies of the NRSRO       governing the post-employment activities of its former       personnel. This bill would allow the SEC to reduce these       categories of inspection to save staff resources. The answer       is not to reduce inspections, but to increase the funding for       the SEC.        These bills fail to advance investor interests or the       safety of the market. Instead, they move in the opposite       direction, ignoring the financial trauma from which Main       Street is still recovering.            Sincerely,      Public Citizen.                                   ____                                   Americans for Financial Reform,                                   Washington, DC, November 8, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of Americans for Financial       Reform (AFR), we are writing to urge you to vote against H.R.       2201, which is being considered on the House floor today.       This legislation would remove crucial investor protections       and open the door to affinity fraud in private securities       offerings.        The registration requirement under the Securities Act of       1933 has two basic objectives: to allow investors access to       information they need to evaluate the securities being       offered and ``to prohibit deceit, misrepresentations, and       other frauds in the sale of securities.''        H.R. 2201 would create needless exemptions from those key       protections for so-called ``micro-cap offerings''--i.e.,       offerings valued at $500,000 or less in a single year. This       legislation would allow micro offerings to be sold to       financially unsophisticated and lower income investors,       provided only that the investors have a ``pre-existing       relationship'' with an officer, director, or major       shareholder of the issuer. These conditions alone do not       represent any protection for investors, nor do they guarantee       access to minimum essential information to evaluate a private       offering and make an informed decision about it.        H.R. 2201 would dismantle the protections afforded to       small-dollar-amount investors by the Securities Act of 1933.       Those protections include some minimal disclosures,       transparency standards, and access to the information       necessary to evaluate potentially risky and illiquid private       offerings. The legislation would also eliminate restrictions       on rapid sale of the securities, exposing investors in the       small offerings market to potential ``pump and dump''       schemes.        As the state securities administrators (NASAA) point out in       their opposition letter to this bill, H.R. 2201 also       obstructs primary regulators by preempting state regulatory       authorities. This legislation does not include any: limits on       purchaser sophistication (e.g. the securities could be sold       to non-accredited investors), measures to prevent offerings       by bad actors, restrictions on secondary sales, or       prohibition on general solicitation. This disturbing lack of       protections would permit bad faith actors to direct shady       private securities to investors.        Affinity frauds and Ponzi schemes are typically carried out       by individuals who are members of the group or community they       are trying to defraud--i.e., those with a ``pre-existing       relationship'' with others in their group. Similarly, the       SEC's red flags for Ponzi schemes include secretive       investments and ``investments that are not registered with       the SEC or with state regulators.'' By permitting the sale of       unregistered securities not subject to state regulation       within groups of investors with a ``pre-existing       relationship'', H.R. 2201 would facilitate affinity fraud and       Ponzi schemes.        Congress should not support statutory exemptions that       loosen restraints on fraudsters. We urge you to reject this       bill.            Sincerely,                                    Americans for Financial Reform.    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I don't understand why  Members of Congress would disregard what the State regulators are  saying. State regulators are saying: Don't do this. Don't preempt us.  Don't pass legislation that would undermine our ability to protect your  constituents.   Yet they are ignoring this altogether. I know that they received this  information. I know that they know that the association had cautioned  against this legislation. Let me just make sure that everybody knows.  It is the North American Securities Administrators Association. They  represent all of the States in cautioning against this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
