 Mr. Speaker, during this National Police Week, I wish  to, on behalf of myself and the fine citizens of the Fifth District of  Virginia, extend our thank-you.   Since 1791, greater than 22,000 law enforcement professionals have  given their lives in the line of duty--over 70 in a single day in 2001,  including 37 from the NYPD and 23 from the Port Authority Police--an  average of over 140 a year. And yet these men and women who look like  us--every race, every color, every gender--are the best of us because  every day they get up and go to work again.   Mr. Speaker, when I served in the military, I became familiar with  Isaiah 6:8, and I cite that verse in thanking our law enforcement  professionals:   And then the voice of the Lord spoke to us and said, ``Whom shall I  send? And who will go for us?'' And I said, ``Here am I. Send me.''   Mr. Speaker, take that as a thank-you from myself and the citizens of  the Fifth District of Virginia to those professional men and women who  serve us every day.                            ____________________
