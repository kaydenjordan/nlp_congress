 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize National  Agriculture Week.   I grew up on a grain and livestock farm just outside of Truman,  Minnesota, and have a deep appreciation for agriculture and all it does  for our rural communities. Our ag-based economy is so critically  important to our Nation and, of course, the State of Minnesota and  southern Minnesota, which is our First District.   The people in southern Minnesota really appreciate our ag producers,  our ag processors, our ag equipment dealers, and all the rest. I can  tell you that in Minnesota's First District, one of the top crop and  livestock districts in all the country, we actually were number two for  hogs in the entire Nation.   Our First District is home to nearly 20,000 farmers. Considering that  each farm produces enough food to feed about 165 people, the reach of  our farmers goes throughout the United States and all around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to commemorating and talking about the  value of agriculture and our farmers during this week and throughout  this Congress.                            ____________________
