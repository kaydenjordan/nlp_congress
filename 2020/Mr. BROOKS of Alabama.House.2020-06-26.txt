 Mr. Speaker, I will never vote to give  Washington, D.C., separate statehood status. Washington, D.C., is a  city, not a State. Its population is roughly one-seventh that of  Alabama.   To add perspective, giving D.C. statehood is the equivalent of giving  Jefferson County, Alabama, or the Tennessee Valley separate statehood  status. That is nuts.   History is in order. The District of Columbia originally was 100  square miles, 10-miles square. Part of D.C. was in Maryland; part was  in Virginia.   In 1847, the Virginia part of the District of Columbia was given back  to Virginia, leaving only the Maryland portion of D.C. still in D.C.   These former D.C., now Virginia, residents gained the right to vote  on U.S. Senators once Senators became elected rather than appointed.   If D.C. residents want to vote on U.S. Senators, fine. That can be  done by following historical precedence and giving the residential  portion of D.C. back to Maryland, keeping the Federal Government  portion, the Capitol, White House, monuments, The Mall, Federal  buildings, and the like in D.C.   But this option won't be offered by Democrats because they don't care  one twit about D.C. residents voting on U.S. Senators. Rather, their  goal is to have two more guaranteed leftwing Senators.   If offered, I will vote to return residential portions of D.C. to  Maryland, thus giving D.C. citizens the power to vote on Maryland's two  U.S. Senators. That option is consistent with historical precedence.   But I will never vote to give a single middling-size city the same  political power as one of America's great 50 States. I will never  support this sham that is motivated by crass partisan political power,  not a desire to let citizens of the District of Columbia vote on U.S.  Senators.
