 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of the memory of  Steven Spickelmier who passed away at the age of 77 after a long battle  with COVID-19.   Steve was a U.S. Navy and Air National Guard veteran, retiring as a  master sergeant after 26 years of military service. His unmatched  energy and positive impact on servicemen, veterans, and their families  throughout northeast Florida displayed his incredible servant's heart.   Among Steve's many local roles, he served as chairman of the Veterans  Council of Duval County and chairman of the Support Committee at  Jacksonville National Cemetery, Madam Speaker, where he championed the  annual Wreaths Across America program and the Memorial Day service. He  was president of the Air Force Sergeants Association, Chapter 559, and  field operations director for Florida's Missing in America project.   Steve attended Mandarin United Methodist Church and, among many other  roles, he served as a church van driver for residents of a nearby  retirement home to ensure all could worship together each Sunday.
