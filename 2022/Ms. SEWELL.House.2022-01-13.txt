 Mr. Speaker, as you know, voting rights are personal to  me. It was in my hometown in 1965 on a bridge in Selma, Alabama, where  John Lewis and the foot soldiers shed blood for the equal right of all  Americans to vote. Fifty-six years later old battles have become new  again as State legislatures erect direct barriers to the ballot box-- 400 bills introduced and 34 passed in 19 States.   Once again, our Nation is at an inflection point. Today, the House of  Representatives will, once again, send voting rights over to the  Senate, and it must pass, Mr. Speaker.   I implore our Senators: Do what is right. You have changed your rules  150 times, most recently to raise the debt ceiling. If you can protect  the full faith and credit of the United States, then surely you can  protect the democracy.   The time is now. What we need is courage.   As we prepare to observe the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, let  us remember that justice delayed can be justice denied.   Senators, we need your leadership. We need it now.
