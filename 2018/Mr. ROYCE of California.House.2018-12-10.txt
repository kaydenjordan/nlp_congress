 Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of Tom  Sheehy, staff director of the Foreign Affairs Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize years of outstanding service by Tom  Sheehy, staff director of the Foreign Affairs committee that I chair.  Tom has been working on the committee for over twenty years, serving as  a staff director for two subcommittees--one being Africa, where  together we greatly improved U.S.-Africa policy. During the last six  years, Tom has expertly run the committee, advancing my agenda during  challenging times.   Tom is known as a hard worker who takes a strong interest in the  well-being of his staff and is a problem solver. A first-rate  communicator who helps other staffers to improve their skills, he has  created a well-coordinated team of top-flight professionals. The  Foreign Affairs Committee staff is widely-known and well-respected as a  result. Tom takes great pride in the committee's good reputation.   The committee has been extremely productive. We have turned over 60  bills into public laws, including sanctions, development, and export  control legislation. This has required Tom's high level of commitment,  knowledge, and negotiation skills; and his empowerment of our excellent  committee staff. Under his direction, we have held hearings and  performed oversight on almost every issue of importance to our foreign  policy.   Nearly all of our committee work has been bipartisan. Not because we  don't differ over policy. But because we understand that we almost  always have more in common than not. Our nation deserves this  cooperation and effectiveness, and Tom has directed our many, many  bipartisan accomplishments.   Tom will be missed by many in Congress, but he surely will continue  contributing to our nation's security and prosperity. Tom,  congratulations on your career in the House. I am grateful for your  service, and wish your family--wife Elizabeth, and children Emma, T.R.  and Jackson--the very best.                            ____________________
