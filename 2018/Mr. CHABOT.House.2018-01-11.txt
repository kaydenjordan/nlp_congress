 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership in  ensuring that a number of important reforms to section 702 of the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act were included in this  legislation.   I rise in support of this modified version of S. 139. While this does  not go as far to reform FISA section 702 as the USA Liberty Act, which  passed out of the Judiciary Committee in November with my support, the  reforms that are included help to provide a more appropriate balance  between protecting our  [[Page H146]]  civil liberties and providing the intelligence community an important  national security tool for another 6 years before its expiration this  Friday.   FISA section 702 is a critical tool used by the intelligence  community to protect American citizens from foreign threats and has  been successfully used numerous times to prevent terrorist plots. Since  we last reauthorized FISA section 702, much has changed not only in who  our foreign threats are, but also in the methods that they use against  us. The bottom line is we need to protect the safety of the American  people. We need to make sure constitutional protections are in place,  and this is the proper balance.
