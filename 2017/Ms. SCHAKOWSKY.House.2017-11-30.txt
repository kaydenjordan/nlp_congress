 Mr. Speaker, it is fact: the Republican tax scam is  an attack on America's senior citizens. According to the AARP, 5.2  million senior citizens, many on fixed incomes, will see a tax hike  under the Republican bill. Meanwhile, over 60 percent of the tax  benefits go to the top 1 percent.   Plus, the bill will trigger an automatic cut to Medicare--$25 billion  in 2018 alone. In 2019, Americans 50 to 64 years old buying health  insurance through the individual market will see their premiums  increase $1,500 on average, according to the AARP. For the first time,  the bill changes the way Social Security COLA is calculated, reducing  Social Security benefits.   Seniors lose in the Republican tax bill, and so does pretty much  everybody else. Who wins? Millionaires, billionaires, and the  wealthiest corporations. We should say no to the Republican tax scam.  Americans deserve a better deal.                            ____________________
