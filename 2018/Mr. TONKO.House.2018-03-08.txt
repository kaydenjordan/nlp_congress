 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1119, the Satisfying  Energy Needs and Saving the Environment, or SENSE, Act.   The SENSE Act continues the theme of the floor this week, giving  unnecessary preferences to a handful of special interests at the  expense of clean air and people's health.   The SENSE Act would weaken requirements of EPA's Mercury and Air  Toxic Standards, or MATS, for power plants that burn waste coal by  enabling a weaker compliance option for hydrochloric acid and sulfur  dioxide  [[Page H1482]]  emissions. To make matters worse, the bill prevents EPA from  strengthening these standards for waste coal pants in the future even  if pollution control technologies become significantly better or less  expensive.   I think we are all proud of the record of the Clean Air Act. As a  nation, we have made significant progress since the 1970s, reducing air  pollution while growing our economy.   This bill is against the spirit of the Clean Air Act and the  bipartisan amendments that have followed. We should not lock in an  insufficient standard when progress is still possible.   Polluters should be pushed to do better, especially when comparable  facilities are meeting those given standards; but instead, these power  plant owners would prefer to get special treatment and a pathway for  meeting the weaker standards for many, many years to come. All the  while, these plants will produce harmful air pollution.   This is not only dangerous but unnecessary. The health risks of these  pollutants are well documented, and it is, in fact, possible for waste  coal plants to meet EPA's MATS. A number of waste coal units have  achieved the standards, and pollution control technologies exist that  would enable noncompliant facilities to meet them, too.   EPA's MATS have already been examined by the courts, which would not  grant an exclusion for waste coal utilities. The courts did not agree  with waste coal plant owners that these standards were impossible to  meet.   EPA established that 8 out of 19 waste coal units nationwide could  meet the rules' acid gas standard or alternative sulfur dioxide  standard already. So now those companies are coming to Congress to  circumvent the court process.   Last year, every Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee  opposed this bill. Those members understood that this bill is simply  not fair. It picks winners and losers in States with waste coal plants,  it disadvantages traditional coal-fired power generators, and it will  allow for more hazardous air pollution. That isn't a good deal for the  power generators that are already compliant with the standards, and it  is a terrible deal for the people who have to live with more dangerous  air pollution.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ``no'' on the SENSE Act, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle), a longtime member  of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a thoughtful and passionate  voice for the greater Pittsburgh area, and for that matter, all of  Pennsylvania and our Nation.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle).    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle).    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I have no other speakers. I just would make mention that some 18  groups that are public interest groups have joined together in a letter  opposing this legislation, suggesting and indicating strongly that it  pits waste coal-burning plants against coal-burning plants, that it  creates a public health situation that is an outcome that is negative  for our constituents, and it basically cites that the courts have  reviewed some of the requests made earlier and denied those requests  because they felt that technology was available.   I include the letter in the Record.                                                      March 6, 2018.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members,       the undersigned organizations urge you to oppose the amended       Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act, or       SENSE Act (H.R. 1119). This bill would weaken health       safeguards for Americans on behalf of special interest groups       and result in more toxic air pollution and health hazards.        The SENSE Act would provide a giveaway to power plants that       burn waste coal under EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards       (MATS). The bill favors waste coal-burning power plants at       the expense of other in-state coal power plants and the       public through blunt political favoritism.  [[Page H1486]]         Specifically, the SENSE Act would permanently exempt power       plants that burn waste coal from having to meet certain       pollution limits. Power plants, including waste coal plants,       are already meeting these standards--passing this bill would       be a free giveaway to polluters, and nothing more.        And the courts agree.        When waste coal plant owners filed lawsuits challenging the       MATS standards in the first place, they claimed it was       ``virtually impossible'' to meet the acid gas and sulfur       dioxide limits set in MATS. The court rejected the plants'       arguments.        The judges pointed to clear evidence that waste coal plants       already were meeting these limits. EPA had evidence       demonstrating that 8 out of 19 waste coal units nationwide       already could meet the rule's acid gas standard or       alternative sulfur dioxide standard. In fact, the court noted       that not only were the plants meeting these supposedly       ``impossible'' standards, but some of these plants were       ``among the best performers'' in achieving hydrogen chloride       reductions among all coal-burning units under the rule.''        Doomsday claims to justify this bill are just that. Waste       coal plants have already had more time than other power       plants to come into compliance with MATS. Rewarding laggards       who continue to drag their feet, even after already getting       special treatment, would undermine all pollution reduction       programs and disincentivize compliance.        Were this bill to become law, the result will be dirtier       air for communities. Indeed, the SENSE Act drags health       standards down to the level of the laggards--resulting in       greater harms for Americans living in states with waste coal       plants as well as in their downwind neighboring states. This       bill is not only bad policy--it is unjustified. It favors the       very dirtiest of polluting facilities at the expense of       Americans, air quality, and responsible power plants who have       already taken steps to clean up their air pollution. Worst of       all, it will lead to greater toxic pollution and health harms       to Americans. We urge you to oppose the SENSE Act.            Sincerely,          Center for Biological Diversity; Clean Water Action;             Climate Hawks Vote; Earthjustice; Environment America;             Environmental Defense Fund; Friends of the Earth;             GreenLatinos; Hip Hop Caucus; Interfaith Power & Light;             League of Conservation Voters; Moms Clean Air Force;             National Parks Conservation Association; Natural             Resources Defense Council; Power Shift Network; Public             Citizen; Sierra Club; Southern Environmental Law             Center.     Madam Speaker, much like the bill considered by the House  yesterday, the SENSE Act would provide so-called relief to a handful of  companies by shifting the burdens of pollution onto the public.  Congress should not be in the business of putting the profits of  polluters before the health of our constituents.   The reality is, by allowing these plants to pollute more, we would be  doing just that. It will result in greater harm to Americans living in  States with waste coal plants as well as in their downwind neighboring  States, such as my home State of New York.   EPA's MATS are achievable and provide considerable health benefits.  Why shouldn't waste coal plants have to comply? The courts think they  should. We shouldn't have to choose between a giveaway to a couple of  special interests over clean air.   Again, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
