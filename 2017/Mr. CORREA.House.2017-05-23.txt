 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Walz.   Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank Chairman Roe and Ranking Member  Walz for giving me the opportunity to share my enthusiastic support for  this bill, H.R. 2288. I also want to thank Mr. Bost and Ms. Esty for  their remarkable leadership in guiding this legislation to the floor  and for taking the steps to finally fix the appeals process.   I stand here today to support the Veterans Appeals Improvement and  Modernization Act. This legislation reforms the VA appeals process so  that our veterans can begin to receive the benefits they have earned  through their dedication to our country.   Veterans in California and all across America, including those in my  district, currently face a backlog of sometimes more than 5 years to  get their benefits. This is not acceptable, and that is why I am  pleased to support this bipartisan legislation.   A veteran who files a disability claim for an injury that they  sustained during their military service is issued a VA rating decision,  which either grants or denies a claim. If a veteran disagrees with the  outcome, they may appeal the VA's decision and then wait and wait and  wait. This bill will improve the process by creating a multiple appeal  streams, which will accelerate the process.   Our veterans who suffered injury during their time in service can now  be assured that they will be one step closer to having their appeals  cases reviewed and decided in a timely manner.
