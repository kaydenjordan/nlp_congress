 Mr. Speaker, as Americans, we mourn for the lives lost in  the act of terrorism in New York last week. But New Yorkers are  resilient. Violence will never break their spirit, and in the Northeast  corridor, business has continued as usual.   Sadly, there are folks who want to use last week's terrorist attack  for their cynical political reasons. They don't want to treat the root  causes of extremism, whether based on racial resentment, twisted  interpretations of religion, or political ideology. They do want to  stoke fear in order to advance an anti-immigrant agenda, and they are  trying to blame the Diversity Visa program for the violence.   Americans are smarter than that.   The Diversity Visa program strengthens the Nation by allowing people  from places like Africa and the Caribbean to lawfully immigrate to the  United States, where they help fill major shortages in the workforce  and drive positive changes in their communities. We need them, and they  need us.   Let's not sacrifice our national principles because of a trumped up  fear of immigrants.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank the gentlewoman from the  Virgin Islands for her leadership on these issues. Right now, her focus  has been on helping her country come to grips with the devastating  hurricanes that have struck all the islands of the American Virgin  Islands, and she has demonstrated great leadership in that endeavor.   Also, on the whole issue around TPS, Ms. Plaskett and Ms. Clarke have  been our true leaders in the diaspora around these issues, whether it  be the Caribbean or back to the Continent of Africa. I just want to  acknowledge their great work on all of these issues and also thank the  gentlewoman for hosting tonight's Special Order hour on protecting TPS  recipients.   Before I start on the topic at hand, I would like to send my  condolences out to the loved ones of the 26 people tragically murdered  and the 21 people injured in yesterday's mass shooting in Texas.   When will we realize that something must be done in this country?   I have to ask: How much blood must be shed before Congress acts on  gun control?   It has been 10 years since Congress has passed a gun control law.  Since then, more than 300,000 people have been killed by guns in this  country. More than 100,000 of those deaths were homicides. The American  people deserve better--much better.   As the news cycle moves from one tragedy to another, we have not  forgotten, and must not forget, that the citizens that Congresswoman  Stacey Plaskett and Congresswoman Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto  Rico represent are still recovering from this summer's hurricanes.  They, too, deserve swift action to help them recover from these  devastating storms.   That, Mr. Speaker, brings me to the topic of tonight's Special Order  hour. I want to start by dispelling the myth that the temporary  protected status designation poses a threat to America's security. The  truth is that TPS holders are rigorously vetted before entering the  country, and they go through stringent background checks before each  TPS renewal.   Mr. Speaker, the TPS designation is a part of our national character,  and it must be protected.   What do I mean by that?   We are a compassionate people, aren't we--a compassionate nation?   The Americans I know are proud to live in a country that is free and  prosperous enough to extend a helping hand to those in need. The TPS  designation does just that.   TPS is a helping hand that reaches out past our national borders to  lift people out of the depths of despair brought on by natural  disaster, violence, or turmoil. Yet the administration is reportedly  planning to remove the TPS designation for nationals of several Latin  American and Caribbean countries. This is really bad news for the  United States.   First, ending the TPS designation for nationals of Haiti, El  Salvador, and Honduras will destabilize communities in the United  States proper. TPS holders own small businesses. They pay taxes. They  take out mortgages. They fill jobs that we rely on every day in  construction; hospitality; restaurants; landscaping; and elder care, in  particular.   Ending TPS designations mean ripping people out of their communities  and local economies. Businesses will shutter. Essential jobs, like  disaster cleanup, will go unfilled. The national economy will suffer a  $164 billion loss in gross domestic product.   Without TPS holders from Haiti, El Salvador, and Honduras, New Jersey  will lose $864 million from its GDP. My State cannot handle that  burden.   Second, ending TPS designations for Haiti, El Salvador, and Honduras  will tear apart families of color. Many TPS holders have lawfully lived  in the United States for more than a decade. They have established  their families here. They are parents to 270,000 U.S. citizens. In New  Jersey, 8,800 U.S. citizens were born to TPS holders from Haiti, El  Salvador, and Honduras.   Forcing TPS holders to leave the country means forcing them to leave  their families. Hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens will have to say  good-bye to their parents and grandparents. People will be forced to  return to countries that are still suffering from the problems that led  them to the TPS designation in the first place.   Third, removing the TPS designation for nationals from Haiti, El  Salvador, and Honduras will threaten security throughout Latin America  and the Caribbean. These small countries are still suffering from  disasters, public health crises, and political instability.   The sudden influx of 300,000 additional people has the potential to  destabilize national governments and threaten security throughout the  region.   Mr. Speaker, in 2015, 2016, and 2017, I led the effort to get the TPS  designation for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. These countries were  reeling from public health and infrastructure  [[Page H8517]]  emergencies. They faced an existential threat from the Ebola virus, and  the American people lent a helping hand by giving them temporary  protected status. I have had no doubt that authorizing nationals from  those West African countries to enter the United States saved lives; no  doubt whatsoever.   Mr. Speaker, we must not abandon our national character to the  cynical call of ``America first.'' The TPS designation does not weaken  us. It strengthens us by showing the world that the United States is  morally worthy of its status as a superpower.   Rolling back the TPS program is bad policy, it is bad politics, and  it is immoral. If the United States turns its back on those in need,  what have we the people become?
