 Madam Chair, I rise today to express my support for this  block of amendments to H.R. 2740.   Included is my amendment to provide $2 million in critical funding  for Bureau of Reclamation projects with a public health benefit, such  as the Salton Sea in southern California.   The Salton Sea is a danger to Californian residents. Dust from the  exposed lake bed contains harmful particulate matter that blows into  communities and is inhaled by residents as far away as Los Angeles.   If we do not take decisive action now, the Salton Sea's decline will  accelerate, exacerbating this public health crisis and leading more  children and seniors to develop respiratory illnesses like asthma.   After Congress passed this amendment last year, the Bureau devoted  $2.5 million to mitigation projects at the Salton Sea. My amendment  would continue this essential funding to invest in the health of  families who live near the Salton Sea and beyond.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote for my amendment to support  the public health of children, seniors, and families across southern  California, and I thank Chair Kaptur for her support and interest in  helping us with the Salton Sea.                                time  2030
