 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today because fentanyl is an epidemic in America.  In counties and cities across America, families are being destroyed by  fentanyl overdoses. Doctors and nurses in emergency departments  throughout our country see it every day. Paramedics, emergency medical  technicians, police officers, and deputy sheriffs see it on the front  line.   China provides precursors to Mexico, who, in turn, produces this  deadly drug. We have seen what happens next. Every day mules illegally  cross the U.S. border by the thousands, bringing fentanyl to  communities across our country. It is killing 300 people every day.   The Secretary of Homeland Security has testified before Members of  this body that we have operational control of the southern border.  Americans know the truth. At this rate, fentanyl is on track to steal  an entire generation from our country.   As a first responder, licensed emergency medical technician for more  than 34 years, I have seen it up close. I have personally had to shoot  Narcan up the noses of children in an effort to save their lives. That  is something that no child should have to experience and no parent  should have to witness.   According to the CDC, fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin and  100 times stronger than morphine. So far in fiscal year 2023, Customs  and Border Patrol have seized over 17,000 pounds of fentanyl coming  across the southern border. Again, in 2023, Customs and Border Patrol  have seized 17,000 pounds of fentanyl coming across the southern  border.   This year Madison County, Alabama, which I represent, is reporting 25  confirmed fentanyl overdoses through the coroner's office with 35  suspected overdose cases pending.   The devastation this drug is leaving as it infects the United States  is something to be mourned. I can say this gruesome nature of fentanyl  is destroying lives, families, and communities. It does not  discriminate.   More and more often we see other dangerous drugs such as  methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, and even marijuana, being laced with  fentanyl without the knowledge of the user.   In the wake of surge in illegal immigration and drug smuggling at the  southern border, we are at risk to witness unprecedented spikes in  fentanyl overdoses. Fentanyl is already running rampant in our country,  and we must take action. My concerns reflect those of my own  constituents and countless others around the United States, especially  those who live and have been forever changed by fentanyl.   To solve problems, you must first admit you have one. We have gotten  here because of this administration's reckless border policies. I am  proud of the legislation that we have come together to advance in the  House this Congress. We must continue to look for ways to equip law  enforcement with essential tools to stop the spread of fentanyl and  give us the support we need on more research of this vicious drug.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Owens).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Cloud).                                time  1930     Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congressman for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Moran).    Mr. Speaker, I thank those who have participated in this  Special Order hour.   Mr. Speaker, as I said, I speak firsthand as an emergency medical  technician for 34 years in town. We have seen so many things occur, so  many families that have been affected.   I can tell you this, as a member of the House Armed Services  Committee and also the committees that have gone to the border, you  start looking at what we saw firsthand and just trying to protect our  country.   We were there at the southern border for about 5 minutes at a point  of entry. In less than 5 minutes, here comes a vehicle. What would you  imagine? Seventy pounds of cocaine right in front of 12 United States  Congressmen.   We went again to McAllen, Texas, and had a full committee hearing--or  what was supposed to have been a full committee hearing. It was only  Republicans who showed up.   Mr. Speaker, the only way that we can solve problems is to admit that  we have a problem and then work together to solve it. It is obvious  that we have a problem with thousands of pounds coming across the  southern border, and we have to act on it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 40 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, May 25, 2023, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
