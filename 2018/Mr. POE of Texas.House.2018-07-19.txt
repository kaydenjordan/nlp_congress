 Mr. Speaker, I wish to address the House, Members  of Congress, and the Chair about what I consider one of our most  serious things that is happening in our country, and it has to do with  sexual assault on our campuses, our universities, our colleges, and  what is taking place there while students, our children, our  grandchildren, go to these universities.   I want to recognize a group of individuals who have started a  program, a cause is really the right word, that they call the 12th  Woman. They are all members, students, former students of Texas A&M  University in College Station, Texas.   The 12th Woman is a phrase that is a takeoff on another phrase that  that university uses, calling the 12th Man. I look at the 12th Woman as  a team, 11 on a team, and there is one more. It makes it 12, all 12  supporting each other in their cause to eliminate sexual assault on  campuses, not just Texas A&M, but all the universities and colleges  through the United States.                                time  1215    So these remarkable ladies started using social media to see if other  people, students, former students, had encountered sexual assault on  campus and what happened and what didn't happen after that was  reported. Then they formed this organization called the 12th Woman.   Several of those members of the 12th Woman are here today watching  Congress, and later today, they are going to go to their respective  Members of Congress and talk about some of the things that are on their  heart.   Constituents in the State of Texas, the reason for this request of  time is that there are bad things that are happening on our university  campuses. It happens because of a lot of reasons. We are talking about  a lot of people, a lot of kids, in my opinion, going away from home and  spending time trying to get an education at one of our universities.   I believe wholeheartedly that our universities in this country are  the finest educational institutions anywhere in the world. That is why  we have people from all over the world coming to our universities.   So I am going to start by telling some of their stories, things that  happened to them, things that they have made public. They have been  bold to talk about the bad things that happened to them while they were  in school.   Mr. Speaker, it takes a lot for a crime victim, especially a sexual  assault victim, to come forward and publicly talk about these things.  For the last, I guess, 30 years before I came to Congress, I was a  prosecutor in Houston, Texas, and then I spent 22 years on the criminal  bench hearing only criminal cases. And I have met, unfortunately, a lot  of sexual assault victims who have come my way either when I was  prosecuting their cases or as a judge.   It is tough, really, it is tough to make those statements public and  come forward. But I want to read a few of these statements and these  stories that happened to some of our ladies that they call the 12th  Woman.   Abbie's family was based around the values of Texas A&M that it  instills in its students. She was raised by two Aggie alumni, and there  was never a doubt about where she would ultimately attend college: it  was always Texas A&M. But like so many others, what should have been an  outstanding experience, just turned sour.   One night, while hosting a Christmas party at her own apartment, she  was raped. That is correct, Mr. Speaker, she was sexually assaulted.   So when she woke up the next morning, she didn't remember how a  portion of that night ended. Bruises, scratches covered her arms, her  legs, and her clothing was ripped and torn.   So doing everything that I think a rape victim should do, she had a  rape kit conducted just a few hours later. The hospital nurse ended  Abbie's SANE exam--SANE stands for sexual assault nurse examiner--and  she told her, ``I will see you in court,'' describing it as the most  evidence that she had ever seen.   Abbie thought that she had a good case against her assailant. She was  advised by the College Station Police Department to seek justice  through the school and proceed to file her report through them.   So she filed a report. The university called a hearing.   The hearing began with what Abbie and her mom thought would be a fair  playing field, until it became evident that she faced a series of well  prepared attorneys at this hearing and she had no legal representation  of her own. Not a single person at the university, the police  department, or the hospital advised her that she had the right to  retain legal representation.   During the hearing, she was, in her opinion, ambushed by her  assailant's attorney, who peppered her with a lot of questions. The  fact that she had created a Facebook event for the party and offered  accommodation to those who were drinking to crash at her apartment was  called into question. It was if the university panel thought that  Abbie's rape was her fault.   Let's get one thing straight, Mr. Speaker. Let's make this perfectly  clear. Sexual assault is never the fault of the victim. It is the fault  of the perpetrator, and that is the way it should be, because it is the  perpetrator who caused this. The victim shouldn't feel like they did  something wrong, but in our culture, sometimes they are put on trial.   Following the hearing, she was referred to a student counseling  service, where she met an individual who had no training in working  with sexual assault victims. So what was the point of talking to the  school counseling if there was no training to handle these types of  cases?   After a lengthy process and dealing with an investigative panel that  she thought and believed was cold and uncaring, her assailant  ultimately faced no consequences. Abbie felt betrayed by the university  that she highly regarded. Her assailant just went back to class. Abbie  was forced to see the man who raped her walking freely around the  campus, a campus where she should have felt safe.   Ultimately, she made the decision to graduate early, ending her time  at Texas A&M prematurely.   She feels like the university that she highly spoke of failed her.  She says:         The university I speak so highly of has failed. Who knows       if it failed before me. There just wasn't anyone to speak out       about it.    Abbie joins the 12th Woman to demand change, not at just Texas A&M,  but colleges across the country.   Abbie says:         It is time for Texas A&M to follow the Aggie code of honor.       They should follow it themselves and unite with the sexual       assault survivors to be an example of fearless change among       the very best American universities.    Mr. Speaker, the Texas A&M code of honor says, ``An Aggie does not  lie, cheat, or steal, or tolerate those who do.''   That is Abbie's story, and I think we should thank her for making her  story available for all of us.   Meghan was a fourth generation Texas A&M Aggie. Her decision to  attend this prestigious school was never a question in her mind. It was  an amazing experience until things went bad.    One morning, while serving as a tutor in the athletic department, a  member of the Aggie football team, twice her size, exposed himself to  her not 2 feet away. He made sexual advances toward her, becoming  aggressive.   Terrified and shocked, she abruptly walked out of the room, trying to  remain calm as he followed her.   Despite reporting the assault to her supervisor, something just went  wrong.  [[Page H6580]]  The remainder of her assailant's tutoring sessions were not canceled.  And get this: the very next morning, Meghan's assailant exposed himself  to another tutor, becoming aggressive.   Mr. Speaker, Meghan feels she did not get justice against her  attacker. She feels and tells me she was failed by a university that  was not really committed to helping victims. She was scared in the  process, scared to go back to work, terrified she might run into this  individual again.   Before the hearing, the university claims she did not need a lawyer,  she was not facing charges. She received no notice that her assailant,  however, had hired legal representation, which he has the right to do.   Months later, Meghan's assailant was found not responsible for  exposing himself to both tutors. The panel stated that it appeared he  had a skin condition and just couldn't control himself. A skin  condition, Mr. Speaker?   The response she received was nothing short of appalling. The school  said:         Sorry, Meghan, that you were offended, but there is nothing       else we can do.    Meghan has appealed that case, and did appeal that case. She still  believed the university would come to provide justice for her.   At the appeals hearing, she was informed that the charge against her  attacker had been downgraded from sexual exploitation to sexual  harassment. What that meant was, in the university's eyes, she was  removed from the remainder of the hearing and couldn't be considered as  a victim.   The university supposedly has several systems in place to aid  victims. Texas A&M employs a victim advocate, but no one from the Title  IX office contacted Meghan. She didn't receive any information  regarding what sanctions her assailant received, if any, and of course  her assailant was allowed to be back on the athletic team.   Mr. Speaker, he stayed on the team until she told the media about all  of this, and then he was later removed from the team and two  misdemeanor charges were filed against him after she went to the media.   Meghan felt abandoned by the university. She thought the accused was  protected due to his status. Texas A&M spends a lot of money on teal  ribbons, according to her, for athletes to wear for sexual assault, and  she says that the ribbon is not enough. Universities must put the  safety and care of sexual assault victims first. I agree with her.   She says:         A&M has a chance to be fearless on every front and to be       fearless in the face of such horrible things that are       happening to our victims.    She wants A&M to take the lead on this that is taking place on our  university campuses.   I applaud Meghan for having the courage to come forward and tell her  story to the world.   Kirsten, she loved being at Texas A&M University. She considered it  one of the friendliest campuses, and enjoyed her time at one of the  country's finest educational institutions.   After she returned from the winter break in the second semester of  her freshman year, her happy-go-lucky bubble of college was shattered.   She was invited to hang out at her guy friend's apartment, and was  led to believe that several of their mutual friends would be there.   When she arrived at the apartment, she realized that they were alone.  Her so-called friend proceeded to sexually assault her.   The next day, her friends and sister pushed her to report the  assault, but she didn't want to. She was made to feel like the crime  was her fault. She told her resident assistant, who warned her that as  an RA, she was required to report it. So a few days later, she received  an email from the Division of Student Affairs inviting her to tell her  story.   Time and time again, she had to relive the story in graphic detail  almost directly after it happened.   One thing about sexual assault victims that unfortunately seems to  happen, when they first tell the first person about what happened to  them, it is not going to be the last time. Generally they tell people  who are strangers, people they don't know, and they have to tell that  story over and over again, and because of that, they have to relive  that experience. That is what happens when sexual assault victims have  to come forward. They go through that, but we should be understanding  of that process.    She says:         If I hadn't already been traumatized by this, the       university officials re-victimized me, certainly cementing       the damage to my mental health.    It is true that any investigative panel must understand what happened  before drawing conclusions, but there is a way of doing that and  getting that information without being insensitive.   Kirsten says she felt as if the investigators were cold and devoid of  empathy. During the disciplinary appeals panel after the deadline to  submit new evidence had passed, she was informed that the assailant's  fiancee, who wasn't even present the night he attacked her, was  permitted to serve as a witness. This witness served only the purpose  to disparage Kirsten's character.   Right before the panel began, she discovered that her assailant had,  like some of the others, obtained legal counsel. Unable to have  representation of her own, she ran to the Student Legal Services. They  refused to help her. They wouldn't offer her legal advice. They had no  victim advocate there to speak to her or on her behalf.   Kirsten, like many other victims, was alone, and she felt alone.   There was no other choice. The investigation continued.   At one point, the officials at the university asked her why didn't  she scream, as if it is Kirsten's fault she was assaulted and raped.   Kirsten says the university official in the investigation became  increasingly irritated, and it was abundantly clear to her that that  person viewed this as a waste of the university's time.   Ultimately, the university concluded that Kirsten had likely been  sexually harassed, but it was not up to the university to sanction her  offender, because there was no impediment to her educational  opportunity.                                time  1230    Let me repeat that. Nothing happened because, according to them,  there was no impediment to her educational opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, Kirsten fully believes, in the end, the panel turned her  words, her desire to complete her education, and her commitment to her  family against her. And they used her resilience and her loyalty to the  university as a weapon against her to absolve themselves from any  responsibility.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to tell Nikki's story, as she recounts it. I  have a total of six. For Nikki, a semester's worth of studying was  about to pay off. Finals week was here. One week was all that stood  between Nikki and a short break before the next semester began--that  is, until she was sexually assaulted.   Following her assault, she reported to the Texas A&M clinic, creating  even more stress on her. Before she left the clinic, Nikki recalls the  head physician came over to her and told her: Things happen for a  reason.   It was shocking to her, and it was traumatic.   Following this traumatic experience at the clinic, she decided  against engaging in the reporting process, feeling that the university  was not sensitive enough. She was aware of the process, because she sat  on the university disciplinary appeals panel, listening to the appeals  of cases similar to hers.   She did return to a private hospital for a SANE examination--once  again, sexual assault nurse examination--by someone who is qualified to  examine, on a medical basis, sexual assault victims. She returned home  for a short break, where she says she had time to process everything.   Mr. Speaker, deciding to come forward and report the sexual assault,  as I have said, is overwhelming to these victims.   After some serious soul-searching, she began the reporting process.  She told the story to the university officials, like so many others,  over, and over, and over again. After her shocking experience with her  visit to the Texas A&M clinic, she says it felt like the reporting was  getting nowhere.   After weeks of attempting to report the behavior of the school  clinic, she finally received a call back, but she was dissatisfied.   The school apologized, but no change ever occurred that she knows of.  She says that: ``After encountering three different women's clinic  physicians  [[Page H6581]]  with such poor manners in a sexual assault case, it is clear to me that  something is wrong at the institutional level.''   It felt like she was the bad guy, forced to justify over and over  again her reasons for reporting. Feeling attacked, she tried to  withdraw her case.   Mr. Speaker, no victim should be forced into a situation where they  feel more discouraged by reporting a rape than they do by staying  silent.   But it was too much. Her grades started dropping. She started  receiving Ds and Cs on tests. She had never gotten Cs and Ds. Her  professors questioned her excused absences, asking if she was in  trouble, only forcing her to explain the situation more and more.   Upon finding out her assailant had hired legal counsel, she asked the  university if she could obtain her own legal counsel. The university  discouraged her from doing so and set a quick panel date.   Ultimately, her attacker was found guilty of sexual abuse, sexual  misconduct, dating violence, and sexual harassment. He was suspended  for the remaining three semesters of Nikki's time at Texas A&M. She  felt lucky because many survivors never receive, in her opinion,  justice.   Just in my opinion, if a person is guilty of sexual abuse, sexual  misconduct, dating violence, and sexual harassment, a three-semester  suspension doesn't seem to be much punishment, if any.   She says: ``If I felt lucky my rapist, who was found guilty, was  suspended for three semesters, one of which was already halfway over,  then, clearly, something was wrong procedurally,'' if that happened.   Many times, so many other victims never receive any justice, and the  question remains: Why is a three-semester suspension unheard of as  severe punishment?   Mr. Speaker, something here is wrong. The reporting process for  sexual assault should never continue to traumatize the victim at every  turn.   Nikki says: ``The trials of the reporting process at A&M served to  exacerbate an already traumatizing experience, leaving me feeling  punished, trapped, and deceived.''   She called on the university's support program for survivors of  sexual assault. It is an interesting note that, during this process,  she received a cease and desist letter from a lawyer wanting her to  tell the university it never happened, and to pay $10,000--I presume  legal fees--to the attorney. I think that is just outrageous that that  happened.   Sydney was at Texas A&M, the school she loved, a school she always  wanted to go to and did go to. It was her dream school. She was in the  second semester at Texas A&M and, over a welcome weekend break, she was  sexually assaulted. Her assailant took advantage of her as she was  unconscious, intoxicated, and unable to fend for herself.   In accordance with title IX rights, she reported the rape. Ninety-six  days after reporting, she was granted an 8-hour hearing. She was told  that any individual can serve as her support during the hearing, but  was never advised to seek legal counsel. Here are a few lines from her  victim impact statement: ``Over the spring break, I decided that I  didn't want to live anymore.''   Let me read that again: ``Over spring break, I decided that I didn't  want to live anymore. I consciously decided that this was too much for  me to take. The waiting. . . . The constant paranoia. The fact that  this boy did something to me that made me want to take my own life  should speak for itself. I am an optimistic person. I excel at creating  my own happiness. But no matter what I tried, I could not find the  silver lining in this situation.''   Mr. Speaker, Sydney did seek help. She was diagnosed with PTSD.   Her impact statement continues: ``What happened to me 4 months ago  has impacted me in the most tremendous way--academically, spiritually,  mentally, physically, in how I handle my relationships. What happened  to me has ultimately changed my life and my perspective of life  forever.''   Mr. Speaker, this is one of the rare cases, in my opinion, where  there is some hope. Sydney did receive justice after going through all  this physical and mental anguish and pain that she is going through.   Her assailant was expelled, given a no-contact order, and restricted  from A&M property indefinitely. Is it the outcome that we would expect?  I would hope so.   To put it into words she said: ``The weight lifted off my shoulders  when I heard that A&M chose to expel him . . . a weight that nearly  smothered me for over 96 days. The fear of running into him on campus,  the fear of seeing him around town, the fear that haunted and  controlled my every move on campus, it was finally gone.''   That, to me, is justice. It means being free from the fear of  constantly being attacked. The rapist has given Sydney a life sentence  of mental pain. When defendants--I will call them perpetrators,  predators, whatever you want to call them--commit an act of sexual  assault, whether they are punished, suspended, go to prison or not,  whenever that consequence under society is over, they go on with their  lives. The victims don't get to go on with their lives. This is the  type of offense where they think about it almost on a daily basis.   That is why I say that it gives them a life sentence of pain and  anguish and turmoil. Sydney stands with her fellow Aggies, demanding  justice for the victims of sexual assault.   She says: ``I wouldn't be the Aggie that Texas A&M taught me to be if  I remained silent after receiving justice for myself. I wouldn't be the  Aggie that Texas A&M taught me to be if I didn't have the backs of  these other Aggies, other survivors,'' these other members of the 12th  Woman. ``Texas A&M taught me to be, if I was afraid, to stand here and  be counted as another one of its one-in-five victims on college  campuses'' of sexual assault.   Because of the time, Mr. Speaker, I am going to just relate one more  story and make some comments about what we are going to do about these  cases.   Kendra was a proud member of the Texas A&M Corps of Cadets. Holding  an executive officer title, she could not be prouder to attend the  school and be part of this outstanding university that prides itself on  respect for men and women in our military service.   She was on track to be commissioned as a second lieutenant in the  United States Army--that was, until the repercussions of her sexual  assault at the hands of a fellow cadet sent her world, like the others  that I have talked about, into an uproar.   Texas A&M has an age-old tradition called the Aggie Ring Dunk. She  and her fellow cadets, one by one, dropped their new class rings into  pitchers of beer. Then they started drinking until they surfaced with  the gold rings appearing in the foam.   What should have been a fun night ended in tragedy. One of her fellow  cadets, who happened to be engaged to someone else, her friend, walked  her and her friend to the dorm room. However, he followed her into her  room, locked the door, and began assaulting her.   Despite being weakened from the alcohol, she told him ``no,'' pushed  him away, did everything that a lady, a victim in this case, should do  to get him away from her. At one point during the attack, he began  suffocating her. She feared for her life.   Since her assault occurred in a campus dorm room, she was told that  there would be a crime alert email sent out to the entire campus. That  alert never went out. No one was warned that a violent sexual assault  on campus had been reported. Not a single A&M woman was any wiser.   Kendra says: ``I believe Texas A&M endangered the lives of every  single A&M student that came into contact with my rapist from the time  the university knew'' what he had done.   She was then told that she would meet with the commandant of the  corps, along with both of her parents, to address the safety and her  lack of safety. Suddenly, her parents were barred from the room, not  allowed to provide any support for her.   Rest assured, the general would have two assistants in the room with  him. Three against one, the 20-year-old cadet versus three high-ranking  military officials, to discuss rape, rape against her.   After much debate, the meeting never occurred. Instead, the dean of  student life met with Kendra and her parents. She described that  meeting as that individual ``implied that my report of the assault was  causing her  [[Page H6582]]  trouble, and I wasn't helping anyone by coming forward. . . . And then  there were several ways that I was requesting not to see my assailant,  because we lived in very close quarters and had common classes and  common activities.''   Every single one of those requests by her was denied to keep him away  from her. They offered to move Kendra's parking spot; not the  assailant's. They offered to change Kendra's schedule; not the  assailant's. They offered to move Kendra's dorm to another dorm, but  not the assailant's. A no-contact order was issued, but, you guessed  it, it was up to Kendra to leave if the individual showed up in a  classroom or the building.   Throughout the entire process, she said the university said that  lawyers slow things down and aren't necessary. But Kendra obtained a  lawyer that night. Shortly afterward, she received justice against her  assailant.   As soon as her attorney met with school officials, the school quickly  found a way to suspend the assailant until the hearing. Kendra's case  was decided by the university's student conduct panel composed of three  faculty members, and they found him responsible for 21 charges,  including sexual abuse and sexual contact. And he was expelled.                                time  1245    It seems to me that because she hired her own private attorney she  got the justice that she wanted and she deserved.   To this day, Kendra hopes university police will pursue a criminal  case against her attacker. With the current backlog of DNA testing, it  would take a year for her sexual assault kit to be analyzed. Until then  she will continue to speak up, be part of the 12th Woman, and ask for  change for her beloved university and all universities to make them  safer for all students.   Those are six cases, individuals, young women, who went to college  and bad things happened to them. Their statements speak for themselves.  In some cases they felt like the university helped them; some cases  they don't feel like the university helped them. But to a person--I was  starting to say to a man--but to a woman, they all want improvements on  college campuses about what has taken place on our campuses.   After all of these things came out in the public domain, the 12th  Woman group met with university officials. They presented a 12th Woman  report outlining specifically what happened and what they want changed  on their university, and really what should be changed on other  universities.   Mr. Speaker, I include the report in the Record.                             12th Woman Report         This report outlines the information shared between the       12th Woman and the administration of Texas A&M including       Chancellor John Sharp and President Michael Young on Monday,       June 25, 2018.        About 12th Woman--The 12th Woman is a group of survivors       and advocates dedicated to transforming Texas A&M University       policies for providing justice in cases of sexual assault       that are reported.            Introduction to Meeting with Texas A&M Administration         My name is Abbie Hillis, and I want to welcome everyone       here tonight. Thank you to the victims for being brave enough       to share your story and thank you to the administration and       President Young for making this meeting a priority.        It is fair to say that we all know this meeting shouldn't       even be a meeting we are forced to have. As survivors, we       know the administration has had meetings like this before,       recently in fact, where you were forced to listen to stories       about how the policies and procedures at Texas A&M need to       change. We are here tonight because there has been complete       and utter failure by the leadership at Texas A&M. You all       have declined to make sexual assault advocacy, policy, and       procedure a priority. Instead, you continue to issue what are       titled ``messages to the community,'' in the hopes that a       carefully-worded statement will keep current and future       students satisfied. Well, we are saying no more. The constant       gaslighting and victim blaming must end.        We come to you today with huge hearts for Texas A&M, but we       also come to you with broken hearts, because you have chosen       to prioritize the university's brand over justice for       victims. For a university that portrays itself to the public       as unique by priding itself on its core values, it is       unconscionable to hear the never-ending stories over and over       and over from survivors. These stories are all the same and       demonstrate in each and every case that the university       prioritizes athletes, money, and perceptions of safety over       providing advocates and support for victims who have been       sexually assaulted. Victims are silenced, shamed, and       encouraged not to hire an attorney. Victims go to the Student       Counseling Center only to be told not to report their story       or that the issues are far greater than the SCC can handle.       Victims are forced to walk on campus next to their assailant,       or worse, to watch their assailant compete and represent the       university on a global stage.        Our stories today will illustrate the inconsistencies in       Texas A&M's reporting procedures for sexual assault crimes.       There is no uniform reporting process and no one is held       accountable. Current policies encourage those in charge, like       some of you sitting in this room today, to brush stories       aside and sweep victims under a rug. Texas A&M is spending       money on ribbons for athletes to wear for sexual assault       awareness but can't provide a qualified trauma counselor to       support sexual assault victims. The university also spends       money duplicating services that are already provided for free       through the government. But this isn't new information to any       of you.        Beyond hearing our stories today, I hope you all also know       that we are investigating your Clery Act alerts with reports       of sexual assault, as we believe there are discrepancies. We       are aware that the university has hired Husch Blackwell LLP       to do a ``thorough'' review of your sexual assault       investigations related to Title IX. But we also know that       this is the exact same firm that found Michigan State       University compliant with Title IX prior to Larry Nassar       being convicted of over 200 counts of sexual assault. Maybe       if MSU actually hired a team of attorneys that genuinely had       the university's best interest at heart, they wouldn't find       themselves in a $500 million settlement. We are curious, is       this the same outcome you all want for Texas A&M? As I       mentioned before, none of this information is new, yet these       issues still come up and we get the same response from the       administration with no results. There is no doubt that the       university is proficient in providing a statement in attempt       to address an issue, but we all know that words only go so       far and actions speak so much louder, actions that you all,       to date, have not had the decency and respect to make a       priority.        Our goal is not to spread awareness to this administration;       you know very well these issues exist. Instead, our goal is       to invoke action with the leadership of the university. Texas       A&M has the ability to be a leader among universities across       the nation. You have an opportunity to address these issues       and create a system that actually works to protect and       advocate for victims of sexual assault. We can either choose       to work together and create change or we will have to work       against each other and force change. Ultimately, it is up to       you, the leadership of Texas A&M, to decide which route we       will take. What we are asking for is simple: a commitment to       integrity, to ensure that all Aggies are safe to attend Texas       A&M University.     Also, the school, Texas A&M, has responded. The  president met with the 12th Woman, the ladies in this group, and had a  meeting with them and has issued a comprehensive statement, as they  call it, comprehensive reviews and actions and next steps by the  president of the university.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record what Texas A&M's response to all  of this is.               Comprehensive Reviews, Actions and Next Steps                               (July 2, 2018)         Dear Aggie Community, I would like to provide you with an       update regarding review plans recently announced that seek       ways to improve how the university addresses sexual assault       investigations. Since the last update, below are some of the       efforts underway now and in the near future:        Robin Means-Coleman is, as reported earlier, leading the       internal review. She has begun the following initiatives, to       which she and those involved will add additional actions       throughout the review:        Assemble the internal review committee. The committee is       comprised of a team of experts, to include: students       including sexual assault survivors; faculty whose scholarship       focuses on sexual assault; staff including student assistance       services; a representative from the community Sexual Assault       Resource Center (SARC); and others;        Analyze related university rules and Standard       Administrative Procedures (SAPs);        Examine Student Affairs Title IX processes, from intake to       post-process;        Identify ways to improve communications with students       regarding available resources, advocates, and advisors; and        Understand staffing allocations and needs.        EVP and Provost Dr. Carol Fierke is, as reported, the lead       liaison to the third-party review firm, Husch Blackwell (HB).       HB will be on campus beginning this month to interview       students, faculty, staff, community advocates and others. HB       was selected because of their expertise and deep level of       scrutiny as it pertains to assessments of policies and,       importantly, challenges in implementing those policies.       Primary interview input, process analysis, training review       and benchmarking to other universities will be some of their       work. We will make available  [[Page H6583]]       to HB the information and resources that they require.       Significantly, as is essential to any meaningful results in a       third-party review, we will also stay out of their way so       that they may do their work independently and unfettered.        During the course of these reviews, as opportunities for       improvement are identified, we will take action. We will not       wait until conclusion of reviews to implement what we are       able to improve as we move along.        Since my last message, an Aggie-led sexual assault       survivors group agreed to meet with our leadership team last       week. The Chancellor, Provost and I along with other campus       leaders listened carefully as individuals bravely shared       their experiences. We are deeply grateful for their input. We       will not comment on any individual case or publicly share       details of that private discussion, but I want to sincerely       thank them for their testimonies and willingness to share       with us directly. I reiterate our commitment to addressing       concerns brought forth.        We are committed to keeping our Aggie community informed as       these important reviews and resulting actions progress. It is       important to remind you of the standing invitation for all       Aggies to send suggestions to [email protected], which we are       reading.        I want to thank you again for your input, caring and       support as leaders inside and outside of the university       advance this important work.            Sincerely,                                                  Michael K. Young,                                                         President.     Mr. Speaker, Texas A&M is not alone in the fight to  provide victims a voice. As stated in one of the victim's statements  that I read into the Record, the National Sexual Violence Resource  Center reports that each year one in five women will be assaulted while  in college. One in five, 20 percent, in those 4 or 5 years. To me that  is a staggering statistic.   According to End Rape on Campus, an American woman who attends  college is more likely to be a victim of sexual assault than a woman  who does not go to college. That means whatever you think it means--one  in five.   Mr. Speaker, most of us in the House are parents. I am blessed to  have three daughters and a son, and I have 12 grandkids, eight of which  are girls. Parents need to be aware of these statistics. One in five  will be assaulted while in college as a student.   So what we want to do and what the 12th Woman wants to do is to stop  these statistics and bring them down. I understand that at Texas A&M,  the statistics--and I may be wrong--the statistics show that 1 in 14  are assaulted. At the same time, institutions of higher education  across the country, to me, do not have an incentive to acknowledge the  problem publicly, to address it.   We can understand why universities don't really talk a lot about what  is happening with crimes on campus. They just don't. It is about the  image of the university and other things. But it is not being talked  about, I think, enough so that people are on notice that there is a  problem.   Here are some solutions to the chances of having an assault committed  on campus and what we can do about it as public, Members of Congress,  and what universities can do about it. Some of those solutions are  presented in the president's report at Texas A&M. Many of the solutions  are presented in what these victims, the 12th Woman, tell us about.   The current oversight--because there are Federal laws that talk about  reporting all crimes, including assault--seems to affect encouraging  colleges to underreport sexual assaults.   I certainly applaud these young women for having the courage to come  forward and tell their stories to the world. This 12th Woman group, as  I said, are here today, and they are advocating for change on the  national level. It has nothing to do with Texas A&M. It has everything  to with changing all of our universities. It is a call to action. The  12th Woman is dedicated to bringing change to the way universities  address sexual assault, not just at A&M, but across the country.   I will stand with the 12th Woman, Mr. Speaker, for their coming  forward and telling their stories. These stories that you heard are not  unique to one university. They happen all over the country.   So what are we doing about it?   Hopefully, I have shown part of the problem. Now it is up to us. I am  talking about Congress. Victims of crime on college campuses--or really  any other place--sexual assault victims don't have high-dollar lawyers  from New York City to represent them. Whether it is in a university  setting or whether it is in a courtroom, they don't. Some of them do,  but most of them don't. As stated in these cases, most of them are  alone when they are trying to resolve this problem before officials at  the school.   The United States Congress must be their voice.   How do we become their voice? We make sure there is the right  legislation filed to protect our daughters and our sons when they go to  our universities. We have some legislation. The Clery Act is one of  these. We are going to try to improve it.   So I am talking about three pieces of legislation. These are pieces  of legislation that are bipartisan. I will repeat that. It is  bipartisan. So it may not get a whole lot of notoriety because we are  not fussing, fighting, and feuding with each other. Both sides agree. I  want to thank Carolyn Maloney from New York and Jackie Speier from  California--bipartisan--for working on these pieces of legislation.   They will help combat sexual assault on campus, provide victims with  a clear path to reporting to the universities, make sure victim  advocates are ready and available to all students nationwide, and make  sure that victims are able to access a qualified nurse examiner, a  forensic examiner.   Let me mention the first one. It is called the Megan Act. It is  bipartisan. Megan Rondini lived in Austin, Texas. She went to school at  the University of Alabama. While she was a sophomore there, she was at  a local hangout, a bar, and came in contact with a former student. She  was taken to his place. She was sexually assaulted, jumped out of the  second story window at his place, and then the whole system seemed to  fall apart.   She went to the hospital, but the person at the hospital didn't  really understand what the responsibility was of that medical test. The  rape kit was taken, but nobody knows where it is. It is gone. The  police interrogated her, I think, because they knew who the accused  was. The parents were important people at the university. They didn't  have anything to do with the case and even talked about filing charges  on her.   Then she went to the university and talked to a counselor. The  counselor said:         Well, I know the accused, and I am not qualified to talk to       you about it.    But they didn't furnish her with somebody else.   So she didn't get help from the university, didn't get help at the  hospital, and didn't get help from the police department. She had a lot  of emotional problems and decided to transfer. So she transferred from  the University of Alabama to SMU in Dallas, Texas.   Shortly after she transferred, Mr. Speaker, she committed suicide.  She couldn't handle it, all of these things going on in her mind. So  she paid; she got the death penalty for what happened to her. Megan  Rondini could have been anybody's daughter.   So we have filed the Megan Rondini Act. What does it do? It does one  thing specifically. It says universities and colleges must provide a  SANE or a SAFE, sexual assault forensic examiner, to victims of sexual  assault, or have one available for them nearby so that when they go to  report this trauma medically they get treatment from an expert. It is  bipartisan legislation. We ought to pass this legislation, get it on  the House floor and pass it to make our universities better.    I will say this about the University of Alabama, because of this  thing that happened at their school, they changed a lot of things. Good  for them that they changed a lot of their procedures.   I would ask the Speaker how much time I have remaining.    Okay. I will talk a little faster. I am from Texas.  We talk slower. I would like to get more than 17 minutes, but I  understand.   Jackie Speier and I have filed a bill called the HALT Act, HALT  Campus Sexual Violence Act. I will give as many details as I can, Mr.  Speaker.   The National Institute of Justice estimates that 63 percent of  universities shirk their already legal responsibility when reporting  sexual assault violent crimes. They are already supposed to report it;  they don't. This bill will make sure that they do report it.  [[Page H6584]]    It allows the Department of Education to issue financial penalties to  people who don't comply with Title IX. It increases the penalties up to  $100,000. It allows a private right of action by the victim on campus,  and it requires public disclosure of a list of colleges and  universities under investigation in violation of Title IX and the Clery  Act. It increases funding so that universities can do this. The HALT  Act is a good piece of legislation.   The third piece of legislation by Carolyn Maloney of New York and  me--it is pretty bipartisan. Carolyn Maloney from New York is a  progressive, liberal Democrat. Ted Poe is kind of a conservative guy  from Texas. We are joining together to sponsor the Campus  Accountability and Safety Act.   What does it do? It provides, specifically, victim advocates in  sexual assault cases to victims of sexual assault on campus. It does a  lot of other things, too. I hope we can get both of these on the House  floor soon. It also requires that there is one reporting mechanism.   In other words, if you are complaining of sexual assault by a  student, there is one avenue on campuses. Other campuses, such as the  ones that have the Corps of Cadets, you go through the Corps of Cadets.  If it is against a faculty member, for example, you go that route. If  it is against an athlete, you go a different route. So we need to  combine all of those in all of our reporting systems so that students  know and are put on notice that they can go through one specific route.  These legislations do a lot of other specific things, too.   Recently I was at Rice University. I had Members of Congress down  there. We did a sexual assault forum on campus. What happened? Rice  University is doing a lot of good things. One of the things they do is  just make it real obvious that there are things that students can do.   Mr. Speaker, I include this poster in the Record.                             You Are Not Alone         Rice University has supportive and caring faculty, staff,       and students who are here to help you.        If you have experienced any kind of sexual assault, sexual       harassment, relationship violence and/or stalking, it is not       your fault and you have options.        Rice University's Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibits       relationship violence, stalking, and sexual misconduct. These       behaviors include physical and verbal abuse, sexual assault,       unwanted sexual contact, and sexual harassment.        For emergency assistance, call:        RUPD/REMS.        For confidential counseling, call (24/7):        Rice Counseling Center        Houston Area Women's Center        the Montrose Center        Students can learn about their options at Rice by       contacting:        Title IX Coordinator        Student Wellbeing and Title IX Support        To learn more or to find a STRIVE Liaison:        Visit safe.rice.edu        Email TitleIXS[email protected]     They post these posters throughout the university  and restrooms telling them basically you are not alone and here is what  you can do to educate and what you can do if a crime is committed  against you.   It is a good idea. They have a protocol that I think many  universities ought to look at. They have designed a student-based-- really?--a program that all students are required to take when they are  an incoming freshman. It is not just a 1-hour course. It is several  weeks long. They educate students on how to deal with other people-- relationships--that a lot of them have never been trained in doing.   Mr. Speaker, I have been talking about, I think, a very serious thing  that happens. Here in Congress, we spend a lot of time talking. Right  before I talked, you heard a lot of talking on both sides. But we spend  a lot of time talking about our national defense, and we spend a lot of  money on airplanes, aircraft carriers, and our military. I'm not saying  that we shouldn't. But it is defense spending to make us safe from  foreign countries.   Should we not be as concerned about the safety of Americans in  America and maybe refocus on their safety?   I think we can and we should. We need to make sure we get our  priorities straight.                                time  1300    I have known a lot of sexual assault victims in my career at the  courthouse for 30-plus years. I still keep in contact with them on a  periodic basis. Sometimes they just call me to check in. I have known  sexual assault victims who, even after the trial and the person went  off to the Texas penitentiary, committed suicide.   Mr. Speaker, rape, sexual assault is a different type of crime than  your car being stolen or your house being burglarized. It affects the  individual in the deepest part of their soul. Sometimes the offender  tries to steal the identity, the soul, the self-worth of the victim.  Many of them feel that way for a long time.   We in the House of Representatives have the responsibility to be the  voice of sexual assault victims in our country and do what we can to  make sure that they have due process, that the same Constitution that  protects the rights of offenders--and I totally believe in those  rights--protects the rights of people who are victims of crime.   Due process and justice must balance both of those so that we get the  right decision for the right reason when these things happen to,  primarily, our female athletes or female students throughout our  universities.   I admire these women who have come forward, being bold to make public  what happened to them--bad things--and our response should be: We are  on your side. We are in it together. We are going to do what we can to  make our great universities even greater and protect our young men and  women on college campuses.   The 12th Woman. I would say, Mr. Speaker, don't mess with the 12th  Woman. These are relentless, tenacious young women who want to take  what happened to them and turn it around and make it something that we  can prevent, make it a positive thing.   My grandmother, who was the most influential person in my life--and I  will close with this, Mr. Speaker, and I appreciate the time--lived to  a ripe old age of 99. She was the most influential person in my life,  even more than both my parents, who are both alive. They are 93 now.  She told me that there is nothing more powerful than a woman who has  made up her mind.   I think these women have made up their mind, and we need to join them  and be together in our calls to stop sexual assault on campuses and  tell our universities and help our universities make those places safer  because our American children and children from other countries that go  to our universities are worth fighting for. It is our job to do so, Mr.  Speaker.   And that is just the way it is.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of my Special  Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
