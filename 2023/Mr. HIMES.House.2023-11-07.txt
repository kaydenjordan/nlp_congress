 Mr. Speaker, it was in this Chamber on January 6, 2021,  that I came to realize relatively late in life how fragile our  democracy is. I realize that the words of the Constitution, to which we  all pledge an oath, are important, and so are the concepts underlying  those words, the concepts of a peaceful transition of power, the  concept of the separation of church and state, and the concept of  freedom of expression.   These are concepts that are hundreds of years older than the  Constitution, but they are critical to our democracy, which I think we  would all agree is currently a bit fragile.   For this reason, I am profoundly disturbed that this House has gotten  into a frenzy of censure resolutions to censure the speech of Members  of Congress.   Mr. Speaker, it is the second clause of the First Amendment to our  Constitution that says that Congress shall make no law abridging the  freedom of speech. Our Founders protected us, in particular, with  another clause in the Constitution, the Speech and Debate Clause.  Article I, Section 6, says that we will be protected: ``For any speech  or debate in either House, they shall not be questioned.''   Our Founders decided that we would not be sanctioned for the things  that we say, yet there are at least four resolutions before this  House--one from Ms. Jacobs, one from Ms. Greene, one from Ms. Balint,  one from Mr. McCormick--seeking an official censure of Members of  Congress for the things that they have said.   Mr. Speaker, this is what I mean by the erosion of the foundational  principles on which our democracy exists.   I don't much like any of the speech that the Members who are accused  of foul speech have engaged in, but the test of our commitment to  freedom of expression is not how hard we fight in a moment for the  rights of those that we agree with. The test is whether we are willing  to stand up for freedom of expression for somebody with whom we don't  agree.   To my Republican friends, I would say they have quite rightly, in  many instances, objected to the cancel culture, which is too rampant in  our universities and elsewhere. Why now? Why in this institution?   To my Democratic friends, I would remind them that every progressive,  going back to Galileo right up through Cesar Chavez to Martin Luther  King, has been tolled and tortured and sanctioned for their expression.   It is time for this to stop in this Chamber. It is time for us to  stop trying to punish each other for the things that we say, no matter  how abhorrent.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that we are more than just Representatives. If  we were just Representatives, we would go back to our constituents and  bring their ideas here. We are stewards of this institution, which is  why we take an oath to the Constitution.   If you take seriously your role as a steward of this institution,  vote to table every one of these obnoxious motions to censure. If they  do come up and aren't tabled, vote against them. The freedom of  expression upon which this institution is built demands nothing less.                            ____________________
