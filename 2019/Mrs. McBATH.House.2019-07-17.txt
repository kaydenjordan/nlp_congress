 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the issue of college  affordability. Too many of our students are  [[Page H5984]]  finding themselves saddled with student loan debt after attending  predatory institutions. We cannot expect our students to repay these  loans when they were not given the quality education and degree that  they paid for.   Students who pursue higher education degrees are sometimes faced with  sudden school closures, or the institution's loss of accreditation.  When this happens, students are often left with incredible debts, but  no degree to show for it.   This issue hits very close to home for me. In March, approximately  1,500 of my constituents became all too familiar with this situation.  Argosy University, an institution ran by Dream Center Education  Holdings, LLC, closed, leaving its students with large debts and class  credits they could not transfer. Student veterans were told their GI  benefits were depleted, and that they would be unable to continue, or  even start over, at another institution.   That is why I am so very proud to have introduced H.R. 3662, the  Relief for Defrauded Students Act. In 2016, the Department of Education  issued a ruling allowing for students to have their debts relieved when  it was found their universities severely misrepresented their services.  My bill would codify this rule and protect students from the impacts of  predatory institutions.   Currently, there are over 180,000 applications for debt relief claims  sitting at the Department of Education awaiting decisions. These  students deserve action from the Department, not silence. H.R. 3662  would provide them a quick and fair process for resolving these issues.   I am happy to have introduced the Relief for Defrauded Students Act,  along with Representatives Katie Porter, Abby Finkenauer, Cindy Axne,  Mary Gay Scanlon, and Sharice Davids. Together, we are committed to  protecting our students and holding these institutions accountable.
