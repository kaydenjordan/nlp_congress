 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 352 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 352         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 1973) to prevent the sexual abuse of minors       and amateur athletes by requiring the prompt reporting of       sexual abuse to law enforcement authorities, and for other       purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       amendments specified in this section and shall not exceed one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the       nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on the       Judiciary now printed in the bill, it shall be in order to       consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment       under the five-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       115-20. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be       considered as read. All points of order against that       amendment in the nature of a substitute are waived. No       amendment to that amendment in the nature of a substitute       shall be in order except those printed in part A of the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House       on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the       bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made       in order as original text.

All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary now       printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       115-19 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended,       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived.

Sec. 3.  On any legislative day during the period from May       26, 2017, through June 5, 2017--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time,  [[Page H4521]]       within the limits of clause 4, section 5, article I of the       Constitution, to be announced by the Chair in declaring the       adjournment.

The gentleman from Colorado is recognized  for 1 hour.

Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation. This rule provides a structured process for  debate. I want to highlight that this rule makes in order all  amendments submitted to the Rules Committee, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Nearly 30 years ago, I held my son, Cody, for the first time. A  couple of years later, I held my daughter, Kaitlin. I knew right then  that these two children were the most important and cherished things in  my life. They deserve the happiest childhood and the brightest future  and the safest world.   I imagine anyone who holds their child for the first time has the  same thought. Until you become a parent, it is hard to describe the  love you have for your children.                                time  1245    Mr. Speaker, that someone would hurt a child simply perplexes me.  Children are the most vulnerable, the most innocent in our society.  They, most of all, don't deserve the trauma and pain that accompany  abuse. They don't deserve to have their trust in adults or their trust  in the world shattered at such a young age. They don't deserve the  ghosts of suffering that accompany abuse victims for the rest of their  lives.   Mr. Speaker, to commit a crime against children is to engage in the  greatest of evils. It is to violate our moral order in the most  egregious of ways. Our job in Congress is to debate and maintain that  moral order. Thankfully, everyone in this Chamber can agree on the  moral imperative to protect children.   Our job today is to uphold our values through well-crafted  legislation. We are here today to pass laws that uphold our belief in  the sanctity of innocence. We are here today for our children.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1973, the first bill in this rule resolution,  strengthens the laws protecting child athletes. The bill requires  coaches and adults involved with amateur sports organizations overseen  by the U.S. Olympic Committee to report suspected child abuse to local  and Federal authorities.   Unfortunately, reporting isn't always the standard under current law.  Over the past 20 years, around 368 individuals affiliated with USA  Gymnastics faced sexual abuse by adults affiliated with the  organization, according to The Indianapolis Star. Sadly, some of the  victims never saw justice. Their allegations remained unresolved,  sometimes because coaches moved from State to State to avoid  investigation.   H.R. 1973 pulls additional adults into the mandatory reporting  category, ensuring that those adults working with minors under the U.S.  Olympic Committee's jurisdiction must report instances of child abuse  to local and Federal authorities.   It further clarifies the sexual abuse reporting duties of national  governing bodies, or NGBs. These organizations, supervised by the U.S.  Olympic Committee, manage amateur athletic competitions.   We need to promote a culture of reporting sexual assault among youth  athletes. That culture needs to overflow into all parts of our society.   We are not suggesting we toss out due process for the accused. The  legislation at hand only requires the reporting and investigation of  sexual abuse of children. Additionally, H.R. 1973 makes stronger the  civil remedies that victims of sexual abuse may pursue.   Mr. Speaker, the other legislation under this rule, H.R. 1761, goes  after those who create child pornography. Just to utter those words is  unbearable, but our job in Congress is to stop the unbearable.   Under current law and due to the impact of the court ruling in United  States v. Palomino-Coronado, perpetrators of child pornography can  sometimes evade prosecution for child pornography under a loophole.  Under the precedent set in the case, even if perpetrators memorialize  the sexual abuse of a child through images and video, they do not  necessarily possess the intent or purpose to sexually abuse children in  order to take a picture. In other words, they didn't intend to violate  title 18 of the U.S. Code, section 2251, which prohibits child  pornography.   We need to close this loophole. If evildoers are sexually abusing our  children and photographing or filming it, they should be going to  prison for a long time. This loophole was carved out by the judicial  branch. It is time for the legislative branch to step in and tighten  the statutory language to prevent the exploitation of this loophole and  to prevent the exploitation of our children.   The bills under consideration today serve two purposes. First and  foremost, they provide a deterrent to criminals who would consider  harming a child.   We can't preemptively stop everyone who plans to commit a crime  against a child, which is why we must deter them with the threat of  discovery, conviction, and jail time.   These bills very practically make the exploitation of a child harder  to get away with. They commission more well-meaning adults to be on  guard against the occurrence of sexual abuse. They allow victims to  pursue even stronger civil penalties that will, hopefully, deter future  criminals, and they strengthen the law itself to ensure that child  pornographers face prosecution and appropriate punishment for their  heinous crimes.   The second purpose achieved today is to send a message. These bills  signal to all of America that our society is serious about protecting  children and that we are serious about catching child predators.   H.R. 1973 specifically directs coaches and others to report sexual  abuse. But these bills send a broader message: everyone in this Nation  should join the fight against child exploitation.   We have too many examples of well-meaning adults remaining silent in  the face of child abuse. This legislation is meant to push Americans to  do what is right, even if it is not easy.   We are all the guardians of our Nation's youth. We all are  responsible for their childhood. We are all proponents of their future.  These are our children, our pride and joy. We must offer them the same  vigilance and protection we offer our own children. The rule before us  gives this House a chance to do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important rule and  the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today for the children.   In voting for the bill and the underlying bills, we are sending a  message to the abuser of children: If you harm one of these little  ones, you will be met with the full fury of the American justice  system. You will be discovered and reported by your peers. You will  face the threat of appropriately harsh demands. You will face the full  force of the law if you visually depict child exploitation.   We are sending a message to the bystanders: You have a solemn duty to  protect these children. You have a duty to be their hope and happiness  and their future when you step in and stop abuse. You have a duty to  report the heinous acts committed by monsters.   Lately, we don't have many moments in Washington where both political  parties can come together and reach a consensus, but the legislation we  are considering today provides the perfect opportunity.   These bills should not be controversial. They should draw the support  of both sides, because protecting our children is a moral necessity for  every American. That is, after all, the message these bills send.   I thank Representative Brooks and Representative Johnson for the hard  work they have done on these bills, and I thank Chairman Goodlatte for  shepherding these bills through the Judiciary Committee and spending so  much time in committee working on legislation to protect our children.   Mr. Speaker, I urge members to vote ``yes'' on the resolution, vote  ``yes'' on the underlying bills.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 352 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       1516) to allow Americans to earn paid sick time so that they       can address their own health needs and the health needs of       their families. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Education and the Workforce. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 1516.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mr. Buck moves that the appeal be laid on the table.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to table.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
