 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for the second year in a row, the State of  Mississippi is the center of the universe for college baseball. Senator  Hyde-Smith and I are proud and delighted this afternoon to congratulate  not one but two Mississippi collegiate baseball teams on becoming  national champions for their respective divisions this year. Those  teams are the Ole Miss Rebels and the Pearl River Community Wildcats.   It was just last year that the Mississippi State Bulldogs won their  first-ever College World Series national championship. And with the new  year, came even more successful baseball in Mississippi.   Last month, after sweating out selection day, Ole Miss went to the  NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament and won 10 out of 11 games,  sweeping Oklahoma in the final round of the College World Series to  become national champions.   Just weeks earlier, Pearl River Community College, located in  Poplarville, MS, defeated Madison College of Wisconsin in the Division  II Junior College World Series. After spending the entire season ranked  in the top five, Pearl River won five out of six games in the playoffs,  defeating Florida State College at Jacksonville, Lansing Community  College, and, finally, Madison College in a three-game series finale.   The Wildcats dropped game one to Madison, but then roared back with a  19-to-1 victory in game 2 and a decisive 7-to-2 victory in game 3. They  finished their season with a sparkling record of 45 wins and 11 losses.   Just think about this for a moment. Three college baseball national  titles in 2 years for the State of Mississippi.   Congratulations also go to the University of Southern Mississippi,  which had an excellent season and even hosted their first super  regional in Hattiesburg, ending with a record of 47 wins and 19 losses.   This year's Ole Miss championship run is a comeback story for the  ages. After spending the early parts of the season ranked No. 1 in the  Nation, the Rebels went into a deep slump in April, losing 4 straight  series and 11 out of 16 games. In May, they were among the last 4 teams  to be included in the field of 64. But they had finished the regular  season hot, and some people believed they just might carry that  momentum into the playoffs. And they did, outscoring their opponents 46  runs to 11 down the stretch.   Led by Coach Mike Bianco and Team Captain Tim Elko, Ole Miss beat one  team after another--first Arizona and Miami in the regional, then  Southern Miss in the Hattiesburg Super Regional, then Auburn and  Arkansas in the College World Series, which led to a final best two out  of three face-off with Oklahoma.   Game one was a slugfest. The Rebels put up 16 hits, including back- to-back-to-back home runs in the eighth inning by T.J. McCants, Calvin  Harris, and Justin Bench--a stunning feat not seen at the College World  Series since 1998.   On the mound, the Ole Miss pitchers kept things quiet. Jack  Dougherty, Mason Nichols, and Josh Mallitz gave up just three runs,  securing a 10-to-3 victory.   The decisive game two was a lot closer. For the first five innings,  it was a pitchers' duel between Ole Miss's Hunter Elliot of Tupelo, MS,  and Cade Horton of Norman, OK. The bats finally got going for Ole Miss  in the sixth when Jacob Gonzalez hit a solo home run. The Sooners  quickly answered by knocking in two runs, making it 2 to 1, Oklahoma.  In the eighth inning, Ole Miss tied things up with hits by T.J.  McCants, Justin Bench, and Jacob Gonzalez, and scored two additional  runs on wild pitches, making it 4 to 2.   In the top of the ninth, Brandon Johnson took the mound for Ole Miss  and closed out the night with three strikeouts, capping off a magical  run for the men from Oxford.   ``From last team in, to last team standing,'' exclaimed the  announcer.   And then to Oxford they returned, bringing with them the 30th NCAA  championship in Ole Miss history.   The day after winning the title, these national champions were  welcomed back to campus by crowds of jubilant supporters as they walked  the hallowed pathway known as the Walk of Champions.   On behalf of the entire State of Mississippi, I commend the Ole Miss  team and their staff on this historic achievement. Justin Bench, Calvin  Harris, Kevin Graham, Kemp Alderman, and Dylan DeLucia all were named  to the NCAA's All-Tournament Team.   Dylan DeLucia received the Jack Diesing, Sr. Most Outstanding Player  of the Series award for pitching a complete game shutout against the  Arkansas Razorbacks, becoming the first recipient of the award in Ole  Miss history. And Captain Tim Elko became only the sixth player in  history to earn four hits in a Men's College World Series final--not to  mention his 46 career home runs, the second most in school history.   I also congratulate Mike Bianco, who has coached Ole Miss for 22  seasons and led the team to 18 playoff appearances,  [[Page S3234]]  including two trips to the College World Series in Omaha. He has  rightly been named National Coach of the Year by the American Baseball  Coaches Association and the Collegiate Baseball Newspaper. He never  gave up on his team, and he inspired his players to persevere through  the tough times.   I wish Coach Bianco the best of luck this week as he now leads Team  USA at an international tournament in the Netherlands, where he is  joined by two Ole Miss players, Hunter Elliott and Jacob Gonzalez.   I also congratulate Michael Avalon, Head Coach for the Pearl River  Wildcats, who, after leading his team to a national title, was named  National Coach of the Year for Division II junior colleges.   I commend the University of Mississippi, Pearl River Community  College, the University of Southern Mississippi, and Mississippi State  University for carrying on Mississippi's winning tradition.   Two years ago, after a season cut short by the COVID pandemic, Ole  Miss catcher Hayden Dunhurst boldly said:         I have never been a part of a team so special . . . We will       bring a National Championship to Oxford.    And so they did. Congratulations and Hotty Toddy.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
