 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in solidarity with the  south Jersey Sikh community. This month marks 38 years since anti-Sikh  rioters in India massacred Sikhs over 3 days.   The massacre was retaliation for the assassination of Indian Prime  Minister Indira Gandhi. There were mass rapes and lynchings. Sikhs'  homes and their businesses were destroyed, senselessly slaughtered for  nothing more than their beliefs and their religion.   Following the slaughter, some of the Sikhs chose to flee India.  Today, many of them call south Jersey home. They built lives for  themselves, contributing to the education, economic, religious, and  cultural richness of our region.   They also carry the knowledge of those dark days. They keep the names  and the memories of those who were lost in those days very much alive.   In memory of those Sikhs lost to this senseless violence between  November 1 and 3 of 1984, and with respect to those who carry on their  legacy in south Jersey today, I stand here in solidarity with my Sikh  brothers and sisters.                            ____________________
