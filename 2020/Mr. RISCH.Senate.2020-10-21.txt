Policy Justification  Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States                      (TECRO)--MS-110 Recce Pod System         TECRO has requested to buy six (6) MS-110 Recce Pods; three       (3) Transportable Ground Stations; one (1) Fixed Ground       station; spare and repair parts; repair and return; site       surveys; integration and test equipment; system support and       equipment; personnel training and training equipment;       publications and technical documentation; U.S. Government and       contractor engineering, technical, and logistical support       services; and other related elements of logistical and       program support. The total estimated program cost is $367.2       million.        This proposed sale is consistent with U.S. law and policy       as expressed in Public Law 96-8.        This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and       security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing       efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a       credible defensive capability. The proposed sale will help       improve the security of the recipient and assist in       maintaining political stability, military balance, economic       and progress in the region.        This proposed sale will improve the recipient's capability       to meet current and future threats by providing timely       Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR),       capabilities for its security and defense. The enhanced       capability is a deterrent to regional threats and will       strengthen the recipient's self-defense. The recipient will       have no difficulty absorbing these systems into its armed       forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Collins Aerospace,       Westford, MA. The purchaser typically requests offsets. Any       offset agreement will be defined in negotiations between the       purchaser and the contractor.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to the recipient.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 20-75       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The MS-110 is a Non-Program of Record electro-optic and       infrared airborne reconnaissance system with long range, day/      night, multi-spectral sensor technology. The multi-spectral       sensor lets the end user see color and better distinguish       subtle features that traditional gray-scale imagery cannot.       The pod can transmit imagery via a datalink to ground-      stations for near-real time analysis and exploitation.        2. The highest level of classification of information       included in this potential sale is UNCLASSIFIED.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems, which might reduce system effectiveness       or be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that the recipient can       provide substantially the same degree of protection for the       sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government.       This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the recipient.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)       is a C-130 transportable wheeled launcher mounted on a 5-ton       Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles truck chassis. HIMARS is       the modern Army-fielded version of the Multiple Launch Rocket       System (MLRS) M270 launcher, and can fire all of the MLRS       Family of Munitions (FOM) including Guided Multiple Launch       Rocket System (GMLRS) variants and the Army Tactical Missile       System (ATACMS). Utilizing the MLRS FOM, the HIMARS can       engage targets between 15 and 300 kilometers with GPS-aided       precision accuracy.        2. The M57 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS)--Unitary       is a conventional, semi-ballistic missile that utilizes a       500-pound high explosive warhead. It has an effective range       of between 70 and 300 kilometers, and has increased lethality       and accuracy over previous versions of the AT ACMS due to a       GPS/Precise Position System (PPS) aided navigation system.        3. The International Field Artillery Tactical Data System       is the international export version of the Army's Advanced       Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS).

International versions are developed for       each customer unique to the weapon and targeting systems in       their inventory.        4. The M1152A1 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle       (HMMWV) is a two-man wheeled vehicle primarily used for the       transport of personnel or as a shelter carrier.        5. The M240B Machine Gun is a family of belt-fed gas-      operated medium machine guns that chamber the 7.62x5l mm NATO       cartridge. It has been used extensively by the U.S. Army in       infantry companies and as a mounted weapon on ground       vehicles.        6. The highest level of information required to facilitate       sale, training, operation, and maintenance of these systems       is classified SECRET.        7. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems, which might reduce system effectiveness       or be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        8.
