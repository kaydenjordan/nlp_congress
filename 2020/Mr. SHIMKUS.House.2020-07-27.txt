 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  2420, the National Museum of the American Latino Act, a bipartisan  piece of legislation that will help elevate and promote the stories of  the Latino community in the United States.   The Latino community represents over one-sixth of the American  population. Their contributions to the history of the United States  throughout the centuries has been both significant and fundamental.  Whether it be through their advancements to American innovation, to  serving faithfully and heroically in every American war, the Latino and  Latina population has always been steadfast in their commitment to the  United States and its values.   Since my appointment to the Smithsonian Board of Regents in 2019, I  have continued to voice my strong support for this legislation, and I  am proud the Latino community is one step closer to finally having  their legacy forever enshrined on the National Mall.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Congressman Serrano and Congressman  Hurd on their tireless work advancing this legislation, and I urge all  my colleagues to vote yes on H.R. 2420.
