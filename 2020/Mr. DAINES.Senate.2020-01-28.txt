 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Brandon Roberts and Stacia Fuzesy of Chouteau County for  their hard work and entrepreneurial spirit.   Brandon and Stacia opened the Golden Triangle Brewing Co. in Fort  Benton. Their craft beers showcase the rich history of Montana ag and  the grain growers of the Golden Triangle. Working with local farmers,  Brandon and Stacia are energizing the local economy and crafting beers  that Montanans can call their own.   They have also worked with local historians to help create unique  names for their craft beer that highlight Montana history such as  Shepweizen and Bentonbier.   It is my honor to recognize Brandon and Stacia for opening up this  thriving Montana small business that promotes our rich history and  values. Small craft breweries like the Golden Triangle Brewing Co. are  helping drive the economy across Big Sky Country. Keep on brewing.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Anna, Grace, and Joy Williams of Daniels County, for their  hard work in planning Hands Across Scobey, an event that raised money  for Montana foster children.   These three Montana sisters took the initiative to give back to their  community and organize an effort to help those most vulnerable in our  society--foster children.   Their mother, Ruth Williams, a mother of five, including one foster  child, was the motivation for the `Hands Across Scobey' event.   It is my honor to recognize Anna, Grace, and Joy for their  selflessness and willingness to serve others. Their charitable effort  is exemplary of the Montana spirit.   I look forward to following the future accomplishments of these three  young ladies.                            ____________________
