 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to  address you here on the floor of the House of Representatives.   I rise today to honor the life of Frank LaMere. Frank LaMere was a  leader for the Winnebagos, who had land on both sides of the Missouri  River in the Sioux City area, and also for Native Americans, especially  in the upper Midwest.   Over the years, our lives interacted multiple times. I had the  opportunity to work with him and see the gentleness of his nature.   I will say that he mellowed out in his later years, but he never let  up. He never took his foot off the throttle. He just found a smoother  way to get to the goals, which were to help out his Native American  people.   He was a model of dedication to selflessness, and he also had more  than his fair share of tragedy, loss, and demons to fight.   Over the course of his life, he demonstrated that no matter the  obstacles, he could rise above them, as we could rise above those and  do the most good we can with the tools we have to work with.   He overcame addiction himself. He had dedicated his life to being a  voice for the voiceless, including securing housing, food, and other  necessities for the people whom he did such a good job representing in  the area.   Yet, tragedy still exists in our communities, and Frank LaMere saw  the need to address those situations. We collaborated on a couple of  important things together. They were the passions of Frank LaMere who  passed away on Sunday evening.   The imagination and the dream that he had was to build Hope Street,  which would be a treatment center and housing center primarily for  Native Americans who are drug addicted or alcohol addicted.   That project, by the way, has the language that allows it to qualify  in this appropriations bill that we have before us this week.   Also, the second project that was a very, very important project was  when Frank and I had a chance meeting in the airport in Omaha, and we  began to discuss these things, too, that were on his mind, that brought  about the bill that is now H.R. 184. That is the Winnebago Land  Transfer Act.   In 1865, the United States Government and the Winnebago Tribe signed  a treaty that granted that land on both sides of the Missouri River to  the Winnebago Tribe. As the river changed and situations changed-- actually, I shouldn't say both sides of the river. It was the Nebraska  side of the river. When the river changed, that meant that a lot of  that land actually ended up in Iowa.   The Corps of Engineers came in 105 years later and condemned that  property for their own project. It was a takings, and I believe it was  an unconstitutional takings. In doing so, they never compensated them  for that land, and they didn't use that land for the project for which  they had intended.   So, over time, the Winnebagos were able to put the money together to  go to court. The statute of limitations had expired. The court ruled  that, if they were going to rule on the issue, they would grant the  land back to the Winnebagos, but it was beyond their jurisdiction  because of the statute of limitations.   The only thing that puts that land back is an act of Congress, and  that is the Winnebago Land Transfer Act, H.R. 184. If we can conclude  that this week or next week, it will be the time that we have finished  the biggest part of the work of Frank LaMere. We should do so to honor  his life.   One of the things that he was quoted as saying, and this was at the  services for him: ``If you haven't been marginalized at least once a  week, then you probably haven't done very much.''   I can identify with that, Madam Speaker, and I can identify with the  life of selfless work of Frank LaMere.   We honor his life. Let's honor his life in this Congress this week or  next.                            ____________________
