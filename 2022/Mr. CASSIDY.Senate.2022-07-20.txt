 Mr. President, I hear from families in Louisiana every  day that they are struggling to keep up with gas prices at historic  heights. It is becoming unaffordable to drive to work or drop their  kids off at school. The 15-year-old pickup that they drive--not because  they don't want a new car but because they cannot afford a new car--now  costs $100 a tank to fill up. And for those who say: Tell them to buy  an electric vehicle, that is the modern-day equivalent of Marie  Antoinette saying to the peasants ``Let them eat cake.''   Families are forced to choose between buying groceries or buying gas.  And the Biden administration doesn't seem to be listening, so I am here  to make their voices heard.   Let me just read from letters we received from constituents, just  kind of like sending us a line. Here is Lorrie from Jamestown, LA.         Dear Mr. Cassidy, Is there any relief in sight for gas       prices? We had affordable gas under the Trump administration.       There is no reason we should have these prices now if the oil       and gas production in the United States was in full force.       Why would we ever depend on other countries for anything when       we have already been energy independent just a short time       ago? Families in our country are suffering.    Next letter, Gwendolyn from Prairieville:         Dear Senator Cassidy, please do whatever it takes to get       American oil and gas used as resources. I am a divorced 60-      year-old woman on a limited income. Gas has gone up,       electricity has gone up, groceries have gone up, medical       expenses have gone up, and insurance has gone up drastically,       and my pay has not kept up at all.    Here is Donnis from Singer:         Dear Senator Cassidy, I just wanted to voice my opinion       about how it makes no sense that our government will not       renew oil leases off the coast of Louisiana . . . There is no       reason we need to be held hostage by countries who do not       care about our sovereignty.    This is Philip from DeRidder:         Please help with these high gas and food prices. I am       retired and on a fixed income and these higher gas prices and       food prices are starting to hurt me and my wife.    Here is Gregory from New Iberia:         This is not about party affiliation. We're coming into a       bad crisis. Both parties need to come together and talk about       drilling. We have all the resources we need to start drilling       again, and I know you are trying. I see it on the news.       Please keep trying.    Here is Laura from Vinton:         I want to express my concern for us Louisiana citizens. Gas       prices are rising every day, food prices are rising everyday       also. It's coming down to having to choose between to get gas       or get groceries. Something needs to be done. U.S. citizens       are suffering daily. Please help us Americans!    Here is Daryl from Mooringsport:         As your constituent, I urge you to publicly call for and       vote in favor of the immediate and permanent expansion of       domestic oil and natural gas production. No more Green New       Deal nonsense. Energy dependence is driving higher gas and       diesel prices that are causing skyrocketing gas and food       prices. We can't rely on Iran or Venezuela to save us. We       need to produce our own energy here--in America--and NOW.    Lastly, Karen from Gretna asked:         Why are we importing any oil? Energy independence is of       vital importance to us and our national security. Louisiana       was a leader in domestic energy production. It is shocking to       see how quickly our country has changed. Please continue to       work on our behalf to force our government to reinstate the       energy independence policies that were in effect during the       Trump administration. Speak loudly for us.    Speak loudly for us.   Speak loudly for us.   What these letters make clear is that Americans are hurting. That is  why I call for an Operation Warp Speed to lower the prices at the pump,  to unleash American energy, and to regain our energy independence.   President Biden needs to stop prioritizing far-left climate activists  over the families sitting at the dinner table asking what they have to  give up next in order to make ends meet.   President Biden, as one of my constituents says, needs to go where  real people live.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Caroline  Watson, in my office, be granted floor privileges until July 21, 2022.
