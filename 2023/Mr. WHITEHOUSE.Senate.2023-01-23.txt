 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate  Colonel Hugh T. Clements, Jr., on his retirement from the Providence  Police Department and on his new role at the Department of Justice  running the COPS program. A 38-year veteran of the police force,  Colonel Clements joined the police force right out of college. He  worked his way to the top job and did so with integrity and devotion to  the job and the city he loves. Two things stand out about Hugh: One, he  made the transition from leading the FOP to leading the department, a  feat that provides a measure of his skills and fairness; two, in the  department's dark days, he remained true to his oath, even though that  likely ended any chance for him at promotion. When the skies ultimately  brightened, his choice to stay true was rewarded; but at the time, it  was not sure that day would ever come. It is easy to do the right thing  when you are rewarded for it; when it comes with a price, that is the  true test--one he passed. I have always admired and enjoyed working  with Hugh. One of his many gifts is to always be in touch with and  understand his officers and the challenges they face as they serve our  capital city, with a similar understanding with the broader community.  Leading any sizable department can be difficult, but Colonel Clements'  long tenure in the role of chief under several mayoral administrations  is a testament to his abilities--to the affection, loyalty and respect  he has earned and to his thoughtful and effective community-centered  approach.   Chief Clements has received many accolades for his outstanding  service. He is a three-time recipient of the Chiefs Award. He has been  recognized  [[Page S53]]  for his work by the FBI, ATF, and the Rhode Island Attorney General.  And now, the Attorney General of the United States has placed his trust  in him. I thank Colonel Clements for his steadfast commitment to the  people of our capital city and to the officers of the Providence Police  Department as he leaves city service. I wish him, his wife Donna, and  their family, all the best--and I look forward to continuing to work  with him here in Washington to protect the public safety.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate  Commissioner Steven Pare on his retirement as commissioner of public  safety for the City of Providence. During Commissioner Pare's tenure,  he worked tirelessly to strengthen the Providence public safety  response team and create a system that delivered for all who work,  visit, and live in our capital city.   As commissioner, he oversaw both police and fire operations in  Providence. A dedicated public servant, Commissioner Pare served on the  Rhode Island State Police for 26 years and then became superintendent  commanding that distinguished organization. He enjoyed a successful  interval in the private sector before duty called again, and he  returned to take the helm in Providence. I have had the pleasure of  working with Steve throughout his years on the State police and in  Providence. Before him, his father was a legendary State police  officer, with a sterling reputation for integrity that Steve has  carried proudly forward.   Commissioner Pare has been a trusted and effective leader throughout  his career in law enforcement. I wish him, his wife, Jill, and his  family all the best.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate  Commander Thomas Verdi on his retirement from the Providence Police  Department. Deputy Chief Verdi joined the force 35 years ago after  graduating from the University of Rhode Island, fulfilling his lifelong  dream of becoming a police officer. I had the pleasure of meeting Tom  when he was a young officer, we did an overnight ``ride-along''  together, and I have worked with him over the years from my time as  U.S. Attorney and Attorney General until his retirement.   His commitment to the job and love for Providence helped him rise up  the ranks into leadership roles. He was the first Providence police  officer to serve on the State parole board; he ran Providence's  training program and led the department administratively. A cop's cop,  Tom was a renowned undercover officer, he received the U.S. Attorney's  Award for his work in the multi-agency Latin Kings gang investigation,  and ultimately received the National Police Association's Top Cops  award for his narcotics investigation prowess.   As he retires, I come to the floor to recognize how Commander Verdi  has served with distinction and honored the residents of Providence. He  comes from a Rhode Island family of great accomplishment, and I thank  Tom for his distinguished service and wish him, his wife Kimberly, and  his family all the best in the chapter of his life that lies  ahead.                            ____________________
