 Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an open letter to  my constituents:        This is a somber time in our country as the House this week       weighs articles of impeachment against our President. It's a       vote that no Member should ever want to take, and I certainly       did not. I ran for Congress to work to lower the price of       prescription drugs, to fight for education funding and to       help our family farmers. And as your representative that is       what I've been focused on. I'm particularly proud that over       two-thirds of my nearly 340 bills are bipartisan and that       I've developed strong relationships across the aisle that are       leading to important legislative accomplishments.        When I was sworn into office this past January, I swore an       oath to protect and defend the Constitution of our great       nation. That is why in mid-September I called for an open and       transparent process to determine whether the President's       actions warrant articles, and if they should receive a full       trial in the Senate.        On Friday morning, the House Judiciary Committee voted to       send the resolution on Articles of Impeachment to the House       Floor. You deserve to hear from me directly in advance of my       vote now that the Committee work is complete.        After reviewing the public testimony from non-partisan       public servants and officials appointed to their roles by the       President himself--as well as the final House Intelligence       Committee report--I have decided that this week I will vote       yes on both Articles of Impeachment.        No elected leader is above the law.        It is clear from the testimony and the report delivered to       Congress that the President attempted to coerce a foreign       government into investigating his political rival by       withholding Congressionally-appropriated military assistance       to a foreign ally. This is a clear abuse of power by a       sitting U.S. President for his own personal gain. It is also       clear that the President obstructed Congress by refusing to       produce documents and blocking testimony during the       impeachment inquiry, which is against the law.        My values would require the same vote if this were a       Democratic President. It is about protecting our democratic       values, about right and wrong, and about upholding my oath to       the Constitution and the rule of law.        Gratefully yours,        Rep. Angie Craig        MN-02        December 15, 2019.
