 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember the life  and legacy of my dear friend and a proud Coloradan, Gloria Tanner, who  we lost earlier this week.   In 1985, Gloria became the second ever African-American  representative elected to the Colorado House of Representatives, and in  1994 she became the first African-American woman State senator in  Colorado history.   Long before her passing, she was inducted into Colorado Women's Hall  of Fame. She was an incredibly accomplished leader. We have lost an  extraordinary public servant, a remarkable human being, and a loving  and devoted friend. Her commitment to advocacy benefited countless  communities throughout the country, and she had a profound impact on my  own life. I have no doubt that her leadership and dedication will  continue to inspire generations for years to come.   Mr. Speaker, we all stand on the shoulders of giants, and Gloria  Tanner was one of those giants. We will miss her deeply. My thoughts  and prayers go out to her family.                            ____________________
