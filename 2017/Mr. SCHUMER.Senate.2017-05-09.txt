 Mr. President, first I wish to thank my friend and our  great Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Markey, for the great work he has  done on the opioid issue. He was one of the first to sound the alarm  when prescription drugs just began to be overprescribed and has worked  very, very hard, with many successes, in trying to deal with this  problem. We have a long way to go. Things would have been a lot worse  without the great work of the Senator from Massachusetts.   I see my colleague from New Hampshire on the floor, as well, and the  same goes for her. She has done an outstanding job. She has worked and  campaigned on this issue and is keeping her promises, working very hard  here in the U.S. Senate. We know that their States are among the top  States with opioid abuse problems.
