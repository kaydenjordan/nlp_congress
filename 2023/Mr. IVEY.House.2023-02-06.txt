 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any  extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor I rise today to  coanchor this CBC Special Order hour with Chairman Horsford, the  chairman of the CBC, and Ms. Kamlager-Dove of California.   For the next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the  American people on issues of great importance to the Congressional  Black Caucus, Congress, the constituents we represent, and all  Americans.   Today, we will be speaking on the death of Tyre Nichols.                                time  1915    Mr. Speaker, I rise today--after the horrifying murder of yet another  young, Black man at the hands of police--outraged because nothing has  worked.   ``They need more police training,'' we said.   But so-called elite squads like SCORPION already require extra  training over and above the basics.   ``They need more diversity,'' we said.   But every single one of the five officers we saw mercilessly beat an  unarmed and compliant Tyre Nichols was Black, just like him.   ``They need more accountability,'' we said.   But even the advent of body cameras hasn't stopped officers from  pummeling our sons--and sometimes our daughters--to death over mere  traffic infractions.   Just throw in a few shouts of: ``Stop resisting'' to try and fool our  eyes from believing what we are clearly seeing.   We tried all those things--more training, more diversity, and more  accountability--and yet Tyre Nichols is dead. He was dragged out of his  car and attacked by a swarm of men twice his size, exhausting  themselves and then coming back to beat him again.   Reforming these so-called elite squads is not enough. It is time to  end them altogether.   These units often attract and recruit young, aggressive officers  drawn to the prospect of less supervision. They slap an intimidating  name on the team, like SCORPION or STRESS or CRASH--which in the  nineties stood for Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums--because  these units aren't about forging bonds with the communities they serve.  They are about instilling fear.   They descend on low-income, usually minority neighborhoods looking to  make pretextual stops in search of drugs or guns. That is not a secret.  It is a tactic sanctioned by the Supreme Court itself. An officer can  stop anyone for whatever reason he wants. He doesn't even need to know  which law he suspects you of breaking, Mr. Speaker, so long as he can  develop a reason after the fact--reasons that are often minor, trivial,  and unrelated. Things like a busted taillight or partially obscured  traffic tag are sufficient for these stops.   This is formal policy in police departments across the country. For  example, the New York City Police Department admittedly trained its  officers to ``stop and question first, develop reasonable suspicion  later.''   What results is a constant state of alert. Black and Brown males  worry about being pulled over for a minor traffic stop that can spiral  out of control. Police officers worry because they are understandably  taught that there is nothing more dangerous than to walk up to a  stranger's driver-side window at night. Both sides of the confrontation  are on edge.   And for what?   So that an officer can peek inside the car for contraband and ask for  so-called consent to search the car, despite many drivers feeling like  they can't say no.   These pretextual traffic stops aren't bearing much fruit. A study  found that stop-and-frisk searches in New York City produced drugs or  guns in less than 2 percent of the cases. What it does is breed  contempt between the police and the people they are sworn to protect.  African Americans are five times more likely to have their vehicles  searched, and a Black man has to hit the age of 50 before his chance of  being pulled over lowers to that of a young White man.   As the father of five Black sons, I am all too familiar with the talk  parents are duty bound to give their Black and Brown children about how  to deescalate interactions with the police.   As a former prosecutor, I saw firsthand how communities can be  ravaged by fear in the face of violent crime and threats to public  safety. Those communities should not also be afraid of the men and  women in uniform whose job it is to defend them. Police can't  investigate crime if victims and witnesses don't trust them enough to  come forward. These squads running roughshod on our streets are  contributing to a breakdown in that trust. It isn't leading to better  results, but it is contributing to the unjustified killing of our kids.   Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn Davis did the right thing by shutting  down the SCORPION unit. But we must not wait until the next murder of  an innocent man gets national attention before we shut down these  roving elite squads across the country.   Professor Christy E. Lopez, the co-chair of the D.C. Police Reform  Commission, made the case brilliantly in a recent Washington Post  editorial titled: ``Cities should get rid of their toxic crime- suppression units.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this article by Christy E.  Lopez.                 [From the Washington Post, Jan. 31, 2023]        Cities Should get rid of Their Toxic Crime-Suppression Units                           (By Christy E. Lopez)         Last week, after five Memphis police officers were charged       with murdering their son, Tyre Nichols's family called for       the dissolution of Scorpion, the specialized policing unit to       which those officers were assigned. On Saturday, Memphis made       the right decision and announced it would shut the unit down.        Now, other cities should follow Memphis's lead and disband       their own analogous--and outdated--units.        In my decades investigating law enforcement agencies, and       studying what makes them prone to causing unnecessary harm, I       have consistently found that units such as Scorpion are a key       factor. And they are not unusual. Most mid-size to large       cities have a unit--or several--akin to Scorpion, focused on       areas considered to be crime ``hot spots'' or on a particular       task such as seizing drugs or guns.        These teams have various names orbiting around buzzwords       like ``crime suppression'' or ``violence reduction.'' In the       communities they police, they're often just called ``jump       outs.'' Regardless of the name, they are all under official       direction--pressure, even--to aggressively police areas       deemed high-crime, nearly always majority Black or Latino,       often using traffic and pedestrian stops as an excuse to       search people and their belongings in the hopes of finding       guns or other contraband.        It's possible that Scorpion was a particularly bad specimen       of this family of aggressive policing units: As one police       chief noted, the name ``speaks volumes about the mission of       the unit and the mentality of the officers.'' That       ``Scorpion'' was an acronym for ``Street Crimes Operation to       Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods'' is a mockery of genuine       concern for community well-being.        But this tolerance for inflicting community pain in the       name of community protection is a thread that runs through       these teams going back decades. In the 1990s, the  [[Page H700]]       Los Angeles Police Department's ``special investigations       section'' was an ``elite'' unit known both for the       extraordinary number of people it killed in shootouts and for       its practice of allowing community members to be victimized       so it could make better arrests. During a Justice Department       investigation of the New Orleans Police Department in 2010, a       police official told investigators that the community viewed       street crime ``task forces'' as ``jump out boys, dirty cops,       the ones who are going to be brutal.'' These task forces       finally were ended in 2020 after the federal monitor showed       they operated with little supervision, made stops with       ``questionable legal basis,'' didn't document their work and       endangered citizens.        An investigation of the Baltimore Police Department's       notoriously corrupt and violent Gun Trace Task Force (GTTF)       found that although created in 2007, its abusive tactics had       roots dating back to at least 1999. Yet the GTTF was not       disbanded until eight of its officers were indicted in 2017.        In Washington, the D.C. Police Reform Commission (which I       co-chaired) recommended in 2021 that the Metropolitan Police       Department suspend its crime-suppression teams and gun       recovery unit until it could provide data showing its       effectiveness. The department has not done so, although late       last year, it suspended one crime-suppression team after       seven of its officers were put under investigation. A month       ago, a former officer from another team was convicted of       second-degree murder for a 2020 car chase that killed Karon       Hylton-Brown (another unit officer was found guilty of       obstructing justice).        These units can't be fixed. Their problems go beyond issues       with selection, training or supervision. The premise on which       they are based ensures they will fail communities. Everything       we know teaches us that, to be effective, policing must       center community well-being and fair treatment. But these       units are focused on stats: arrests made, guns and drugs       recovered, even overtime hours worked. This incentivizes       policing that takes full advantage (and then some) of the       broad discretion under law--including pretext stops and       discretion to jail that is broader than a judge's--to detain       and search people based on little more than a hunch, a       profile or where they live. It's an approach that has been       shown time and again to be inefficient, alienating and       confrontation-provoking, even as its impact on crime is       uncertain.        I have talked with many police officers who are ambivalent       about--or even resentful of--these units, which generally do       not respond to calls for service. This leaves regular patrol       officers to pick up the slack--and often, the pieces of       community relationship broken by interactions with the       specialized units. These patrol officers live the mixed       messages given by police and city leadership: They are       sternly admonished to build trust and take action only where       public safety requires, even as they see leadership       encouraging (and promoting) members of crime-suppression       teams. They watch as the relationships they built with       community members go unnoticed and the latest gun and drug       bust earns a commendation. Heavily policed communities will       tell you exactly how this contradiction plays out: ``The       police are everywhere,'' I often have been told, ``until you       need them.''        Suppression units also become petri dishes for cultures of       impunity. As long as they ``produce,'' making arrests and       bringing in contraband, chiefs can ward off unrealistic       expectations that policing solve social problems. But       facilitating this kind of ``production'' has always, in my       experience, gone hand-in-hand with indulging lax adherence to       law and policy, discounting or glossing over misconduct       complaints and generous overtime approval.        These units reflect and reinforce the worst aspects of       warrior policing. The cost-benefit analysis makes no sense       once you recognize that we have underestimated their harms,       and the benefits they offer could be better achieved through       services that respond more directly to community needs and       work to reduce the root causes of crime.        Disbanding Scorpion was likely a little too little, and       certainly a little too late. Other communities should not       wait for an act of searing violence before rethinking this       approach. It's time to recognize the harm these units cause--      and put an end to them and the approach to policing they       embody.     Finally, I think the time has come to end pretextual stops  completely because they are just racial profiling hiding behind  legalese and little more than a subtle way to circumvent the  constitutional rights of Black and Brown males.   Pretext stops allow police to stop cars even though they lack even  reasonable suspicion to think that an actual crime is, has been, or is  about to be committed.   They allow police to pressure drivers into a so-called consensual  search so that they can avoid the need to obtain a warrant to search  the car. As we have seen yet again, these pretextual stops frequently  escalate into young men being killed or seriously injured not because  they broke the law but because they have been targeted for aggressive  police tactics that aren't directed at other communities.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge President Biden to use his executive  authority to put an end to this practice at the Federal level, and I  urge State and local officials--mayors, police chiefs, and county  executives--to put an end to this practice all over the country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Kamlager-Dove).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for her  powerful and extemporaneous comments. I think it is a representation of  the powerful leadership she has provided over the years and will  continue to provide in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Horsford), my  colleague, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for that powerful  statement.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), my  colleague, the Representative from the Fourth District of Georgia.  [[Page H703]]         Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those powerful  comments.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Adams).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Bowman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs.  Cherfilus-McCormick).   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today and say a special  thank you to the Congressional Black Caucus, Chairman Horsford, and  also my colleagues for having this Special Order hour.   Mr. Speaker, my heart is broken for the family of Tyre Nichols,  another Black man who lost his life to senseless police overreach and  violence.   The horrifying footage of his untimely death displays why the United  States must pass comprehensive police reform and public safety  legislation.   Tyre Nichols' murder occurred in Memphis, the city where Dr. King  lost his life fighting for a dream that we still are reaching for  today.   Our country must reckon with the longstanding and fraught legacy of  racism and violence against Black people.   Tyre Nichols, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Michael Brown, Tamir  Rice, and so many more Black men, women, and children should be alive  today. Their deaths were preventable.   Black Americans constantly find themselves trapped in an endless  cycle of grief. Mr. Speaker, 3 decades after the heinous beating of  Rodney King, Black communities continue to bear the deadly consequence  of a culture of policing that allows law enforcement officials to  dehumanize, debase, and victimize individuals without consequences.   As a mother of two Black children, it is heartbreaking to shoulder  your kids with the responsibility of a double-consciousness of how you  as a parent see them, but also as the whole world sees them.   Our Black children go from being viewed as innocent to future  convicts in the eyes of society and in the eyes of those who are  charged with the responsibility of protecting them.   It is terrifying to not know if your child will return home after  they step out that door. Mothers and fathers planning their children's  funerals cannot become a standard in our great Nation. It is simply  unacceptable.   In the 117th Congress, House Democrats introduced a George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act, which passed the House but failed in the  Senate, ultimately failing all Black families.   In a humanitarian call for action, I urge the House to pass public  safety legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I end by saying their names: Tyre Nichols, George Floyd,  Breonna Taylor, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, and so many more Black  women, men, and children would be alive today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs.  Sykes).    Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Representative Kamlager-Dove and  the Congressional Black Caucus, we thank the Speaker for this  opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 13 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, February 7, 2023, at 10 a.m.                                 ____________________
