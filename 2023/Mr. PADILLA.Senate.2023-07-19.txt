 Mr. President, I rise as a proud Angeleno to  celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.   Few stadiums in the world have such a storied history and such a  lasting cultural impact, as the LA Coliseum. Since opening in 1923, it  has served as a living memorial to those who bravely fought in World  War I, and it has endured as a landmark for generations of Angelenos.   The Coliseum remains the only stadium in the world to have hosted two  Summer Olympics. The first games, held in 1932, helped revolutionize  the format for the modern Olympic Games and displayed America's resolve  through the Great Depression. The second, held in 1984, was highly  regarded as a financial success and a masterclass in hosting and  showcasing the Olympic Games. As a boy, I remember watching in awe as  Olympic legend and California icon, Rafer Johnson, ran up the steps of  the Coliseum and lit the Olympic cauldron. With plans to once again  welcome athletes from around the world and showcase Los Angeles as a  world-class city in 2028, the Coliseum will soon break its own record  as a third-time host for the Olympic Games. The Coliseum also hosted  the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games to showcase the skills and  accomplishments of athletes with intellectual disabilities.   Many iconic sports teams have called the Coliseum home over the  years. The USC Trojans' and the UCLA Bruins' athletic programs shared  the stadium for over 50 years. Today, the Coliseum's timeless white  arches provide the backdrop for thousands of loyal USC fans waiting to  erupt each time their team plays a home game. In the National Football  League, the Rams, the Raiders, and the Chargers have all called the  Coliseum home at one point, and the stadium hosted three NFL  championship games in 1949, 1951, and 1955, as well as the very first  Super Bowl in 1967 and Super Bowl VII in 1973.   As a point of personal privilege, my Los Angeles Dodgers called the  Coliseum home for several years when they first moved out west, and  they would host the first World Series played on  [[Page S3146]]  the west coast at the Coliseum on their way to winning the 1959 World  Series.   For decades, the Coliseum was where leaders would go to speak to  large masses of Southern Californians. The stadium has hosted  Presidents Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Reagan,  as well as notable dignitaries and civil rights leaders, such as Martin  Luther King, Jr., Nelson Mandela, Cesar Chavez, and the Dalai Lama. It  has also hosted decades of legendary concerts from greats like the  Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Bruce Springsteen, Van Halen, and more.  Since 2022, NASCAR has hosted the Busch Light Clash at the Coliseum,  which is the first exhibition race of the NASCAR Cup Series season each  year.   As we recognize 100 years of memorable events and historic firsts, I  join all of Los Angeles in celebrating a century of competition,  camaraderie, civic engagement, and culture, and I know the next 100  years have even more in store.                            ____________________
