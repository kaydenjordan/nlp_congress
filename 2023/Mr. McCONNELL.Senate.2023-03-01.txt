 Mr. President, last week, Senate Republican colleagues  and I visited our allies and partners in Europe. We both reassured them  of America's commitment to strength and leadership but also urged them  to invest and engage more in security and the transatlantic alliance.   Our allies are coming around to the realization that security  assistance to Ukraine is not just helping one nation's citizens defend  their sovereignty. It is also degrading Russia's ability to further  threaten Europe or threaten America and sending a powerful deterrent  signal to other potential aggressors.   From our own perspective, much of the money that is being described  as American aid to Ukraine is actually being invested in our own  defense industrial base here at home. We are procuring new versions of  munitions and weapons for our own military to replace often decades-old  versions that we have sent over to Ukraine.   And, after an ill-advised ``holiday from history,'' European allies  are now following America's lead. NATO members are making historic  investments in defense that will keep paying dividends long after  Ukraine defeats Putin's aggression.   The West is priming the pump of the industrial capacity that will  ensure we are prepared to meet the larger military challenges posed by  systemic rivals like China.   The recent press reports that Beijing is considering providing  weapons to Russia should not come as a surprise. China has plenty of  reasons to fear a Russian defeat and plenty of reasons to hope Russia  gets away with forcibly seizing another country's territory.   Yesterday, the Senate Armed Services Committee heard testimony from  Keith Kellogg, a former adviser to President Trump and cochair of the  Center for American Security at the America First Policy Institute.   Like the vast majority of Republican Senators, he complained that the  Biden administration had been actually too slow in providing military  assistance to Ukraine. He noted that the best way to end the conflict  was to ``enable Ukraine to defeat the Russian army in Ukraine.''   And what about the claim that the West supporting Ukraine is somehow  distracting us from the threats posed by the PRC?   Here is what Kellogg said:         Make no mistake: weakness against Russian aggression is       weakness against the Communist-Chinese threat . . . Russian       victory in Ukraine today almost certainly means war for       Taiwan tomorrow.    Likewise, in Japan, senior officials are spelling out the clear link  between the response to Putin and the prospects of deterring President  Xi. They have taken historic steps to invest more in their own defense,  and during our trip last week, Prime Minister Kishida announced that  Japan plans to direct $5.5 billion in assistance toward Ukraine.   Other reports indicate that citizens of Taiwan are volunteering to  fight alongside Ukrainians against Russia.   Let me say that again. There are reports that indicate citizens of  Taiwan are volunteering to fight alongside Ukrainians against Russia.   The very people most threatened by the ambitions of the PRC tomorrow  [[Page S540]]  understand the importance of Ukraine prevailing today.   Our friends and partners in the Middle East know the score as well.  They have had to contend with Russia as an influential force in the  region ever since President Obama failed to enforce his redline in  Syria and Putin came rushing in to that conflict. Now our partners see  the same Iranian missiles and UAVs that have struck their own cities  being used by Russia to attack Ukraine. They know Moscow will repay  Tehran soon somehow and that a victorious Russia will be less  constrained in providing advanced capabilities to Iran.   So we have seen senior Israeli officials showing up in Kyiv. We have  seen Saudi Arabia vote against Russia in the United Nations, pledge  $400 million in assistance to Ukraine, and send its first official  delegation to Kyiv in 30 years.   Clearly, America's friends all around the world know that the way we  respond to today's threats will determine our readiness to face  tomorrow's. They know it in Europe, they know it in the Indo-Pacific,  and they know it in the Middle East.   And, here at home, Republicans know that the safest America is a  strong--strong--and engaged America. That is why we will continue to  push President Biden and his administration to move faster to exert our  leadership, invest in our own defense, equip our friends, and keep  America safe.
