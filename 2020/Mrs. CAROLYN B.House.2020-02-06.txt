 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise to express  my strong support for H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to Organize  Act.   For over 3 years, the Trump administration has waged an assault on  organized labor, limiting unions' ability to fairly represent the  American workforce while undermining safeguards that protect against  discrimination and unsafe working conditions.   This bill will protect our Nation's workforce against this erosion of  their rights. The PRO Act introduces meaningful, enforceable penalties  for companies that violate workers' rights to unionize, streamlines  access to justice for workers who suffer retaliation, facilitates  collective bargaining, and increases transparency in labor relations.   Our Nation was not built by gold or silver but was built by labor.  Protecting the rights of workers to organize strengthens our workforce,  our economy, and our Nation.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important bill.                            ____________________
