 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my  dear friend State Senator George C. Edwards, who is retiring from the  Maryland General Assembly at the end of this year, and to thank him for  a half-century of principled and productive public service to the  people of Maryland, especially his constituents in what we call  Mountain Maryland: Garrett, Allegany, and Washington Counties.   George was born in Grantsville, MD, and graduated from Northern  Garrett High School in Accident, MD. He received his bachelor of  science in business administration, cum laude, from Fairmont State  College in West Virginia in 1970. He was the starting fullback on the  football team there and earned National Association of Intercollegiate  Athletics All-American honors. Despite playing at a small school, he  was good enough that the Baltimore Colts drafted him. George wanted to  be a teacher, however, and later attended what was then Frostburg State  College to receive his teacher's certificate so he could teach social  studies at his old high school.   I met George when he won his first election to the Maryland House of  Delegates in 1982, where I was serving as speaker of the house. Even  though he was only 33, he was already a seasoned elected official with  a decade of experience on the Grantsville Town Council and the Garrett  County Board of County Commissioners. He also served in the National  Guard for 6 years after he graduated from college,   George served with distinction in the house of delegates for 24  years, finishing his tenure there as minority leader from 2003 to 2007,  when he won election to the State senate, where he has served for the  past 16 years. George won 4 of his 10 elections to the general assembly  with 100 percent of the vote and another 3 with 98 percent or more of  the vote. He and Delegate Sandy Rosenberg are the deans of the Maryland  General Assembly; each of them started their service in 1983.   George delivered a farewell address to the State senate that reflects  the type of person he is, a statement filled with self-deprecating wit,  congeniality, and a gentleness too rare in politics. He said that his  first task in Annapolis was to educate his fellow lawmakers that  Allegany County isn't spelled with an H, that Maryland's longest border  is with West Virginia, and that western Marylanders speak in a  particularly folksy way. ``You speak slow and you m-m-m mumble a little  bit,'' he said. He also noted that when he joined the general assembly,  there were only 13 Republicans serving in the house of delegates and 7  in the State senate. ``I can count,'' he said he remembered thinking.  ``I said, hmm, I need to make some friends. And I need to make some  friends on [the Democratic] side of the aisle. And I think I've done  that.'' George certainly has made friends on the Democratic side of the  aisle, and I am proud to be one of them.   In an op-ed in the New York Times several years ago, Michael  Ignatieff wrote:         For democracies to work, politicians need to respect the       difference between an enemy and an adversary.        An adversary is someone you want to defeat. An enemy is       someone you have to destroy. With adversaries, compromise is       honorable: Today's adversary could be tomorrow's ally. With       enemies, on the other hand, compromise is appeasement.        Between adversaries, trust is possible. They will beat you       if they can, but they will accept the verdict of a fair       fight. This, and a willingness to play by the rules, is what       good-faith democracy demands.    George understands this crucial distinction between adversary and  enemy and has acted according to this principle throughout his entire  career, which is why even his adversaries are his friends. It is why he  has served as cochair of the general assembly's joint committee on  legislative ethics, making him the only Republican in leadership in the  legislature. It is why he has been such an effective representative for  his constituents in western Maryland. It has been a challenge because,  as George has noted, ``A lot of people where I live don't think people  in other parts of Maryland think we're in Maryland.'' As Maryland State  Senate President Bill Ferguson said, George has ``made sure every  senator understood the needs of his district and always approached  negotiations from a standpoint of getting to a resolution, not to  obstruct.'' Senate Majority Leader Nancy J. King, a former chair of the  budget and taxation committee, summed it up when she said, ``You can't  say no to George because he's such a nice guy.''   In 1946, Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher famously quipped,  ``Nice guys finish last.'' Durocher never met George, who has always  come in first by putting his constituents first. Being nice is not the  same as being obsequious. George is a true conservative, a rarity in  today's politics. He and I have different points of view on some major  issues like gun safety and government regulation, but that has never  stopped us from working as a team on behalf of his and my constituents.   We have worked together to support and expand Federal-State  partnerships such as the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Economic  Development Administration, Community Development Block Grants, and the  Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Program. We have worked  together to secure funding from Maryland and Pennsylvania and the  Federal  [[Page S4437]]  Government to complete the North-South Appalachian Highway initiative  connecting I-68 to the Pennsylvania Turnpike via US-219. We have worked  together to expand rural healthcare access and opportunities through  federally qualified community health centers, regional hospitals, and  other Federal partnerships in the region. We have worked together to  support higher education and workforce development programs through  Frostburg State University, the Western Maryland Consortium, and the  region's three community colleges.   We have collaborated to provide State and Federal grant training for  local emergency management and first responders to ensure they have the  resources they need to protect their communities. We have collaborated  to ensure that small businesses have access to State and Federal  resources to grow their businesses. We have collaborated on casework  for our constituents with State and Federal agencies related to  healthcare, veterans' benefits, housing, banking and taxes, passports,  and other issues.   George's legislative accomplishments are too numerous to list, so I  will mention just a few. He fought to alter a State revenue formula to  provide additional funding to counties, such as Garrett and Allegany,  where the State owns 15 percent or more of the land. He secured changes  to Maryland's Program Open Space, a land acquisition and recreation  program, to give Garrett and Allegany Counties the flexibility they  need to use the program without impeding economic development. He  increased Allegany County's share of revenue from the Rocky Gap Casino  Resort and increased the county's flexibility with respect to how it  can spend that revenue. He succeeded in increasing the speed limit on  parts of I-68 to 70 miles per hour, which is understandable considering  that his Senate district--district 1--stretches 125 miles from Red  House at the far western end of the State to Williamsport in Washington  County. Earlier this year, Governor Hogan signed into law a bill George  sponsored to establish the Western Maryland Economic Future Investment  Board and Senator George C. Edwards Fund to provide $50 million over  the next 3 years in State grants and loans for capital infrastructure  and business development projects in the region. Of course, George is  far too modest to suggest naming something after himself; his  colleagues voted unanimously to amend the bill to be named in his  honor.   When George announced his retirement, he noted that he had spent the  equivalent of 10 years in Annapolis, away from his family. So I would  be remiss if I failed to mention Linda, his beloved wife of 55 years,  and their two children, Kristin and Paul. Paul has followed in his  father's footsteps and serves as chair of the Garrett County Board of  County Commissioners. All Marylanders, but especially his district 1  constituents, owe a debt of gratitude to his family for sharing him  with the public. He and Linda are the proud grandparents of eight  children, and I certainly understand his desire, after half a century  of public service, to spend more time with his family.   In Shakespeare's play ``Hamlet,'' Polonius counsels his son Laertes,  ``This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the  night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.'' This  describes George Edwards and his life of public service. He has been  true to himself and never false to his colleagues or to his  constituents. I am honored to count George as a friend and want, on  behalf of the entire U.S. Senate, to extend my congratulations and  deepest appreciation to him and wish him and Linda and their family all  the best as he returns home to Mountain Maryland.                            ____________________
