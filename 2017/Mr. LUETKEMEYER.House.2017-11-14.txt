 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 21st  Century Flood Reform Act.   Chairman Hensarling and Chairman Duffy have crafted a great  substitute amendment that will bring about meaningful reform of NFIP  and protect taxpayers and policyholders alike.    The amendment includes H.R. 2246, my Taxpayer Exposure Mitigation Act  of 2017. Included in that bill is a requirement that the FEMA  Administrator purchase reinsurance or a capital market alternative in  an effort to guard taxpayers against losses.   I know of no major insurance company in the private sector that does  not purchase coverage to protect itself against loss of this kind.  These products function well. There is no reason that FEMA should not  be following this best practice as well.   The amendment also grants States and local governments and our  constituents the ability to play a more proactive role in the FEMA  floodplain mapping process.  [[Page H9228]]    I represent the Lake of the Ozarks with its 27,000 pieces of property  along its shoreline, which has dealt with tremendous mapping issues  over the past several years. Hundreds of letters of map amendments were  granted to my constituents, and there were multiple attempts by the  community to engage with FEMA to fix their mapping process, but my  constituents never felt their concerns were taken seriously.   The Lake of the Ozarks is not unique. FEMA processes 25,000 LOMA  letters each year at a cost of $13 million. This should tell all of us  something about the mapping process. Under this bill, areas like the  Lake of the Ozarks would be able to improve the accuracy of the maps  themselves, no longer beholden to Washington, D.C.   This amendment would also create an opt-out from the mandatory  coverage required for commercial properties, allowing banks and  businesses more flexibility to secure flood insurance coverage that  meets an entity's unique risks and needs.                                time  1530    It is important to note that this legislation does not preclude any  business from securing NFIP policy. Policies will remain available to  all businesses.   Also, this provision should not be misconstrued as a caveat to avoid  the purchase of flood insurance. Businesses operating in flood plains  should have flood insurance, and I am confident that lenders will  insist upon reasonable coverage. I believe this should be a business  decision between the lender and the business customer.   Lastly, this amendment would require FEMA to use actual replacement  cost in determining premium rates for NFIP policies--language  originally included in my H.R. 2565.   Pricing for private policies frequently takes into account the actual  replacement cost of a structure. It makes sense. Any insurance policy  should factor in the amount of money that would be needed to replace a  structure.   FEMA doesn't adhere to this fundamental of insurance. Rather, the  agency effectively uses a fixed national average for insured value and  replacement costs when determining customer premiums.   The result of FEMA's current practice is that lower-income  policyholders subsidize wealthier homeowners.   The substitute amendment we consider today gives FEMA the flexibility  it needs to stop this practice and move toward a replacement cost  pricing structure.   I also want to thank my colleague from Wisconsin for including this  provision in his substitute amendment. I am confident this package will  allow the private sector to flourish and take risk off the backs of  taxpayers while protecting NFIP policyholders.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the measure.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets of the Financial Services  Committee.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding and for her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2874.   There are some good things in this bill, including the Zeldin-Maloney  bill, that would allow policyholders to receive mitigation credit for  elevating boilers and other mechanical systems to higher floors instead  of in easily flooded basements, which is a huge deal for the city of  New York and other big cities.   But there are too many provisions that would make flood insurance in  my district either unavailable or unaffordable. For this reason, the  city of New York opposes this bill.   The bill would raise premiums on homeowners by increasing the floor  on premium increases that Congress just set 3 years ago. Currently,  FEMA has to increase premiums by a minimum of 5 percent per year. Under  this bill, FEMA would have to increase premiums by a minimum of 6.5  percent per year.   When you add up the mandatory increases in premiums required to fund  FEMA's reserve fund and all of the other surcharges in the bill, the  effect would be to significantly increase flood insurance premiums for  homeowners.   Finally, I am concerned about eliminating the noncompete clause for  so-called write-your-own private insurers. This would allow the private  insurers that administer the National Flood Insurance Program to  exploit their access to FEMA's database in order to cherry-pick the  safest properties. This would leave FEMA with only the riskiest  properties, and would undermine the solvency of the National Flood  Insurance Program.   So, while there are many thoughtful good provisions in this bill,  there are too many provisions that would dramatically increase premiums  for my constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.
