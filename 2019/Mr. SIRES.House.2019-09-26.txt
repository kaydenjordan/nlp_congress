 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the great  generosity and service of Frank Guarini, a former Member of this  institution.   He was born and raised in Jersey City, New Jersey, and has served his  State and country through many numerous roles: as a naval officer, a  state senator, a representative to the General Assembly of the United  Nations, and a Member of this House of Representatives for seven terms.   During his years on the House Committee on Ways and Means, Frank  Guarini was a committed advocate for education.   Since retiring from Congress, he has remained a dedicated champion of  education and public service, donating millions of dollars to support  local universities and organizations.   He has provided funding to establish numerous institutes, including  the Guarini Institute for Government and Leadership at St. Peter's  University, a nonpartisan forum that drives conversation about public  policy and New Jersey's key issues.   He has donated to the New Jersey City University to support  performing arts and scholarships designed for interdisciplinary urban  studies, planning, and development.   Most recently, Frank Guarini has announced a $10 million gift to St.  Peter's University School of Business to expand and update the school's  established new initiatives.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Frank Guarini for his  generosity, his public service, his longstanding commitment to bolster  education, and his support for his hometown of Jersey City. I thank  Frank Guarini.                            ____________________
