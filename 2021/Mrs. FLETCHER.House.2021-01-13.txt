 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Article  of Impeachment and in opposition to the gaslighting that is  masquerading as debate in this Chamber today.   I was in this Chamber when the President assembled and unleashed a  mob to attack the United States Capitol and the United States Congress,  the elected representatives of the people. By doing so, he incited an  insurrection against our representative democracy itself.   If that is not an impeachable offense, then what is?
