 Mr. Speaker, last year was an abject failure in  addressing the climate crisis. In both policy and real-world emission  reductions in the U.S. and globally, we fell short. We cannot afford  another year like it, and yet, 2019 is off to an ominous start.   The consequences of inaction on climate change are both dire and  familiar. The lives and livelihoods of millions across the country and  billions around the world are at risk.   Climate change is a national security threat, a food security threat,  a housing issue, a transportation issue, an infrastructure issue, an  immigration issue, a jobs issue, an energy issue, a financial issue,  and a public health issue.   We cannot, in good conscience, claim to be adequately representing  the people of our districts and our country and the world if we ignore  or deny the dangers that climate change poses to the American public  and the world.   I stand here in strong support of H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act,  to reverse the shameful and dangerous course of the last 2 years and  meet the challenge of climate change head-on.                            ____________________
