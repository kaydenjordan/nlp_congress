 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend  their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the subject of my  Special Order.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this is  Infrastructure Week in the United States, and while Hallmark may not  quite yet be making cards to observe Infrastructure Week, I hope those  of us here in Congress can take a moment to recognize that this is a  unique opportunity to talk about the importance of the state of our  Nation's infrastructure.   This is a time, as I was mentioning, really to focus on all modes of  transportation and our utility systems that most of us only tend to  notice when they are broken.   Well, Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of broken infrastructure in our  country to notice lately. In fact, even President Donald Trump has  recognized that the roads, bridges, and all the other underpinnings  that make our modern world possible are crumbling and need urgent  attention.   So the President has vowed repeatedly, both as a candidate and as  President, to invest at least $1 trillion in our infrastructure system.  That was a key promise of his campaign and critical to his appeal to  working class Americans, including in my home State of Pennsylvania.   But that promise is, so far, as broken as our Nation's  infrastructure. Instead, 4 months into his administration, this  President is laying the groundwork to shortchange American workers and  manufacturers. Mr. President, it is most disappointing.   I stood Monday morning at Philadelphia International Airport. I stood  with the former Governor of our State, Ed Rendell, who is part of a  bipartisan group called Building America's Future. I stood with both  Democratic and Republican Members of this body who happen to represent  the greater Philadelphia area. I also stood with Senator Coons of  Delaware, who, himself, lives not too far from the Philadelphia  International Airport. We used that setting to talk about the  importance of Infrastructure Week and reinvesting in our Nation's  infrastructure today and for tomorrow.   I mentioned in those remarks something that I am going to mention  here tonight: 100 years ago, there was no doubt that the United States  of America was the leader in the world when it comes to infrastructure.  Our roads, our bridges, our waterway systems, our mass transit, and our  gas lines were rated number one. Today, if you seek out the report of  the American Society of Civil Engineers--these are not Democrats; they  are not Republicans; they are really nonpartisan; they are civil  engineers--we are rated a D-plus.   The International Civil Engineers do not rate the United States of  America in the top 20 when it comes to infrastructure. That should  bother all of us, whether you are Democrat or Republican or Independent  or nonpolitical.   I have to say, as someone who believes in this country and believes  that we should always strive to be number one, not even being in the  top 20 bothers me, and it is simply not good enough. It is unwise  economic policy.   Part of why the 20th century became known as the American Century is  because we were the number one world leader when it came to our  infrastructure. How are we supposed to compete today and in the future  if we are not even in the top 10 or the top 20?   Mr. Speaker, for the needs of our infrastructure and for a myriad of  other issues related to this, I have cofounded the Blue Collar Caucus.  I have spoken on this House floor about the need for our country's  leaders to pay attention again to our blue-collar workers and our blue- collar economy.   I am so happy that, while tonight might be specifically about  infrastructure and that sliver of the overall blue-collar economy, I am  joined in this effort with my cofounder, the co-chairman of this  caucus, Marc Veasey of Texas. He will be speaking in a moment, as well  as a few other members of our caucus, about the importance of  reinvesting in our Nation's infrastructure and why that is critical to  our economy.   Mr. Speaker, if we really want to put Americans back to work and put  them back to work not in low-paid jobs but in good-paying jobs--family- sustaining jobs--the way to do it is to reinvest in our Nation's  infrastructure. I have many other things to say on this topic that I  will be saying throughout the next hour or so.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey), the  co-chairman of our Blue Collar Caucus. He is someone who has been a  real leader on this issue and feels just as passionately about it as I  do.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman. As my colleague was just mentioning, someone who has really  been a champion on these issues for decades, someone who intellectually  gets it, but also speaks on these issues not just with her head but  with her heart, and now as the climate in our country has, I think,  evolved on some of these issues, some people are recognizing that what  she was talking about for quite a while has been proven to be correct.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) who I  am honored to serve with.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank  Congresswoman Kaptur.   I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, at the very beginning of my remarks that we  kicked off infrastructure week on Monday morning at an event at  Philadelphia International Airport. One of those Members of Congress  who joined me for that event is the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Norcross), someone who practices what he preaches when it comes to the  issues that most concern the Blue Collar Caucus, and someone who can  really speak about infrastructure from many different perspectives.   I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. I should have mentioned when I  was introducing Mr. Norcross that he is the founder and the chairman of  the Building Trades Caucus. When he talked about that one electrician,  he was talking about himself. I understand from some of his former  electrician buddies that he was a top-rated electrician. He is someone  who has literally walked the walk.   It now gives me a real pleasure to introduce someone who has  represented Chicago and the Chicagoland area for a number of years,  someone who also gets it when it comes to the issues that most concern  the Blue Collar Caucus,  [[Page H4306]]  and then specifically what we are addressing tonight in the Special  Order, the need to reinvest in our Nation's infrastructure and put  people back to work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski).    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank  Mr. Lipinski for his words, and I appreciate his membership in the Blue  Collar Caucus.   In going through this entire discussion on infrastructure, because  there are so many things that we could talk about as part of this,  certainly I would encourage those interested in this topic to read the  report of the American Society of Civil Engineers. It is an  overwhelming case for why we need at least a $1 trillion infrastructure  plan really making up for decades upon decades of underinvestment in  our Nation's infrastructure. We could certainly talk about that and  talk about many different aspects of it.   In the few minutes that we have remaining, I want to talk about its  overall effect on our country. I am not talking about dollars and  cents. I am not talking about in a tangible way. I  [[Page H4307]]  mean something that is not tangible, that you can't exactly put your  fingers on; and that is the spirit of America.   Mr. Speaker, something that Americans have always been known for is  our eternal optimism. So much so that if you are friends with folks in  Europe and in other places, they would always gently make fun of  Americans for being so optimistic, for our undeniable, unending belief  in the power of the future; that tomorrow will always be better than  today.                                time  2030    Yet we know, Mr. Speaker, in recent times too few Americans are  feeling optimistic about our country's future. All the polls are  showing that. There has been a pretty dramatic turn in just the last  20, 30 years in how Americans feel about their own personal futures and  the future of this country.   Part of what leads to that, part of it is stagnant economic wages. I  have talked about that at length on the floor as part of a previous  Blue Collar Caucus hour. Part of that also, though, is the sense that  we are not building anymore; that 100 years ago we were building, that  we were launching the first airplane; that 50 years ago we were going  to the Moon.   In the Eisenhower era we were building the world's best highways. But  in today's day and age, we don't build anymore. That growth is  happening in Asia and in other parts of the world.   So just imagine what that would do not just for the economy, not just  for our infrastructure, but imagine what it would do for the spirit of  America if they saw a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill take hold, if  they saw our roads being rebuilt and new roads being built, if they saw  the investments that we can make in our mass transit and our intercity  rail.   I happen to represent a district smack dab in the middle of the  Northeast corridor. I met today in my office with the chairman of The  Northeast Maglev project, a project to take a technology that exists  today in Japan, build it here in the United States, and make it  possible that you could get from New York City to my district in  Philadelphia in a half hour, that you could get from New York City to  Washington, D.C., in 1 hour instead of the 3 hours that it takes today.  That would have a transformative effect. No other place in the world  has the maglev. Even in Japan, which has invented the technology, it is  only in a small snippet.   So making sure that we can move forward in a bipartisan way, actually  achieving something with Democrats and Republicans working together  with this administration, we would send such a signal beyond the  substance of the issue itself. I believe that we would have a dramatic  effect in improving the way that the American people feel about their  future and the future of our country.   Mr. Speaker, literally, over a million jobs will be created by a $1  trillion infrastructure bill. I wanted to speak about the importance of  making sure that those are high-paying jobs and why the Davis-Bacon Act  is linked to that, but knowing that my co-chairman will speak about  this issue, I am happy to turn that over to him now to speak about that  issue and others that are affected by this.   As it may be my last time speaking on this, I thank my colleagues for  their passion on this issue. I appeal to the White House, to President  Trump specifically: Please work with us on this issue. It is, I  believe, the single best way we could unite Democrats and Republicans  in the House and the Senate. We can get this done. It is something that  must get done. It would put millions of Americans--that is not an  exaggeration, by the way. It would put over a million Americans back to  work. It is critically needed for today and tomorrow, and I appeal to  this White House, even in this hyperpartisan, fractured time, to work  with us on this issue and finally, 4 months after taking office, unveil  your infrastructure plan.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey), my colleague and  co-chairman.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________     BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I move that the  House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 43 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, May 18, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
