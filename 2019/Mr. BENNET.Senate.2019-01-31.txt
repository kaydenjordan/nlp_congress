 Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the bravery and  service of PFC Floyd K. Lindstrom, a Colorado Springs World War II  veteran who has earned our Nation's highest military decoration, the  Medal of Honor. I also want to recognize the significance of February  3, 2019, which marks the 75th anniversary of his death. He was killed  in action at the battle of Anzio.   It is my pleasure to commend the efforts of the VA Eastern Colorado  Health Care System and Colorado's veterans community, which worked to  bring a Medal of Honor for display at the Lindstrom Colorado Springs  Community-Based Outpatient Clinic.   Much has been said about the battle that compelled Lindstrom to act  above and beyond the call of duty where he earned his place in the Hall  of Heroes. According to the citation, Lindstrom acted with  ``conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity'' in defeating a German  counterattack on a hill near Mignano, Italy, November 11, 1943. When  the enemy counterattacked, Lindstrom and his platoon were forced to  fall back to a defensive position. Unable to eradicate the enemy nest  from this position, Lindstrom fearlessly picked up his heavy machine  gun and ran up the hillside to gain a new position, only 10 yards away  from the enemy machinegun; yet again, Lindstrom was unable to reach the  gunners who were hiding behind a large rock. Lindstrom charged uphill  once more facing a steady stream of fire and killed both gunners with  his pistol. In this moment, Lindstrom embodied the true spirit of self- sacrifice.   Every day, men and women in uniform like Lindstrom heroically serve  on the front lines of our Nation's defense. I stand with Coloradans  today to honor his sacrifice and his memory.                            ____________________
