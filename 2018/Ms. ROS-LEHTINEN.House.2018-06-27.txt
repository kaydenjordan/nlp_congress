 Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to congratulate  Biscayne Engineering as it celebrates its 120th anniversary this year.   Located in my congressional district, Biscayne Engineering is one of  the oldest, if not the oldest, business in the city of Miami, and the  oldest land-surveying firm in south Florida.   Over 100 years ago, two partners, J.S. Frederick and W.E. Brown,  established the company just 2 years after the city was incorporated in  1898 and made the first official map of the city of Miami just a few  years later.   They were tasked with many important projects that were vital to the  community, including laying out the city of Miami's streets and other  parts of the greater county. One of its most prominent projects was  their role in developing Villa Vizcaya, a north Italian, 16th century- style villa built for James Deering.   Biscayne Engineering's responsibility included building and road  design, paving and drainage layouts, and the conservation and  preservation of the estate's national foliage. Today, Vizcaya Museum  and Gardens serves as a national historic landmark for visitors from  all over the world to come and enjoy.   Mr. Speaker, for decades, Biscayne Engineering has had its hands on  so many important projects that have helped shape south Florida into  the jewel that it is today. It has aided in the development of our U.S.  post office building; Federal courthouse; Bayside Marketplace; Fisher  Island; Star Island, which is the area's first manmade island; and even  assisted with the renovation of many of the historic art deco hotels in  Miami Beach, which is located in my congressional district.   Additionally, Biscayne Engineering has been involved with the Miami- Dade Transit Metromover, the Miami-Dade Public Library System, and the  Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts.   Biscayne Engineering has professionally partnered and worked with  [[Page H5752]]  private clients, local municipalities, counties, and State government,  and even played a larger role in the surveying and construction of two  of my alma maters, the University of Miami--go 'Canes--and Florida  International University--go Panthers. The list goes on and on.   Most importantly, its engineering surveyors, planners, and staff  uniformly promote the company's core values of integrity, honor, and  leadership in their work and, to this day, still continue the  commitment and the tradition of its founders.   So congratulations to Biscayne Engineering on its 120th anniversary.  I am always glad to celebrate anything that is older than I.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from  the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 2061) to reauthorize the North  Korean Human Rights Act of 2004, and for other purposes, with the  Senate amendment thereto, and to concur in the Senate amendment.
