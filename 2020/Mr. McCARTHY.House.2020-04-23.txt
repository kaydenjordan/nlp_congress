 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and  I thank him for his service.   Before I begin, I want to thank all of us for spending the time to be  here today.   Madam Speaker, I want to say to the families who are battling this  virus or to the families who have lost a loved one, if we would all  pause to think about that, not only did they lose a loved one, but they  couldn't even be near them or with them in their time of need. I want  them to know, from a Republican and Democrat side, for the entire  Congress: You are in our prayers, and you will stay in our prayers.   I also want to give a sincere thank-you to all of the essential  workers on the front lines of this crisis, not from the Republican  leader, but from a very grateful nation.   For the medical professionals, the doctors, the nurses, the  receptionists, we thank you for going to work. We know the fear that it  brings; we know the fear that it brings when you go home to your  families; and we are grateful.   To the farmers who make sure we have food grown in America that is  safe and the truck drivers who drive through the night to replenish the  stores that we walk in and keep our distance to have the food; to the  postal workers, the warehouse workers, the clerks inside those stores  who every day go to work, you are making a meaningful and measurable  difference in the lives of our entire Nation.    We will be forever grateful for those who kept us safe, kept us  healthy, and kept us fed. They deserve a government that strives to  meet that very same level of dedication.   That is the promise I will make: that we will bring the same  dedication that you bring to help others that you don't even know, and  we should rise to that occasion. This is a commitment we make to every  American. We will fight this virus together until we defeat it  together.   We did not ask for this virus. We did not invite it. It came from a  distant land. But together, we will defeat it, not only for our  country, but for the world.   To do that, Congress must act, and we will continue to act even if  some in this body want to play politics. Even if we get something held  up, we will stay at the table until we bring people together.   We want to put people before politics. Our entire effort will be  bipartisan. After all, public health and a strong economy are not a  Democrat or Republican issue.   Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, we watched the other side within our  own Speaker of the House interject politics where it did not belong:  into an oversight body of our necessary relief funds.   Now I want everybody to understand what the CARES Act did, the CARES  Act that got held up for more than a week. Yes, at the end of the day  it changed from that one Sunday night. Kennedy Center and others got  some more money, but it didn't change for what the work was going to be  done, for the people who needed it.   Yes, some people, unfortunately, got laid off because it was delayed.  It wasn't a bright moment for this body that week. But inside that  CARES Act, not only did we provide resources, we provided  accountability.   You see, every single committee in Congress has an oversight. We have  a committee just designed for oversight. But we wanted to make  something to make sure it was bipartisan, so we created three new  entities in the CARES Act just for oversight.   The first is called the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.  It is made up of inspectors general, not Republicans or Democrats. They  are independent and professional.   The second is a Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery. This  individual is appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and  lasts for 5 years. And we gave $25 million to make sure they had the  resources to make it happen.   But that wasn't enough. We created a third one. Now, this one is the  Congressional Oversight Commission, with commissioners. This body is  appointed by congressional leadership.   On our side of the aisle, we appointed French Hill. Why? First, he is  a statesman. He worked at the Treasury Department. He knows things  backwards and forwards, so they can't ever fool French Hill.   I was very excited when I heard, on the other side of the aisle, they  appointed Donna Shalala, the former Secretary of HHS.   You see, this body won't be weighted by one side or the other. All  four leaders, Republican and Democrat, appoint one, so it is equal.   And then you know what happens for a chair? Mitch McConnell and  Speaker Pelosi decide who to become the chair. I think the American  public says that is right. But they don't go and hide inside a corner.  They literally report to Congress every 30 days.   I was proud of that accomplishment. That is what America expects from  us: no politics, but the very best on there, and report back.   But today, when we come back because it was delayed, to give small  business the resources it takes to keep people employed, now we added a  little politics to the game. You see, today, we will vote on a new  Oversight Committee.   Will it be equal? Will it be the same number of Republicans and  Democrats like the congressional one? No.   Will it be the same when it comes to the inspectors general, where it  won't care about politics? No, sad to say not.   You see, this committee will be the only committee weighted  politically. There will be seven Democrats and five Republicans. This  committee was announced before they even told the mission of what this  committee should do. They even announced the chair of the committee.   Now, I respect the chair greatly, Madam Speaker. He has one of the  best political minds I know. Joe Biden will tell you that. You see, our  dear friend Congressman Clyburn should be credited with getting Joe  Biden the nomination. While he failed in all the other States, South  Carolina was critical.  [[Page H1940]]    He did politics very well in the endorsement. He turned the tide of  the Democrat nomination. And they will have a nominee, and a lot of  that will go to  Jim Clyburn, and he deserves the credit politically  for what he was able to accomplish.   We do not question his political abilities. He is the majority whip.  He knows how to gather votes. He knows how to make the political  argument. But, Madam Speaker, this is the same individual who said that  the pandemic presented the perfect opportunity to restructure things to  fit our own vision.   I do not question his appointment. I wonder why this committee. If  that was his view, why wasn't he put on the congressional oversight  that was equal with the number of Republicans and the number of  Democrats?   The public does not want to see politics. Why would we waste our time  bringing people back to create a political committee? I guess the vote  will tell us differently.   It is interesting to know why we are here. At 8:30 today, we actually  found the reason, 4.4 million more reasons why we are here. How many of  those 4.4 million would not have gotten a pink slip last week had we  listened more than 2 weeks ago, on April 7, when we said the program we  created that was so successful, that was able to do the number of loans  in 14 days that it took the SBA to do in 14 years, that there was such  a need out there that maybe we would overcome politics for that  one moment. Could it be too much to read that it was one simple page?    I thought there was a moment in time it would happen. I thought we  could say yes on a unanimous consent, this is a program we all had just  voted for and surely just 2 weeks before.   Yes, that was tough to get that bill through. Yes, we had to have it  held up on the other side. That was wrong that other millions were laid  off. But this was the moment to learn from that mistake on the other  side before. We did not learn. It was played again.   To those 4.4 million Americans who were laid off this week: Congress  owes you an apology. You did not have to have that happen.   To the small business owner: I understand this greatly. At age 20, I  created my first business. I know where you make these decisions. You  make these decisions on the kitchen table.   If you ever had a small business, you realize you are the first to  work, you are the last to leave, and you are the last to be paid. You  know those who work with you are not just employees, they are your  family. You know their children's names. You are there at their  weddings; you are there when they graduated; and you are proud of them.  You never want to have to say you are going to lay them off.   They put everything into their business to succeed, and government  told them they had to shut down for the health of the Nation. They made  a sacrifice. But they got sacrificed for politics last week.   Shame on this body.   I have listened to this debate thoroughly. I have listened to the  other side.                                time  1400    When you look at what we accomplished in those 14 days alone, we  saved 30 million jobs. We all could have put a tweet out today not  having to be in here and say we saved 34 million jobs, but, no, 4  million more lost because somehow people felt good with politics.   I listened to debate on the other side. Some actually said they don't  want to be here today: We shouldn't have folded and actually came  together. We should have used leverage even further, used that  political leverage to hold people up.   I have even seen some people on the other side of the aisle say they  loved to see it when the price of oil dropped, when no one had seen it  before, and the idea that millions in our energy industry are going to  get laid off, too.   It doesn't matter about politics. There will be Democrats and  Republicans both that get laid off.   Then I listened as we come back here, Madam Speaker, and I tried to  listen to the other side. I tried to understand: Why would you hold it  up? What is different?   I listened to the debates. I listened to the leadership talk. It was  amazing to me. In listening to it, the only thing I could think is what  Shakespeare would say: ``The lady doth protest too much, methinks.''   If you have to explain as hard as you can and spin with as much  political might as you can why you laid 4.4 million people off because  you felt better to tell Mitch McConnell that a program that put out  funds and saved 30 million jobs, that you were going to hold it up to  prove a point, that is not what I would want to hear in history.   Madam Speaker, as I said earlier, it is our responsibility to act, to  put our differences aside and do what is right for the American public.   Now more than ever, the American people deserve a Congress that acts  with leadership, dedication, and resilience. Anything we do in this  Chamber that deals with COVID should be bipartisan, from legislation to  deliberation to voting.   Yes, I stayed up until 2 a.m. to see what the majority wanted to put  forward. We all work hard to get here. We all almost have about the  same size districts, because every 10 years we take a Census to figure  that out.   Our constituents make a decision every 2 years to lend their voice to  the person they want to represent them. They did not lend their voice  to give that proxy to somebody else they cannot hold accountable. They  did not lend that voice to wait until 2 a.m. to change more than 200  years of history because somebody wanted to have more power than the  job of the majority themselves.   We are living in one of the greatest turning points in history. This  is not a time for indifference, selfishness, or division.   We are going to help America get through this. We are going to do  this together. In the end, we are going to be stronger, healthier, and  more united than ever before. Why? Because we are Americans, and that  is who we are.   This body will raise debates. This body plays politics many times,  but now is not the moment for politics. Now is not the moment to say:  Let's hold something up even if somebody is going to be punished,  because somehow I will get a political advantage.   Finally, when people come together, the statement should not be:  Let's hold more leverage, because it is okay because, when we come to  the floor, we will spin it and say it was not us.   But when we are long gone, history will write about this day. They  will write about that day on April 7 when America witnessed something  they have never seen before, when one stood before the Chamber in the  Senate and requested to add exactly what we are doing today to a  program to keep people hired in all the places we know and love in our  neighborhood, and one party sent two people, in the middle of COVID,  onto the floor to raise a simple hand to say they object. That was the  only thing holding the money up between the American public and those  4.4 million who unfortunately went to a different job today: the  unemployment line.   I don't know how anybody could be proud of that, but, Madam Speaker,  I am always an optimist. I know what has been before us. I know the  challenge. Today, we are going to display to the American public that  we can work just as those truck drivers, those medical professionals,  the checkers at my local Vons, or the paramedic who comes when the call  is requested. They are essential. I think it is essential to this  country to show we can do our job not in a partisan way.   So when the moment comes, you will have two votes. You have already  voted, all of us here in the Chambers, to add three more committees  that are bipartisan for the accountability of this money going forward.  The country is asking you to keep that together.   So you will have a choice. Now you can cast a new vote to put in  something partisan that we have never seen before with an individual  who is one of the best political minds around, who believes that this  virus is more about restructuring government in their view than solving  a problem. Then you are going to have another vote, a vote to continue  the funding that we already asked for more than 2 weeks ago.   This time, after twice holding up money from the American public, I  just ask all in this Chamber to learn from this. Let's not hold up  again our ability to help and work in a bipartisan manner to not only  open this Chamber, but to work for the American public and solve this  problem once and for all.
