 Mr. Speaker, on May 6, our north Texas community was left  scarred by the shooting at the Allen Premium Outlets. Nine people were  killed, and seven others were injured.   Today, I rise to talk about the bravery and service of Gicela Aleman,  a nurse and unsung hero, who that day was shopping at the outlet mall  with her daughter.   After the gunman opened fire, he severely wounded Preeti Patel, a  woman who was visiting family in north Texas and, like so many others,  was just trying to do some shopping.   Amidst the chaos and violence, Gicela sprang into action. Using her  training as a nurse, she grabbed Preeti and tried to slow her bleeding.  After seeing that ambulances were struggling to get through security,  she called the hospital and drove Preeti in her car with her daughter  to the hospital in time to save her life.   Preeti is alive today because of Gicela, an amazing story that  deserves a hero's praise. She and her daughter should not have had to  be heroes that day, but they were and are. We thank them for  representing the best of north Texas.                            ____________________
