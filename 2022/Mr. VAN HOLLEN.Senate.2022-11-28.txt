 As the majority leader said, I rise to honor the  stellar public service of Joan Kleinman, a senior member of my office  team, who retired in February after 19 years of working on behalf of  the people of Maryland and the United States.   Today, I would like to share with the Senate the depth of her  commitment to  [[Page S6818]]  the people of Maryland and her extraordinary legacy of good works, and  have her story inscribed in the pages of the Congressional Record so  that it might be a source of wisdom and inspiration for all time.   I first met Joan Kleinman in 1990, when I started working at the  Washington, DC, law firm of Arent Fox. Joan was also a fellow lawyer,  who was in charge of managing the staffing of cases in the litigation  department. For those of us who were litigation associates, that meant  we had better be on Joan's good side.   While I was practicing law at Arent Fox, I was also serving 3 months  a year in Maryland's part-time legislature. I knew Joan and her husband  Sam were raising their family in Montgomery County, and that Joan had a  keen interest in what was happening in our community.   At the time, I needed someone to be treasurer for my State senate  campaign committee, somebody who was really well organized, someone who  cared about our community, and somebody who I could trust completely.  Joan fit the bill. But would she do it?   I will confess that I was a little scared to ask her. I finally  mustered up the courage to knock on her office door, and luckily for  me, Joan had no idea what she was getting into, and she said yes.   The rest is history.   In 2001, with Joan's encouragement, I launched my campaign for the  House of Representatives. That campaign started at the kitchen table in  our home in Kensington and with my wife Katherine and a small cadre of  friends and dedicated volunteers, including Joan.   We knew it would be a tough fight, but we thought we had a shot. Our  campaign grew quickly. It was powered by hundreds of volunteers and  thousands of small contributions that kept coming in.   And, now, as treasurer of my congressional campaign, Joan would keep  track of the flurry of small contributions that arrived every week. It  was a ton of work. And Joan also worked on other aspects of the  campaign at the same time. As another veteran member of that  congressional campaign recently told me, ``for Joan, 3 a.m. was as much  a part of the normal workday as 3 p.m.''   We won that campaign, and Joan was key to our success. So when the  campaign ended, I had some very big decisions to make, including who  would run our congressional district office? I wanted someone who was  dedicated to our community, someone who could manage that important  job, and, again, someone whom I could trust completely. The person who  met all those requirements was Joan Kleinman.   I will admit--and we would all admit--that in those early days, we  were flying by the seat of our pants, and Joan was charged with  building out our constituent services program from the ground up. She  had to do all of the big picture things, like building relationships  with community stakeholders and forging bonds with Federal Agency  officials. She also had to bring on our entire constituent service team  and our community outreach team and develop an intake and tracking  system for constituent cases to make sure nothing would fall through  the cracks.   Joan built out our Maryland offices day after day, week after week,  month after month, until we became the gold standard in constituent  services. She instilled an ethic of persistence in our casework team to  ensure that we did everything--and I mean everything--in our power to  deliver results for our constituents.   I started receiving buckets of handwritten thank-you letters from  folks across our congressional district. People would stop me in the  street to thank me for our help. In fact, under Joan's leadership, our  office became so well known for our top-notch constituent services that  we started getting calls from people in all the other congressional  districts in our State.   We solved that challenge when I ran for the U.S. Senate, and, after  that campaign, Joan assumed responsibility for maintaining excellent  constituent services and outreach for all Marylanders. And that she  did.   The letters of appreciation we received from constituents are now  kept in large binders that filled up whole bookshelves. And now people  across our entire State stop me on a regular basis to acknowledge their  appreciation for something that Joan and her team did to help them,  which leaves me with one big question: How does that happen? How did we  grow from that empty office space after my congressional election in  2002 into an operation that is renowned for delivering amazing services  to people throughout our State? And the answer is Joan Kleinman.    Our story of success is the story of Joan Kleinman and the team that  she built, and I would like to reflect on the qualities that made that  happen. And there are many, but three big ones jump out.   No. 1, follow the golden rule. Joan established an ethic in the  office that every constituent--every one--was to be treated the way we  would want to be treated, with respect. She told our team that when  someone calls our office, handle the case like it is your mom calling  or your dad or your brother or sister. And it did not matter if the  problem related to a Federal issue, a State issue, a county issue, or  anything else. We were there to deliver results.   Joan knew how frustrating it could be to pick up the phone, call a  government office asking for help, only to be told to call a different  government office. So even if the issue fell in someone else's  jurisdiction, we connected them to ensure they could get the help they  needed.   Joan constantly reminded her team that if someone is calling us, it  is because they need help, and they had likely tried and exhausted all  other avenues to resolve the problem themselves.   Another of Joan's sterling qualities is real leadership. Now,  leadership can mean different things to different people, but you know  it when you see it. Joan is a strong leader and an excellent manager  because she leads by example. Like a good general who leads their  troops into battle from the front, Joan was always willing to take on  any task, large or small, for the success of the team. She worked crazy  hours. She read every letter. There was nothing that she would ask  others to do that she would not do first.   Her exemplary leadership also flowed from her emphasis on detail and  determination, a good combination. Good intentions about helping our  constituents are great, but good intentions without implementation and  accountability are empty promises. And good advocacy on behalf of  constituents requires constant coaxing and constant followup.   So let's be clear. Joan's team has always been civil in pressing  agencies and organizations to help our constituents, but her team has  also been firm, polite, but always persistent.   And Joan's leadership powered a sense of common purpose and joint  accomplishment. She would always highlight the achievements of members  of her team who served our constituents, from helping our veterans and  seniors obtain their benefits, to getting a passport approved so a  constituent could visit a sick loved one, to getting student loans  forgiven, to reuniting entire families, to helping folks avoid  foreclosure, and hundreds and hundreds of other matters.   Joan ensured that the success of our office belonged to everyone on  the team. She lifted everyone up. And on those days when this job can  be frustrating and discouraging--and the Presiding Officer knows we  face our share of those--on those days, reading the notes of  appreciation that Joan would circulate from constituents thanking us  for helping them in their greatest hour of need, or about how our work  had changed their life for the better, reminded me and everyone on our  team of the importance of public service and the good that we can do.   A third quality Joan has in abundance is compassion for those she  worked with. Like the good Jewish mother she is, Joan brought that same  sense of caring and nurturing to members of her family away from home,  her office family. She was often the first to reach out to new staff,  inviting them to lunch or coffee. She would circulate cartoons from the  New Yorker that particularly resonated, which mostly got chuckles. She  would laugh generously at other's jokes, even if they weren't all that  funny. And she spent hours mentoring and coaching each member of our  team. As a senior member of my staff remarked recently,  [[Page S6819]]  ``Joan believed in me more than I believed in myself.''   Her good counsel helped guide staff members while they worked in our  office and also served them well in their future endeavors. We are  especially grateful that Joan helped groom one member of our staff who  started as an intern under Joan's tutelage and then worked as a staff  member in our office before going to practice law, as Joan had once  done. This member of our team later returned to our office well  prepared to take on Joan's job when Joan left the office in February.   And Joan wasn't just a mentor on professional matters. She was also  there for staff members navigating the ups and downs of life. She has  been a consoler-in-chief in times of loss and a cheerleader-in-chief in  times of joy. Her warmth radiated in moments of hurt and of happiness.   And my office hasn't been the only beneficiary of Joan's love. It  also extends to members of her wonderful family, who have joined Joan  in the Senate Gallery this evening: her husband Sam, their daughter  Molly, their son Ari, and their son Ben, with his wife Saryn. It is a  joy to have them here for this special occasion.   I also want to give a shout-out to Joan's grandson, little Miles, who  is at home. And I want to salute Joan's late father and her amazing  mother Evelyn. Both of her parents helped raise her to be the woman she  is today, and her mother, in particular, has always been very vocal  about her thoughts about my cable TV appearances.   Thank you all for sharing Joan with us all those years.   And Joan's commitment also extends to her family of faith. Joan isn't  just a good Jewish mother to everyone. She is also a devoted member of  her synagogue. Her life has been driven by the spirit of ``tikkun  olam,'' repairing the world. And this year, for Rosh Hashanah, Joan was  invited by her congregation to speak from the pulpit and offer an  interpretation of religious text.   In her remarks, Joan shared this reflection:         I know we all want to be remembered for the personal       qualities that we value. But I think it's important that we       also seek to be remembered for how we respond to the       challenges of our times.    That isn't just a meditation on faith; that is a meditation on  service. In Joan's eyes, each of us has a responsibility to match our  strong words with even stronger deeds. We honor our values only through  our action. It isn't enough to envision a more perfect world. We need  to build it ourselves--brick by brick, hour by hour, good deed by good  deed.   Joan has spent her life realizing the promise of that creed, and  because of it, she leaves behind a legacy of good works that not only  fill up bookshelves but also fill up the lives and hearts of countless  people in our State of Maryland.   She has helped guide people in need. She has met the moment. She has  changed lives for the better. She has done so much good for so many  Marylanders for so many years that our State will always be better  because of it.   So on behalf of me and my entire family, on behalf of our entire  staff, past and present, on behalf of all the people in the State of  Maryland, we thank you, Joan Kleinman. Your legacy of good works has  left the world a much better place.   Joan, we love you.   Even though Joan has retired from our office, I will continue to seek  her counsel and relish her friendship for years to come.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, November 20, 2022, marked the 27th  World Day of Remembrance--WDoR--for Road Traffic Victims, commemorating  the millions of people killed and injured on the world's roads. It is  also a day to thank emergency responders for their role in saving  lives, to reflect on the impact of road traffic deaths and injuries on  families and communities, and to draw attention to the need for  improved legislation, awareness, infrastructure, and technology to save  more families from the tragedy of losing a loved one.   More than 1 million people die from road crashes every year, and tens  of millions are seriously injured. Road traffic crashes are the No. 1  killer of young people aged 15-29 and the eighth leading cause of death  among all people worldwide. Rochelle Sobel, president of the  Association for Safe International Road Travel, highlighted the gravity  of this issue and the imperative to fix it: ``Every 27 seconds,  somewhere in the world, a person dies in a road crash.''   On this 27th anniversary of World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic  Victims, it is important to remember the history and recommit to the  goals of this day. It was initiated in 1995 as the European Day of  Remembrance and quickly spread around the globe to countries in Africa,  South America, and Asia. In 2005, the UN General Assembly adopted  resolution 60/2, recognizing November 15 as the World Day of  Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. Since that time, the observance  of this day has continued to spread to a growing number of countries on  every continent.   Last year marked the start of the new Decade of Action for Road  Safety 2021-2030, during which the WDoR will highlight the reasons for  all of the necessary actions to be taken during this coming decade.  Indeed, the day has become an important moment to focus international  attention on this preventable epidemic and as an advocacy tool in  global efforts to reduce road casualties. As a result of the growing  awareness and global call to action that World Day of Remembrance for  Road Traffic Victims has generated, in September 2020, the United  Nations passed a resolution declaring the years 2021 to 2030 a new  Decade of Action for Road Safety. The declaration affirms the UN's  commitment to work vigorously to implement a new, ambitious agenda to  halve road crash deaths by 2030.   Additionally, the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.6 calls on  governments and their stakeholders, including NGOs and private  citizens, to address the personal, medical, and financial burdens  associated with road traffic deaths and injuries.   The devastation of losing a child, parent, sibling, partner, friend,  caregiver, or caretaker is immeasurable, as are the challenges of  caring for a permanently disabled loved. Road traffic crashes are  preventable, and so we owe it to our communities to work together so  that the hopes and dreams of our loved ones are not shattered on the  roads of the United States and the world. We must all take action to  prevent these avoidable tragedies and save lives.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 5796 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.
