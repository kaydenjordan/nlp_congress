 Mr. Speaker, in the United States of America, cash at a  political party should never be convertible to a warrant to spy on  American citizens.   Because I expect Republicans and Democrats will both be empowered at  some point in the future, we should be looking for bipartisan solutions  to revise the FISA process so that what happened to President Trump  never happens to a future American President.   I went looking for solutions, and I found that, in 2013, the  gentleman from California, the ranking member of the Intelligence  Committee, wanted to give the President of the United States the power  to appoint FISA judges. He argued that then judges would be more  ideologically diverse. They would come from different areas in the  United States, and they would be subject to Senate confirmation.   Today, I filed that legislation, and I would encourage the gentleman  from California to join me as a cosponsor so that we could advance  bipartisan legislation to improve the FISA process, because, Mr.  Speaker, if it was good enough to give President Obama these powers, it  is good enough to give President Trump these powers.                            ____________________
