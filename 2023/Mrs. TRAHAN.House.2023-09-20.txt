 Mr. Speaker, we have 10 days until House Republicans  force a catastrophic government shutdown; 10 days until the food  assistance that nearly 50 million Americans rely on, including 6  million women and children, is put in jeopardy; 10 days until seniors  struggling with the Social Security or Medicare issue can't get someone  on the phone to get their benefit or to keep their coverage; 10 days  until the loans small businesses depend on to pay their workers and  keep their doors open are delayed for who knows how long.                                time  1045    Mr. Speaker, we have seen this train wreck before.   Republicans shut down the government for over a month in 2018 while  they demanded billions in taxpayer funds for Donald Trump's border  wall, the same one that Mexico was supposed to pay for.   That shutdown lasted 35 days, hurting families and reducing our  economic output by $11 billion, much of which was never recovered. It  only ended after planes were grounded at major airports due to the  strain on air traffic controllers, who were working around the clock  with no pay to avert a major disaster.   Here we are again. It is Republican shutdown deja vu. Extreme MAGA  Republicans are once again holding the American people hostage in  exchange for dangerous policies and a politically motivated  impeachment.   You don't have to take my word for it. Just listen to the demands  from my colleagues across the aisle. One of our colleagues, a  Congresswoman from Georgia, tweeted that she would not vote to fund the  government if Congress doesn't pursue an impeachment inquiry against  President Biden. Others are trying to roll back abortion protections  for women serving in our military regardless of where they are  stationed.   To pretty much no one's surprise, Speaker McCarthy has folded like a  cheap suit on every single one of their demands. That still hasn't been  enough to get Republicans on board with this new plan, a breakthrough  that would slash funding for the home heating assistance that thousands  of families in my home State of Massachusetts depend on each winter;  eliminate access to Head Start and childcare programs for nearly  200,000 children nationwide; and cut off access to housing vouchers for  20,000 veterans and 90,000 seniors, pushing them closer to  homelessness.   This deal hashed out by Republicans for Republicans was a disaster  from the start, and the fact that it fell apart even quicker than it  came together is embarrassing for the majority of this Chamber.   It is amateur hour, but the stakes are too high, and the American  people deserve better.   Mr. Speaker, there are 212 Democrats standing by whenever your party  is ready to get serious and do what needs to be done. There are 212  votes standing by to keep our government open, to keep veterans housed,  to keep our children fed.   I encourage Speaker McCarthy and my colleagues across the aisle to  avert this disaster before it is too late. Put a clean funding package  on the floor, and let's pass it together.   That is our job. It is your job, and the American people expect you  to do it.                            ____________________
