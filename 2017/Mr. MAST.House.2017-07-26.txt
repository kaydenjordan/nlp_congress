 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today because I represent the Treasure  Coast of Florida, and it is facing an environmental disaster that,  sadly, communities across the Nation face, from down along the  Mississippi, up in Michigan, to the east coast of Florida. We face  these disasters year after year. This disaster is toxic algal blooms.   The water that is discharged into my area comes out of Lake  Okeechobee and goes into the Treasure Coast of Florida. It puts people  out of business, kills sea life, sea grass, manatees, and fish. It  makes people sick. It destroys home values and businesses. It is all  because of a guacamole-like toxic algal bloom that can occur year after  year. This can't continue. Our communities can't wait any longer. Our  lagoons, beaches, and water have to be restored.   My amendment increases the Aquatic Plant Control Research Program  within the Army Corps of Engineers' Engineer Research and Development  Center, or ERDC, by $500,000 above the appropriated level.   The Aquatic Plant Control Research Program is the only federally  authorized research program directed to develop the kind of technology  for management of nonindigenous aquatic plant species, like these toxic  blooms.   When I talk to the Corps about the issue in my community and the  communities across the country, I am told that they don't have the  technology to scale the type of equipment that cleans out fish tanks to  the level that we are facing in these large bodies of water.   This amendment replaces the $500,000 shortfall from last year's  appropriation and makes important investments in the research in order  to ensure that the Army Corps has all of the information required to  develop that technology that can scale the size needed to successfully  complete their mission.   Mr. Chair, I urge immediate passage, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
