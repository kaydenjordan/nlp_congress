 Mr. Speaker, my heart is with the families and the loved  ones of our colleagues, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, and all  those injured yesterday: Crystal Griner, David Bailey, Matt Mika, and  Zack Barth.   Steve, we are all praying for you and your wife, Jennifer, and your  children. We wish you a happy Father's Day and a full recovery.   To the U.S. Capitol Police, you showed yesterday why you are the best  at what you do.   David Bailey and Crystal Griner, without hesitation, leaped into  action. Had they not done that, the story could be very different  today. We are grateful for your service yesterday and every day.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 2 o'clock and 26 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Friday, June 16, 2017, at 9:30 a.m.                            ____________________
