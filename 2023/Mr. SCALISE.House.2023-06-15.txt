 Madam Speaker, I, too, want to thank our guest chaplain,  Dan Borne. For so many years, over 30 years, I have known Dan and known  him wearing many different hats. Anybody in Louisiana who has  encountered a number of different interests, whether it is  philanthropic, religious, business, you have run into Dan Borne.   I know Dan through the Louisiana Chemical Association, as the head,  representing thousands of workers throughout Louisiana, making things  that all of us use in our everyday life and making sure that those  great men and women have the ability to do their jobs with the pride  that they have. That was the first role in which I really got to know  Dan Borne and his dear friend, Greg Bowser.   Also, of course, as an LSU alum, when you are in Tiger Stadium,  everybody knows that voice. When you hear the voice of Dan Borne, it is  just one that gets people excited, most people get excited. There are  other people in Tiger Stadium that might not be as excited when they  are on the other end of what happens in Death Valley, but Dan is the  one who really keeps things going as the voice of the LSU Tigers. Then,  of course, there is his role as a deacon and also a spokesperson for  the diocese of Baton Rouge.   Dan Borne wears many hats, but he wears them all with great pride and  distinction. He carries himself the way all of us should, a true man of  God.   We are honored to have Dan here with us today. I am glad he was able  to open the House up in prayer today. God bless him.                            ____________________
