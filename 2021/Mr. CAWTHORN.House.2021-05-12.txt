 Madam Speaker, the energy crisis created by the Russian  hack of the Colonial Pipeline is impacting my district in the worst  possible way. Gas prices have skyrocketed. Lines are forming all across  the great State of North Carolina.   Madam Speaker, I am here today to say what few politicians will, but  what most of the Americans believe. We were attacked. We were attacked  by a foreign entity, and the current administration has done nothing in  response.   When our leadership is weak, our Nation suffers.   You don't believe me?   Take a look outside. Our border has dissolved into ruin, gas prices  are skyrocketing, and the dollar is worth less and less each day.  Israel is burning, China is rising, and Russia attacks our homeland.   All the while, the American people wonder when this administration  will finally grow a backbone and stand firm against a growing wave of  international tyranny. President Biden is weakening our defenses. The  wolves are at the gates, and America's leader is asleep at the wheel.   But you know what?   Thank heavens we have a President who doesn't tweet mean things  anymore.
