 Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to rise in the  people's House to honor Selena Quintanilla-Perez, an icon and  trailblazer from south Texas whose music has transcended borders,  cultures, and generations.   Her unique blend of cumbia, Tejano, and pop has captivated audiences  around the world and introduced my community's culture to millions of  Americans over the last 30 years.   Selena's seamless mix of Spanish and English lyrics, combining  Mexican folklore and R&B, perfectly captured the richness of a  beautiful culture that is shared by millions of us who are both fully  American and proud of our Mexican heritage.   Selena's music is essential to the soundtrack of our lives. That is  why I am submitting, for nomination, her album, ``Amor Prohibido,'' to  the Library of Congress for historical preservation in honor of her  birthday, which was yesterday.   May Selena's legacy be forever engraved in our hearts and our  Nation's history.                            ____________________
