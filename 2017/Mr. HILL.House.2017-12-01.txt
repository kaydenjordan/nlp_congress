 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. I want to congratulate  my friend, Andy Barr, for bringing this bill back to the floor of the  House to be on the side of the consumer, to be on the side of  affordable choices, to be on the side of truly affordable housing in so  many areas where there is no alternative.   Many in the urban areas of our country, the East and West Coast  elites who make financial policy, have no understanding of living out  in the country. They don't realize we don't have stick-built  alternatives in many rural areas of our country.   As a former community banker down in Ashley County and Chicot County,  Arkansas, the most affordable, best alternative for many of our  families is a manufactured home, working with a relative for a plot of  land. Dodd-Frank has made that unaffordable and unavailable.   And to that point, I want to say I got a letter from a pal at the  Army National Guard who said: I was turned down on a loan that would be  cheaper, larger, and better for my family.   It was better than the house, the 60-year-old house, that he was  renting. That is why we need this bill, and I thank the chairman for  bringing it to the floor today.
