 Mr. Speaker, following a summer of horrific gun  violence, we can no longer accept congressional failure to take  concrete action. Mass shootings in Gilroy, El Paso, Dayton, and Odessa,  as well as the unceasing daily gun violence in communities across our  country, including close to my home in Chicago, define the summer of  2019. I hope the fall of 2019 will be remembered as the time when our  leaders finally began to address our Nation's gun violence epidemic.   The simple fact is, this House already passed bipartisan bills on  universal background checks and closing the Charleston loophole. This  is commonsense legislation that more than 90 percent of Americans  support. It would have closed the loophole that the Texas shooter used  to acquire his weapon.   But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell astonishingly continues to  carry the water for the NRA and refuses to even allow a simple up or  down vote on this bill. We need to tell Mr. McConnell and the NRA that  enough is enough. People are needlessly dying. The victims and their  loved ones deserve more than mere thoughts and prayers. Congress must  act now.                            ____________________
