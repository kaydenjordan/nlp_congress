 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am pleased, at long last, to speak on  the floor today in support of four protocols amending the tax  conventions between the United States and Spain, Switzerland, Japan,  and Luxembourg.   I have long been a strong supporter and proponent of these tax  protocols and worked to advance them across multiple Congresses. In the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I voted to advance Japan and Spain  protocols three times and voted four times to advance the protocols  with Luxembourg and the Swiss Confederation. I am pleased that, after  too many years of waiting, the majority leader has finally decided to  take up these protocols.   I am a strong believer in the benefits these treaties provide our  country. They play a critical role in relieving U.S. citizens and  companies of double taxation, encouraging foreign investment in the  United States, and enforcing U.S. tax law on those who seek to evade  it. There are no downsides to these treaties.   As I conveyed directly to Secretary Mnuchin, the Treasury  Department's initial interaction on these treaties without consulting  the Foreign Relations Committee was completely inadequate. This botched  effort resulted in a completely avoidable delay in taking up these four  protocols. However, I am pleased that Treasury responded quickly to my  concerns, including providing a written commitment on behalf of the  administration that the Foreign Relations Committee chair and ranking  member would be consulted on any changes to the model tax treaty prior  to negotiations based on a new model or new model provisions.  Therefore, I support moving the tax treaties as expeditiously as  possible and urge my colleagues to support them.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
