 Madam Speaker, as a young woman in Texas, I  marched with hundreds of other women in support of the equal rights  amendment. Today, I stand with all my colleagues here to affirm our  support for women's equality.   Women are behind some of the Nation's greatest achievements. We flew  across the Atlantic, fought for civil rights, set athletic records,  sent men to space, and then went there ourselves. We have forged our  own paths and put many cracks in the glass ceiling, but there is still  much more to do.   ``Women deserve equality.'' ``Las mujeres merecemos igualdad.''   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.J. Res. 17.
