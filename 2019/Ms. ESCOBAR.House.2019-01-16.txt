 Madam Speaker, today, on the 26th day of the Trump  [[Page H616]]  shutdown, I rise on behalf of Lauren, an El Pasoan in my district on  the U.S.-Mexico border.   Lauren is married to one of our DEA agents, and he is one of nearly  10,000 Federal employees in El Paso. Every day, her husband puts his  life on the line to serve El Pasoans and our Nation, and, last week, he  missed his paycheck.   Lauren describes the shutdown as discouraging and scary. They are  struggling to make ends meet for their family of three small children.   Lauren and her family, and the hundreds of thousands of Federal  employees in America, should not have to face this dire reality and  don't deserve this treatment.   We must reopen the government now and give our public servants the  pay they have earned for their honorable work.   And I will repeat what I know to be true: The border has never been  more secure or safer.   Madam Speaker, we, in the House, have voted on a number of bipartisan  bills to reopen the government. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to  come together, end this absurdity, have some compassion, and do the  same.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Raskin for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule for H.R. 268, the  Disaster Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2019.   This bill would provide over $12 billion in necessary funds to help  affected communities recover from natural disasters, including Puerto  Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and farmers who  lost crops due to Hurricanes Michael and Florence.   I would like to thank my colleagues for introducing the underlying  bill and for making in order an amendment to prevent these funds from  being used to plan, develop, or construct a new border barrier.   Sadly, this amendment is necessary because this administration wants  to divert critical disaster aid meant for other projects to go toward  border wall construction.   The reality is that our country needs help recovering from some of  the greatest natural disasters we have seen in our lifetimes. Puerto  Rico is still recovering from the devastating aftermath of Hurricane  Maria, a storm that claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 people.   I am glad to see that the underlying text provides $600 million in  disaster nutrition assistance to the island where over 3 million U.S.  citizens reside.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, the  underlying text, and this important amendment. Let's hold this  administration accountable and ensure they do not deceive the American  people by pulling a bait-and-switch.    Madam Chair, I thank Chairman McGovern for yielding and  for offering this amendment.   Madam Chair, I rise today in support of amendment No. 2, which would  prevent funds in the underlying bill, made available for the Army Corps  of Engineers or the Department of Homeland Security, from being used  for the planning, development, or construction of any new physical  barrier along the southwest border.   Sadly, this amendment is necessary because this administration wants  to divert critical disaster relief funds meant for other projects to go  toward border wall construction.   The reality is that our country needs help recovering from some of  the greatest natural disasters that we have seen in our lifetime.   Let's ensure that our Nation has the necessary tools to recover,  rebuild, and mitigate future natural disasters.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to  hold this administration accountable and ensure that they do not  deceive the American people by pulling a bait-and-switch.
