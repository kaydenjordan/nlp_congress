 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  ``Fighting Homelessness with Services and Housing Act.'' This bill  would help address our Nation's current homelessness crisis by  establishing a new Federal grant program to increase support for  comprehensive services paired with housing.   As we have seen with the growing diversity of our homeless  populations--families with children, veterans, individuals with mental  health conditions, people who simply could not keep up with increases  in rent--our Nation's homelessness crisis is not going to resolve  itself on its own.   According to the most recent data available from the U.S. Department  of Housing and Urban Development, there are more than 552,000 homeless  individuals and families in the United States. Nearly 25 percent of  this population is in California, with approximately 129,972 homeless  people sleeping on the streets on any given night.   In a Nation as prosperous as ours, we can and we must do better. Our  city, county, state, and Federal governments must work hand-in-hand  with the non-profit and private sectors to establish collaborative  efforts to significantly address the issue of homelessness.   The good news is that we have seen a model that works: supportive  housing can truly stabilize an individual or family and change their  life. Supportive services such as mental and physical health care,  substance abuse treatment, education and job training, and life skills  such as financial literacy are critical components. Paired with  intensive case management, supportive housing models make a difference.   One success story is the Downtown Women's Center in Los Angeles. This  shelter allows homeless and formerly homeless women to transform their  lives through a combination of permanent, supportive housing and  workforce development. This would not be possible without the Center's  partnerships with the City of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles County  Department of Health, and other critical stakeholders. I've visited the  Center, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same to see why this  model works.   It will take a significant investment to solve the current  homelessness crisis. The ``Fighting Homelessness with Services and  Housing Act'' authorizes a new Federal funding grant program of $750  million per year, subject to annual appropriations. Grantees must serve  individuals or families who are homeless or at risk of becoming  homeless by providing housing paired with a comprehensive set of  services, and they must provide a 25 percent match for any Federal  funds received.   Because each individual and every community is unique, the grant  program created by this bill would be flexible in order to work in any  region or for any homeless population. This bill supports the great  work already being done across the country, allowing local governmental  entities and non-profit organizations to expand their capacity and  ensure a greater reach by putting Federal dollars where they will make  the most effective impact.   This bipartisan legislation is supported by a wide coalition of local  government, housing, health, and child welfare organizations, including  the Child Welfare League of America, Children's Defense Fund,  Corporation for Supportive Housing, Mayors and CEOS for U.S. Housing  Investment, National Alliance to End Homelessness, National Association  of Counties, National Education Association, National League of Cities,  National Low Income Housing Coalition, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic  Social Justice, and Treatment Communities of America.   I particularly want to thank Senator Murkowski for working with me on  this important issue. I hope our colleagues will join us in  cosponsoring the bill and moving it through the Senate. Thank you Mr.  President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):   S. 959. A bill to establish in the Smithsonian Institution a  comprehensive women's history museum, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Rules and Administration.
