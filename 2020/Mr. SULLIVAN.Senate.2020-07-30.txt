 Mr. President, it is Thursday afternoon, and normally I  come down to the Senate floor to talk about the Alaskan of the Week-- what I call that person. It is one of my favorite things to do in the  Senate. But I just witnessed something so remarkable and disturbing  that I actually want to come down to the Senate floor and explain what  just happened on the floor because I think a lot of people probably  missed it, if they are watching at home, and maybe didn't understand  it. There was a lot of discussion going on here. Let me just say that  the Senate minority leader from New York just objected to extending the  current level of unemployment insurance in the CARES Act--$600 a week  to help American workers who had been laid off due to the pandemic. He  just objected to that and stopped legislation that was moving on the  floor to extend unemployment insurance for another week. Let me repeat  that: The Senate minority leader of the U.S. Senate, when we are moving  in good faith, as we are discussing and negotiating bills here, one  element of CARES that is going to expire at the end of this month,  unemployment insurance in the CARES Act, the Senate minority leader  just blocked that from happening. Who knows why, but there will be  millions of Americans, in 2 days, who will lose that benefit, and the  Senate minority leader just blocked it.   I sure hope our friends in the media write this story because that is  exactly, exactly, exactly what happened.   Let me describe in a little bit more detail. As you would expect in a  democracy, in the U.S. Senate, we have been debating, working on, and  negotiating a new relief package due to the pandemic. In March, we  passed unanimously in this body the CARES Act to try to bring relief to  our fellow Americans whom we knew were going to be hurting from this  pandemic. We didn't have a crystal ball on how long relief could last  or should last for unemployment, for businesses, for small businesses,  for families, for hospitals, for schools, or for fishermen. So we are  now working on, as you expect in a democracy, what we view as the  appropriate next level because this has extended longer than any of us  thought, and the impacts are very significant. That is what we are  doing here.  [[Page S4626]]    The Republicans put forward the Health, Economic Assistance,  Liability Protection, and Schools Act--HEALS. I think it is a good  bill. It is not a perfect bill, but it has very significant--very  significant resources for schools, for hospitals, and for families.   When I was home in Alaska and taking calls with my fellow Alaskans  and heard what their priorities are and heard what they said was really  important for them to have in any kind of the next relief package, part  of my job is to listen and try to work hard to get that done.   There is a lot in the HEALS Act that is exactly what my constituents  have been pressing for, what they need, and what I believe they need.   Let me give you a couple of examples: more flexibility for States and  local governments on how to use the CARES Act funding that they already  have, a very high priority; additional funds for our fishermen. The  Presiding Officer knows how important that is, being from Florida. The  original CARES Act had $300 million. That was a provision I got into  the CARES Act for fishermen. It is not enough but something important  to this really critical part of the Alaskan, American, and Florida  economies. The HEALS Act has $500 million in it because they have been  hit so hard. There is economic assistance in terms of another round of  paycheck protection for small businesses whose revenues have been  crushed, like in the tourism industry. Again, that is something my  constituents have been asking about. Allowing 501(c)6s to access the  PPP, that is in there. Allowing certain PPP borrowers, like fishermen  and seasonal businesses to request an increase in loan amounts due to  the changes that were in the interim final rules that came out of the  Treasury Department, that is in there. Dramatic expansion of testing,  more funding for vaccine development, everyone wants that. Securing  supply chains for crucial medical equipment and critical minerals, many  of which we have in Alaska, that is all in there. It is a pretty good  bill. It is not perfect, but it is a pretty good bill.   The competing bill, you may have seen, you may have read in the paper  a couple of months ago, came from the House--the so-called Heroes Act.  It is a behemoth in terms of the pricetag, and it has some things that,  actually, are similar to the HEALS Act: school funding, hospitals. It  has other things that aren't in the HEALS Act, some things that I think  would be completely unnecessary: a huge tax break for some of the  richest Americans in the HEROES Act. Yes, that is in there. Economic  impact payments for illegal immigrants--I don't think that is a  priority right now, at least not for my constituents. An overt attack  on Alaska Native organizations, dozens and dozens of them, Alaska  Native corporations, stripping them of any Federal funds they receive  in the CARES Act, that is in the House-passed Heroes Act. Trust me,  that will never pass on the Senate floor because I will not allow it.  But that is in there. It is a highly inappropriate attack on 20 percent  of the population in my State.   But here is the point: These are starting points. This is what  happens in the Senate--or at least I thought these were starting  points.   But I guess I was wrong because, when my good friend from Arizona  came down and said we are having negotiations on these bills, we are  having negotiations on how and to what degree to extend unemployment  insurance from the Federal Government--she put forward a bill that we  all agreed to that said, because we are negotiating right now and the  one thing in the CARES Act that expires at the end of this month is  unemployment insurance, let's extend it--at the current level.   It is right now. Let's extend it so the people who are relying on it  can have something for the next week while we continue to negotiate and  debate. That is very reasonable. That happens all the time here.   The Senate minority leader came down, and he blocked it. He blocked  it. If you are not going to be receiving a check next week, there is  one person you can blame. What did he say when he blocked it?  Remarkably, he said, in essence, if the other side doesn't accept the  entire Heroes Act--that bill that I just talked about that attacks  Alaska Natives--then I am going to block everything. That is what  happened on the Senate floor like an hour ago.   No, that is not working in good faith. I am sure that the minority  leader believes that the national media will not blame him. He is  probably right, but it should. But it should.   If you are one of the millions of Americans who are worried about  this issue because you are out of work, we just put forward a very  simple compromise: As we continue to negotiate, we will continue the  unemployment levels paid to Americans that were in the CARES Act for  another week, at the levels that currently exist.   It was blocked by the Senate minority leader, without a real  explanation, essentially saying take our Nancy Pelosi $3.5--actually,  $4 trillion bill or nothing. I sure hope the media reports on what just  happened. I don't have faith that they will, but that is exactly what  happened.   We are facing a national crisis. We don't always come together in  immediate agreement on everything, but what we have seen in the last  several months is that we have come together in the Congress. These  bills haven't been perfect. The bills I just described--the HEALS or  Heroes--aren't perfect, but what they require is compromise and working  together.   When you can't get to a spot in a certain amount of time, you look at  areas where, OK, this is going to expire right now--that is pretty  important--so let's extend it for a week or two. That happens all the  time here. People do it in good faith.   What we just saw was bad faith. What we just saw, in my view, was the  Senate minority leader taking hostage this issue, hoping that his  friends in the national media will somehow blame us. I think, if you  are telling the truth and you just watched what happened on the Senate  floor, that is going to be hard to do. My view is we have to come  together in good faith to help our fellow Americans, my fellow  Alaskans, many of whom are still really, really hurting. We have a  Senator from Arizona who tried to do that just an hour ago on the  floor, and it was rejected.   There are going to be a lot of people next week who are going to be  hurting because of this, and I hope they accurately report why they are  hurting, what just happened, and that is not the spirit of compromise  that we are going to need to get through this pandemic.
