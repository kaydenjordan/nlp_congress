 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Louisiana for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues on this House floor  and remember our good friend, the dedicated dean of the House,  Congressman Don Young, from the great State of Alaska.   Don had a fire in him. He exuded joy in everything he did. And when  he walked into a room, you knew he was there.   Don was passionate in his desire to serve the people of Alaska, and  for almost 50 years, he did just that. Don loved this House and chaired  two of our key committees, Natural Resources and Transportation.   As a freshman, yes, I, like, so many new members, sat mistakenly in  his seat. The big bear growled me away.   Once during a vote series, I voted ``no'' on a Don Young bill  building roads in Alaska and walked out of the Chamber. Three minutes  later, the whip team is texting me. Representative Ann Wagner is  texting me: Don Young is screaming your name on the House floor. He  wants to know why you voted ``no''. I went to dinner.   The next morning, I found him and asked if he still needed me. He  asked why I was a ``no''. I told him, and he smiled with that great big  smile and asked if I could vote for his Alaskan fishing bill the next  week. I said, yes, you bet, Mr. Chairman. You bet.   I would like to extend my condolences to Anne, his children, and all  who loved him. Don was a great man who will not be forgotten. May his  life of service be an example to us all.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Louisiana.  [[Page H3956]]
