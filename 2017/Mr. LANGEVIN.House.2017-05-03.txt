 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the omnibus  spending agreement that is before us today, which will finally fund the  government for the remainder of fiscal year 2017. The bill before us is  not a perfect bill, but it represents a good bipartisan compromise.   Mr. Speaker, we need to engage in good faith discussions about our  values and priorities, not participate in posturing to social media. It  is my hope that my congressional colleagues on both sides of the aisle  will continue the constructive tone that this agreement represents.   This fiscal year 2017 agreement delivers on many priorities important  to Rhode Island. It restores the year-round Pell Grant Program or  summer Pell eligibility, allowing summer students to receive Pell grant  funds to help them finish their degrees on time.   Rather than slash funding as the President had requested, this  compromise also adds $2 billion in funding to the National Institutes  of Health, which conducts vital research in our efforts to treat and  cure catastrophic diseases and drives innovative economic development.   On the defense side, this agreement funds vital national security  programs, including the continued procurement of Virginia class  submarines and ongoing development of the new Columbia class, work that  I am proud to say happens at Quonset Point in my district.   I want to thank all those involved in these negotiations on both  sides of the aisle for their commitment to achieving a good faith  compromise that will keep the government open and working for the  American people. I hope we can continue on a similar bipartisan  agreement as we plan for the next fiscal year.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory  of General Amedeo ``Armie'' Merolla--a dedicated patriot, a passionate  legal mind, a community leader in Rhode Island, and someone whom I was  proud to call a dear friend.   Armie's distinguished military career spanned 36 years, during which  time he served in the United States Marine Corps and the Rhode Island  National Guard. He served as assistant adjutant general for the State  and retired as the first brigadier general of Italian heritage in the  history of the Rhode Island National Guard.   As an accomplished attorney for more than 60 years, he provided legal  counsel and advice to several public officials--myself included--and  maintained a very successful private practice.   As a tireless community leader, he served as chairman of the Warwick  School Committee and held leadership positions in local branches of  charities and children's organizations. Above all, he prioritized his  family, whom he loved dearly and to whom he devoted his life's work.   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to remember Armie on the floor today,  just as it was to consider him a trusted friend and adviser. Mr.  Speaker, he made a difference, and he will be greatly missed.                            ____________________
