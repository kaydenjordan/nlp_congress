 Mr. Speaker, my district lies just outside of Washington,  D.C., in northern Virginia, and is home to tens of thousands of Federal  workers and contractors. Since I was sworn in on Thursday, I have  received hundreds of calls, emails, and social media outreach from my  constituents whose lives are upended. I would like to read one of those  messages now.         I am a Federal employee who used the last of his       discretionary funds this week to attend his grandfather's       funeral. Now I'm preparing to file for unemployment. My wife       has to try to get a job despite her severe and crippling       disability, and we've had to return some of the Christmas       presents for ourselves, our four-year-old son, and our six-      year-old daughter.        We've always lived paycheck to paycheck because of the high       cost of living in northern Virginia, and we don't have the       option to take out loans because we incurred so much debt       moving to the area and dealing with our family's medical       bills.        Right now I am contacting our utilities and mortgage       company to see if we can push out the deadlines for bills. I       gave up military service to join the civil service and have       been so disheartened to see the lack of respect for our       Federal employees.    Mr. Speaker, we owe our Federal employees better than this. I call on  the Senate and the President to do the right thing and end this  shutdown now.                            ____________________
