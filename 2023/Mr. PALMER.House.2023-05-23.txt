 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Johnson for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 11, a resolution  nullifying the EPA's overreaching rule on American trucks.   Mr. Speaker, the American people cannot afford yet another misguided  Biden policy. From the gas pump to the grocery store, costs have  skyrocketed because of this administration. Now, in their infinite  wisdom, they have concluded American trucks need to be regulated with  the most stringent standards in our Nation's history, all in the name  of the radical, climate-alarmism agenda.   Almost every item found in the grocery store, pharmacy, restaurant,  or business is transported on a heavy-duty truck. If this regulation  takes effect, Americans will see essential items such as food,  clothing, and school supplies cost even more.   It is sad the Biden administration and regulators at the EPA decided  their devotion to radical climate goals justify increased suffering for  the American people. However, it is a price they are willing to make  you pay to achieve their goals. Regulations like this will diminish the  quality of life for constituents like mine.   Supporters of this regulation might argue the costs of compliance  would be minimal. They would be wrong. The EPA's own analysis found  that it would cost over $8,000 per truck. Furthermore, the bureaucrats  at the EPA have a history of underestimating the costs of their heavy- handed regulations.   In 2001, they estimated the cost of their nitrogen oxide regulation  to be $5,000 per truck, but the market analysis found it to exceed  $21,000. The American Truck Dealers Association agrees the EPA estimate  is far too low and estimated the true costs to be around a $42,000  increase per truck, which would mean more inflation.   Mr. Speaker, the American people should not suffer higher costs  because of demands made by climate activists. We must nullify this  regulation. I support this resolution for the benefit of the American  people.                                time  1500
