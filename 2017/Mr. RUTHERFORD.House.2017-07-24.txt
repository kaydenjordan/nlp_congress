 Madam Speaker, I rise today also in strong support of  H.R. 3218, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of  2017.   When our brave men and women put on the uniform to protect our  Nation, we have a sacred responsibility to provide them and their  families with certain opportunities in repayment for their services and  sacrifice.   As a new generation of servicemembers are returning from the  battlefield, we as a nation have needed to reevaluate how we better  help our veterans succeed back home. This important legislation is an  example of how that success for veterans can be achieved.   As a result of the hard work of many veteran service organizations,  the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and countless veteran advocates,  H.R. 3218 makes many important reforms to the GI Bill to improve  veterans' access to education.   One reform that I would like to highlight is a provision that I  introduced as a stand-alone piece of legislation earlier this year  called the Julian Woods Yellow Ribbon Program Expansion Act.   Madam Speaker, under current law, dependents and surviving spouses of  those killed in action who attend college on the Fry Scholarship are  not eligible for the Yellow Ribbon Program. The Yellow Ribbon Program  helps to cover the cost of schools with tuition above the level of what  the GI Bill covers.                                time  1515    Since the dependents and spouses of those killed in action are not  currently eligible for this program, they are, in fact, limited in  their educational opportunities.   I thank the committee, Chairman Roe, and Ranking Member Walz for  including my bill in this legislation, and it is just one of many  reforms that this package makes.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues' support.
