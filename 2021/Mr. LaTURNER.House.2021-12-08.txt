 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, last year, Congress set aside $8 billion in the CARES  Act for Tribal Governments to spend on pandemic-related expenses.  However, much of this $8 billion was held up in litigation and  distributed to Tribes only 4 short months ago, more than a year after  the funds were originally appropriated.   This money is supposed to be used by December 31, 2021, about 3 weeks  from today. But it is irresponsible to expect Tribal Governments to  spend all this money within a few months of receiving it.   This bill would extend the deadline an additional year, giving Tribes  more time to responsibly allocate these funds and best serve their  people.   I thank my colleagues, Representative Young of Alaska and  Representative Cole of Oklahoma, for their efforts in working on this  matter.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Alaska (Mr. Young), who is the dean of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  South Dakota (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, because I believe this is sensible legislation and  good for tribal governments, I will vote in support of this bill. I  urge my colleagues to support this needed and bipartisan legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.
