 Mr. Speaker, for too long, companies like Purdue Pharma  have lied, cheated, and swindled the American people, leaving death,  addiction, and despair in their wake, all because of their greed and  their desire to improve their bottom line.   Through marketing lies and overdistribution of these dangerously  addictive drugs, they have oversaturated parts of our country already  struggling from high levels of addiction, while knowing but not  disclosing their highly addictive nature and risks. Because of their  tactics, this opioid epidemic now takes 115 American lives every single  day.   The time for holding these drug companies and their leaders  accountable is long overdue. These companies rake in billions of  dollars in profit every year on the backs of the American people, and  not one of them has been prosecuted or held accountable.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting bicameral legislation,  the Opioid Crisis Accountability Act, that would prohibit illegal  marketing and distribution of opioids and empower prosecutors to punish  those who break the law.   We cannot allow perpetrators of this epidemic to continue ruining  lives in this country. We must hold those responsible accountable for  the damage, heartache, and suffering they have caused.                            ____________________
