 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection.                            ____________________     Madam President, today, the Senate will continue making  progress on the NDAA, one of the most important bills of the year and  something that for more than six decades has passed with bipartisan  support.   Yesterday, we adopted two important amendments to the NDAA, adding to  the Senate's work on outcompeting the Chinese Government. Both  amendments--one by Senators Cornyn and Casey and one by Senators Rounds  and Tester--passed overwhelmingly, with 91 ``yes'' votes each. It is  not often that 91 Senators can unite on a single measure, let alone two  measures. So to see us unite on outcompeting the Chinese Government was  an important demonstration that this issue remains broadly bipartisan  and something we will continue working on throughout the year.   This morning, we will hold another vote on an amendment by Senators  Warnock and Budd halting the harassment of our servicemembers by debt  collectors. I hope this will also enjoy broad support.   Last night, we sent out a hotline with a number of additional  amendments. I am hopeful we can lock in an agreement soon to begin  voting on some of them.   Since last Wednesday, the Senate has voted on eight amendments here  on the floor and adopted seven more by voice vote. This is how the  process should work.   Finally, I will also keep working with the Republican leader, Chair  Reed, and Ranking Member Wicker on a second managers' package that will  have more accomplishments both sides can embrace, and I appreciate the  cooperation and good faith of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.   I have said repeatedly that the NDAA is an opportunity for the Senate  to show we can work on the biggest issues facing our country through  bipartisanship, cooperation, and honest debate. That is what we have  seen play out so far this year on the floor--bipartisanship. The NDAA  process in this Chamber is a welcome departure from the contentious,  chaotic, and partisan race to the bottom we saw in the House.   As I have also said, if we continue embracing bipartisanship, we will  finish our work on the NDAA before the start of the August State work  period. We wish to finish the NDAA as soon as we can. There is no  reason for delay. We aren't quite there yet--there is still some more  work to be done--but we are close.   I thank my colleagues for their cooperation, and the Senate will  continue working on the NDAA until the job is done.   (Mr. BENNET assumed the Chair.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the IRA anniversary--when we passed  the Inflation Reduction Act last year, I said here on the floor that it  would endure as one of the defining legislative feats of the 21st  century. Just 1 year later, the IRA is paying huge dividends for the  American people, for our economy, and for our environment.   The Republicans claimed the IRA would make inflation worse. One of  our Republican colleagues claimed the IRA would cut jobs and fuel  inflation. But since we passed the IRA, inflation has gone not up but  down. We are lowering costs day by day for the American people with the  passage of this legislation. Inflation is now half of what it was a few  years ago.   Across the board, costs are coming down for the American family. For  the first time ever, we made it possible for Medicare to negotiate the  price of prescription drugs, helping Americans save at the pharmacy.  Because of the IRA, vaccines are free for Medicare beneficiaries, and a  cap on out-of-pocket drug spending--no senior will have to pay more  than $2,000 a year for drugs--is coming very soon.   What a relief for people, lowering costs on one of the things that  bothered them the most--the high cost of prescription drugs. That is  what we Democrats are doing, while over there in the House, the  Republicans are just racing to the bottom.   We also capped the price of insulin for seniors on Medicare to $35 a  month, spurring major companies like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to  follow suit. Millions of people who buy their health insurance on the  ACA exchanges are now saving hundreds--hundreds--of dollars each month.   Indeed, we are lowering costs. That is what we promised to do.   On top of these savings, I also said the Inflation Reduction Act  would kick-start the era of affordable clean energy and create  countless good-paying, green jobs. The Inflation Reduction Act has done  just that too.   From the new wind turbine facilities in New York to the solar  facilities in Arizona, the IRA is paving the way for America to lead in  clean energy manufacturing. Eighty new clean energy  [[Page S3563]]  manufacturing facilities have been announced across the country,  employing thousands and thousands of people--and not just in junky,  low-wage jobs but in good, high-pay, high-skill jobs, with training to  boot. Again, these new facilities mean even more good-paying jobs for  years to come in construction, manufacturing, clean energy, and so much  more.   As the new jobs are being created, wage growth continues to go up. It  is now exceeding inflation. So the amount brought home in your paycheck  has gone up more than the cost of goods has gone up. That is a new  thing. It only happened in the last few years.   The policies that we have passed here in the Senate--that Democrats  have passed here in the Senate, frankly--are making a huge difference.  Of course, we are only getting started. As we continue implementing the  IRA, the American people will see more evidence of the Democratic  agenda working for them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on AI, finally, with so much going on in  the Senate, I want to remind my colleagues that today we will hold our  third all-Senate briefing on artificial intelligence. Our presenters  are Rick Stevens from the Department of Energy's Argonne National Lab,  Dr. Sethuraman ``Panch'' Panchanathan from the National Science  Foundation, and Dr. Kathleen Fisher from the Information Innovation  Office at DARPA. Finally, our moderator will be Dr. Jose-Marie  Griffiths, member, National Security Commission on Artificial  Intelligence, and president of Dakota State University. It is a broad  range of presenters.   The last few briefings were well-attended. I know people are busy  today, but please try to make the time. And the Q-and-A was  surprisingly very direct. We got a lot of answers and learned a lot.   So I look forward to seeing my colleagues at the briefing for what  surely will be an illuminating, important discussion, and I thank  everyone for their good work.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin),  the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman), and the Senator from  Rhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are necessarily absent.

In these cases, brought against Mark Sahady and Leo Brent Bozell IV,  trials are expected to commence on August 21, 2023, and September 6,  2023, respectively, and the prosecution has requested testimony from  Daniel Schwager, formerly counsel to the Secretary of the Senate,  concerning his knowledge and observations of the process and  constitutional and legal bases for Congress's counting of the electoral  college votes. Senate Secretary Berry would like to cooperate with  these requests by providing relevant testimony in these trials from Mr.  Schwager.   In keeping with the rules and practices of the Senate, these  resolutions would authorize the production of relevant testimony from  Mr. Schwager, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel.

Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the  substitute amendment No. 935 to the desk.    I send a cloture motion to S. 2226 to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, July 26, be waived.
