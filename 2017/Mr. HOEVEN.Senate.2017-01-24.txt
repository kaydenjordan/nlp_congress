 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed  5 minutes to make comments but also that my colleague from North Dakota  be allowed to make comments, as well, and that we be allowed to  complete those comments prior to the afternoon recess.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service and  sacrifice of Colt Eugene Allery, a sheriff's deputy in Rolette County,  ND, who was killed in the line of duty on January 18. Deputy Allery was  just 29 years old and leaves behind his fiance, Alexandria, his four  children and stepdaughter, along with many family and many friends.   Deputy Allery was dedicated to serving the public and spent the last  5 years working in law enforcement. He started his career as a  corrections officer, serving as a police officer in Rolla, ND, and as a  tribal police officer for the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians,  a tribe of which he was a member.   He became a deputy with the Rolette County Sheriff's Office just 3  months ago. His colleagues remember him for his friendly and positive  disposition and his commitment to making his community and our State  safer. He was also well known in St. John, the tight-knit community  where he was raised by his grandparents. He was known for always  serving his friends and his family. They say Colt was happiest when he  was doing things for others, which is why he chose law enforcement as  his career.   Deputy Allery's life is a reminder to each of us of the enormous debt  we owe to all of the men and women in law enforcement who leave home  every day and go to work to protect us and help make our communities  and our States safer places--places that we are proud to call home.   My wife Mikey and I extend our deepest condolences to Deputy Allery's  family and friends during this difficult time. Our thoughts and prayers  are with his loved ones and his law enforcement colleagues, in the  coming days and months and especially today, as Deputy Allery is laid  to rest. May God bless him and his family.   Mr. President, I yield the floor and turn to my colleague from North  Dakota.    Mr. President, for all the people of North Dakota, we  thank Colt for his service, and we ask that God bless Colt Allery and  his entire family.   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have ten requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
