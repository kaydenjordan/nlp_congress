 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in a moment, I am going to propound a  unanimous consent request, but before I do so, I want to make some  brief remarks.   As my colleagues know and as several fact checkers have confirmed  over the past week, the Democrats' partisan reconciliation bill that  became law last week will provide many illegal aliens with $1,400  rebate checks paid for by the American taxpayer. By several estimates,  millions of illegal immigrants will get these rebates.   I offered an amendment 2 weeks ago to the Democrats' bill to close  this loophole. During debate on my amendment, one Democratic Senator  spoke against my amendment, saying that no illegal aliens have Social  Security numbers, and therefore the premise of my amendment and my  speech was, he said, ``not true.'' In fact, here are the Senator's full  remarks from the floor 2 weeks ago:         Mr. President, the statement from the Senator from Texas is       just plain false. Let me be clear. Undocumented immigrants do       not have Social Security numbers, and they do not qualify for       stimulus relief checks, period.        And just in case you didn't notice, they didn't qualify in       December when 92 of us voted for that measure, and they don't       qualify under the American Rescue Plan. Nothing has changed.        And for you to stand up there and say the opposite is just       to rile people up over something that is not true.        It is not true, and we know what is going on [here]. They       want to be able to give speeches and say the checks go to       undocumented people. In the circumstance where there is a       parent receiving--    At that point, the Senator's time expired.   Following that debate, the Senator in question took to Twitter to  double down. So it was not, after an all-night of no sleep, a moment of  erroneous comment, but, rather, on Twitter that same Senator tweeted:         Sen. Cruz's claim is only meant to rile people up over       something that's not true. You cannot receive a stimulus       check without a Social Security #. That's a fact. Instead of       discriminating against mixed-status families, let's       prioritize getting more relief to those families.    A second tweet from the same Senator:         We simply cannot stand by and allow outright falsehoods to       be propagated on the Senate floor. It's time for GOP Senators       like Ted Cruz to stop trying to rile people up over       misinformation.    Well, as John Adams famously said, facts are stubborn things, and it  turns out the comments from the Democratic Senator were categorically  false and my comments that this bill would send checks to millions of  illegal aliens were categorically true.   Numerous fact checkers began looking at the claims. Newsweek  initially fact-checked it, and, as is the wont with a fair number of  media fact checkers, took the word of the Democrats for it, concluded  my statement was mostly false.   Following that, my staff got on the phone with Newsweek and presented  them with incontrovertible facts--incontrovertible facts that of the  roughly 12 million estimated illegal aliens who are here, roughly 60  percent of them are visa overstays, people who came legally and then  overstayed their visa, and a significant percentage of visa overstays  have Social Security numbers and will receive checks.   Indeed, that is why my amendment was scored at saving the Federal  Government over $600 million, because of the checks that would not go  to illegal immigrants if my amendment had been passed.   When Newsweek heard these facts, they did something really quite  impressive, admirable. They admitted they were wrong. They revised  their fact check, and they changed their fact check from mostly false  to true. True, period. No caveats. True. I want to commend Newsweek for  demonstrating journalistic integrity. Correcting that fact-check, I am  sure, was not an easy decision for them to make, but it was the right  decision for them to make.   So, Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that we enter this  fact-check into the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                       [From Newsweek, Mar. 8, 2021]  Fact Check: Will Millions of Illegal Immigrants Get Stimulus Checks, as                               Ted Cruz Says?                            (By Graham McNally)         Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) proposed an amendment to the       American Rescue Plan that would bar illegal immigrants from       access to the $1,400 stimulus checks.        His amendment was voted down after Senator Dick Durbin (D-      Ill.) criticized Cruz for trying to ``rile people up over       something that is not true.''                                  The Claim         Cruz claimed on Twitter that illegal immigrants would be       eligible for the $1,400 stimulus checks included in the       American Rescue Plan.        On March 6, Cruz tweeted, ``When the checks go out,       millions of illegal immigrants WILL GET $1400 checks.''        He wrote that many people considered illegal immigrants are       those who have overstayed their visas, and therefore have       Social Security numbers.        Cruz argued that the possession of Social Security numbers       will allow unlawfully present individuals to obtain the       stimulus money.  [[Page S1634]]                                       The facts         Anyone who pays taxes in the United States as a resident is       eligible for a stimulus payment under the American Rescue       Plan. That includes non-citizens.        For example, a citizen of Canada who is living and working       full time in the U.S. would have a Social Security number and       would be eligible for a stimulus payment.        The United States Department of Homeland Security website       describes unauthorized immigrants as foreign-born non-      citizens who live in the United States without legal       residence. Individuals who overstay their visas but pay tax       in the United States using a Social Security number can be       eligible for stimulus payments. The most recent available       data for the number of visa overstays in the United States is       from 2019, released by the Department of Homeland Security.       It said that 1.21 percent of visas in that year were       overstayed, or 676,422 overstays. In 2019, student visas       (1.52 percent) had a higher overstay rate than those from       Canada and Mexico (.75 percent, 1.27 percent, respectively).        Illegal immigrants would not be eligible to receive a check       if they do not have a Social Security number.        Immigrants who overstay their visas no longer are lawfully       in the country but retain their Social Security numbers and       therefore are eligible to receive a check.        ``Technically, if they have overstayed their visa, they are       here illegally,'' a spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border       Protection told Newsweek. ``If a visitor has not been granted       an extension of status by USCIS [United States Citizenship       and Immigration Services], then they are considered to be       overstays and subject to deportable status under 237 of the       Immigration and Nationality Act.''        People who qualify as legal residents include those who       have passed the green card test (permanent legal residents)       or those who pass the substantial presence test. That test       requires taxpayers to be physically present in the United       States for 31 days of the current year and 183 days for the       past three years.        Anyone who has a green card is considered a legal permanent       resident, and would be eligible for the stimulus payment.                                  The Ruling         True.        Cruz's claim that millions of illegal immigrants would       receive stimulus payments is true, given the amount of people       who have overstayed their visas over the years. Once they       overstay, they technically are considered ``illegal.''        Correction, March 9, 4:00 pm EST: The ruling on this story       has been corrected to true. A statement from Customs and       Border Patrol has been added.     Mr. President, it is clear and indisputable that a  significant number of illegal immigrants will receive checks and are  receiving checks right now. All 100 Members of this body were  misinformed by the Democratic Senator that no illegal aliens would  receive fact checks--would receive, rather, stimulus checks. So I want  to give my colleagues a chance to adopt the amendment now, with the  correct information, with the true information, with the factual  information.   I would note as well, in these deeply partisan times, it is easy for  Republicans to throw insults at Democrats; it is easy for Democrats to  throw insults at Republicans. Far too much of that occurs.   The Senator from Illinois, who is a friend whom I served with for 9  years, is a talented Senator. I am not here suggesting that when he  stood up and spoke on the Senate floor and said things that were  absolutely false, that he did so knowingly and maliciously. I would  certainly give the Senator from Illinois the benefit of the doubt that  he was in error rather than deliberately misstating facts, but the  facts are now clear.   We have a rule in this body, rule XIX, to reprimand any Senator who  imputes the character or integrity of another Senator. I am not going  to seek refuge in that rule, although I think there is an argument that  I could. But I will say this, that once the facts have been made clear,  I hope my friend from Illinois will show the same principle Newsweek  showed--to apologize, to say he was wrong and he is sorry for calling  me a liar on the Senate floor and then going to Twitter to do so twice.  That would be the right thing to do, to acknowledge an error when it  occurred. The Senator from Illinois' statement that no illegal  immigrants will receive checks under this bill is categorically false.   For that reason, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to immediate consideration of S. 842,  introduced earlier today. I further ask that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President.    I would note several things. No. 1, the Senator from  Illinois said he didn't know if the number of illegal immigrants  getting checks from the Democrats' stimulus bill was in the tens or the  hundreds or the thousands. With all due respect, he does know that. It  is not in the tens. It is not in the hundreds. It is not in the  thousands. JCT, the Joint Committee on Taxation, which is a nonpartisan  organization that reports to this Senate and this Congress, scored my  amendment as roughly 482,000 illegal immigrants are getting checks  under the Democrats' proposal. Two outside organizations have scored it  as millions of illegal immigrants.   I would note what Newsweek said, when they corrected their fact- check, and I am going to read a quote:         The Ruling. True. Cruz's claim that millions of illegal       immigrants would receive stimulus payments is true, given the       amount of people who have overstayed their visas over the       years. Once they overstay, they technically are considered       ``illegal.''    Nowhere in the Senator from Illinois' remarks was a word of apology  for  [[Page S1635]]  falsely calling me a liar on the floor of this Senate and on Twitter.  That is unfortunate.   What the Senator said right now is also incorrect. The Senator from  Illinois said this amendment would halt the payments that are going  out. This amendment doesn't do anything of the sort. This amendment  restricts sending payments to people who are here illegally. When the  Senator from Illinois said he would love to do that, with all due  respect, that doesn't withstand even the slightest bit of scrutiny  because if he would love to do that, all he had to do was not object,  and the American citizens, the people who are here legally, would all  get their $1,400 checks, would get them on the exact same timeframe,  but those here illegally would not.   Today's Democratic Party supports sending checks to millions of  illegal immigrants. They have justified it, as the Senator from  Illinois did, by falsely claiming none of them are getting checks.  Those are not the facts, as the Newsweek fact-check makes clear.   I would note that a bill that Democratic Senators are trying to push,  denominated H.R. 1, what many are calling the corrupt politicians act,  would compound that by allowing millions of illegal immigrants to be  registered to vote and, no doubt, to cast votes.   This is a political decision that is far outside the mainstream. It  is unfortunate, but sadly it reflects where today's Democratic Party  is.   I yield the floor.
