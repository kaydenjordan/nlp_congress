 Madam Speaker, I rise today, along with our Ohio Buckeye  colleagues, to solemnly honor a former colleague and well-regarded Ohio  public servant, Congressman Tom Sawyer, from the city of Akron. Sadly,  Tom passed away this week, on May 23, 2023, at 77 years of age, after  prolonged illness.   Our hearts and prayers go out to his beloved wife, Joyce, cherished  daughter Amanda, their family and friends, and all people with whom Tom  worked and served.   Tom was a dedicated public servant, very dignified and steady, a  measured and enlightened man. He attained many elected positions as a  senior officeholder, serving in broad-ranging capacities at the local,  State, and national levels for 40 years.   Prior to Congress, he was elected as a member of the Ohio House of  Representatives. He was elected mayor of Akron in 1983 and then was  elected to Congress in 1987, serving 16 years, a total of eight terms,  until 2003.   Tom was very passionate about education. He dedicated his honorable  service on behalf of the people of Akron, of Ohio, and of the American  public at large.   Following his congressional service, he served on the Ohio State  Board of Education and then for nearly a decade more in the Ohio  Senate.   Together, let us celebrate the life of Tom Sawyer, honorable public  servant, loyal son of Ohio, and enlightened man with a fine mind, an  easy, broad smile, and a mellow voice of certitude.   Now, please let me yield to our new Ohio colleague from Akron, Ohio,  Congresswoman Emilia Sykes, to share her recollections and words about  her hometown predecessor, the Honorable Tom Sawyer.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Sykes).    Madam Speaker, I now ask our House colleagues to join us  in a moment of silence to remember our former colleague, Tom Sawyer.                            ____________________
