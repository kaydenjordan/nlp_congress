 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and remembrance of  legendary retired Air Force Brigadier General Charles McGee, who  peacefully departed on the morning of January 16, 2022. He was 102  years young and one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen.   Charles McGee lived a full and beautiful life of bravery and  perseverance. He was the embodiment of hope and service.   As a Tuskegee Airman, he made history as one of the first Black  military aviators, breaking the color barrier in the armed services  during World War II and flying 409 fighter combat missions in three  wars.   In addition to his life of service, Mr. McGee created an enduring  legacy through the family that he grew. He married the love of his  life, Ms. Frances Nelson, in April 1942. The two would go on to be  married for more than 50 years.   He is survived by his 3 children, Charlene, Ronald, and Yvonne; 10  grandchildren; 14 great-grandchildren; and 1 great-great-grandchild.   Black history is American history, and Charles McGee is an American  hero. General McGee's legacy will live on through the pages of our  history, the incredible family he created, and the lives he touched,  including my own.   Mr. Speaker, to our General, our beloved Papa Gee, I pray that he  rests in peace and power, reunited with his love, Frances, with the  wind forever at his back and the clearest blue skies ahead.                            ____________________
