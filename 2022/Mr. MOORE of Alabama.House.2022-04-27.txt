 Mr. Speaker, in the last 15 months, President  Biden and House Democrats have dumped trillions of dollars on the  struggling economy already weighed down by left-wing overspending.   We warned them that if they continued to print money to fund their  reckless liberal wish list, inflation would hammer the American people.  Now, inflation will cost the average American family an extra $5,000  this year. Folks are traveling less; they are buying less because of  Joe Biden. Inflation is crushing the working-class people.   Last week, I introduced the Household Income Tax Suspension Act to  provide the equivalent of a 6-month Federal income tax holiday for  millions of hardworking Americans.   Americans want relief. Let's allow them to keep more of their own  money instead of weighing down the economy with ineffective stimulus.  This is common sense. We need to put more money back into the working  people's pockets.  [[Page H4520]]                                ____________________
