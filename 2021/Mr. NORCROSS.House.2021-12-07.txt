 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking  Member Rogers for their leadership in bringing this bill to the floor.  This is our opportunity to pass the Defense Authorization Act for the  61st straight year. That is important.  [[Page H7219]]    Madam Speaker, this bill continues the Tactical Air and Land Forces  Subcommittee's long tradition of bipartisan work to make America's  Armed Forces continue to be the best in the world.   I commend the hard work by our members, certainly our staff, and  everyone else in this rather unusual, complicated, and demanding year.                                time  2030    I especially want to thank Ranking Member Hartzler for her leadership  and commitment to this bill. Our bipartisan cooperation in the House,  once again, paid dividends in delivering a defense bill that meets the  modernization and readiness needs of our Nation's air and land forces.   Madam Speaker, this bill carefully manages our military resources  while increasing our congressional oversight of DOD's large, complex,  and expensive programs. Certainly, this is something that demands our  attention and it certainly has.   This billing includes significant compromises, many of which I  personally do not agree with. This is a good bill, and it furthers  America's national security needs.   Madam Speaker, I urge everyone to support this bill.
