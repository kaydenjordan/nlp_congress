 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, here we go again. Another bloated spending  deal that doesn't just bust the spending caps but spends more than ever  before on this division. With a $22 trillion national debt, you would  think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would show a little  restraint.   My friends on the other side of the aisle, who I have enormous  respect for, including the chairman, are proposing to spend $137.1  billion in this division alone, which is $6 billion more than last  year's enacted level.   Mr. Chairman, we simply can't continue to go down this path. While  both parties have contributed to Washington's $22 trillion national  debt, my colleagues are recklessly proposing to bust the budget caps,  trigger sequestration, and continue to mortgage our children's future.  At some point, we have got to do something to confront this town's  spending addiction.   I acknowledge that reducing our national debt is a daunting  challenge, and I am prepared to debate today how to best accomplish the  goal of a balanced budget. But my friends on the other side of the  aisle do not even want to have that discussion.   Hoosier families in my district have these tough talks every day  around their kitchen table. Why can't Washington, D.C., do the same?   With these spending packages threatening to bust the budget caps and  initiate sequestration, there appears to be an indifference from my  Democrat colleagues as to the severe harm that this poses to our  national security.   I will not be silent about this, Mr. Chairman. This is my seventh  time coming to this microphone offering the same amendment in the last  couple of weeks alone. I am looking forward to having a substantive  debate today about this particular amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5061]]         Mr. Chairman, a very wise former Governor of Indiana once  said that you will never know how much government you will never miss.  And these days, as we roll out spending package after spending package  that spends more and more than ever spent before, I look back to those  wise words of that former governor, because that former Governor, knew,  just as I do, as a former State Legislator, that the States can always  run these programs and do better with running government, administering  programs like these than the Federal Government ever can.   And while there is a difference of opinion between my colleague,  again, who I respect and admire so much, it is clear that there is a  difference of opinion between those who believe that Washington, D.C.,  should tax more hard-earned tax dollars out of the pockets of  hardworking Hoosier families, just so that Washington, D.C., can spend  more and more on spending packages just like these.   In closing, Mr. Chairman, President Ronald Reagan once said: ``We  don't have a trillion-dollar debt because we haven't taxed enough; we  have a trillion-dollar debt because we spend too much.''   Since then, we have added roughly $21 trillion to our Nation's debt.  This simply cannot go on. If we do not begin to tackle this challenge  now, it will be tackled for us by our creditors.   We need to learn from the commonsense words of President Reagan and  start to live within our means today. If we don't, we will be putting  our troops at a disadvantage and our national security at risk because  of sequestration and leave for our children a country with less freedom  and less opportunity than the one that we inherited. That is  unacceptable to me, and I plan to fight to prevent that future from  becoming a reality. I urge my colleagues' support for this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
