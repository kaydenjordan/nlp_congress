 Madam Speaker, thousands of young people brought to the  U.S. at a young age fought for and have benefited from DACA. This gave  recipients and their families a little peace and resulted in economic  gains for our country, but the program falls short of a pathway to  citizenship.   DACA was a significant achievement for many immigrants, but it is by  no means a substitute for fixing our broken immigration system.   Since its inception, DACA has been under attack by far-right  politicians. The reality is that DACA has gone back and forth in the  courts, leaving DACA recipients and DACA-eligible youth in a state of  limbo. This continued legal threat leaves the lives of DACA recipients,  DACA-eligible youth, and their families in uncertainty and dread.   Congress introduced and passed H.R. 6, the Dream and Promise Act,  more than a year ago, but it is stuck in the Senate. We must end the  filibuster and pass a real solution for the millions of people who call  the U.S. home.                            ____________________
