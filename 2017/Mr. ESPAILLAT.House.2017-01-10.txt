 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong  opposition to the confirmation of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General.   In a 2006 speech, then-Senator Sessions wrongfully misstated:  ``Fundamentally, almost no one coming from the Dominican Republic to  the United States is coming here because they have a provable skill  that would benefit us and that would indicate their likely success in  our society.''   When I was 9 years old, Mr. Speaker, I immigrated to the United  States from the Dominican Republic without any papers, and now I am a  Member of the U.S. Congress. Mr. Sessions, have I not succeeded in  America?   On behalf of millions of Dominican Americans and notable Americans  such as fashion designer Oscar de la Renta, Pulitzer Prize winner Junot  Diaz, Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez, and baseball giant Big Papi, I  stand here on the floor of the United States House of Representatives  as a proud Dominican American. I say to Mr. Sessions: you are wrong,  wrong in thinking, and wrong for our country.   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the confirmation of Jeff  Sessions as Attorney General. Hateful speech and racist rhetoric have  no place in our American society.                            ____________________
