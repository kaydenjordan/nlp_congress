 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Right to  Contraception Act as an original cosponsor. I thank Representative  Manning for her leadership--and her co-leads, Representatives Craig,  Jacobs, and Williams--on this important bill, which responds to the  very real threats to access to reproductive healthcare and to bodily  autonomy that we face today.   We saw this threat in Justice Thomas' concurring opinion in the Dobbs  case, suggesting the landmark case of Griswold v. Connecticut, which  gave married couples the right to use birth control, should be  revisited and overturned. We see these threats from some in this body  and legislatures across the country. We certainly see it in Texas.   We also see that this effort does not represent the desires of the  vast majority of people I represent who rely on contraception of all  kinds every single day and have for more than 50 years. Yet, we see  these efforts to block women from accessing contraception that works  for them, including IUDs.   Once again, I am proud to protect the health, privacy, dignity, and  autonomy of women and families across this country by voting ``yes'' on  this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.                                time  1000
