 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Representative Perlmutter. I  am proud to join him in offering this amendment, which comes in a  direct response to a tragedy that occurred in the district I am honored  to represent, and countless other tragedies across the country.  [[Page H3663]]    As Representative Perlmutter mentioned, back in 2015, there was a  Flight for Life crash in Frisco, Colorado. The pilot, Patrick Mahany,  died, and one person on board is still in the recovery process.   The death and damage was caused not directly from the crash, but from  the lack of a crash resistant fuel system that is already mandated in  military helicopters, but, for some ridiculous reason, it is not  mandated in civilian aircraft like the Flight for Life helicopter.   I want to thank the widow of Patrick, Karen Mahany, for keeping this  issue in front and foremost. I know how difficult it must be to go  through a personal mourning process, but then to look above that and  say: Let's stop this kind of tragedy from affecting other families.  That is what Karen has done by putting herself out there.   I am honored to be supportive of this amendment here today that will  save lives and make sure that Patrick is among the last to suffer from  a loss of life from this lack of simple safety equipment in  helicopters.   This important amendment simply requires the FAA to mandate crash  resistant fuel systems in newly manufactured helicopters. I am also  working on a tax credit to help fund retrofitting of existing  helicopters. We can't let another tragedy lead to loss of life from an  avoidable problem. All helicopters should be equipped with the best,  most effective, and cost-effective technology available.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly encourage my colleagues to adopt this  amendment and ensure that this is part of the final bill that comes out  of the House and Senate as well.
