 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator Jim  Risch and Representatives  Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher, I  congratulate Ron Pisaneschi on his remarkable more than 35-year career  with Idaho Public Television.   Ron is retiring after serving as Idaho Public Television's general  manager since August 2013. He joined Idaho Public Television in 1985  and served in numerous positions for the station prior to his  managerial role. This includes serving as director of content, director  of programming, director of public information, and director of  marketing and development. We understand under his leadership of the  station, Idaho Public Television has been one of the most watched and  best supported Public Broadcasting Service, PBS, stations  [[Page S4899]]  per capita in the Nation. Douglas Balfour, president of the Friends of  Idaho Public Television, wrote, ``With his leadership, IdahoPTV has  focused on the wonderful people and places we have in the Gem State,  with local productions like Idaho Reports, Outdoor Idaho and Idaho  Experience. Ron will be missed, but we will carry on in the tradition  he established.''   Ron has also contributed extensively of his time and talents to  serving in various roles throughout the community, State, and Nation.  This includes his service as vice chair of the NETA board of directors,  chair of the Idaho State Broadcasters Association, and member of the  board of directors of American Public Television. Ron dedicated more  than 25 years to serving on the PBS Children's Advisory Committee. He  also served on the board of directors of the Public Television  Programming Association from 2002-2007, serving as president in 2006.  From 2002-2012, he served on the board of directors of the Idaho  Humanities Council, where he served two terms as chairman. These are  just a few examples of his longtime involvement in numerous leadership  roles and advisory panels. His dedicated work has earned recognition,  including Ron being named the 2005 Programmer of the Year by his  colleagues in the PBS system.   Ron, thank you for your commitment to advancing public discussions in  Idaho for all these years. Your curiosity, ingenuity, and thoughtful  advocacy for Idaho interests have no doubt contributed significantly to  broadening understanding, educational opportunities, and public  discourse across Idaho and well beyond our State's borders. We will  miss you at the helm of Idaho Public Television but wish you all the  best in a well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
