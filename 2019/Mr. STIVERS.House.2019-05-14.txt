 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 389, the Kleptocracy Asset  Recovery Rewards Act, and I want to thank the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) as well as the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Budd) for their hard work on this important piece of bipartisan  legislation.   H.R. 389 would authorize the Treasury Department to offer rewards for  information leading to the recovery of assets stolen through foreign  government corruption.   Mr. Speaker, in the past, the United States has focused on fighting  such corruption with traditional tools such as sanctions, technical  assistance, and oversight of international financial institutions, but  the bill gives Treasury an additional tool to expose corrupt foreign  officials.   I, again, would like to thank my colleagues across the aisle,  especially Chairwoman Waters, for her hard work on this bill and  allowing us to work together in a bipartisan fashion to refine this  legislation as it made its way to the floor.   One piece of the bill that has gotten better that I still think could  use an additional tweak is the bill does not allow anyone to receive a  payment if they are part of the corrupt activity, but it does not  require Treasury to fully investigate every potential claimant to make  sure that they are not. So while that has gotten better--there is  better language in the bill now--I think that, hopefully, this can  continue to be perfected as we move forward. I support the bill, but I  do think that provision could get better.   The minority did make several proposals to strengthen the bill, which  were accepted by the majority. I am grateful to the gentleman from  Massachusetts for partnering with us, as well as the gentleman from  North Carolina, and for their hard work on the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to voting for H.R. 389. I urge my  colleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                   (1715)     Mr. Speaker, H.R. 389 will give the Treasury an  additional tool to fight corrupt foreign governments. There has been a  lot of work done on this bill. It is a good bill. I urge my colleagues  to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1060, the BUILD Act. This  bipartisan legislation addresses an unintended consequence of the Know  Before You Owe disclosure rule, better known as TRID.   The BUILD Act is a straightforward solution, and it allows bona fide  nonprofits making zero percent interest loans to use whichever Truth in  Lending form they feel is better. They can use the Truth in Lending,  Good Faith Estimate, and the HUD-1 form instead of the TRID forms, or  they can choose the TRID forms.   Currently, organizations making five or fewer mortgage loans are  exempt from using the TRID forms. This extends that exemption to  charities making zero percent interest loans, regardless of how many  loans they make per year.   The costs and complexities associated with TRID have left charities  like Habitat for Humanity struggling to provide mortgages. These  nonprofits have limited resources. In fact, many of their 1,200  community-based affiliates have little or no full-time staff.   Despite their size, these organizations play a pivotal role in our  communities. Today, the House will play a small part in helping them  continue to serve our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) and the gentleman from California (Mr.  Sherman). They have worked together diligently on this legislation for  several years and should be commended for their efforts.   I want to thank the chairwoman, Ms. Waters of California, for her  efforts on this.   Mr. Speaker, I urge this legislation to be supported, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk). He is not only an Air Force  veteran, but his wife came up with the acronym for this bill.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would close by saying that the gentleman from Georgia and the  gentleman from California have worked very hard on a bill that passed  our committee unanimously and that helps nonprofits accomplish their  mission of building capacity in housing, and I urge adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to express my strong support for H.R. 1037, the Banking  Transparency for Sanctioned Persons Act. The bill includes important  provisions to strengthen our national security, and it passed  unanimously last year in the full House.   I am pleased to see this legislation come to the floor under a new  sponsor, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Riggleman). Although he is in  his first term, Congressman Riggleman has already made significant  contributions to the committee's work. His leadership on this bill is a  case in point.   The gentleman's legislation would require the Treasury Department to  provide Congress with a copy of licenses that authorize financial  services for state sponsors of terrorism. These licenses are  essentially waivers, and while sanctions laws often require  congressional notification when formal waivers are issued, licenses can  fall through the cracks.   To be clear, some licenses may be desirable, such as those allowing  humanitarian relief or allowing for tailoring of sanctions in order to  better advance our policy goals. In other cases, however, Congress may  have legitimate concerns that a sanctioned entity is being licensed to  carry out transactions with U.S. persons, including our country's  financial institutions.   This bill simply ensures that Congress knows whether a license has  been issued, which will allow us to have better oversight of the  sanctions program.   In addition, Mr. Speaker, this bill requires Treasury to send  Congress semiannual reports that show which foreign financial  institutions are providing support for sanctioned terrorists, corrupt  officials, and human rights abusers. Although these bad actors are cut  off from American banks, we should know whether they are evading our  measures through the use of foreign entities. If Congress is made aware  of these relationships, we can work to close those loopholes.   Again, the unanimous support these policies have garnered previously  underscores their commonsense nature. Congressman Riggleman has spent  much of his career before Congress devoted to protecting our national  security, and his work on this bill, H.R. 1037, deserves our support.   I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Riggleman), the sponsor of the bill. He  has done great work here, and I will give him as much time as he may  consume.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bipartisan bill  that passed unanimously in committee and in the House last year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
