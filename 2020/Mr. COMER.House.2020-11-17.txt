 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate National Adoption  Month along with National Adoption Day on November 21.   This recognition aims to increase awareness for the 122,000 foster  children in America awaiting adoption,  [[Page H5802]]  and to celebrate the children and families brought together through the  adoption process.   Mr. Speaker, I honor the numerous organizations and individuals  throughout the First Congressional District that offer vital assistance  to the children in the foster care system. Their efforts to help  adopted children and provide resources for young adults aging out of  the system go a long way in ensuring the safety and well-being of this  vulnerable population. Their tireless efforts and compassion for others  form the backbone of our child welfare system.   I am honored to join with my colleagues in celebration of National  Adoption Month and to thank all the generous organizations and  individuals in the First Congressional District of Kentucky for their  dedication to such a noble cause.                 Recognizing Todd County's 200th Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, as the Congressman for Kentucky's First  Congressional District, I am proud to represent 35 counties and  numerous communities with their own unique identities.   A very special county and city in my district are celebrating their  200th anniversary this year. Todd County is a county I represent on the  Kentucky-Tennessee State line that is full of small towns and rich  traditions.   Todd County, along with the city of Elkton, have been a special part  of western Kentucky for two centuries now.   Whether you reside in Elkton, Guthrie, or Trenton, you call home a  beautiful county full of wonderful people. With a strong farming  heritage, agriculture continues to play a significant role in the local  economy.   2020 is not the ideal year to celebrate the two-century milestone,  but while this year has brought significant change to our society, one  thing has not changed: Todd County, Elkton, and other rural communities  will continue to provide a strong voice for small-town values in our  Nation.   I am proud to represent the good people of Todd County and Elkton in  Congress, and I look forward to seeing even more prosperous years to  come.                               End Proxy Voting     Mr. Speaker, under Speaker Pelosi's leadership, this body  has experienced a series of new lows.   One of these failures in leadership was encouraging the abdication of  our duty as lawmakers amid a national crisis. The majority party  upended centuries of precedent by allowing proxy voting, and now has  another terrible idea: vote by text.   As many essential American workers have continued working every day,  this approach mistakenly signals that Congress is above the American  people.   The coronavirus is a serious crisis and one that requires Congress to  show up in person to address our Nation's challenges. I am proud to  have shown up here at the Capitol alongside my Republican colleagues  throughout 2020 to cast votes.   Members of this body should not be able to shield themselves from  scrutiny by voting on issues without being fully present.   As we close out the year and move into 2021, it is imperative that  all Americans get the full representation they deserve in Congress,  with their elected officials showing up for work.                     Hold Hearings on Election Integrity     Mr. Speaker, today,   Jim Jordan, the ranking member of  the Judiciary Committee, and myself are sending a letter to Chairman  Nadler and Chairwoman Maloney, the chairs of our respective committees,  requesting a hearing on the election process, the integrity of the  election process.   Just last night, we got a report that over 2,000 ballots had just  been found in Georgia. Ironically, despite the fact that all these  absentee ballots have been breaking overwhelmingly for the Democrats  and for Joe Biden in the Presidential race, this particular batch of  ballots broke 800 votes in favor of Donald Trump.   Now, I have been hesitant to criticize the election process without  facts. We have facts here.   It is a fact that there has been a history of problems with Dominion  and different election software programs that have been used in several  of the States that are in question in this Presidential election.   We have had all of these hearings in the Judiciary Committee and all  of these hearings in the Oversight and Reform Committee on Russia  collusion that never proved anything, but we have a Presidential  election that every American is watching. Why can't we have hearings on  that?   Mr. Speaker, we are here for the next 2 weeks. I strongly encourage  the Judiciary and Oversight and Reform Committees to hold a hearing on  our election integrity.                            ____________________
