 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his  leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support for the amendment  proposed by Representative Crenshaw.   Despite being the world's leading emitter of carbon emissions and the  second largest economy, China made minimal commitments under the Paris  Agreement for greenhouse gas reduction, and we let them get away with  it.   Now we have heard claims from the CCP, this administration, as well  others, the CCP is stepping up their commitments and generally want to  address climate change. In fact, China has only committed to stop  increasing emissions by 2030. That is another 8 years of increasing  emissions from China.   This administration's wishful thinking ignores the fact that the  United States is the only industrialized nation to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions over the last 2 years in a row, which has been achieved  primarily with low-emissions natural gas from my home State of  Pennsylvania.   However, the reality of China's new commitments is that they are  still doing the bare minimum compared with what the United States and  other leading economies have committed. China continues to use fuels  that this administration is strongly throttling back.   If we are expected to believe the CCP is genuine in their commitments  on climate, then it is critical that we see proof and accountability.   Madam Speaker, that is why I support this amendment to require annual  briefings on the Peoples Republic of China's progress toward their  climate commitments.
