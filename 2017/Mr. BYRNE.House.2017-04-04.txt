 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 241 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 241         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1304) to       amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,       the Public Health Service Act, and the Internal Revenue Code       of 1986 to exclude from the definition of health insurance       coverage certain medical stop-loss insurance obtained by       certain plan sponsors of group health plans. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committee on Education and the Workforce now printed in the       bill shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended,       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as       amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and the       Workforce; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without       instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, in 2010, then-President Obama said: ``If you  like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.''   Unfortunately, at least 4.7 million Americans now know that was  simply not true. ObamaCare was a takeover of the American healthcare  system. The law's mandates have been burdensome, destroying 300,000  small-business jobs and forcing an estimated 10,000 small businesses to  close. Premiums are skyrocketing, and choices are dwindling.  [[Page H2648]]    House Resolution 241 provides for the consideration of H.R. 1304, the  Self-Insurance Protection Act, an important part of the Republican  effort to repair the damage ObamaCare has done to insurance markets.  More than 150 million Americans--62 percent of workers--receive their  health insurance from their employer. In fact, almost all firms with at  least 200 or more employees offer health benefits, and just over half  of smaller firms with 3 to 199 employees offer health insurance.   Overwhelmingly, Americans and their employers like this system of  employer-sponsored health care; and for many years, employer health  plans have been successfully regulated by the Employee Retirement  Income Security Act, or ERISA.                                time  1315    Typically, small and large employers offer healthcare coverage to  employees either in self-funded arrangements or purchase fully insured  plans from an insurer.   Under self-insurance plans, employers cover the costs of their  employees' medical expenses. Employers can either process claims in- house or work with a third-party administrator to oversee and implement  the plans.   ERISA regulates both fully insured and self-insured plans, but only  self-insured plans are exempt from the patchwork of mandates imposed  under State insurance law. Furthermore, employer-sponsored self-insured  plans are not subject to the same requirements under ObamaCare, as are  fully insured plans.   Thus, self-insurance plans are desirable and successful because they  are free from many government restrictions and regulations and allow  employers to tailor their plans to meet the unique needs of their  employees and to innovate.   For example, these plans do not require employees to purchase  government-mandated coverage options that their employees do not want  or need. This helps lower costs for working families while ensuring  access to high-quality health care.   In hearings before the Education and the Workforce Committee, on  which I sit, we heard testimony that today self-insurance is often the  only way employers can afford coverage, thanks to the burdens of  ObamaCare.   Mr. Speaker, in Alabama, we like to say: if it ain't broke, don't fix  it. Prior to ObamaCare, there were problems in our Nation's healthcare  system, but the successful model of employer self-insurance wasn't one  of them. Today, self-insurance remains perhaps the best way for  employers to provide health care to their workers.   Unfortunately, the prior administration seemed intent on disrupting  this successful healthcare model. Rather than leave self-insurance  plans alone, they repeatedly explored ways to impose new regulations  that would negatively impact self-insurance. Specifically, the Obama  administration wanted to disrupt the model by regulating stop-loss  insurance and treating it as if it were health insurance.   Employers who self-insure often purchase stop-loss insurance to cover  large medical claims and to protect against the financial risks such  claims can pose. Despite decades of Federal regulation on employer  health plans under ERISA, stop-loss insurance has never been regulated  by the Federal Government. That is because stop-loss insurance is  actually a financial risk management tool designed to protect employers  from catastrophic claim expenses. Remarkably, in a regulatory grab, the  Obama administration tried to reclassify it as ``group health  insurance.''   Mr. Speaker, if the last 7 years have taught us anything, it is that  more Federal control over health insurance does not make health care  more affordable for the American people. Stop-loss insurance is not  health insurance, and it should not be regulated like it is.   The Self-Insurance Protection Act simply updates the law to make  clear that Federal bureaucrats cannot redefine stop-loss insurance as  group health insurance. This is about reaffirming longstanding policies  and ensuring workers continue to have access to a health insurance  model that is proven to lower costs and provide flexibility to  consumers.   This bill will provide workers and employers alike with the  regulatory certainty that they have desperately wanted and needed. They  shouldn't have to worry about unelected Federal bureaucrats stepping in  and destroying their healthcare system.   To put it simply, this bill is necessary in order to prevent future  bureaucratic overreach that would destroy the self-insurance model that  has been so successful for so many working families.   I also think this bill is an area where we should have some  bipartisan cooperation. It passed out of the Education and the  Workforce Committee earlier this year on a voice vote, and I hope it  earns bipartisan support here in the full House.   As we continue our efforts to increase choices, lower costs, and  provide better healthcare options for working families, let us not  forget to shore up and protect the health insurance programs that are  actually working and getting the job done.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 241 and  the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Florida said that the Moon is not the  Sun. Well, stop-loss insurance is not health insurance, but the Obama  administration tried to make it so. Because they tried to make it so,  we need to put into statutory law what I think we all agree on both  sides of the aisle not only is the law but should be the law so that  there is no question about it in the future. It is unfortunate we have  to do that, but, because of some of the actions of the prior  administration, it is necessary.   He talked about the strong foundation of the ACA, ObamaCare. That  foundation is crumbling beneath the program. We now have more insurers  jumping out of exchanges. My home State of Alabama is down to one  carrier on the exchange. Soon enough, we may find that, in Alabama,  like some other States, there are no carriers. This isn't a foundation.  It is a foundation made of sand--and the sand is leaking out. Something  has to be done.   Today's bill is a step--not the only step--in that direction. I know  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle agree with what we are  doing here in substance, and I wish we would just come together and get  this bill done so that we can assure that the self-insured smaller  employers and larger employers have the protection that they need for  the working families that participate in their programs.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida for his remarks. I  completely agree with him. Both parties should be working together to  make sure that we provide what we can reasonably for the health care of  the people of America, and we should be collaborating, not just in this  House across the aisle but in the Senate as well. I think it is a good  place to start right here with this bill because we really don't have a  substantive disagreement about this bill.   Both sides understand that stop-loss insurance is not health  insurance. It is just the Obama administration tried to turn it into  that. This bill would stop that and bring the certainty we need back to  these self-insured plans that mainly small employers have and make sure  that we have in place for working families across America a system that  is working for them and maintain that.   I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join  with us, will collaborate with us, and that our colleagues in the other  House, in the Senate, will do as well and pass this legislation because  it truly is bipartisan in substance and, I hope today, in the vote.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution  241 and the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 241 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       1868) to provide that providers of broadband Internet access       service shall be subject to the privacy rules adopted by the       Federal Communications Commission on October 27, 2016. The       first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce. After general debate the bill shall be considered       for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 1868.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution .. . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
