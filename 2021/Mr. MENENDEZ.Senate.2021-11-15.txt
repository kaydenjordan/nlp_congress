 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION     Saudi Arabia--AIM-120C Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles                                  (AMRAAM)         The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has requested to buy two       hundred eighty (280) AIM-120C-7/C-8 Advanced Medium Range       Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and five hundred ninety-six       (596) LAU-128 Missile Rail Launchers (MRL).

The total estimated cost       is $650 million.        This proposed sale will support U.S. foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a friendly country that continues to be an       important force for political and economic progress in the       Middle East.        The proposed sale will improve Saudi Arabia's capability to       meet current and future threats by increasing its stocks of       medium-range missiles for its fighter aircraft fleet for its       national defense. This potential sale will support Saudi       Arabia's Eurofighter Typhoon, F-15C/D, F-15S, and F-I5SA       programs and will further strengthen the interoperability       between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia will       have no difficulty absorbing these missiles into its armed       forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Raytheon, Waltham, MA.       There are no known offset agreements in connection with this       potential sale; however the purchaser typically requests       offsets. Any offset agreement will be defined in negotiations       between the purchaser and the contractor.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Saudi Arabia.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 20-11       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(l) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AIM-120C-7/C-8 AMRAAM is a supersonic, air launched,       aerial intercept, guided missile featuring digital technology       and micro-miniature solid-state electronics. AMRAAM       capabilities include look-down/shoot-down, multiple launches       against multiple targets, resistance to electronic       countermeasures, and interception of high-and low-flying and       maneuvering targets. The AIM-120C-8 is a form, fit, function       refresh of the AIM-120C-7 and is the next generation to be       produced.        2. The highest level of classification of information       included in this potential sale is SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems which might reduce system effectiveness or       be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that the Kingdom of Saudi       Arabia can provide substantially the same degree of       protection for the sensitive technology being released as the       U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the       U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined       in the Policy Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.                            ____________________
