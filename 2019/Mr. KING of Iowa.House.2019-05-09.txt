 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  Texas yielding to me.   Madam Speaker, I came to the floor to highlight the disasters that we  have in the Midwest.   I recall back in 2011 when the Missouri River was 11 miles wide at  its widest and 5 to 6 miles wide most everywhere else, all the way  through Iowa and down across Missouri. It was a secret flood because  you couldn't drive there. You had to fly over to see it.   We have some of these similar circumstances this spring, although it  has gotten a little more of the press. We had more water come down  below Gavins Point than ever before. It wiped out a lot of ag land on  the Iowa side and more so, even, on the Nebraska side.   We have critical infrastructure that has got to be reconstructed. We  have got to protect some of these communities that have been nearly  wiped out. This Corps of Engineers, in particular, has 41 breaches on  the levees just on the Iowa side of the river.   I urge that we get to a conclusion and adoption of a final package on  this disaster relief.   But I would point out, Madam Speaker, that this message from the  White House said that Congress should not use natural disasters as a  pretext to engage in unnecessary spending outside the agreed upon  discretionary spending caps.   I am hopeful that this gets worked out between the House and the  Senate. We need the relief, and we need it very soon.
