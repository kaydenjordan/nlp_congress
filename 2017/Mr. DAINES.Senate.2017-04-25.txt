 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of  Shawn Gilbert. Shawn was a prominent member of Montana's Little Shell  Tribal community who tragically lost his battle with cancer this past  January. Even in his final days, Shawn maintained a positive attitude,  and all who knew him fondly remember the constant smile on his face. As  is the Montana way, Shawn loved the great outdoors. He enjoyed  snowmobiling, four-wheeling, and hunting with his family, as well as  reloading his own ammunition and target practice with his pistols.  Shawn served his people as a member of the tribal council and dreamt of  the day his nation, Little Shell Nation, would be formally recognized.  It is our duty and my honor to keep that dream alive as my colleague,  Senator Tester, and I work to enact into law legislation to do just  that. I had the pleasure of meeting Shawn while he was in office at the  Little Shell Tribal headquarters. Along with his fellow tribal leaders,  Shawn presented me with a beautiful beaded bolo tie which sits on  display in my office. It serves as a daily reminder of the Little Shell  people and of Shawn. May God watch over his soul as his light lives on  through the memories of his loved ones.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
