 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1242, and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes of  debate, equally divided.    This amendment provides $650 billion of immediate relief  to those Americans who need it most. It is focused on the COVID crisis  before us, not on future unrelated spending priorities. The amendment  provides $160 billion to bolster vaccine production and delivery, as  well as testing and much needed support for healthcare providers.   It includes $1,400 checks for lower and middle-income Americans and  extends unemployment insurance.   It targets money to reopen schools, something that needs to happen as  soon as possible, and to expand access to childcare.   It has funding for substance abuse programs to combat the opioid  epidemic that has worsened.   This amendment would save tax dollars. It would save taxpayers more  than $1.2 trillion while meeting immediate needs.   The emergency we are facing should not be an excuse for funding  partisan priorities. Instead, we should come together----   --just as we had on the five previous bipartisan bills.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act, I move to waive, and I ask for the yeas and  nays.
