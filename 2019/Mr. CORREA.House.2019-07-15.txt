 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I am proud to support Chairman Engel's H.R. 2615, the U.S.-Northern  Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act.   Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to visit the Northern  Triangle and to meet with elected officials, law enforcement officials,  and humanitarian organizations to discuss the difficult and dangerous  conditions that force families and children to flee their homes in  search of a better life. I discovered what we all knew: The root causes  of the refugee crisis are, of course, violence and lack of economic  opportunity.   During my trip, I was encouraged by the positive impact and  effectiveness of U.S. foreign assistance and the changes it has made in  Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. For example, U.S. programs have  supported micro, small, and medium enterprises in El Salvador.   During my trip, I also learned of China's interest to build a  deepwater port and to buy coastline in the area. Clearly, it is in  America's best strategic long-term interest to make sure that the area  is economically stable and that the region is economically and  politically stable.   We must continue to invest in regional security and economic  development to ensure that our neighbors are safe, strong, stable, and  secure. And by ensuring our region is secure, we can build strong and  lasting peace and prosperity and build markets for American products  and services.   I urge my colleagues to pass this vital legislation.
