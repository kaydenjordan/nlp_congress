 Mr. Speaker, President Trump's irresponsible shutdown  is in its 19th day. America's working families are bearing the brunt.   In Illinois alone, more than 7,000 Federal workers are going without  pay. Without a solution, more Americans, and our Nation's economy, will  suffer. Tax refunds that families depend on could be frozen or delayed.   Nutrition assistance programs could be reduced. The Northern Illinois  Food Bank is now dipping in to reserves to operate without USDA  funding.   Air travelers, already experiencing longer lines as TSA struggles to  staff checkpoints with workers who aren't being paid, will incur even  longer delays.   None of this is necessary. Last week, this new Congress passed  bipartisan bills to fully reopen our government. This week we will pass  them again, department by department.   The President needs to stop holding our Federal agencies and the  livelihoods of thousands of families hostage. The Senate needs to take  ``yes'' for an answer and vote to open the government now. Then we can  continue the debate on how best to secure our border.                            ____________________
