 Madam Speaker, I rise today to stand with America's  friend and ally Israel against a rising tide of anti-Semitism and the  dangerous Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement, or BDS movement.   BDS is a form of economic warfare aimed at marginalizing the world's  only Jewish state. This radical agenda rejects Israel's right to self- defense and seeks to destroy its economy.   The House must stand with Israel and pass H.R. 336, the Strengthening  America's Security in the Middle East  [[Page H3931]]  Act. This commonsense bill would combat the BDS movement by supporting  State and local governments that choose not to contract with companies  that discriminate against Israel.   It already passed the Senate with strong bipartisan support. Sadly,  Speaker Pelosi refuses to allow a vote.   I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 336. This week, I signed a discharge  petition to ensure it gets a vote on the House floor.   Madam Speaker, Republicans and Democrats must send a strong signal  against anti-Semitism and the anti-Israel BDS movement. We need a vote  on H.R. 336.                            ____________________
