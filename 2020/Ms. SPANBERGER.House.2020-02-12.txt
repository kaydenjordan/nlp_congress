 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Reverend Lance  Watson for his thoughtful opening prayer this morning. His service to  central Virginia and his accomplishments as a spiritual and community  leader are an example to all of us.   For more than 30 years, Reverend Watson has served as the senior  pastor of St. Paul's Baptist Church in the Richmond area. Dr. Watson  has been honored as an outstanding community leader, outstanding  contributor to education, and Minister of the Year by multiple  organizations, and he leads a congregation of nearly 12,000 people.   While Reverend Watson has focused on the spiritual development of the  community through his ministry, he has also supported the social and  economic development of the community in a variety of ways. Under his  leadership, St. Paul's Baptist Church has initiated a bold plan to  build housing, a park, an urban farm, and community gardens to improve  the central Virginia community.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Reverend Watson; his wife, first lady Rose  Watson, herself an accomplished singer; and the entire Watson family  for their service to the St. Paul's community in central Virginia.   I also thank Reverend Watson for being here today to offer us  inspiration through the opening prayer.                            ____________________
