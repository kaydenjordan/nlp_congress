 Madam Speaker, for the past 40 years, community service  block grants have been vital to providing communities the resources  [[Page H3681]]  needed to address poverty and expand opportunities for children and  families. CSBG is a targeted program with strong oversight and a solid  track record of success. And because no two communities are the same,  CSBG gives organizations the flexibility to create new and locally  tailored solutions.   CSBG is also bipartisan. This year, I was honored to join with more  than 100 House Members from both sides of the aisle to advocate for an  increase in funding to the program. More resources will allow great  organizations in my community, like the Mohawk Valley Community Action  Agency, to improve and increase their services.   For over 50 years, MVCAA has served the residents of Oneida,  Herkimer, and Madison Counties providing important services, and  supporting education, employment, childcare, and family needs. In 2018  alone, they assisted 9,210 individuals, including 3,649 children.   I am so grateful that the Committee on Appropriations met our fiscal  year 2021 requests of $800 million for CSBG, which will ensure that  even more families and children have access to the tools they need to  realize their potential.   I thank my good friend, ranking member of the Committee on  Appropriations,   Tom Cole, as well as Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro for  their leadership and commitment to this program.                            ____________________
