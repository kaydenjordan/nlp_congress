 Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member for his work.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1. While my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle have deemed this bill to be ``for the  people,'' a more proper characterization would be ``for the  politicians.''   Voting is a foundational right for all Americans, and the egregious  provisions of this bill would jeopardize our freedoms. In particular,  this legislation fails to address the issue of ballot harvesting.   As we have seen in California and my own State of North Carolina,  ballot harvesting has created troubling irregularities in several  elections due to the lack of oversight and opportunities for voter  manipulation and intimidation.   Ballot harvesting allows political operatives with a partisan agenda  to get involved in the collection and submission of votes, creating an  opportunity for organizations or campaign workers to exploit voters and  violate our fundamental rights.   Americans should have a choice on how they want to vote, who they  want to support, and if they want to vote at all.                                time  1445    Not only would H.R. 1 manipulate the voting process, but it would  also restrict our rights as Americans to donate to the campaigns of our  choosing and would allow the Federal Government to use our taxpayer  dollars to subsidize elections.   Aside from the proposed matching donations with a 6-to-1 ratio, H.R.  1 would create a pilot program to provide $25 vouchers for eligible  voters. In practice, that means taxpayer money from hardworking  Americans could be used to finance campaigns for candidates they do not  support.   If this doesn't limit free speech enough, another provision of the  bill politicizes the Federal Election Commission by reducing membership  from six to five. This makes a traditionally nonpartisan organization  political, giving one party the power to make partisan decisions about  election communications.   With the vague standards created by H.R. 1, this would affect any  group wishing to advocate on behalf of any legislative issue.   In short, this legislation violates the First Amendment. Even the  ACLU has problems with it. It creates an avenue for fraud and subjects  voters to potential exploitation.   While my colleagues across the aisle will support this bill to  subsidize their own elections and keep their party in the majority, I  will stand up for our rights as Americans and vote against one of the  worst bills ever, this abhorrent assault on our election system.
