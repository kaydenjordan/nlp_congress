 Madam President, reserving the right to object, no one  in this Chamber has more respect for the senior Senator from Illinois  and the Democratic whip than I do. I share much of his frustration. I  also share, and I believe what the Senator also believes, that  immigration is an extraordinarily important subject that this body  should be addressing. We are a nation of immigrants. The American  people support legal immigration. I know the senior Senator from  Illinois supports it. I certainly support it.   I am rising to object because a number of my colleagues--and I don't  want to simply put it on them; I join with them in this--would like a  little additional time to study this bill. Equally important, if not  more important, many of my colleagues' sentiment is that we should take  this bill up first in the Judiciary Committee.   I commit to the minority whip that I will join with him in trying to  get our esteemed chairman to take this bill up. I don't think we ought  to be afraid of this issue. I don't think we ought to be reluctant to  take difficult votes. That is why we are here in the U.S. Senate. I  also cannot think of a subject that is more important for this body to  address than the subject of immigration, including but not limited to  legal and illegal immigration.   The fact of the matter is that the American people deserve an  immigration system that looks like somebody designed it on purpose.   For the reasons I just expressed, Madam President, I respectfully  object.
