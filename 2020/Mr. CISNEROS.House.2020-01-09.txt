 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of our  Constitution and express the urgent need of Congress to reestablish  itself as an equal branch of government.   Our Founders explicitly laid out the roles and responsibilities of  the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches, creating a  necessary system of checks and balances, but today we find our  democratic system in jeopardy.   In the past week, there has been an increasing concern about the  United States going to war with Iran.   Let me be very clear: If and when the President decides to use  military action, he must go through Congress first.   Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to  declare war. Any attempt to undermine that power would be unsafe,  unacceptable, and unconstitutional.   As a Navy veteran, I am constantly thinking of our brave  servicemembers. It is why I take this constitutional responsibility  seriously.    We cannot turn our backs to our principles, we cannot turn our backs  to our values, and we cannot turn our backs to the Constitution.   I look forward to voting for the War Powers Resolution and taking  Congress' power back.
