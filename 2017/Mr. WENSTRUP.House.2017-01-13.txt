 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of providing a  waiver permitting the nomination of General James Mattis to the Office  of Secretary of Defense.   General Mattis is an exceptional warrior, strategist, and leader. At  a time in which the United States faces an increasingly diverse array  of threats around the globe, his unique skill set and decades of  experience render him worthy of this exceptional legislation.   Civilian control of the military is a foundational underpinning of  our system of government, and it is one of General Mattis' nomination  strengths, not weaknesses.   Just as every one is a civilian before they join the military, they  return to civilian life when they leave it. Since becoming a civilian  3\1/2\ years ago, General Mattis has thoughtfully analyzed the  civilian-military relationship, coediting an analysis of the state of  civilian-military relations today. This work includes recommendations  that aim to, in his words: ``Ensure our military are braided tightly to  our broader society in a manner that will keep alive our experiment in  democracy.''   Throughout his distinguished career, General Mattis has demonstrated  a mastery of all aspects of American leadership on the global stage. He  has a keen grasp of the value of diplomacy and has been a strong  supporter of the State Department and its valuable mission.   Throughout his decades of service, he has accumulated a deep  understanding of the importance of deterrence and how a well-guarded  peace can prevent conflict before it begins. As a seasoned strategic  thinker, he has been an incisive critic of current and serious, long- term planning for American national security that hasn't really  existed.   General Mattis knows firsthand the reality of combat and the stakes  involved in any decision to use military force. The United States needs  a Secretary of Defense equipped to use every tool necessary to defend  our Nation and defeat our adversaries.   Because of General Mattis' unique capabilities to address the  multitude of threats our country faces today, I urge all my colleagues  to support this legislation.   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I would just point out that,  because of the way this law is written, General Mattis actually will  not be going back to civilian life after he leaves. He is still subject  to the UCMJ and, therefore, is still, in some ways, a military officer  while he will be the ``civilian head'' of the Defense Department.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman specifically for a clarity on  the status of General Mattis as the legislation is written.   I think it is important, Mr. Speaker, that all of us who stand make  sure the American people know of our greatest respect and honor for  General Mattis. His history of service to this Nation, his tactical  expertise, and his ability to acknowledge the constitutional  underpinnings of which this Nation is based is without question. But we  have, as my colleagues have said on the other side of the aisle, a very  serious moment in history.   In the public domain is a conspicuous intrusion of Russia and the  election of 2016. There is also knowledge of other areas of which they  have used the cyber system for cyber warfare.   The talent of military persons is welcome, but that is the strength  of this Nation: that we don't yield and bend this little book called  the Constitution, which has, as I indicated, its essence being that our  Nation is governed by the civilian population under principles of  democracy and equality, the recognition of the three branches of  government, and the separation of our military and civilian operation.                                time  1430    This waiver is extraordinary. This waiver, I believe, undermines the  very sense of the freedom of our military, its ability to counsel as a  separate entity, and it undermines, again, the idea that in 1947 our  Congress decided to acknowledge and only waived to General Marshall  because of the potential concern and catastrophe of the Korean  conflict, now Korean war. It has not been done since.   So I would ask my colleagues whether or not we are going to bend--not  bend the arc toward justice and recognition of the Constitution, but  bend at any moment of convenience. I do not believe that this is a time  in history to bend for convenience.   I believe General Mattis would agree, with his very fine record, that  civilian control of the government should be superior and raise the  question himself, if asked, whether or not this waiver is for this time  and for now and whether or not we are in such a moment of history that  that waiver needs to be granted. My view is that it does not. My view  is that we should, in essence, adhere to the regularness of  constitutional premise and also to recognize the well-established  separation of civilian and military.   At this time, I want to thank General Mattis for his service, and I  would argue that this resolution should receive a ``no'' vote from our  colleagues in the United States House of Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to S. 84, which provides an  exception to a limitation against appointment of persons as Secretary  of Defense within seven years of relief from active duty as a regular  commissioned officer of the Armed Forces so that the President-Elect  can nominate Gen. James Mattis to serve as the next Secretary of  Defense.   Gen. Mattis retired from active duty in 2013, which under current  law, makes him ineligible for appointment as Secretary of Defense.   Civilian control of the military has been a bedrock principle of our  democracy since the founding of the Republic.   That principle has served the nation well and there is no reason to  depart from from 66 years of precedent in strictly protecting the  American principle of civilian control over the military.   Indeed, in the history of the Department of Defense, the only Defense  Secretary ever given a waiver was then-Secretary of State, General  George Marshall--who was provided an individual waiver in 1950 at the  height of the Korean War in a stand-alone bill approved by the  Congress.   It is not the service of the individual nominated or his or her  fitness to serve that is in question, but the dangerous precedent that  would be set by entrusting leadership of the Department of Defense to a  retired military person whose active duty military experiences have not  been moderated by the tempering effect of life in the civil sector.   I urge all Members to join me in voting against S. 84.
