 Madam Speaker, it's been less than two  months since the start of the 115th Congress and Republicans have  already taken every opportunity to roll back progress made for women.   They have pledged to tear down the Affordable Care Act and block  access to Planned Parenthood.   They passed a bill through the House that limits insurance coverage  for comprehensive reproductive healthcare.   Now they've turned their sights to title X, a family planning program  that is crucial for women's health.   There are serious consequences for scaling back title X: without the  contraceptive services provided at these title X sites, pregnancy rates  would be 30 percent higher among teens.   We in government should be making it easier for young people to make  smart and informed decisions, not depriving them of the ability to be  responsible about their health.   Please, Madam Speaker, think about those young women. Their lives and  their health should be a concern to all of us
