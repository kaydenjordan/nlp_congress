 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and honor  CMSgt Marcus Oats for his recent promotion to Chief Master Sergeant in  the U.S. Air Force and upon the completion of his Air Force fellowship  with my office.   Selection for chief master sergeant is extremely competitive, as only  1 percent of the Air Force's entire enlisted population may hold the  pay grade of E-9 at any time. Chief Oats clearly epitomizes the finest  qualities of a military leader, as evidenced by his distinguished  career and elevation to the highest enlisted level of leadership within  the Air Force. Chief Master Sergeant Oats entered the U.S. Air Force on  September 4, 1996, as a services specialist and was later selected for  retraining into the field of acquisition. Chief Oats' honorable service  has spanned numerous overseas and stateside assignments including  Southwest Asia, four States, and the Nation's Capital. He has also  completed several deployments in support of Operations Allied Force,  Enduring Freedom, and Inherent Resolve. Chief Oats currently serves as  the senior enlisted advisor in the Office of the Secretary of the Air  Force's Legislative Liaison Directorate. Chief Master Sergeant Oats has  chosen to repeatedly lead his airmen by example.   Despite years of challenging work schedules and countless military  obligations, Chief Oats elected to make his education a priority. Since  2011, he has earned two associate's degrees, a bachelor's degree, a  master's degree, and a graduate-level certificate.   Furthermore, Chief Oats' outstanding performance has garnered  numerous accolades, including the 386th Expeditionary Wing Lance P.  Sijan Leadership Award, two time 7th Bomb Wing Senior Noncommissioned  Officer of the Year Award, and the Air Force Central Command Senior  Noncommissioned Officer of the Year Award. As a true testament to Chief  Master Sergeant Oats' exceptional career, he was selected to represent  the U.S. Air Force on Capitol Hill as its enlisted legislative fellow  in 2019. I was fortunate to have Chief Oats spend the year in my office  as an integral part of Team Murkowski and was pleased with his  professionalism, character, and devotion to duty.   Chief Oats joined my office in January of this year while serving as  my defense fellow on behalf of the U.S. Air Force Legislative  Fellowship Program. As the defense fellow, Chief Oats drafted  legislation, prepared floor debate materials, planned and analyzed  public policy, and served as a congressional liaison between Alaskans  and industry or government representatives. Chief Oats is the first  enlisted contracting airman selected for this position and is one of  only two enlisted Active-Duty Air Force fellows currently serving in  this capacity. Chief Oats is a Memphis resident and an alumnus of  Overton High School. He holds a bachelor of science in computer  information systems and management, as well as a master's in business  administration.   Chief Oats served as an integral member of our defense team, and I  relied on his advice in support of Alaskans and all Americans. His  tireless efforts were critical to the passage of the Merchant Mariners  of World War II Congressional Gold Medal. This bill is to award a  Congressional Gold Medal to the U.S. Merchant Mariners of World War II  in recognition of their dedicated and vital service during World War  II--service which proved instrumental in securing victory for the  Allied powers. Moreover, Chief Oats led a bipartisan effort to  introduce the sixth Defense Department Regional Securities Study  Center, named after the late Alaska Senator Ted Stevens. The centers  aim to support defense strategy objectives and policy priorities  through a unique academic forum and to foster strong international  networks of security leaders. He also helped secure several wins for  Alaska in the Defense appropriations bill.   Chief Oats continued the extraordinary lineage of military fellows I  have had the honor of working in my office, serving as a member of my  team. He was also the first enlisted contracting fellow in Congress. It  has been a great privilege to work with and get to know Chief Oats over  the past 11 months. I know that my entire team will agree when I say  Chief Oats will always be part of the Murkowski family.   As I thank Chief Oats for his service, I also thank his wonderful  family who has remained by his side for his 23-year Air Force career.  Chief Oats is married to Cecilia Oats. They have three children, Kayla,  Mya, and Myles.   On behalf of the U.S. Congress and a thankful Nation, I want to  express our gratitude to CMSgt Marcus T. Oats for his dedicated service  to the U.S. Senate and to all Alaskans. We applaud Chief Oats on his  recent promotion to chief master sergeant, the highest general enlisted  rank of the Air Force, and hope the best for him in his next role of  Legislative Advisor to the Chief Master Sergeant of the U.S. Air Force.  Just as I have greatly benefited from Chief Oats' leadership and  advice, I have no doubt that the U.S Air Force will also reap the  benefits from this true American. Thank you for everything Marcus.                            ____________________
