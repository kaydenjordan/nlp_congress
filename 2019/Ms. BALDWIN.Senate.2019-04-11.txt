 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the career and  legacy of former U.S. Representative Jim Moody, who passed away on  March 22, 2019. Born James Powers Moody, he was an influential leader  in Democratic politics in Wisconsin in the 1970s and 1980s.   Born in 1935 in Virginia, Jim spent much of his childhood abroad. His  father was an official with the American Red Cross, and his mother  worked in relief efforts for refugees. Jim was heavily influenced by  his parents' international focus, and he developed a passion for  foreign cultures and global affairs at an early age. He attended school  in Shanghai before graduating from an English-language high school in  Athens, Greece.   After graduating from Haverford College in Pennsylvania in 1957, Jim  worked in the former Yugoslavia and Iran with CARE, an international  humanitarian organization. He joined the Peace Corps in the  organization's early days and established the first Peace Corps  programs in Pakistan and Bangladesh. He spoke many languages, including  Greek, Farsi, Croatian, Spanish and French.   Jim received a master's degree it public administration from Harvard  University's John F. Kennedy's School of Government in 1967 and a  doctorate in economics from the University of California at Berkeley in  1973. Eugene McCarthy's 1968 Presidential campaign inspired Jim's  exploration of politics. He was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly  in 1976 and to the State Senate in 1978. With his mother at his side as  his campaign manager, he ran for and was elected to the U.S. House of  Representatives in 1982 from Wisconsin's 5th Congressional District in  southeastern Wisconsin, where he served five terms.   Moody was a progressive voice in Congress in the spirit of  Wisconsin's greatest progressive, Robert M. ``Fighting Bob'' La  Follette. He was an early advocate of gay rights and wilderness  preservation. In 1991, he authored a federally funded universal health  care bill to cover the 37 million Americans who lacked insurance at the  time, including 550,000 Wisconsinites. He proposed paying for the  coverage with higher taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals.   After an unsuccessful U.S. Senate race in 1992, he returned to his  passion for international affairs. In 1995, he became the chief  financial officer of the United Nation's International Fund for  Agricultural Development, which focuses on improving the living  standards in the agricultural sectors of developing countries. He  served on the board of the National Iranian American Council and as an  elections observer in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Ukraine. His post  congressional career also included work as professor, an economist and  a financial adviser   Jim Moody took his role as a public servant very seriously. It was a  responsibility and an honor that he carried proudly. He cared deeply  about the economic stability and well-being of his constituents and of  people around the globe. He will be fondly remembered as one of  Wisconsin's great progressive leaders.                            ____________________
