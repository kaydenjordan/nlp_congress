 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 2613) to require the Director of the Financial Crimes  Enforcement Network to carry out a study on the use of emerging  technologies within the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2613         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Advancing Innovation to       Assist Law Enforcement Act''.       SEC. 2. FINCEN STUDY ON USE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES.         (a) Study.--        (1) In general.--The Director of the Financial Crimes       Enforcement Network (``FinCEN'') shall carry out a study on--        (A) the status of implementation and internal use of       emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence       (``AI''), digital identity technologies, blockchain       technologies, and other innovative technologies within       FinCEN;  [[Page H7811]]         (B) whether AI, digital identity technologies, blockchain       technologies, and other innovative technologies can be       further leveraged to make FinCEN's data analysis more       efficient and effective; and        (C) how FinCEN could better utilize AI, digital identity       technologies, blockchain technologies, and other innovative       technologies to more actively analyze and disseminate the       information it collects and stores to provide investigative       leads to Federal, State, Tribal, and local law enforcement,       and other Federal agencies (collective, ``Agencies''), and       better support its ongoing investigations when referring a       case to the Agencies.        (2) Inclusion of gto data.--The study required under this       subsection shall include data collected through the       Geographic Targeting Orders (``GTO'') program.        (b) Report.--Not later than the end of the 6-month period       beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Director shall issue a report to the Committee on Banking,       Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on       Financial Services of the House of Representatives       containing--        (1) all findings and determinations made in carrying out       the study required under subsection (a);        (2) with respect to each of subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C)       of subsection (a)(1), any best practices or significant       concerns identified by the Director, and their applicability       to AI, digital identity technologies, blockchain       technologies, and other innovative technologies with respect       to U.S. efforts to combat money laundering and other forms of       illicit finance; and        (3) any policy recommendations that could facilitate and       improve communication and coordination between the private       sector, FinCEN, and Agencies through the implementation of       innovative approaches, in order to meet their Bank Secrecy       Act (as defined under section 5312 of title 31, United States       Code) and anti-money laundering compliance obligations.        (c) Bank Secrecy Act Defined.--For purposes of this       section, the term ``Bank Secrecy Act'' means--        (1) subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States       Code;        (2) section 21 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; and        (3) chapter 2 of title I of Public Law 91-508.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material  thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2613, the Advancing  Innovation to Assist Law Enforcement Act, and I urge all Members to  support it.   The financial services industry spends quite a bit of time  considering how it can use new technologies to improve its data  collection and analysis to detect and report suspected financial crime.   This bill turns the lens onto the Financial Crime Enforcement  Network, FinCen, to look at its use of artificial intelligence, digital  identity technologies, blockchain, and other innovative technologies.   The study required by H.R. 2613 will examine how this essential  regulatory and data-driven agency could itself better utilize these  technologies to more actively analyze and disseminate the information  FinCen collects and stores to provide investigative leads to its law  enforcement partners.   The result of this study will help the agency and us in Congress to  identify gaps that need to be filled with the same advanced tools that  are being adapted by the industry.   I applaud the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez) for his work on this  bill and recommend its passage.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, we have no additional speakers on  this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, we are prepared to close. I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I once again thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Gonzalez) for bringing this bill before the House.   Improving the use of technologies can only improve our response to  the wide range of crimes that FinCen combats. I urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting this important piece of legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1396) to award Congressional Gold Medals to Katherine  Johnson and Dr. Christine Darden, to posthumously award Congressional  Gold Medals to Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson, and to award a  Congressional Gold Medal to honor all of the women who contributed to  the success of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration during  the Space Race, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1396         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Hidden Figures Congressional       Gold Medal Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) In 1935, the National Advisory Committee for       Aeronautics (referred to in this section as ``NACA'') hired 5       women to serve as the first ``computer pool'' at the Langley       Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory where those women took on       work making calculations that male engineers had made       previously.        (2) During the 1940s, NACA began recruiting African-      American women to work as computers and initially separated       those women from their White counterparts in a group known as       the ``West Area Computers'' where the women were restricted       to segregated dining and bathroom facilities.        (3) Katherine Johnson was born on August 26, 1918, in White       Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.        (4) In 1953, Katherine Johnson began her career in       aeronautics as a computer in the segregated West Area       Computing unit described in paragraph (2).        (5) As a member of the Flight Research Division, Katherine       Johnson analyzed data from flight tests. After NACA was       reformulated into the National Aeronautics and Space       Administration (referred to in this section as ``NASA''),       Katherine Johnson--        (A) calculated the trajectory for Alan Shepard's Freedom 7       mission in 1961, which was the first human spaceflight by an       individual from the United States;        (B) coauthored a report that provided the equations for       describing orbital spaceflight with a specified landing       point, which made her the first woman to be recognized as an       author of a report from the Flight Research Division;        (C) was asked to verify the calculations when electronic       computers at NASA were used to calculate the orbit for John       Glenn's Friendship 7 mission; and        (D) provided calculations for NASA throughout her career,       including for the Apollo missions.        (6) Katherine Johnson retired from NASA in 1986.        (7) Dr. Christine Darden was born on September 10, 1942, in       Monroe, North Carolina.        (8) In 1962, Dr. Christine Darden graduated from Hampton       Institute with a B.S. in Mathematics and a teaching       credential.        (9) Dr. Christine Darden attended Virginia State University       where she studied aerosol physics and earned an M.S. in       Applied Mathematics.        (10) Dr. Christine Darden began her career in aeronautics       in 1967 as a data analyst at NASA's Langley Research Center       (referred to in this section as ``Langley'') before being       promoted to aerospace engineer in 1973. Her work in this       position resulted in the production of low-boom sonic       effects, which revolutionized aerodynamics design.        (11) Dr. Christine Darden completed her education by       earning a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from George       Washington University in 1983.        (12) While working at NASA, Dr. Christine Darden--        (A) was appointed to be the leader of the Sonic Boom Team,       which worked on designs to minimize the effects of sonic       booms by testing wing and nose designs for supersonic       aircraft;        (B) wrote more than 50 articles on aeronautics design; and        (C) became the first African American to be promoted to a       position in the Senior Executive Service at Langley.        (13) Dorothy Vaughan was born on September 20, 1910, in       Kansas City, Missouri.        (14) Dorothy Vaughan began working for NACA in 1943.       Dorothy Vaughan--        (A) started at NACA as a member of the West Area Computing       unit;        (B) was promoted to be the head of the West Area Computing       unit, becoming NACA's first African-American supervisor, a       position that she held for 9 years; and        (C) became an expert programmer in FORTRAN as a member of       NASA's Analysis and Computation Division.        (15) Dorothy Vaughan retired from NASA in 1971 and died on       November 10, 2008.        (16) Mary Jackson was born on April 9, 1921, in Hampton,       Virginia.        (17) Mary Jackson started her career at NACA in 1951,       working as a computer as a member of the West Area Computing       unit.        (18) After petitioning the City of Hampton to allow her to       take graduate-level courses in math and physics at night at       the all-White Hampton High School, Mary Jackson was able to       complete the required training to become an engineer, making       her NASA's first female African-American engineer.        (19) Mary Jackson--        (A) while at NACA and NASA--        (i) worked in the Theoretical Aerodynamics Branch of the       Subsonic-Transonic Aerodynamics Division at Langley where she       analyzed wind tunnel and aircraft flight data; and        (ii) published a dozen technical papers that focused on the       boundary layer of air around airplanes; and        (B) after 21 years working as an engineer at NASA,       transitioned to a new job as Langley's Federal Women's       Program Manager where she worked to improve the prospects of       NASA's female mathematicians, engineers, and scientists.        (20) Mary Jackson retired from NASA in 1985 and died in       2005.        (21) These 4 women, along with the other African-American       women in NASA's West Area Computing unit, were integral to       the success of the early space program. The stories of these       4 women exemplify the experiences of hundreds of women who       worked as computers, mathematicians, and engineers at NACA       beginning in the 1930s and their handmade calculations played       an integral role in--        (A) aircraft testing during World War II;        (B) supersonic flight research;        (C) sending the Voyager probes to explore the solar system;       and        (D) the United States landing the first man on the lunar       surface.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDALS.         (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate       shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on       behalf of Congress, of 5 gold medals of appropriate design as       follows:        (1) One gold medal to Katherine Johnson in recognition of       her service to the United States as a mathematician.        (2) One gold medal to Dr. Christine Darden for her service       to the United States as an aeronautical engineer.  [[Page H7813]]         (3) In recognition of their service to the United States       during the Space Race--        (A) 1 gold medal commemorating the life of Dorothy Vaughan;       and        (B) 1 gold medal commemorating the life of Mary Jackson.        (4) One gold medal in recognition of all women who served       as computers, mathematicians, and engineers at the National       Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and the National       Aeronautics and Space Administration between the 1930s and       the 1970s (referred to in this section as ``recognized       women'').        (b) Design and Striking.--For the purpose of the awards       under subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (referred       to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike each gold       medal described in that subsection with suitable emblems,       devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.        (c) Transfer of Certain Medals After Presentation.--        (1) Smithsonian institution.--        (A) In general.--After the award of the gold medal       commemorating the life of Dorothy Vaughan under subsection       (a)(3)(A) and the award of the gold medal in recognition of       recognized women under subsection (a)(4), those medals shall       be given to the Smithsonian Institution where the medals       shall be--        (i) available for display, as appropriate; and        (ii) made available for research.        (B) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medals       received under subparagraph (A) available for--        (i) display, particularly at the National Museum of African       American History and Culture; or        (ii) loan, as appropriate, so that the medals may be       displayed elsewhere.        (2) Transfer to family.--After the award of the gold medal       in honor of Mary Jackson under subsection (a)(3)(B), the       medal shall be given to her granddaughter, Wanda Jackson.       SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.         Under regulations that the Secretary may promulgate, the       Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the       gold medals struck under this Act, at a price sufficient to       cover the cost of the medals, including labor, materials,       dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.       SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS.         (a) National Medals.--The medals struck under this Act are       national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31,       United States Code.

(a) Authority To Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to       be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise       Fund such amounts as may be necessary to pay for the costs of       the medals struck under this Act.        (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of       duplicate bronze medals authorized under section 4 shall be       deposited into the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.       SEC. 7. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material  thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1396, the Hidden  Figures Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2019.   I thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Johnson) for her work on this  bill, which honors the women mathematicians and engineers who helped  win the Space Race. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Apollo  Moon space landing, a shining beacon of bold American innovation and  ingenuity, made possible by tireless and often unacknowledged and  under-appreciated contributions of the women working as computers,  mathematicians, and engineers at the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration.   These women faced challenges that exemplified the period of  segregation in which they lived and the male-dominated culture at NASA  and its precursors, despite the contributions they made to space  exploration. They faced lower pay, were not allowed to submit their  work under their own names and did not receive the promotions that  their male colleagues did. They also faced segregated dining  facilities, water fountains, and bathrooms.   It was only right that the experiences of these women were brought to  light by a popular book by Dr. Christine Darden published in 2016,  which also became a successful movie. This book described her and the  struggles of Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Dorothy Vaughan in  this difficult environment.   The women computers, mathematicians, and engineers of NACA and NASA  overcame these challenges. They made critical contributions not only to  the Space Race, as depicted in the film based on Dr. Darden's book, but  also to World War II aircraft development and research into faster- than-sound flight.   The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian award bestowed  by the Congress. It is awarded to persons who have performed an  achievement that has an impact on American history and culture that is  likely to be recognized as a major achievement in the recipient's field  long after the achievement.   The Hidden Figures Congressional Gold Medal Act awards five  Congressional Gold Medals; one each to Katherine Johnson, Dr. Christine  Darden, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, and one medal to honor the  contributions of the hundreds of women computers, mathematicians, and  engineers whose names have largely been lost to history.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Johnson) for  introducing this bill this Congress, and I urge members to vote  ``yes''.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman  [[Page H7814]]  from Texas (Ms. Johnson), chairwoman of the House Committee on Science,  Space, and Technology.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased that this bill has wide bipartisan  support, and I thank the entire House Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology for its efforts in ensuring that this incredible story is  not lost in the annals of history.   Given the place the Moon landing holds in our Nation's collective  consciousness, a national expression of gratitude for these women and  their contributions is long overdue.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 3589) to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Greg  LeMond, in recognition of his service to the Nation as an athlete,  activist, role model, and community leader, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3589         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Greg LeMond Congressional       Gold Medal Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) Gregory James ``Greg'' LeMond was born in Lakewood,       California, on June 26, 1961.        (2) Greg began cycling at the age of 14, winning an       astonishing 11 straight races to begin his career.        (3) Greg took home a full suite of medals at the 1979       Junior World Championships, including gold, silver, and       bronze, emerging victorious in the road race and placing in       both team and track pursuit events.        (4) At age 18, Greg became the youngest cyclist in the       history of the sport to be selected for the United States       Men's Olympic team.        (5) Greg emerged victorious in the 1980 Circuit de la       Sarthe, becoming the first American in history and the       youngest rider ever to win a major pro-am cycling event on       the European continent.        (6) At age 19, Greg signed his first professional contract.        (7) In 1982, Greg made the first of several remarkable       recoveries, returning from a broken collarbone to win the       silver medal at the world championships in Great Britain.        (8) The Tour de France, the world's preeminent cycling       competition, was first held over a century ago, in 1903.        (9) The Tour de France takes place over 23 days, covering       an extraordinary 2,200 miles, winding through multiple       mountain ranges, spanning multiple nations, and is viewed as       comparable to running a marathon every day for three       consecutive weeks.        (10) Greg first competed in the Tour de France in 1984,       finishing third, and finishing second the following year, in       both years deputizing himself to his teammates, sacrificing a       chance to win himself to boost his teammates toward victory.        (11) Greg emerged victorious in the 1986 Tour de France,       ascending the fabled Alpe D'Huez, defeating the field by more       than three full minutes, becoming the first American and the       first non-European to win cycling's most prestigious race.        (12) In 1987, while recovering from a broken wrist and       collarbone, Greg was tragically shot during a turkey hunting       accident, leaving him in intensive care, requiring the       removal of over 40 shotgun pellets from his abdomen, was       deemed unlikely to ever ride a bicycle again, and likely       survived only due to the abnormal strength of his       cardiovascular system.        (13) Greg mounted the greatest comeback in the history of       American sports, taking home an astonishing victory at the       1989 Tour de France, following multiple surgeries, life-      threatening gunshot wounds, tendon repair, and an       appendectomy, winning by eight seconds in the closest finish       in the history of the Tour de France.        (14) Greg would win a third Tour de France victory in 1990.        (15) Greg is the only American to win the Tour de France.        (16) Greg has vocally spoken out to champion healthy sport       amongst athletes of all ages and competition levels.        (17) Greg and his wife, Kathy, are active in numerous       nonprofit causes, including healthy sport, assisting victims       of sexual abuse and various childhood illnesses.        (18) Cycling offers young people a healthy, active, outdoor       hobby.        (19) Greg completed his professional career having won two       World Championships, three Tour de France championships, and       twenty-two titles overall.        (20) More than any other cyclist, Greg personified the       ``breakaway'' culture of American cycling in the 1970s and       80s, viewed universally as the epitome of a young person on a       bicycle, attempting to accomplish feats no other American had       achieved.        (21) Greg has not only reached the pinnacle of       international sport, but has devoted his time and resources       to assisting his fellow athletes.        (22) Greg has demonstrated the commitment to excellence,       generosity, community, and tenacity that makes him an example       for all to follow.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.         (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate       shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on       behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design       to Greg LeMond, in recognition of his contributions to the       Nation as an athlete, activist, role model, and community       leader.        (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation       referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury       (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a       gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions,       to be determined by the Secretary.       SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.         The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of       the gold medal struck pursuant to section 3 under such       regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price       sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor,       materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and       the cost of the gold medal.       SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS.         (a) National Medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this       Act are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title       31, United States Code.        (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of section 5134 of       title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under this       Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.  [[Page H7815]]            SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3589, the Greg LeMond  Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2019.   I thank the gentleman from California, Representative Thompson, for  his work on this bill, which honors a man who, in addition to being one  of our Nation's greatest athletes and the greatest American cyclist in  history, exemplifies the virtues of sportsmanship, selflessness, and  perseverance.   Born in Lakewood, California, Greg LeMond is the only American  cyclist to win the Tour de France officially, which he won three times.  He is also the first American to win a major European cycling  tournament and the youngest cyclist in history to be selected for the  U.S. men's Olympic team.   LeMond is at the pinnacle of American cycling history and ranks  firmly among the most accomplished international athletes in U.S.  history.   In 1987, he suffered a horrific gunshot injury during a hunting  accident, which left him with over 40 pellets in his abdomen. He was  told he would never ride a bicycle again.   Remarkably, in what remains one of the most astonishing recoveries in  sports history, LeMond won the 1989 Tour de France on its final day, to  win his third yellow jersey in 4 years.   That victory--on the heels of gunshot wounds, an appendectomy, a  broken wrist, and a fractured collarbone--is a testament to Mr.  LeMond's tenacity and training. It still stands as the last time an  American officially won the Tour de France.   Above and beyond his considerable athletic accomplishments, LeMond  has demonstrated a repeated willingness to sacrifice his own individual  victories for the sake of his teammates.   Outside of the world of sports, LeMond and his wife, Kathy, have  worked through various charitable initiatives to support victims of  childhood abuse and various childhood illnesses.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Thompson for joining me in introducing  this bill this Congress and urge Members to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Thompson), chairman of the House Ways and Means  Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I am pleased to support this bipartisan bill, and I want to thank Mr.  Thompson and all the bill's many cosponsors.   For decades, Greg LeMond has exemplified the breakaway culture of  American cycling and is the embodiment of talent, tenacity, and  selflessness that is unparalleled in American sports.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1830) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint  coins in commemoration of the National Purple Heart Hall of Honor, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1830         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material  thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1830, the National  Purple Heart Hall of Honor Commemorative Coin Act.   I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick  Maloney) as well as Representatives Takano and Gallagher for their work  on this bill which would honor the Purple Heart Hall of Honor.   The Purple Heart was established by General and future President  George Washington in 1782 and is one of the oldest and most recognized  American military medals awarded to servicemembers who were killed or  wounded by enemy action.   The National Purple Heart Hall of Honor is located in New Windsor,  New York, just 2 miles from the town of Newburgh, where General  Washington signed the order creating the Purple Heart. Its mission is  to collect and preserve the stories of Purple Heart recipients from all  branches of the Armed Forces from the time of its creation.   The Hall of Honor is a memorial to the brave men and women who have  been wounded or died during combat, and work ensures that their  sacrifices are not forgotten. Currently, there are over 200,000 names  installed at the Hall of Honor.   This bill would provide tangible support to the Hall of Honor by  directing the West Point Mint to produce commemorative coins in  recognition of the work of the Hall of Honor. Proceeds from the sale of  this coin would fund improvements to the museum itself to help expand  the understanding and respect for those who have served and sacrificed.   Additionally, proceeds would go toward special projects like the  Purple Heart Patriot Project, which provides resources for Purple Heart  recipients and their families from all across the Nation to visit the  National Purple Heart Hall of Honor Museum.   I thank Mr. Maloney, Mr. Takano, and Mr. Gallagher for joining me in  introducing this bill this Congress, and I urge Members to vote  ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney), chairman of the Coast Guard  and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I want to again thank Mr. Maloney for introducing this legislation,  and all the cosponsors. We must work to guarantee the stories of our  Purple Heart recipients are not forgotten. This shows our commitment to  this important mission and to helping future generations understand the  recipients' sacrifices.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
