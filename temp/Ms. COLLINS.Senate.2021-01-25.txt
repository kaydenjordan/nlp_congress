 Madam President, as we face an economic crisis brought  on by COVID-19, we will need steady, proven leadership at the Treasury  Department. A highly respected economist, Dr. Yellen served first as  Vice Chair and then Chair of the Federal Reserve. She has served under  Democratic and Republican presidents and during periods of economic  crisis and economic growth.   Last year, I worked with my colleagues to deliver bipartisan relief  for those who have been harmed by the pandemic. We addressed the crisis  in five bills totaling approximately $3 trillion. Through subsequent  negotiations in November and December on an additional $900 billion  package, we secured a second round of Paycheck Protection Program  forgivable loans for the hardest hit small businesses and extended  unemployment programs, assistance for schools, vaccine delivery, and  more. But additional work remains.   During this crisis, Secretary Mnuchin proved himself to be an able  partner to all of us in delivering this relief. It is my hope that  Treasury Secretary-designate Yellen will build on our work. In her  testimony before the Senate Finance Committee and during the subsequent  questions, Dr. Yellen made clear that she understands these needs.   Our nation's eight living former Secretaries of the Treasury have  provided their support for the nomination. I urge the swift  confirmation of Janet Yellen to ensure that President Biden has a  qualified economic team in place.   Thank you.
