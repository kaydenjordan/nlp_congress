 Mr. President, I would like to recognize an  Oregonian who was a champion for children and families in my home  State. Sarah Cohen-Doherty was a young Oregonian with a passion for  helping those most vulnerable; she left us far too soon. Sarah was  known in the Portland community to be a fierce advocate with a generous  heart, and she followed that heart into a career in public service.   After getting her master of arts in teaching from Willamette  University, Sarah worked as a community impact manager for Social  Venture Partners Portland, an organization that invests in local  nonprofit organizations and community causes. Every day, she worked  tirelessly to put needy people in touch with the organizations that  could solve their problems and improve their lives.   Sarah's public service extended outside of work hours. She was  instrumental in the effort to pass a county ballot initiative that  would go on to fund universal preschool in Multnomah County. In  November 2020, several months after her tragic, unexpected passing,  that county ballot measure passed thanks to her efforts. If that wasn't  enough, somewhere in what I can only assume was the 25th hour of the  day, Sarah also volunteered in Portland-area high schools to teach  about the Holocaust. Sarah was committed to Oregon's statewide effort  to preserve the memories of those lost in the horrific genocide and  prevent something so awful from occurring in the future. I am  incredibly proud to have known Sarah and was moved by her commitment to  equity for all children, especially Portland's youngest.   Sarah is survived by her husband Brian, stepdaughter Maysa, mother  Ruth and father Jerry. Her life will be celebrated by a community made  better by her service and incredible compassion. The impact she had  during her time here with us will be felt for generations by the  children and families she worked so incredibly hard to support and  protect. We celebrate her life and the legacy she leaves behind.                            ____________________
