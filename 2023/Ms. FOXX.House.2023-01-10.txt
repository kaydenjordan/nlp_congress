 Mr. Speaker, words matter, and ideas have consequences.  That is why House Republicans are once again changing the name of the  committee I now chair to the Committee on Education and the Workforce.   Every time Democrats take control of the House, they swap out the  word ``workforce'' for ``labor.'' This back and forth is at the core of  Republicans' and Democrats' differing views on the concept of work.   The Bible tells us that when God created Adam and Eve, He gave them  the garden to cultivate and animals to name. This was work. Being made  in the image of God means that we, like Him, have the capacity to  build, create, and bring order from chaos.   Using our God-given gifts, mankind has done just that. This ability  to work and create is something to celebrate, not lament.   Influenced by Marxism, the left prefers to call work labor. This is a  mistake. I reject the idea that work freely done is toil. I reject the  idea that work freely done is a curse. I embrace the idea that having  the opportunity to provide for one's family is a blessing.   Even those who do not adhere to a Biblical worldview can see  empirically that men and women are at their best when they get to work.   Work is fundamental to a lasting sense of fulfillment. As a small  business owner myself, I know there is nothing better than the feeling  you get when you look at something you have built with your own hands  and ingenuity.   I also prefer the word ``workforce'' over ``labor'' because all work  is of equal value. When the left refers to labor, they aren't talking  about the work of lawyers and doctors but the work of mechanics and  welders. Why? For several decades now, our culture has made a  distinction between blue-collar and white-collar work that denigrates  the former. This is wrong. Calling the men and women who keep our homes  heated and our cars running ``laborers'' degrades their contribution to  society.   We must recognize that there is more than one path to the American  Dream. Working in a high-rise office building is not of greater value  than the window washer cleaning that building. Each plays a pivotal  role in keeping our economy running.   ``Labor'' also implies that workers do not have a choice in who they  work for or what conditions they work in. In the United States, we live  in a free society, and workers have freedom to choose for whom they  work. If an employer is unfair or unjust, workers have the freedom to  find a different employer and to seek recompense.   Yet the left uses the word ``labor'' to pit workers against  employers, all in the hopes of bringing about more government control  and a radical redistribution of wealth.   The United States is the most prosperous country in history because  of our free market, but embracing socialist policies and views would  destroy that.   Democrats also insist on using the word ``labor'' because they are  beholden to Big Labor. Democrats have made it clear that they wish to  force all Americans into unions, regardless of their preference.   When Democrats oversee this committee, their efforts focus on  bolstering union bosses at the expense of employee free choice. This  myopic view serves only a small spectrum of the workforce, as the  majority of workers choose not to be in a union.   On the other hand, Republicans are committed to supporting the entire  workforce. We do not support a one-size-fits-all work model and  understand that work is as diverse as the people doing it.   So when I talk about the workforce, I am talking about all the men  and women who take pride in their work. When I talk about the  workforce, I am talking about all the men and women who work hard to  provide for their families. When I talk about the workforce, I am  talking about all the men and women who have gained the skills  necessary to be productive and self-sufficient citizens.   Under my leadership, the Committee on Education and the Workforce  will  [[Page H116]]  serve the entire workforce, no matter what color their collar is, how  dirty their hands get when they work, or whether they work  independently.   The end of Big Labor, in our hearing room, is over.                            ____________________
