 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding,  and I thank my friend who is managing on the other side.   Madam Speaker, I wanted to come just for a brief minute to clarify  what I heard on this floor. There is not a self-serving mindset today.  There is a serving of the American people, because the American people  have cried out for the reasons why domestic terrorists attacked this  place.   So I say that the Speaker worked bipartisan with Mr. Katko and Mr.  Thompson and gave us an independent commission, but that was not  accepted. So, today, we come because it is not our voices that are  demanding it, it is the American people.   Madam Speaker, I just want to say that I was here for September 11,  and it was the Democrats who had to push for the 9/11 Commission. But  even on that day, there were no Republicans or Democrats. There were no  Northerners or Southerners or West Coast or East Coast. We were not red  State or blue State. We were all simply Americans. And that is where we  find ourselves today.   Madam Speaker, I experienced at that time a gamut of emotions, as I  did on January 6. Because of the Constitution, it is necessary that we  move on this bill today.   Madam Speaker, as Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime,  Homeland Security, and Terrorism, and a senior member of the Homeland  Security, and Budget Committees, I rise in strong support of H. Res.  503, which establishes a Select Committee to Investigate the January 6  Attack on the Capitol Complex Act and charged with investigating and  reporting upon the facts and causes of the January 6, 2021 attack on  the U.S. Capitol as well as the influencing factors that may have  provoked the attack on our democracy.   Specifically, the Select Committee's mandate includes:   1. examining and evaluating evidence developed by relevant Federal,  State, and local governments, in a manner that is respectful of ongoing  investigations, regarding the facts and circumstances of the attack;   2. building upon other investigations regarding the attack and  targeted violence and domestic terrorism related to such attack; and   3. reporting its findings, conclusions, and recommendations for  corrective measures taken to prevent future acts of targeted violence  and domestic terrorism and improves the security posture of the United  States Capitol Complex in a manner that preserves the accessibility of  the Capitol Complex for all Americans, and strengthen the security and  resilience of nation and American democratic institutions against  domestic terrorism.   H. Res. 503 establishes a 13-person committee appointed by the  Speaker, with five members appointed after consultation with the House  Republican Leader.   The Select Committee is authorized to issue subpoenas to secure  information to carry out its investigation and is be required to issue  a final report with findings regarding the facts and causes of the  attack, along with recommendations to prevent future attacks on our  democratic institutions .   Like September 11, 2001, we cannot and must not ever forget the  existential threat faced by our democracy on January 6, 2021, when  thousands of domestic terrorists inspired by the 45th President stormed  the U.S. Capitol in a violent, crazed, and desperate effort to disrupt  the Joint Meeting of Congress prescribed by the Constitution to tally  the votes of presidential electors and announce the results to the  nation and the world.   Madam Speaker, the morning of September 11, 2001 is, and will always  be, a day like no other.   It is a day all living Americans will remember because not since  Pearl Harbor had there been such a dastardly and deadly attack on  American soil.   My heart still grieves for those who perished on flights United  Airlines 93, American Airlines 77, American Airlines 11, and United  Airlines 175.   When the sun rose on the morning of September 11, none of us knew  that it would end in an inferno in the magnificent World Trade Center  Towers in New York City and the Pentagon and in the grassy fields of  Shanksville, Pennsylvania.   Madam Speaker, as hard as it is to believe, out of a tragedy so  overwhelming and horrific, something good and great emerged in the  aftermath of September 11.   On that day there were no Republicans or Democrats; there were no  Northerners or Southerners or West or East Coasters.   We were not Red State or Blue State; we were all simply Americans.   On that day, we were united in our shock and anger and sadness and in  our resolve to defend our country and protect the freedoms that has  made America the greatest country in the history of the world.   I experienced the same gamut of emotions on January 6: grief, hope,  resolve, and fierce commitment to protect our country.   Madam Speaker, the assault on the U.S. Capitol by domestic terrorists  and insurrectionists rightly takes its place as one of the darkest  moments in our nation's history since the Civil War.   Madam Speaker, the January 6 insurrection caused tragic loss of life  and many injuries, while leaving behind widespread physical damage to  the Capitol Complex and emotional trauma for Members, Congressional  employees, and the Capitol Police.   It bears repeating often that the Congress and the nation owe undying  gratitude to the men and women who answered the call of constitutional  duty and heroically won the day on that bloody and deadly afternoon.   That is why I introduced H. Res. 169, a resolution commending the  officers of the United States Capitol Police Department, the  Metropolitan Police Department of Washington, DC, and other law  enforcement personnel for their selfless and heroic service in defense  of American democracy in responding to the assault on the United States  Capitol by domestic terrorists on January 6, 2021.   H. Res. 169 notes that the January 6, 2021 siege of the Capitol  assault resulted in one of the worst days of injuries for law  enforcement in the United States since the September 11,  [[Page H3330]]  2001, terrorist attacks but that the officers of the United States  Capitol Police Department, the Metropolitan Police Department of  Washington, DC, and other uniformed law enforcement officers stood  their ground in defense of American democracy while being attacked  metal pipes, discharged chemical irritants, and other weapons.   The resolution conveys the thanks and appreciation of a grateful  nation to them for their selfless and heroic service, encourages all  educational and media institutions throughout the United States to  teach and celebrate the story of their heroism and patriotism; and  calls upon all Americans to read, celebrate, and revere the  Constitution of the United States, fidelity to which is the surest best  means of forming a more perfect union, establishing justice, ensuring  domestic tranquility, providing for the common defense, promoting the  general welfare, and securing the blessing of liberty to them and their  posterity.   Madam Speaker, the domestic terrorists and seditionists who attacked  the Capitol Building on January 6, 2021 were not, as some of their  ardent defenders and apologists across the aisle have stated falsely,  on a ``normal tour visit''; nor was their effort to lay siege to the  Capitol and disrupt the processes of government an act of persons who  love their country.   And it is absurd to suggest that it was a celebration of the United  States and what it stands for when the leading edge of terrorists  desecrated the Capitol by offensively parading the treasonous  Confederate flag through the building and when, because of their  insurrection, several members of law enforcement made the supreme  sacrifice and scores more were seriously injured.   Madam Speaker, I would like to take a few moments to explain why the  intended purpose of the January 6 insurrection--to disrupt the Joint  Meeting of Congress to tally the votes of presidential electors and  announce the results to the nation and the world--was the greatest  threat to the American Experiment since the Civil War when the  proslavery forces would rather make war than let the nation survive and  the pro-freedom forces would accept war rather than let the nation  perish.   Madam Speaker, the Framers had first-hand experience with the types  of abuses and usurpations committed by political leaders who ruled them  but were not accountable to them and detailed many of those wrongs in  the Declaration of Independence.   The Framers understood and declared to the world that democratic  governors derived their powers from the knowing and voluntary consent  of the governed as expressed in free, fair, and unfettered elections  unmarred by the influence or sabotage of any foreign country or entity  not a member of the political community.   The Framers understood that if elections are influenced by foreign  actors or authoritarian forces within, then voters are reduced from the  great role of citizens to mere subjects, and government for and by the  people is a sham.   The most important feature of a democracy is that it is the voters  who alone can confer the legitimate consent and authorization necessary  to govern upon the governors who are then duty-bound to represent the  voters' interests, and only their interests.   Madam Speaker, the fundamental democratic compact between the  governed and the governors is that the latter's authority and  continuance in office comes exclusively from the governed and  allegiance is owed exclusively to the governed.   This agreement can only be reached through free and fair elections, a  breach of which threatens the vitality and viability of the social  contract upon which democratic self-rule of, by, and for the people  depends.   Madam Speaker, President Lincoln called the United States the ``last  best hope of man on earth'' and stated at Gettysburg the importance of  finishing the work we are in to ensure that ``government of the people,  for the people, by the people does not perish from the earth.''   By our actions in voting to establish and empower a Select Committee  to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the Capitol Complex, we are  taking an indispensable step in ensuring the preservation of our  democracy, which has been the envy of the world for than 240 years.   I urge all Members to join me in voting for H. Res. 503, establishing  a Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the Capitol  Complex Act.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, this bill is so important to the Nation  and to Texas that I had to come and rename it: Repair, innovate,  restore, inspire.  [[Page H3513]]    Thank you for the INVEST in America Act that looks at social equity,  that realizes we cannot concrete our way to a better quality of life,  that also invests in those issues of dams and bayous and roads and  bridges, but at the same time recognizes the economic engine that  climate change is, the economic engine that investment in workers is,  and, as well, recognizes that we have a new day in America where  transit is for everyone.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for giving us transit for America.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Kansas for  her leadership, and I want to take a moment to thank Mr. DeFazio for  this transformative legislation that is really going to move America,  not just in mobility, but in quality of life.   Mr. Speaker, I want to also take a moment to offer my sympathy to a  family in my community, the Cummings family, whose mother was killed as  she brought her son to the United States Naval Academy in the last 48  hours. I hope that we will pray for them at this time.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to take this moment to dedicate this  amendment that Mr. Espaillat and myself introduced to bicyclists,  motorcyclists, pedestrians, and wheelchair users, and particularly to  Jamail Harris, who was killed on a motorcycle in an intersection at  Highway 288.   This amendment that I am offering in the name of others, such as  Lesha White, Jesus Perez, David Leon Loya, is evidence of the dangers  of mobility in the form of bikes and pedestrians in the city of  Houston.   In the past 16 years, the Houston area has seen 2,000 deaths of  bicyclists and pedestrians, an average of 100 a year, with the last 3  years seeing the rate increase to 150 a year, according to Federal  statistics.   The amendment that I am offering is an amendment that deals  specifically with the safety legislation that causes the Department of  Transportation to work with local entities to decide where those  dollars will go, where the crashes or the numbers of crashes or the  incidences with pedestrians and bike riders and motorcycles are at  their highest. Listen to the community.   This is in the name of those who have lost their lives, these  families who have lost a life: one crashed in a school bus; one was a  lady helping a wheelchair get across the street, and she stopped a car  and a car ran into her and the wheelchair. I think it is extremely  important in this particular amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to indicate that I thank Mr. DeFazio for the  legislation that allows a new redoing of Scott Street in an earmark, a  community assessment that we are able to utilize for Scott Street to  make a difference in that area.   Mr. Speaker, I want to mention my next amendment that directs the EPA  Administrator to establish and implement a program under which the  Administrator may award grants to community water systems to carry out  activities to educate and assist persons served by the community water  system and adapting and responding to acts and natural hazards,  including subzero temperatures.    Mr. Speaker, this has to do with the freeze that we  had in Houston, and I am very grateful for this amendment because there  were more than 100 people who died.   Mr. Speaker, my second amendment has to do with wastewater. A recent  report suggested that wastewater resources in facilities in urban and  rural areas were at their lowest. This forces a study to determine how  to improve and to ensure that those kinds of resources for wastewater  and sewage are equal in rural and urban areas as would be otherwise.   I am grateful for these amendments because they will change lives,  and certainly, the bike amendment will allow us to be able to save  lives.  [[Page H3572]]     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Invest in America Act (RCP  117-8 and RCP 117-9; H.R. 3684), and the Jackson Lee Amendments  incorporated in the Chairman's En Bloc Amendment.   Let me thank Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for their hard work in  crafting and shepherding the legislative package before us today.   I thank the staff of the Transportation Committee for working with me  and my staff on the three Jackson Lee Amendments that are included in  the En Bloc Amendment.   These amendments are intended to make a good bill better.   The first amendment I want to speak to you about is intended to make  walking, biking, motorcycling, and other pedestrian travel safer by  making changes to the new ``Safe Streets'' program already in the bill  to allow local input in decisions by state Department of Transportation  on projects intended to reduce fatalities of vulnerable road users.   This Jackson Lee-Espaillat Amendment gives local governments more  control over where the funds for the new ``Safe Streets'' program are  spent, by requiring state Departments of Transportation to consult with  the local governments before carrying out these complete streets'  projects.   The ``Safe Streets'' program sets aside safety funds to reduce  fatalities and serious injuries on public roads, with a focus on  vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, bicyclists, scooters users,  and motorcyclist.   The amendment will support local governments by giving them a voice  in the implementation of projects intended to address high crash areas  where pedestrian fatalities occur.   The goal of this amendment is to make more efficient the learning  curve of State Departments of Transportation on methods, strategies and  policies that yield proven reductions in deaths.   We can and must do a better job of making the roads safer for  everyone--including bike riders.   As the nation celebrates its first Juneteenth Independence Day, it  was an added bonus for participants to take a bike ride from Galveston  to Houston along routes once used by former slaves to travel from the  island to their new lives in the city of Houston and beyond.   The 58-mile bike route is scenic and historic with lush green spaces,  and eclectic neighborhoods--that are linked by trails, park land and  roads.   This event is a welcomed recent addition to the 156-year history of  Juneteenth celebrations in the Galveston Houston area, and this year's  jubilation was more exuberant with the knowledge that the entire nation  joined us in the festivities.   The bike ride is not a race, but a leisure activity that all members  of the family can enjoy.   There are adequate rest breaks along the way to visit historic sites  like a trailer exhibit of memorabilia about Marshall Walter ``Major''  Taylor who was born on November 26, 1878.   Taylor became a professional cyclist at 18 and won the sprint event  at the 1899 world track championships at the age of 20 to become the  first African American to achieve the level of cycling world champion.   Another rest stop is at the 1867 Settlement, which was the home of  newly freed slaves who bought property to form a community that would  later be well known for the cowboy skills of its residents.   A little-known fact is that some of the skills featured at Rodeos owe  their invention or refinement to black cowboys--a term used to  distinguish between whites and blacks.   Whites were called cow hands and blacks referred to as ``cow boys,''  which later became the term for everyone working with cattle regardless  of race.   Some well-known rodeo contests skills owe a thanks to black cowboys  like Bill Pickett (1870-1932), who invented the form of steer wrestling  called ``bulldogging,'' and Jesse Stahl (c. 1879-1935), who was a  bronco rider.   The pleasure of riding bikes has and continues to be an important  source of recreation and exercise for millions of people who ride  routinely or occasionally, which is evidenced by the growth in  popularity of this biking event.   Unfortunately, biking is not always so carefree as this event held on  Juneteenth weekend.   The reality for too many bicyclists is the dread and fear they  sometimes experience while riding in residential, rural, or urban  spaces.   In June 2019, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  published its traffic fatality report which showed a one percent  decrease in traffic fatalities and a four percent increase in  pedestrian fatalities, but a whopping 10 percent increase in bicyclist  fatalities.   On May 9, 2021, a hit-and-run driver who allegedly ran a red light  slammed into a motorcycle, killing the rider.   Despite less traffic on the road in 2020 due to the pandemic and a 2  percent reduction in motorcycle crashes nationally, safety officials  are alarmed by a 17 percent increase in Texas motorcycle fatalities in  2020 compared to 2019.   On average, a motorcyclist is killed in a crash on Texas roads every  day.   Last year, 482 died, accounting for 12 percent of all traffic  fatalities statewide.   In my city of Houston, just last month, a driver allegedly ran a red  light and struck and killed a motorcyclist on Highway 288.   The incident happened along Holly Hall and Highway 288, the South  Freeway.   Witnesses told police a pickup or SUV ran the light and struck a  motorcyclist, who was heading westbound on Holly Hall.   The motorcyclist had a green light, police believe.   The suspect, who was believed to be in a white or light color  vehicle, briefly stopped but then sped away.   The motorcyclist died at the scene.   On March 30, 2019, in the city of Houston, at the intersection of  North Shepherd Drive and West 10th Street, located in the 18th  Congressional District of Texas, Lesha White, 54, was driving with her  daughters when she saw Jesus ``Jesse'' Perez struggling to cross the  intersection in a wheelchair.   Ms. White pulled over and got out of her car to help Mr. Perez cross  the street when another vehicle struck them, and they were both killed.   On March 7, 2019, 23-year-old David Leon Loya was killed in a  collision with a school bus while riding his bicycle in The Heights  area of Houston.   Police report that Mr. Loya was in the bike lane and tried to avoid  the accident by sliding under the bus, but unfortunately, he was run  over by the back axle.   This young man was greatly loved by his family and is missed by the  people he helped through his volunteer work, and the bicyclist  community.   I offer this amendment in remembrance of Lesha White, Jesus ``Jesse''  Perez, David Leon Loya, and all of the other pedestrians and bicyclists  who have lost their lives in accidents with motor vehicles in urban  areas.   In the past sixteen years, the Houston area has seen 2,000 deaths of  bicyclists and pedestrians, at an average of 100 a year, with the last  three years seeing the rate increase to 150 a year, according to  federal statistics.   In 2017, the most recent year for which comprehensive statistics are  available, according to the Texas Department of Transportation  (``TDOT''), the numbers were no more encouraging.   According to TDOT, 1,409 Houston-area pedestrians were injured in  roadways crashes:   1. 275 of them were injured seriously;   2. 146 pedestrians were killed in roadways crashes;   3. 639 bicyclists were injured in roadways crashes; and   4. 82 bicyclists were injured seriously.   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has called the  number of deaths a'' public health crisis.''   The problem is no more encouraging on the national level, as Texas  ranks third nationwide in bicycle deaths, behind California and  Florida.   Nationwide, the number of fatal bicyclist accidents is rising and are  also amounting to a greater percentage of total traffic fatalities.   Cities are uniquely susceptible to this problem, as the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that 70 percent of  bicycle fatalities occur in cities.   The Jackson Lee Amendment amends Section 12020 of the Water Quality  Protection and Job Creation Act of 2021, which is Division H of Rules  Committee Print 117-9, and requires the EPA Administrator to initiate a  study on the distribution of wastewater infrastructure funds to rural  communities, economically disadvantaged communities, and Tribal  communities during the 20 fiscal years preceding the date of enactment  of this Act.   Among other things, the legislation requires that in conducting this  study, the EPA Administrator:   1. consult with other Federal agencies, State, local, and Tribal  governments, owners and operators of publicly owned treatment works,  and stakeholder organizations;   2. undertake at least one public meeting in a rural community, in an  economically disadvantaged community, and in a Tribal community, to  receive testimony from the public;   3. examine whether the distribution of wastewater infrastructure  funds during the period covered by the study has been in accordance  with any applicable executive order or policy regarding environmental  justice; and   4. examine how wastewater infrastructure funds have been distributed  with respect to the identified needs of rural communities, economically  disadvantaged communities, and Tribal communities, and whether such  funds have addressed the needs of such communities equitably.   These are all laudable requirements; the Jackson Lee Amendment goes a  step further and adds a fifth requirement that the EPA Administrator  endeavor to calculate, measure,  [[Page H3573]]  and ``document the harm and injury caused by any identified inequities  in the distribution of wastewater infrastructure funds with respect to  the identified needs of rural communities, economically disadvantaged  communities, and Tribal communities.''   The events of the past year have laid bare for the nation and world  the systemic inequalities that unfortunately still exist in too many  sectors of American life, including the health care, education, and  criminal justice systems, housing patterns, and environmental quality  of life.   The path-breaking 2019 study and report, ``Flushed and Forgotten:  Sanitation and Wastewater in the Rural United States,'' conducted by  the Alabama Center for Rural Enterprise (ACRE), the Columbia Law School  Human Rights Clinic, and the Institute for the Study of Human Rights at  Columbia University concluded:   Sanitation is essential to everyday functions such as urination and  defecation. Without a system in place to dispose of wastewater,  individuals experience environmental contamination and health risks.  Common risks include infections such as hookworm and other tropical  diseases that were thought to be eradicated in the United States. These  can have serious impacts on health, including development, pregnancy,  and reproductive capacity. The perpetual appearance of wastewater in  and around homes that occur when systems are absent or failing, takes a  significant toll on mental health and the ability of individuals to  live with dignity.   These communities do not have the luxury to flush and forget as raw  sewage backs up into their yards and homes.   A lack of adequate sanitation can also perpetuate cycles of poverty  and marginalization through negative impacts on health, education, and  employment.   The burden for improving sanitation systems currently rests primarily  on homeowners, who receive little government support.   Securing sanitation can be costly, especially for individuals who  lack access to central wastewater systems.   Further, in some jurisdictions, failure to comply with sanitation 1  regulations leads to fines and criminal records, in effect  criminalizing poverty.   This criminalization compounds the challenges already faced by  individuals living in poverty.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 15 requires the EPA Administrator to  document identified results from disparate treatment in the  distribution of wastewater funding to rural areas and communities of  color.   We cannot begin to pursue and implement effective measures to  ameliorate the damage caused until we know the extent of the injury,  which is the purpose of the Jackson Lee Amendment.   My next amendment to RCP 117-9 directs the EPA Administrator to  establish and implement a program under which the Administrator may  award grants to community water systems to carry out activities to  educate and assist persons served by the community water system in  adapting and responding to malevolent acts and natural hazards,  including sub-zero temperatures, that disrupt the provision of safe  drinking water or significantly affect the public health or the safety  or supply of drinking water provided to communities and individuals.   This past February, a historic cold outbreak led in the coldest air  in decades across the United States, reaching all the way to the Rio  Grande and bringing record amounts of snow and ice to the Deep South.   Over 154 million people, or roughly half the population of the  country, were in subfreezing temperatures.   1. Dallas dipped to 5 degrees Fahrenheit, the coldest temperature the  city has seen since 1989.   2. Oklahoma City hit 6 degrees below zero, the city's coldest  temperature since 1989, and the wind chill reached a record 29 degrees  below zero.   3. Austin and San Antonio in Texas both had single-digit temperatures  for the first time since 1989.   4. Corpus Christi, Texas, dipped down to 17 degrees, the coldest it's  been there since 1989.   5. Rapid City, South Dakota has had five consecutive nights of 12  degrees below zero. The last time this happened was in 1943.   6. The wind chill dipped to 32 degrees below zero in Kansas City,  Missouri, the lowest since 1989.   7. Monday's high of 3 degrees below zero and a low of 21 degrees  below zero was the coldest day in Omaha, Nebraska, in 25 years.   Texas power providers, Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT),  and Entergy Corporation, did not provide the needed weatherization of  power generating and delivery equipment after being warned in 2011  after a cold snap that the system would fail if these steps where not  taken.   What made matters worse was the Texas electric grid was not connected  to neighboring electric grids so that it could take power from other  electricity generating sources onto the Texas grid to heat homes or  businesses.   Today, too many families mourn the loss of a loved one, including the  mother of 11-year-old Cristian Pineda, after he and his family were  trapped in their mobile home for two days without electricity.   Nearly 8.8 million people--approximately a third of the state's total  population--still experienced water disruptions on Sunday evening,  according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.   The disruptions impacted more than 1,200 public water systems in 199  counties in the state, and about 147 public water systems serving  ``just under'' 120,000 people were nonoperational.   Active duty troops from Fort Hood, Texas, helped to provide clean  water to local inmates at jails in several towns in Texas that were  struggling to restore water supplies in the wake of the extremely cold  weather, and the Texas Agriculture Commissioner announced that grocery  stores were unable to get shipments of some products, and severe  weather conditions had created a ``food supply chain problem like we've  never seen before, even with Covid-19.''   No one was prepared for five days of subfreezing temperatures, ice  and snow-covered roads, and a failed energy grid throughout the state  of Texas.   That is why Jackson Lee Amendment No. 18 is necessary; to ensure that  should we experience another once-in-a-century ice storm like we did  earlier this year, that Americans will be prepared to ride it out  without unnecessary loss of life and minimal economic and physical  damage.   I thank the Rules Committee for making the Jackson Lee Amendments in  order and Chairman DeFazio for including them in the Chair's En Bloc  Amendment, and I urge all Members to vote for the Amendment and the  underlying legislation, the Invest in America Act of 2021.
