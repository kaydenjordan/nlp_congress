 Mr. Speaker, I rise also in support of  the Jackie Walorski Maternal and Child Home Visiting Reauthorization  Act of 2022.   Programs like these are essential and they deliver meaningful results  that strengthen our families and our communities.   In West Virginia, the MIECHV program has made over 21,159 home  visits, served 1,556 families, and impacted over 1,943 children. The  program supports our vulnerable pregnant women, and it comes alongside  parents with young children to ensure that they all have the resources  that they need to raise their children.   I also, of course, take a moment to recognize my dear friend and  colleague, Jackie Walorski, who this bill is named after.   Jackie was my mentor in Congress when I first came here and she very  quickly became my friend. We shared meals together, good conversation,  and her office was even directly across from mine in the same hall.   It was my pleasure to serve alongside her on the Worker and Family  Support Subcommittee. Her leadership and her passion for these issues  are reflected in this bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of this  resolution.
