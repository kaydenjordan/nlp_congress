 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Ro Khanna for organizing this  today and holding this particular Special Order about Janus v. AFSCME.  But, actually, the larger question is: What kind of shape will America  be in if the Supreme Court makes the wrong decision?   We envision, in the Progressive Caucus, an America in which parents  can dream about their kids being able to go to college. We believe that  you ought to be able to put food on the table. You ought to be able to  get a good job and earn a decent pay and have a voice on your job. You  ought to be able to turn on the water faucet and drink the water. You  ought to be able to drive down the road without busting the axle on  your car. You ought to be able to have safe affordable transit to get  to where you have got to go.   We don't think this is too much to ask. This is something that other  countries in the world have. We think you ought to be able to go to the  doctor if you are sick. Now, the guarantor of all those things for so  many years has been people coming together and organizing themselves  into a group that argued and negotiated with their employer for a fair  wage. They negotiated with their employer, and they said: Look, you  know, you want us to supply labor? We will do it. You have got to pay  us right. You have got to make sure the benefits package is right. You  have got to make sure that this thing is making sense, not just for  you, but for us, too.   And, for many years, employers who didn't want to see strikes and  didn't want to see labor shutdowns, and wanted to stop the turnover  that you would see, and wanted to make sure that there was labor peace,  came to an agreement, and said: Okay, we will work with you.   And between World War II and right up until about 1970, even a little  beyond, that bargain helped create the world's greatest middle class.  It wasn't easy to get a cohesive union movement. In fact, there was a  time in American history where being in a union was a criminal offense.  They called the Pinkertons in. They beat you down. There is a lot of  labor blood that has been spilled in this country in order to have a  labor movement, but we have got one.   And by 1957, a year that had racism and segregation, sexism and  homophobia, had one thing going, and that was about 35 percent of all  Americans were in a union, and about 35 percent more were paid as if  they were. So the unions were setting the wage scale, and they helped  create an American middle class, which really is what we think of when  we think of America at its best economically.    The union movement didn't just stop at labor issues. It went further  than that. It was the UAW that helped fund the March on Washington. The  march for jobs and justice was funded by organized labor. It was labor  that stood with those sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee, when  they were on strike and Martin Luther King came down to march with  them. It was AFSCME--AFSCME, the American Federation of State, County,  and Municipal Employees--who had the back of those workers in Memphis.  And when we lost the great Martin Luther King just about 50 years ago,  AFSCME was by the side of those workers. And those workers literally  won that strike, and many of them are still around to talk about it  today.   These folks made it so that in 1968 you had a rate of poverty that  was much lower than it is today. You had CEOs that made about 20 times  more than their average worker. Today, that is 339 to 1, and that is  just the median. In fact, you have companies like Mattel that make  almost 5,000 times--the CEO makes 5,000 times the average worker.  McDonald's, the CEO makes 3,100 times the average worker. Kohl's, the  CEO makes 1,200 times the average worker.   But in 1968, with its strong union movement, we had an emerging civil  rights movement. We had a minimum wage that was probably in the  neighborhood, as has been mentioned, that was livable at the time, if  you compare it to inflation. You had a rate of poverty where fewer  people were in poverty. You had a ratio between workers and CEO which  was much more rational.   And something interesting happened beginning in the 1970s; there came  an organized concerted attack on labor. And people will tell you that  in 1980, after Ronald Reagan was elected, he went out on the campaign  trail saying that he was for working people, but shortly after he got  in office, he dismissed the air traffic controllers.   When he broke that strike and he broke those workers, it set working  people in this country on a trajectory, which brings us to where we are  now, which is stagnating wages for literally three, four decades. The  CEOs have done great. And if you ask Donald Trump, he will tell you:  Oh, yeah, you know, the stock market is booming out of control. We are  doing fine.  [[Page H4686]]    But, you know, in this America, our America, this largesse is not  shared by most people. My colleague, Pramila Jayapal, mentioned earlier  that about 67 percent of Americans would not know what to do if they  were hit with a $1,000 bill. They don't have it. But there are even  other statistics that are as jarring, as equally upsetting. Other  statistics would show just how difficult it is for Americans to pay  their bills.   Now, I know we are talking about Janus today. I am getting there. But  there is a recent story that I want to share with you, and we can  submit it for the Record, and the title of this story, Mr. Speaker, is  ``More Than 40 Percent of Americans Can't Pay Their Bills.'' That is  the name of the story, and it says: ``Donald Trump thinks the economy  is doing great--way, way better than under Obama. Actually, Obama  created more jobs on his way out the door than Trump has so far.   ``But that's besides the point.''   The story says, based on this research, the conclusion of the  research: ``43 percent of us struggle to pay our bills, and 34 percent  are suffering `material hardships,' including `running out of food, not  being able to afford a place to live, or lacking the money to seek  medical treatment.' ''   The truth is, Mr. Speaker, is that we live in a Nation that is  lurching toward plutocracy. We live in a Nation that is lurching toward  oligopoly and oligarchs, because the people who make the hamburgers,  they don't benefit in the profits of the company. The CEO does that.  The people who make the clothes and work for Kohl's and work their job,  they don't benefit. They just get survival wages, and the executives  take it all home for themselves.   Part of the reason is a conservative philosophy which says that  companies should not have to pay any taxes. They shouldn't have to  abide by any regulations. They should be allowed to slam labor cost to  the ground, if they can, and then the CEO should be able to walk away  with all the money. And then the theory goes that they will use that  money to invest in plant and equipment, and then everybody will be  better off. But that never happens.   That Republican philosophy, that conservative philosophy, is  absolutely and utterly bankrupt. It doesn't work. It is not true. And,  yet, we keep on doing it over and over again. But part of this  philosophy is the union busting. And they have been on a 40-year  trajectory of trying to break the union.   I mentioned PATCO a little while ago, when Reagan broke PATCO. That  sent a shockwave that reverberated even until the moment we are in now,  and it is culminating in this attack on Janus.   Let me tell you, they have been trolling around for a worker, a  public employee, to try to break Janus--break public employees for  years. A few years ago, right before the Supreme Court Justice Antonin  Scalia passed, there was a case before the Supreme Court called the  Frederick case. And in that case, it is exactly like the Janus case.  Why are they similar? Because right-wing law firms are trolling the  country looking for any public employee to try to attack the union and  attack fair share. That is what they have been doing.   They have been going around: Will you take the case? Can we represent  you? Can we represent you? And they finally found somebody, this guy,  Janus. And he makes the outrageous claim that he--who benefits from  collective bargaining and who the union expends money to make sure he  has a decent contract--he is saying: Oh, this is unfair. My free speech  rights are going into this union, and I don't want that to happen.   Well, they are not, actually. All they are doing is assessing a  reasonable fee that is associated with the cost of negotiating on his  behalf to have a better wage. But he says: No, I want to be able to  benefit from the work that the union does, but I don't want to pay  anything. It is quite ridiculous. But that is the case that is in the  Supreme Court right now.   You know, you want to know what is in the First Amendment? The right  to freedom of assembly. The right to freedom of assembly is in the  Constitution. And if some workers want to assemble together and  negotiate for better wages and better benefits with their employer, I  believe they have a constitutional right to do so.                                time  1800    What I don't think you have a constitutional right to do is to be a  freeloader, which is what Janus is arguing. He is saying: I want to be  able to benefit from what the union negotiates on my behalf, but I  don't want to pay anything.   He doesn't have to pay into the fund that goes to political stuff. He  doesn't have to pay for that. That issue has been decided. It is not  required under the law that he help fund candidates or issues that he  doesn't want to support. But it is fair, and it is right, and it is  reasonable, and the Supreme Court has found in the past that an  assessment on employees for the cost of representation is fair and  constitutional. Now, this is a case called the Abood case where this  was found to be constitutional. What they want to do is flip Abood and  say: No, you can now be a freeloader.   Let me just say to my good friend from California, our law has been  favoring the employer over the worker for years now. Here is the law  right now. If you are an employer and you fire a worker because they  are trying to organize a union, that is not legal to do. But guess  what? That worker can file, but they can't file a private lawsuit; they  have to file under the National Labor Relations Act. They can't get  punitive and treble damages. They can't do discovery. They just have to  go through the NLRB process, which takes quite a long time, according  to most workers who go through it. And when they do go through it, all  they can ever get is back pay, minus whatever they earned after they  were fired illegally.   This is a very small price to pay for people who are exercising what  I believe is a constitutional right to freedom of assembly and freedom  of expression. But why shouldn't you fire them because, hey, it is the  worst of the cost of doing business for some employers who don't want a  union?   Another example of how unfair the situation is an employer can tell  the workers: You better be in the cafeteria tomorrow because there is a  union drive, and I want to threaten you and scare you and tell you all  the reasons why it is a bad idea.   This is called captive audience.   Can the union go into the same plant and say, ``Well, now we want to  give you our side of why you do need a union''?   They cannot do it. It is not fair. It is like having an election,  where the rights of the workers will be determined by the election, and  yet only one side gets to be able to go and argue in the negative.   By the way, if the employer said, ``Come to the meeting, we are going  to tell you why you do need a union,'' that would be an unfair labor  practice.   It is crazy, really. But it is the kind of world that a guy like Neil  Gorsuch thinks would be a good one. This is the guy who was, in my  view, illegally put on the Supreme Court of the United States-- illegally.   The Constitution says that the sitting President gets to offer a  replacement for a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Barack Obama did that,  and the head of the Senate Republicans, who was in the majority, said:  We will not hear anybody.   Do you know what? The role of the Senate is to give advice and  consent. They can say, ``We think that this guy is not qualified'';  they can say that this guy has a judicial temperament that is not  proper; they can criticize that nominee any way they want to. But one  thing they cannot do is say: We simply will not discharge our  constitutional responsibility. But that is what they did do because  nobody can make them do otherwise.   They did it because they could do it, but it was wrong. It was  actually immoral, and it was an abuse of their responsibility as  Members of the United States Senate. But they didn't care. They want  power--raw, naked power. That is what they did, and somehow they got  away with it because they got Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. This  is the guy who was a deciding vote in a case that, I believe, is a  foreshadowing of what we are going to see in Janus.   Just the other day, a case called Murphy Oil was decided--Monday.  Neil Gorsuch cast a deciding vote in a Supreme Court decision that  ruled, for  [[Page H4687]]  the first time, that bosses can forbid their workers from joining  together in class action lawsuits to challenge violations of the  Federal labor laws. This is an outrageous usurpation.   Bringing a complaint against your boss or your company is expensive  and risky, especially for workers who have no safety net. Congresswoman  Jayapal just got through telling you how stressed to the wall American  workers are, and yet those workers, who don't have much money, are now  told that they cannot come together in a class action suit to challenge  violations of Federal labor law. They have to pursue these claims  individually. They don't have a chance. The bargaining position power  is absolutely unequal, and yet that is what we got.   Decisions like this are why Mitch McConnell and Republicans have  engaged in the historic obstruction to block President Obama from  filling the Supreme Court vacancy for nearly a year. They wanted an  ideologue like Neil Gorsuch to tip antiworker cases like this.   So what is going to happen in Janus? I hate to admit it, but even I,  who consider myself quite optimistic, believe that: Look, they put Neil  Gorsuch on the Supreme Court to destroy public employee bargaining;  that is why he is there. I have no illusions about what is about to  happen. But it is just like other unjust Supreme Court decisions that  have happened, along the lines of Shelby County, which destroyed the  Voting Rights Act, or along the lines of Citizens United, which  basically said that corporations can dump massive amounts of money into  elections.   Who has a massive amount of money? You know. America's corporate  elites.   And then it goes all the way back to unjust decisions like the  Lochner case or even Dred Scott.   History will look very dimly on this moment in time. I believe that  when you crush decency and fairness to earth, it does rise. And I  believe that workers of this country, if they are prohibited by the law  and the Supreme Court from being treated fairly, they are just going to  start going on strike all over the place, just like the teachers just  showed us that they would. They are just going to start going on  strike, and we will just settle it out in the street. This is  unfortunate.    Wouldn't it be much better to have fair bargaining and come to the  table and negotiate decent wages and benefits? Of course it would be.   Those teachers didn't want to go on strike. They wanted to be in the  classroom teaching those kids.   But whether it is Arizona, North Carolina, or Oklahoma, these people,  who dedicated their lives to young people, had to go out on the trail,  go out on the strike line, just so that they could get a decent  situation for those kids and themselves. Those teachers said: These  kids' learning environment is our work environment. Both are bad. So we  have to strike. We have been given no alternative but to do so.   So they did, and they got some justice out of it.   This is what the likes of Neil Gorsuch and Janus v. AFSCME are  pushing the American labor picture towards. It is too bad, but I have  great faith in the American worker. They will not take this lying down,  and we will be on the picket line with them.
