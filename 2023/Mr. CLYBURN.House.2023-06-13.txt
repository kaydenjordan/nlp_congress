 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce that I have just  filed a discharge petition on the resolution providing for the  consideration of H.R. 2403, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2023.   Saturday, June 17, will mark 8 years since the massacre at one of the  country's most historic churches, Emanuel AME Church in Charleston,  South Carolina.   That racially motivated attack took nine parishioners' lives and  injured three others as they participated in a Bible study. It also  exposed a loophole in our firearm background check system known as the  ``Charleston loophole,'' that allows individuals to purchase firearms  prior to an approval of their background check.   Tragically, that very loophole enabled the gunman, who I might add  was not eligible to purchase a firearm, to acquire a firearm and commit  that horrendous act.   The Brady Act mandates criminal background checks for all gun sales  at licensed firearm dealers through the National Instant Criminal  Background Check System, NICS. Though most checks process within  minutes, and 97 percent are completed within 3 business days, if NICS  has not completed its background check in 3 days, regardless of the  reason, the dealer can proceed with the firearm sale.   In Charleston, just because a gunman's background check had not been  completed within the 3 days, the shop had already sold the gun before  he was deemed to be ineligible.   Every year, thousands of weapons are purchased through this loophole  that otherwise should be prohibited due to criminal records or other  factors--more than 5,200 in 2021 alone. Though this problem was  discovered too late for the 12 victims at the Emanuel AME Church, we  must narrow this loophole to prevent future tragedies.   Since 2015, I have introduced the Enhanced Background Checks Act, and  it passed the House in the 116th and 117th Congresses. This bill  provides the FBI with crucial additional time to complete the  background check on a potential firearms purchaser before a licensed  dealer can transfer a gun.   If a background check has not been completed after 10 business days,  a purchaser may request an expedited review by the FBI. This request  for an expedited review will trigger a more intensive FBI  investigation, designed to resolve the case within an additional 10- business-day period.   If the additional 10 business days elapse without a response from the  NICS system, only then may the dealer sell or transfer the gun to the  purchaser. Transactions for prospective purchasers who do not request  an expedited review cannot proceed until their background check is  resolved.   While I would hope that House Republican leadership would recognize  the harm caused by the Charleston loophole and would bring this bill to  the floor for a vote, this discharge petition would make that happen  even if they remain unwilling. With strong support in the Democratic  Caucus, we just need a handful of Republican colleagues willing to put  partisanship aside and do the right thing for the American people.   I would respectfully ask that they reflect upon the nine parishioners  who lost their lives at Emanuel AME Church 8 years ago. I hope they  will conclude that to prevent lives from being needlessly lost in the  future, they must ensure that the Enhanced Background Check Act of 2023  be enacted into law to finally close the Charleston loophole. That  starts with signing this discharge petition.   Madam Speaker, I close my comments by indicating that on Saturday,  while I will be pausing in the morning to say a prayer for the families  of these nine souls, I will go to Bethel AME Church in Columbia to  celebrate the homegoing of Ms. Elise Martin, who when she lived in  Charleston and came into my life, often worshipped at Emanuel AME  Church.   Fortunately, the good Lord allowed her to live for 108 years. The  pastor of Emanuel AME Church lost his life.                            ____________________
