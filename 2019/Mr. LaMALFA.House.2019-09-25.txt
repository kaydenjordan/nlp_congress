 Madam Speaker, I want to point out a unique opportunity  for viewing. The U.S. Park Service, their division of the Historic  Vehicle Association, places on display in The National Mall, several  times a year, unique vehicles with unique histories.   Right now, in a glass case just a couple of blocks from here in The  National Mall is the 1966 Volkswagen van that belonged to Esau and  Janie Jenkins from South Carolina, who were longtime revered civil  rights leaders back in the day, transporting people to rallies and to  get them out to vote and for voter registration, education, all sorts  of things in the civil rights movement, starting back in the 1940s  until they obtained this van and used it for many years.   It was brought out from a field where it had been deteriorating over  many years. It was brought back to life in this display for everyone to  see in this glass case. It will be here for the rest of the week.   I encourage people to go down and check that out and see what the  Historic Vehicle Association is doing.                            ____________________
