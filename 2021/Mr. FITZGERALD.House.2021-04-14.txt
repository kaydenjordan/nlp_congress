 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1487.   Unlike large businesses with access to debt and equity markets, small  businesses rely on commercial banking to fund their operations. Should  a creditworthy small business be unable to obtain a conventional  business loan, the Small Business Administration can help the small  business by offering access to capital through the microloan program.  The microloan program allows nonprofit intermediaries to make loans of  up to $50,000 to small businesses, along with technical assistance.   The program has grown from approving $52 million in loans in 2015 to  over $80 million in 2019. Despite this growth, the SBA produces minimal  statistics that are needed to evaluate a government guarantee loan  program.   This commonsense legislation will require the SBA to produce an  annual report detailing additional information about microloans that  have defaulted and the number of loans provided to rural areas.   We owe it to Americans to conduct basic oversight to protect their  taxpayer dollars while expanding opportunities for rural small  businesses to grow and innovate.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill to ensure small businesses hit  hard by the pandemic have robust access to capital, regardless of their  size and location.
