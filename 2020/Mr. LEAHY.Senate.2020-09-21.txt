 Mr. President, I am here with an incredibly heavy heart.  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg--a tireless, legendary champion of equality  who reshaped our society for the better--passed away on Friday, the  first eve of Rosh Hashanah. Adherents of the Jewish faith believe that  a person who passes away during the High Holidays is a person of great  righteousness. Truer words could not be spoken of Justice Ginsburg.  Standing just over 5 feet tall, she was a giant among us, a moral  beacon whose life and legacy have inspired millions of Americans to do  their part to bring upon a more perfect and just union. We are all  forever indebted to her.   The Brooklyn-born daughter of working-class Jewish parents, the young  girl who would become just the second woman to serve on the Supreme  Court knew from early on she had to fight for a place in the world. And  what a fighter she was.   When she entered Harvard Law School in 1956, just 1 of 9 women in a  class of over 500, the United States was truly a man's world. Women  were expected to stay home and out of the workplace. Even when they had  jobs, they could be fired for getting pregnant  [[Page S5723]]  and they otherwise earned barely half of what men earned for the same  work. Women couldn't get credit cards without their husband's consent.  As Justice Ginsburg remarked some years later, these and other gender- based rules helped to ``keep women not on a pedestal, but in a cage.''   Justice Ginsburg refused to accept the status quo. She believed  unwaveringly that equal justice under law fundamentally required gender  equality. When she joined the ACLU's Women's Rights Project in the  early 1970s, she waged a systematic legal campaign against gender  discrimination, and she ultimately won five out of six of the cases she  took to the Supreme Court. She eloquently and incisively convinced the  then all-male Court to see--and strike down--the visible and invisible  lines that kept the genders unequal.   In Reed v. Reed, she convinced the Supreme Court for the very first  time that the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment barred  discrimination on the basis of sex, enshrining constitutional  protections for generations of women and men. During oral arguments,  she spoke quietly yet confidently, piercing through dense legal  arguments with moral clarity.   In Frontiero v. Richardson, in which she convinced the Court to end  gender discrimination in the administration of military benefits, her  words resonate powerfully today. She said:         In asking the Court to declare sex a suspect criterion . .       . ``I ask no favor for my sex. All I ask of our brethren is       that they take their feet off our necks.''    Within a few short years, Justice Ginsburg had already empowered  millions of American women through her zealous advocacy, granting them  more autonomy over their lives, their bodies, and their careers. She  was widely hailed as the Thurgood Marshall of women's rights. She could  have simply rested on her laurels from that point forward.   She was just getting started. In 1980, President Carter nominated her  to be an appellate judge on the DC Circuit. I was so proud to vote for  her confirmation back then, 40 years ago. There she developed a  reputation as a pragmatic consensus seeker, often finding common ground  and building friendships with conservative judges. One of the best  known of those friendships was hers and Justice Antonin Scalia.   It was no surprise that in 1993, President Bill Clinton selected Ruth  Bader Ginsburg to be Justice of the Supreme Court. He called her--and I  am rather proud to say that she and her husband were visiting Vermont,  my home State, when she received the call. I still vividly remember her  confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee as head  Judiciary of the committee. She was the embodiment of humility and  grace and strength and wisdom. She endured 4 long days of, at times,  intense questioning from Senators of both sides of the aisle. Never  once did she lose her poise. I remember that so well. I thanked her for  fighting for a world in which my daughter would have opportunities  equal to those of my two sons. Unsurprisingly, she was confirmed by a  96-to-3 vote, becoming just the second woman to ascend to our Nation's  highest Court. My vote for her confirmation to the Supreme Court is  among the most consequential and impactful I have cast as a Senator.   This weekend, my wife Marcelle and I drove here to the Capitol. We  walked over to the Supreme Court. We saw all the people around writing  notes in chalk on the sidewalk, praising her, leaving flowers, leaving  pictures. I really was struck by the number of teenagers and people  probably in their early twenties who were just standing there sadly. I  talked to a couple. We were all wearing our masks. I am sure they had  no idea who I was. I talked to them. They all said in one word or  another: She was our inspiration.    I think of my own daughter when, a year ago, Justice Ginsburg was  being honored by a congressional group against cancer. She asked my  wife to introduce her. My wife is a cancer survivor. My wife brought  our daughter as her guest, and they sat there. My daughter has told me  so many times that it was one of the most meaningful times in her life  to sit with a woman who had always been her hero. Marcelle and I just  stood there in silence and thought of the memories of the times we had  been with her and what she has done for this country.   Over the course of nearly three decades, Justice Ginsburg secured a  place as one of the most ardent defenders of equal rights for all  Americans in Supreme Court history. She never tired of being a voice  for the voiceless. She always tried to use her power--her power--to  uplift the powerless. She authored the landmark majority opinion in  United States v. Virginia, which struck down the Virginia Military  Institute's male-only admissions policy as being unconstitutional. Her  words still read like a treatise on what equality must mean in America:  Laws or policies are ``presumptively invalid,'' she wrote, if they  ``den[y] to women, simply because they are women, equal opportunity to  aspire, achieve, participate in, and contribute to society.'' I think  of my wife and my daughter, and I think of my three wonderful  granddaughters.   Even when she was in the minority, Justice Ginsburg did not go  quietly. She always left an impact. In the Lilly Ledbetter case, where  the majority ruled the claim of unequal pay was barred by an arbitrary  statute of limitations, Justice Ginsburg retorted that the majority  ``does not comprehend, or is indifferent to, the insidious way in which  women can be victims of pay discrimination.'' She urged Congress to  correct the Court's ``parsimonious reading.'' Two years later, we did  just that. We passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, a copy of which  she proudly hung in her chambers. It is a bill that I was so proud to  help bring to fruition on the floor of this body.   In Shelby County v. Holder, the disastrous decision to validate key  provisions of the Voting Rights Act, Justice Ginsburg's dissent spoke  truth to power. She wrote that throwing out key provisions of the  Voting Rights Act ``when it has worked . . . to stop discriminatory  changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you  are not getting wet.''   Of course, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was right. Since that  decision, we have witnessed a torrent of voter suppression laws because  the Supreme Court did not listen to her. That is why I championed the  bipartisan John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore the  Voting Rights Act. These drives for change, and many others, often  began with two words from the Justice wearing the bejeweled collar: ``I  dissent.''   All the greatness of Justice Ginsburg was matched in spades by her  authentic goodness. I will always remember the Action for Cancer  Awareness event I mentioned earlier that she and my wife Marcelle spoke  at together last year. She was so genuinely kind to Marcelle, to me,  and to all the people she interacted with. She loved people, so it is  not surprising they loved her right back. It is not surprising. We saw  tears in people who knew her and didn't know her as we stood in front  of the Supreme Court this weekend.   Justice Ginsburg became a beloved cultural icon, inspired books,  movies, and even ``Saturday Night Live'' skits. Some of us did tease  her about that, and she took it all in good humor. Her dogged public  battle with cancer and her can-do attitude--in fact, she missed less  than a handful of arguments despite her yearslong illness--inspired  millions across the world. She gave hope to people she would never see  and never meet, but they felt they knew her, and she gave them hope.  Through it all, she never lost her humility.    When asked how she would like to be remembered, Justice Ginsburg  simply said: ``Just as someone who did whatever she could, with  whatever limited talent she had, to move society along in the direction  I would like it to be for my children and grandchildren.''   I am proud to stand on the floor of the Senate, as dean of this body,  and say with certainty that she is going to be remembered for that and  for so much more. She will be remembered long after any of us are.   This incredible life and legacy should be the only story of today.  Sadly, that is not the case. Instead of celebrating her life and her  many contributions to our society, President Trump and the majority  leader have forced our attention to turn to her vacancy on the Court  days before she has even been laid to rest.   In fact, immediately after the news of her passing, Senator McConnell  announced that he would rush to replace  [[Page S5724]]  her on the Court. Even as her family was standing there, mourning her,  he made that announcement. He tossed aside all precedents and  principles and declared his intent to ram through a nominee no matter  the cost. Despite all of Senator McConnell's talk and promises 4 years  ago--that, when a vacancy arises 269 days before a Presidential  election, the American people should have a voice in deciding which  President fills that vacancy, which is what he said when President  Obama was the President--the majority leader is doing everything he can  today to deny the American people a voice and, this time, with not 269  days but just 42 days remaining before a Presidential election.   Seeking a fig leaf of institutional cover, the leader is trying to  conjure up yet another rule today that, essentially, there was an  unspoken exception to everything he promised in 2016. I guess I didn't  hear that unspoken exception. Apparently, the American people do not  get a voice when the White House and Senate are under the control of  the same party.   Pay no attention to the fact that this contradicts everything Leader  McConnell and many other Republicans claimed to believe ad nauseam for  10 months in 2016. Yet even this desperate hair splitting falls flat on  its face. If the majority leader's 2016 rule to let the American people  decide only applies when there is a divided government, then the  unprecedented 10-month blockade of Merrick Garland contradicted the  confirmation of Justice Kennedy by a Democratic Senate during the  election year of 1988. As did virtually every other Democrat, I was one  who voted for this Republican nominee.   The majority leader's abrupt about-face is not about following  precedent, and it certainly isn't about principle. The blatant  hypocrisy--and the belief that norms and principles apply only to the  other party or apply only when nothing is at stake--is the result of  something even more insidious. It is the direct result of the  President's and the majority leader's wanting to bend the courts to  their will no matter the cost--no matter the cost for the Senate and,  certainly, no matter the cost for all of our courts across the country.   I will have much more to say about this. Make no mistake, the actions  that we take during these waning days of the Trump administration will  forever stain or redeem this institution in which we proudly serve  depending on whether we go along with this or not. The 100 Members of  this body represent 330 million Americans. We are entrusted to act in  their best interests. Through our actions in the weeks ahead, we risk  forever eroding the American people's trust and faith in our  independent judiciary, and our actions will have a lasting impact for  good or for ill on every American's most basic rights--the rights of  equality and fairness--that Justice Ginsburg spent her lifetime  securing.   We all know what we should do. We all know how we can make the U.S.  Senate be as it should be--the conscience of the Nation. I fear that we  are willing to close America's door on that conscience. Yet, today, I  simply seek to honor Justice Ginsburg. She dedicated her life to the  causes of equality and justice and made both a reality for millions of  Americans. She has left us a rich legacy to cherish and, more  importantly, to carry forward. We will be forever in her debt. A  generation--actually, more than a generation--of women and all  Americans have been inspired by her leadership and courage. Generations  to come will have her trailblazing legacy to thank. Let's honor her  memory by following her example, by recommitting ourselves to pursuing  a more perfect union not just for the few--no, not just for the few-- but for all Americans.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
