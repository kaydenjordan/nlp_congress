 Mr. President, on May 4 of this year, there was a party  at the White House, a celebration--a celebration that the House had  passed TrumpCare. Indeed, the President wanted to invite people over  and say what a great job they had done and what a great bill they had  passed. He called it a ``great plan.'' He said the House plan was  ``very, very incredibly well-crafted.''   That was on May 4--a party at the White House, a celebration--but  what a difference a month can make. A week ago, on Tuesday, June 13,  the President had another gathering, and at this gathering he said that  the bill from the House was ``mean,'' and he went on to use a very  derogatory phrase to describe it.   So what happened between May 4 and June 13? Did the bill change in  some way? Absolutely not. It had already been passed out of the House.  Apparently what happened is that someone explained to the President  what was in it, and he said: That is terrible. We can't do that. It is  a mean bill. And he used other vivid language to say just how bad it  was.   What feature of the TrumpCare bill did the President get briefed on  that made him say that it was mean? It certainly is a mean-spirited  bill. It certainly is a hard-hearted bill. It certainly is destructive  to the quality of life of millions and millions of Americans. So which  aspect of the bill was he referring to?   I asked that question of the Secretary of Health and Human Services,  Tom Price, when he came to the Senate for a hearing last week. I asked  the Secretary if he shared the President's opinion that the TrumpCare  bill was a mean bill. He didn't have an answer for that. He wouldn't  say whether, as a leader in the administration on healthcare, he shared  the President's opinion.   I asked whether he thought the President thought it was a mean- spirited bill because it ripped healthcare from 23 million Americans.  The Secretary of healthcare didn't answer.   I asked whether it was mean because it eliminated essential health  benefits like emergency care and rehabilitation services and mental  health and addiction treatment and maternity coverage for women having  a child. The Secretary again refused to answer.   And he proceeded to say things like ``Well, I wasn't in the  meeting,'' and that he hadn't talked to the President about why the  President didn't like the bill. One would think that the Secretary of  Health and Human Services, upon hearing that the President thought that  the bill he had advocated for was terrible, would actually go to him  and say: What is it you thought was so terrible? That might inform the  conversations here in the Senate. But he said that he hadn't talked to  the President about it. The Secretary of Health and Human Services  didn't want to know why the President disliked this bill.   I asked if the President thought that this was a mean bill because it  has vast premium increases for older Americans. An individual in their  mid-sixties, prior to the age for Medicare, a 64-year-old earning  $26,500--how much would they pay under current law and how much would  they pay under TrumpCare? Under current law, the answer is about $140 a  month. And under TrumpCare from the House, the answer is $1,200 per  month--an eightfold increase. How can anyone earning a little over  $2,000 a month spend $1,200 on health insurance? It is an impossible  situation.   So, of course, those Americans in that situation would not be able to  buy health insurance, would not be able to access healthcare. Is that  why the President thought it was mean? Did the President get briefed on  the damage it would do to our older Americans? Or was the President  concerned about the impact on our older Americans who need to have care  in a nursing home? Is the President finally aware that Medicaid pays  for more than 6 out of 10 individuals who are in a nursing home because  they need a level of care that can't be provided in the home?   I went and visited a nursing home over the weekend in urban Oregon  and then visited one in rural Oregon, in Klamath County. In Klamath  County they told me that almost 100 percent of their citizens in long- term care are paid for by Medicaid. Nationally, it is a little more  than 6 out of 10, but in this rural community, almost 100 percent. I  thought about the residents there and what happens to them. Under this  bill, when Medicaid is slashed massively and 23 million folks lose  access to it, what happens to them? One woman, Deborah, said: Senator,  Medicaid pays for my bill and if it doesn't exist for me--if it is  taken away--I am on the street, and that is a problem because I can't  walk.   So picture an older American, a senior American who needs an  intensive level of care that can't be provided in the home being thrown  into the street in a wheelchair, unable to walk, and, by the way, no  support structure because in order to qualify for Medicaid to pay your  bill, you have to have spent down all your own resources, so it isn't  like somebody has a backup plan. Maybe there are family members who  will take them in and provide an intensive level of care. Maybe a few  will have friends who will take them in and provide an intensive level  of care. But for the vast majority, that support structure isn't there,  and that means they are going to be on the street. Is that why the  President said it was mean?   Was it because the bill said States can charge more, allow insurance  companies to charge more for individuals with preexisting conditions?  That is certainly a huge problem. Community pricing has given access to  insurance at the same price to everyone in America, regardless of  preexisting conditions, but, unfortunately, TrumpCare changes that.   I think we need to recognize that now, here in the Senate, 13  Senators are working to craft a Senate version of TrumpCare, and they  are terrified--terrified of the public seeing their bill. It is a  vampire bill. It is afraid of the sunlight--the sunlight of public  commentary, input, even a public discussion from experts. They are  afraid of their citizens. They are afraid of the expert commentary. And  they want to hide it until the last second so they can bring it to the  floor--next Thursday, a week from this Thursday--and try to pass it in  a moment's time, less than a day.   I was fascinated that our Secretary of Health and Human Services-- after there were more than 100 hearings and roundtables and walk- throughs of the healthcare bill in 2009, after consideration of more  than 300 amendments in the Senate, after more than 100 Republican  amendments that were adopted,  [[Page S3622]]  minority amendments adopted, after more than 25 days of debate on the  Senate floor--complained that the bill and the process were not  transparent. If that wasn't transparent, how do you score the  transparency of a bill where there have been zero committee meetings,  zero chance for legislators to weigh in, zero chance for public input  by experts, zero chance for the citizens of the United States to see  this bill and share their feelings, zero chance for us to go back to  our own States and have townhalls and ask for input? Well, you give it  an F. It is a process completely out of sync with the responsibilities  that every Senator took when they took the oath of office to be a  Member of a legislative body--not a secret body, a legislative body,  which implies deliberation in committee and deliberation on the floor  and deliberation with constituents back home.   There is a phrase for the Senate--probably not merited; in fact, I am  sure it is no longer merited--that the Senate was the world's greatest  deliberative body. But crafting legislation in secret that affects the  quality of life of millions and millions of Americans, with no  deliberation, that is not a legislative process. That is not what was  envisioned under our Constitution, our ``we the people'' Constitution.  It wasn't a ``we the secret group of powerful folks accommodating  powerful special interests, government by and for the powerful.'' That  wasn't the introduction to our Constitution. Perhaps Members might read  the first three words of the Constitution. Perhaps folks might go back  and look at our history of why we have this floor to debate the issues,  because that is what a system of government of, by, and for the people  is all about.    In my home State, the elimination of Medicaid expansion--that is, the  Oregon Health Plan expansion--would throw 400,000 people off of  healthcare. Stretching that timeline from a couple years to 7 years  doesn't change the fact that 400,000 people lose healthcare. That is  mean-spirited. That is hard-hearted. That is terrible healthcare  policy.   It is not just those individuals who are affected. The uncompensated  care rate has dropped enormously in Oregon, from 15 percent to 5  percent. The result is that there is much more income to our clinics  and to our hospitals, and the result is better healthcare for  everyone--everyone in our rural communities, everyone in our urban  communities. Nonetheless, the majority persists in wanting to destroy  this improvement.   I am hearing from people like Elizabeth from Portland, who wrote to  say that the Oregon Health Plan saved her life. The Oregon Health Plan,  or Medicaid, saved her life. She was in school, and she had some health  problems that were getting worse because of stress. But she didn't have  a job and didn't have insurance, and things were getting bad. Then the  Affordable Care Act came around, and it extended coverage. Since then,  she has gotten her health problems under control, finished school, and  was able to get a job. In Elizabeth's own words:         I am once again contributing to society. I just need a       little bit of time and help and I'm back on my feet.    Isn't it the right thing to provide a foundation for every single  American to have access to quality healthcare, so that when they get  sick, it helps them get back on their feet?   Ask yourself: What is your value? Is it your value that every  American should have access to affordable healthcare? That is my value.  That is what I am fighting for. What are you fighting for? Are you  fighting to destroy healthcare for millions of Americans? Is that your  value--to make life difficult and hard and mean-spirited and hard- hearted and terrible and painful for millions of Americans? Is that  your value? If so, then keep up with this secret plan to destroy  healthcare for millions of Americans. But if you value your  constituents' quality of life, if you value their peace of mind, then  put a stop to this abomination, this anti-democratic process. Insist  that there is at least a month of consideration of the bill so that  citizens can weigh in, so experts can weigh in, so committees can  deliberate, so committees can propose amendments and improvements.  Insist on that.   We just need three Members of the majority party to believe in the  responsibility of this Chamber to hold a public debate and insist that  they will not vote to proceed to the bill unless we have at least a  month of opportunity. That is only one-ninth of what we had in 2009. It  is only a fraction of the committee meetings, roundtables, and walk- throughs we had in 2009. It would be only a fraction of the amendments  offered in 2009. It would only be a fraction of the time here on the  Senate floor we had in 2009. Don't you believe we should have at least  a fraction of the public deliberation we had just 8 years ago before  jamming this through and destroying healthcare for millions of  Americans? What does peace of mind mean to you?   I will tell you what it means to my constituents. It means that when  their loved one gets sick, their loved one will get the care they need.  It means that when their loved one gets sick, they won't go bankrupt.  That is the peace of mind we are talking about, and that is the peace  of mind that is so profoundly disturbed when you have a secret group  meeting with powerful special interests, devising a bill they are  afraid to show to the public of the United States of America. I would  never want to have to vote on such a major bill without being able to  hear what my citizens in Oregon think. I don't think any Member of this  Senate should agree to vote on a bill with no deliberation and no  public hearing.   So we need three champions. Just three out of 52. It should be 52 out  of 52 who insist on a quality public process. We have heard the  comments in the hallways, many Members of the majority dislike the fact  that there is a secret process that their majority leader is insisting  on. We have heard that they don't like it. It is not right. But do you  know what? Every Member here has a chance to say no to the secret  operation, the secret committee of 13, and the last-second presentation  of such a bill on the floor.   The issue of the changes in healthcare without public deliberation  terrifies folks like Deborah from Hillsboro, OR. She was diagnosed with  Crohn's disease 8 years ago and has to take regular injections and  medications to keep it under control. She does a lot of things right.  She doesn't smoke, she exercises, and she follows her doctor's  recommended diet. Other than her regular medications, she lives a  normal, healthy life, and she is looking forward to retiring in the  near future with her husband. They have been working hard their whole  lives. They have been saving up for it. It is so close that they can  almost taste it. But it is a dream that could be shattered by the  Republican healthcare plan--the TrumpCare plan--being concocted  secretly by 13 Members of this body. As she says:         Without affordable coverage for pre-existing conditions I       cannot even switch jobs easily. If Medicare is reduced or       eliminated, as the GOP is trying to do, I may never be able       to retire . . . we should not now, or ever, eliminate       coverage for pre-existing conditions (or price that coverage       such that most of us will never be able to afford it).    She is worried that changes that refer to Medicaid and the Oregon  Health Plan will ruin her ability to retire and her ability to access  healthcare.    I don't know exactly what the President was briefed on that made him  call TrumpCare ``mean'' and then speak in a very derogatory fashion  about the bill from the House. I don't know exactly what he learned. I  don't know if it was because he learned that folks on long-term care  could lose that long-term care and Medicaid pays for more than 6 out of  10 Americans who are in long-term care. I don't know if it was because  he learned about preexisting conditions. I don't know if it was because  he learned it would throw 23 million people out of the healthcare  system. I don't know if it was because he learned this would have  devastating consequences to rural healthcare because of the impact on  the finances of clinics and hospitals.   Whatever he meant, he was right. He was right to make that transition  from a month earlier when he held a celebration at the White House  because this terrific, wonderful bill had been passed by the House, and  when he sobered up and discovered that it was a mean-spirited, hard- hearted bill. But for all these reasons, no healthcare should be  crafted and jammed through without deliberation. No significant bill  affecting  [[Page S3623]]  the lives of Americans should be pushed through in this manner.  Americans deserve better. They expect more from this Chamber than such  a secret, callous, poorly informed process. They don't like that  powerful special interests are meeting with the Senators in private-- those private 13--to develop a plan, because here is what they have  heard:   They know this bill gives huge tax breaks to powerful parts of the  healthcare industry, that it gives huge amounts of money away to those  who make medical equipment and huge amounts of money away to health  insurance companies, meanwhile stripping healthcare from millions of  Americans. They know it also gives a massive tax break to the richest  Americans.   So here we are with a bill that Trump has called ``mean,'' giving  away the Treasury to powerful special interests, meeting in private  with my colleagues, giving away the Treasury to the richest Americans,  while on the other hand lowering the boom on our seniors in long-term  care, lowering the boom on struggling and working families, lowering  the boom on 20 million or so Americans who would lose healthcare, and  lowering the boom on the clinics and hospitals that provide care for  everyone.   That is what they see: special favors for the powerful and thrown  into the street the working and struggling families. That is morally  wrong. That is wrong from a policy point of trying to improve the  quality of life of Americans, and it is why every Senator here should  absolutely say no to moving to this bill on the floor without a full  month, at least, for committee deliberations and for the citizens of  the United States to weigh in.   That is the difference between what happens in a dictatorship with no  deliberation and a democratic republic with a legislative process that  values deliberation and openness. That is the difference. Which model  do my colleagues support?   Let's fight for the ``we the people'' vision of our Constitution, and  let's fight for quality healthcare for every American, and let's say no  to moving to any bill that hasn't had public deliberation and at least  a full month of deliberation in this Chamber.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
