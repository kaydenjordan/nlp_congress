 Mr. President, I object to the certificate from the  State of Alabama on the grounds that the electoral votes were not,  under all of the known circumstances, regularly given and that the  electors were not lawfully certified, especially given the confirmed  and illegal activities engaged in by the Government of Russia that were  designed to interfere with our election and the widespread violations  of the Voting Rights Act that unlawfully suppressed thousands of votes  in the State of Alabama.    Mr. President, the objection is in writing and is  signed by a Member of the House of Representatives but not yet by a  Member of the United States Senate.
