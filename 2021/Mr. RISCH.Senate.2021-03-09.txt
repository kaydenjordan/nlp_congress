 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and honor the  retirement of one of my senior staff members and friend who has served  in my home State of Idaho for the last 12 years as the State director  of natural resources, Michael ``Mike'' D. Roach.   After retiring from the banking industry, Mike came to my staff after  my first election to the U.S. Senate in 2009 as the regional director  of my Lewiston office. However, with a bachelor's degree in wildlife- fisheries resources from the University of Idaho, I knew he was a  perfect fit for the State director of natural resources position  stationed in my Boise office. Shortly after starting in Lewiston, Mike  helped to find his replacement in north Idaho and moved to southwestern  Idaho to lead my State offices in natural resources.   Mike was born in Twin Falls and grew up in southwestern Idaho where  his father worked in the cattle and banking industry. This afforded him  the opportunity to work and associate with the cattle and sheep  industry in Idaho and develop a deep understanding of the history,  traditions, and issues of Idaho. While in college at the U of I, he  worked for Idaho Fish and Game and served as a Wildlife and Range  Sciences Guidance Council member for the U of I's College of Forestry.  He was also appointed to the district advisory council for the Bureau  of Land Management--Boise District by former Secretary of the Interior  Manuel Lujan. With his deep roots in Idaho, he was the perfect  ambassador to the diverse natural resource and conservation groups of  the State like the Idaho Cattle Association, Idaho Farm Bureau, Trout  Unlimited, and the Nature Conservancy.   During his 12 years of service as my natural resources director, he  advised and guided my office through many complicated issues like the  sage grouse recovery plan, Idaho Roadless Rule implementation, salmon  and steelhead management plans, Columbia River Treaty, Good Neighbor  Authority, and many other resource issues. Due to his experience and  knowledge, in 2015, the University of Idaho College of Natural  Resources awarded Mike Roach the Alumni Award, recognizing his career  achievements in natural resources.   Another significant milestone came to pass while serving on staff; he  became engaged and married to Cally Grindstaff in 2019. They now make  their home in Fairfield, ID.   It is always difficult to lose a trusted staff member of Mike's  caliber, but I want to wish him and Cally nothing but best wishes in  their future endeavors and look forward to our continued friendship in  the years ahead.   Congratulations and thank you for your outstanding service to my  staff and the citizens of Idaho.  [[Page S1422]]                                ____________________
