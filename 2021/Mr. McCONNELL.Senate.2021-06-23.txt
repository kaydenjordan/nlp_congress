 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, for the first time earlier this  month, President Biden traveled to Europe. The primary purpose for this  trip was to engage with some of America's closest friends and allies,  but the agenda also included a one-on-one meeting with a staunch  adversary, Vladimir Putin.   The President took office armed with a great deal of tough talk on  Russia. He called his counterpart a ``killer'' and a ``KGB thug'' and  warned he would ``pay [the] price'' for interference in U.S. elections.  The world wondered whether this rhetoric would be underpinned by tough  action. I certainly hoped it would.   Back in January, I made it clear that if the Biden administration was  serious about ``imposing real costs on Moscow,'' it would ``find  willing partners on Capitol Hill.'' But so far, there have been few  encouraging signs for those of us who take Russia's threats very  seriously.   Remember, after less than a week in office, President Biden agreed to  Russian requests for a full 5-year extension of the New START Treaty,  no strings attached. He gave it up for free, undermining our leverage  to extract concessions in future negotiations.   Then, his administration rolled out a budget proposal that would cut  investment in defense, in real terms--shortchanging the modernization  we need to keep pace with both Russia and China.   And 2 weeks ago, the President left for Europe, having already given  the Kremlin two other gifts: a high-profile summit that experts  predicted Putin would use to help legitimize his regime at home and  abroad and a waiver of sanctions on the Russian-owned company behind a  lucrative gas pipeline project.   So I will repeat for President Biden the same warning I offered to  the previous administration: The Kremlin is  [[Page S4709]]  not our friend, and it is high time our actions started reflecting  that.   Back home, of course, the Biden administration has proven it knows  perfectly well how to crack down on energy pipeline projects when it  wants to. In fact, on the day he left for Europe, the firm behind the  Keystone XL Pipeline project announced that the President's revocation  of its construction permit would be fatal. That is the end of it. What  a striking image. The President of the United States heads overseas and  meets with a major adversary whom he has handed a major geopolitical  win, and here at home, the last nail goes in the coffin of the job- killing crusade against reliable North American energy that he said on  day one was a priority.   It is a tale of two pipelines: the decisive rejection of thousands of  American jobs here at home and the empowerment of America's adversaries  abroad. And it is only the latest sign that the Biden administration's  strategic priorities are simply out of order.   Recall, this administration rushed to rejoin a climate agreement that  has failed to hold major signatories to their commitments on reducing  emissions, even as the United States recorded multiple years of  reductions on our own.   This administration made it harder to cap our abundant and domestic  energy, even at the risk of greater reliance on imports from countries  with lower environmental standards. And, of course, they proposed to  squander years of accumulating economic pressure on Iran in exchange  for no meaningful concessions on its nuclear ambitions or regional  aggression.   So when President Biden elected to pass on another opportunity to  check the influence of a major adversary, we had heard this story  before.   Here in Congress, opposition to the completion of the Nord Stream 2  Pipeline has been vigorous and bipartisan. Last year's Defense  authorization, which earned 84 votes here in the Senate, expanded the  scope of sanctions against critical entities involved in its  construction. We are talking about a project that would give Putin a  new artery of influence in Western Europe and rob Ukraine of critical  leverage over the way Russian energy currently flows throughout the  region.   But, apparently, the Biden administration's own opposition to the  project was just rhetorical. When the chips were down, the President  used a waiver to avoid having to place sanctions on the biggest company  behind the project and its CEO--a Putin crony. According to reports,  his decision even overruled the objections of senior diplomats and the  concerns of his very own Secretary of State.   Oddly enough, the administration's decision to snuff out union jobs  in the energy sector here at home didn't seem to prompt as vigorous an  internal debate. In fact, President Biden's Executive action to kill  the Keystone XL has been followed by a steady stream of radical  proposals that illustrate just how deep his administration is in thrall  to the environmental fringe.   Under the guise of infrastructure, they pitched trillions of dollars  in Federal spending, aligned so closely with most liberal interests in  Congress that the authors--the authors--of the Green New Deal boasted  President Biden's agenda had their manifesto's DNA all over it:  unprecedented spending on electric vehicles, huge increases in funds  for transit projects that disproportionately benefit blue States on the  coast, and plans to pick winners and losers in the market for  affordable, reliable American energy.   So American workers know what a thriving energy sector looks like. It  is exactly what Republicans spent 4 years working to encourage here at  home.   As a matter of fact, if you hit pause on Washington Democrats'  radical climate rhetoric, you will notice that smart energy policy  isn't limited by political stripe. For years, the liberal government up  in Canada has recognized pipelines as a safe and efficient way to  connect people with affordable, reliable energy and grow what is  already the largest sector of United States-Canada trade. So it was  hardly surprising to hear one Canadian official greet President Biden's  decision to sink the Keystone XL Pipeline as ``an insult''--an insult-- or to read that the Canadian firm behind the project is now pursuing  legal action to recoup its investment.    So capitulation to our rivals, painful blows to our neighbors,  legitimizing corrupt foreign leaders, and jamming hard-working  Americans--whatever his motives, and despite his own rhetoric, the  consequences of President Biden's actions are already clear.   It is not too late to impose real costs on Russia's pipeline windfall  and provide serious, lethal support to Ukraine and other vulnerable  States on the frontlines of Putin's aggression. It is not too late to  get serious about the defense investment that bipartisan assessments  say that we need--that we need--in order to compete with China and  Russia. It is not too late to recommit to bipartisanship on  infrastructure and on energy and show radical climate activists the  door.   I hope the Biden administration changes courses sometime soon.    Mr. President, for 150 years, Calvert City has been a  central hub of the Jackson Purchase, serving as a focal point for  pioneers, farmers, and railroaders from all over western Kentucky. The  town's enduring legacy is a tribute to the enterprising demeanor of  those trailblazing Kentuckians who first called the Purchase home. In  recognition of Calvert City's sesquicentennial, I am privileged to join  this vibrant Kentucky community in celebrating 150 years of Bluegrass  heritage.   Calvert City started off as nothing more than a depot alongside the  Paducah & Elizabethtown Railroad, but quickly blossomed as settlers  spread west into the Jackson Purchase to profit from the region's  fertile soil and easy access to the Tennessee, Cumberland, Ohio, and  Mississippi Rivers. By the time the Kentucky Dam was completed nearby  in 1944, bringing jobs and hydroelectric power to the region, the town  was a flourishing center of commerce. Today, Calvert City is home to  numerous advanced chemical manufacturing facilities and continues to  play a critical role in western Kentucky's economy.   In recognition of Calvert City's pioneer spirit, the town is  celebrating 150 years of history with 150 events throughout the  calendar year. These ceremonies are made especially poignant by the  passing of Mayor Lynn Boyd Jones this January. He had dreamed about  Calvert City's 150th anniversary since the town's centennial 50 years  ago and was an early planner of this year's festivities.   As Kentucky emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic, the celebration will  be a uniquely joyous tribute. All aspects of Calvert City's storied  history will be on display, from railroad cars, to an auto show, to  events at Oak Hill, the original home of town founder Potilla Calvert.   I want to give special thanks to the Calvert City civic leaders who  made this year's sesquicentennial celebration possible. It is through  their hard work and dedication that the town continues to prosper, so  many years after its founding. On behalf of the Senate, I share our  congratulations with every Calvert City family and join them in  honoring 150 years of proud Kentucky traditions.                            ____________________
