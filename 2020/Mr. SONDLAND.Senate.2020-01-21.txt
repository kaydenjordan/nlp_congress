 Yeah. A lot of people were aware of it. And--         Correct.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. The documents also highlight the extensive  involvement of Mick Mulvaney in this geopolitical shakedown scheme.  Email messages summarized by Ambassador Sondland during his sworn  testimony show that he informed Mr. Mulvaney, as well as Secretary  Pompeo and Secretary Perry, of his efforts to persuade President  Zelensky to announce the investigations desired by President Trump.   For example, as shown on the screen, on July 19, Ambassador Sondland  emailed several top administration officials, including Mr. Mulvaney,  stating that he had talked to President Zelensky to help prepare him  for a phone call with President Trump, and he reported that President  Zelensky planned to assure President Trump that he intends to run a  fully transparent investigation and will turn over every stone.   Ambassador Sondland made clear in his testimony that he was referring  to the Burisma/Biden and 2016 election interference investigations that  were explicitly mentioned by President Trump on the July 25 phone call.   Mr. Mulvaney wrote in a response: I asked NSC to set it up.   What exactly did Mr. Mulvaney know about the Ukrainian commitment to  turn over every stone? And when did he know it?   These are many of the questions that require answers, under oath,  from Mr. Mulvaney. Mr. Mulvaney is also a central figure with respect  to how President Trump implemented his pressure campaign.   According to public reports and witness testimony, Mr. Mulvaney was  deeply involved with implementing the scheme, including the unlawful  White House freeze on $391 million in aid to Ukraine.   This isn't just other people fingering Mr. Mulvaney. Mr. Mulvaney has  himself admitted that he was involved.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
