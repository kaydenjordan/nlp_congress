 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support  of the SAFE DRIVERS Act introduced by my colleague, Representative Seth  Moulton.  [[Page H8396]]    In June of this year, seven members of Jarheads Motorcycle Club were  tragically killed in my district when they were hit by a truck that  crossed over into the wrong lane on Route 2 in Randolph, New Hampshire.   The Massachusetts driver responsible for this accident should not  have had an active driver's license and should not have been behind the  wheel that day. Despite his criminal history, the driver still had a  license because of a loophole where State DMVs often do not process  out-of-State infractions.   The SAFE DRIVERS Act would help States implement electronic systems  to ensure that dangerous drivers are kept off our roads. By  incentivizing States to modernize their databases, we can keep our  roads safe and prevent further tragedies.                            ____________________
