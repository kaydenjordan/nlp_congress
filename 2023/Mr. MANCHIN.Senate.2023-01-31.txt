 Mr. President, I saw some exciting news this morning,  and it said that General Motors announced it is making a $650 million  equity investment in Lithium Americas to develop the Thacker Pass Mine  in Nevada. Now, this has been talked about for 10, 12, 13 years, but it  is time to do something.   According to GM, this represents ``the largest-ever investment by an  automaker to produce battery raw materials,'' and that is exactly what  the Inflation Reduction Act was meant to do. It is a tangible result  because of that, and now, we have to make sure we follow through.   GM's CEO, Ms. Mary Barra, even said:         Direct sourcing critical [electric vehicles] raw materials       and components from suppliers in North America and free-trade       agreement countries helps make our supply chain more secure,       helps us manage cell costs, and creates jobs.    This is really what we are dealing with. We are dealing with-- basically, China has a captive market. I had a hard time understanding  why our administration was going down a path of transitioning into  electric vehicles as quickly as they intended and wanted to do without  having our own secure supply chain.   China right now has 80 percent of the world's anode production, which  is the positive and negative part of the battery that makes the battery  work; 80 percent of the world's battery material processing, which is  the processing of raw material that makes the batteries that run the  vehicles we have; 60 percent of the world's cathode production; and 75  percent of the world's lithium ion battery cells.   I am old enough to remember--and maybe the Presiding Officer might  be, too--that basically in 1974 I was standing in line waiting to buy  gas, if it was my turn to buy gas, to go to work. I don't intend to  stand in line to wait for China to send a battery to make my car work.  I just won't do it. So this is why we are moving in the direction we  are.   China has worked long and hard on cornering this market and done a  very, very thorough job.   We have seen firsthand what Russia has done to the EU--to Europe, our  allies--and most importantly, to Germany. They have used their  production of energy--inexpensive, cheap energy--and let Europe and  mostly Germany put their guard down and become totally dependent. Then  Putin weaponized energy against them and put them in a heck of a  stranglehold. Then basically decisions were being made about what they  could do.   Well, the first thing they did was basically eliminate their  dispatchable, dependable fuel, whether it be the coal-fired plants,  which they had a desire to do, but they actively worked quicker than  they had anything to replace it with and became more dependent. They  got rid of their nuclear plants because their extreme environmental  community wanted none of that; they wanted to go absolutely clean and  green.   There will be a time probably--hopefully in our lifetime; maybe not,  but in our children's lifetime--that all of this might be transitioned  into a new carbonless fuel, but right now, we need an ``all of the  above'' energy policy.   But they became totally dependent on cheap Russian gas, and they  realized only after the invasion that they had made a mistake. Well,  now they are scrambling to revive the very same coal-fired powerplants  they shut down prematurely and bring back the nuclear reactors that  they are going to need for a while.   People talk about the social cost of greenhouse gases, and I agree,  there is a social cost, but we are not even talking about the  geopolitical cost of inaction, being energy secure. That is really what  this is all about.   The Inflation Reduction Act that we worked so hard on and every  Democrat voted for in the House and the Senate, as the Presiding  Officer knows, has been touted as an environmental bill. That is all  you have heard. You have not heard the word from our administration  talking about energy security.   The United States is the superpower of the world, and to remain that  status, you have to have energy independence and be secure in your own  energy sources.   If you recall, when all this happened and the invasion of Ukraine by  Putin and basically the challenge we had and the high rising of oil  prices to gasoline prices to everyday workers going back and forth--in  my State, there is an awful lot of transit that goes on to secure your  jobs. What had happened during that period of time, our administration  started saying: Well, maybe we can reduce the sanctions on Iran.   I said: You have the most prolific terrorist supporters in the world,  and you want to lift sanctions so they can put more product into the  market and make more money or have more revenue to wreak more havoc on  humankind? I don't think that should be, I don't think that is a good  idea, and I sure can't sign up for something such as that.   Then we allowed Venezuela, which basically has very little oversights  on their environmental emissions--but we released that, and now they  are putting product in the market.   Now, if we are so concerned about the environment, which we all  should be, then shouldn't we basically look at what is going on? Is  America just turning a blind eye and saying: Out of sight, out of mind.   We are asking other parts of the world to do what we won't do. We  asked the Gulf States--Saudi Arabia--to produce more oil, put more oil  into the marketplace, because that would stabilize the oil price, bring  the price of gasoline down. We never asked our friends in Texas. We  never asked our friends in Alaska. We never asked our best trading  partner Canada to do more for us. We were seen asking other people--and  pretty drastic measures, if you would, by other nations--to do  something we didn't want to do for ourselves. I thought that was  unattainable, it was just unrealistic, and it did not show the  leadership of the superpower of the world.   Again, I will repeat this, and I will continue to repeat it: You will  not maintain this status of being a superpower unless our allies look  to us for help when they need it. We didn't have the energy to even be  independent ourselves, let alone be able to help our allies as quickly  as they needed it. We are getting up to speed now, we are coming back,  and that is exactly what the Inflation Reduction Act was intended to  do.   If we don't establish a domestic supply with the God-given resources  that we have--we produce oil, we produce coal, and we produce natural  gas environmentally better than anyplace else in the world. In the IRA,  that bill was designed to have two tracks. For 10 years, we would have  certainty that we would be energy independent by using everything  above, and that means relying on the fossil fuels that we need, and we  have, but we are going to do it better and cleaner than we have ever  done it before. We put more money in carbon capture, sequestration, and  utilization than ever before. We put more technology and fees on  methane emission, which we know is harmful to the environment, than  ever before. So basically we are leading the world and going to find  the new technology we can share that makes the environment better. But  if you can replace the dirty production of fossil with the cleaner  production from the United States, that is  [[Page S163]]  truly helping the environment. It is something that the leaders and the  superpower of the world should be doing. We weren't in that position.  We are fighting to get back.   But I have to watch now, after we passed a piece of legislation we  all voted for--we are getting different interpretations from Treasury  and other Agencies that have oversight, which is so wrong. That is not  their job, to interpret what they want in a piece of legislation; their  job is to basically enforce what we wrote in the legislation. And we  said that we will be independent, that we will have our own supply of  critical minerals. We will have our own supply, basically, and we are  not going to have to depend on China for car batteries or anything else  we need to run our economy. That is what we should be fighting for, and  that is what we should all be considering that we should be doing.   The IRA is crystal clear. What the Department of the Treasury did is  wrong. The law was very clear. By December 31 of last year, 2022, they  were supposed to have the rules and regulations of how they would  enforce the bill that we wrote. Well, guess what. They didn't. Now,  guess what happened.   Let me explain to you how the law worked before. Before we did what  we did with the IRA, the electric vehicles, the supplement that we  gave, $7,500, from 2008 after the crash of the economy, the banking  crash that we had--there was a bill passed in 2008, a recovery bill,  that was going to give $7,500 credit to any manufacturer--I mean, any  manufacturer--that sold an electric vehicle in the United States of  America. Now, once they saturated and sold 200,000 cars, it was over;  they got no more credits.   So let's look at our big manufacturers in the United States. We have  General Motors, OK, we have basically Ford, and we have Toyota. Let me  just tell you what has happened. So we are going to set the record  straight because I had a discussion with my dear friend and colleague  from Michigan, the Senator from Michigan, and we talked about that, and  I think there was some misinterpretation or misspeaking about what has  really happened.   As of last year, Tesla and--no, 2018. So that bill went into effect  in 2008, and by 2018, Tesla and General Motors reached their cap of  200,000 cars. They weren't getting anymore $7,500 if they sold a Tesla  and if they sold a General Motors electric vehicle. And guess what. It  didn't slow down the sales any. Tesla kept right on. They are past the  million mark now and still going strong. So people want the product. We  didn't have to give them Treasury or give them taxpayers' money to do  it. General Motors hit their 200,000. Toyota reached theirs last year.  Ford reached theirs September of last year. So all the major  manufacturers. If we had not done the inflation reduction bill and put  in new guidelines, all the people who would have gotten the $7,500  credit from American taxpayers were all foreign manufacturers sending  electric vehicles to America. That is not right.   But now what happened is they picked and chose. So the Secretary of  the Treasury--and we have had a conversation. We agree to disagree, and  I disagree stronger than anyone's ever disagreed on something that they  are doing that they shouldn't be doing. They are doing it wrong, and I  will continue to fight and hold them accountable.   Last week, I introduced a bipartisan bill with Senator Braun that  would do one simple thing. It would implement the law as intended by  putting the sourcing provision in effect immediately, whether Treasury  chooses to issue guidance or not.   I cannot pressure them to do their job on time, but I can do this: We  can do our job. We wrote a piece of legislation, and we can make sure  it takes effect when it was supposed to when they haven't done their  job. They failed to do it. What we are going to say is, fine, and you  implement it exactly the way you wrote the law.   What they are trying to do is this. They said: We don't have rules  and regulations, but from January 1--and still going on--they are going  to continue to give $7,500 to everybody again. So they are opening it  back up to General Motors. They are opening it back up to Tesla. They  are opening it up to Toyota, to Ford. To everybody, it is opened up to  start getting $7,500 again.   Now, what they did, they chose out of our bill--the Inflation  Reduction Act--they said: Yes, but if you make more than $150,000, you  are not qualified. That is exactly what is in our bill. But they said  they don't have rules and regulations, but they took that part of it.  They said: Well, if you buy a sedan that costs more than $55,000, you  don't qualify for the 7,500. If you buy a pickup truck that is more  than 85,000, you don't qualify. That is all in our bill.   If you can't write your rules and regulations, but you can pick and  choose what you like in the bill, that means you don't want to enforce  the bill the way it was written. That is what we should not tolerate.  That is not what anybody in this body should ever tolerate, to let the  Agencies do exactly what they think they want to do to appease whomever  they are trying to appease versus what we passed and the intent of what  we passed.   That is what I am upset about, and that is why we are going to  continue to fight.   And as it stands right now, they are cherry-picking, and they have  completely cherry-picked, and other Agencies will do the same. This  selective implementation is going to create a disadvantage for some  automakers while giving more flexibility to others by allowing this to  happen.   It is beyond being not right.   So let me tell you what we are going to do to make sure that the  American people understand.   If you believe that we were wrong in passing that piece of  legislation, then speak up. If you believe that we were wrong in saying  that we should not be dependent on China, but you want to continue to  have China dominating the market, you want them to have total control  in a market that we are moving--it is the first time in the history of  the United States that we have ever had to rely on a foreign supply  chain for our transportation mode, whether it is trains, whether it is  planes, whether it is automobiles, any form of transportation. We have  been able to not have to depend on another foreign supply chain because  we were able to do it in the United States.   We have allowed a lot a manufacturing to leave. We are bringing it  back now.   So what we said basically in the bill was: You get $3,750 credit  toward an electric vehicle you bought from an American manufacturer,  when the vehicle was manufactured in North America. That is the  culmination between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which is  what NAFTA, which is what the USMCA, the new bill, that is what we do,  has been moving those vehicles back and forth.   If it is manufactured here, you get 3,750. You get the first 3,750 if  the selection of all the rare earth materials are selected from either  North America or from countries that we have a free-trade agreement.  And the reason that is done, we want to make sure that we have a secure  channel for these rare earth minerals it takes to process and  manufacture the battery.   So the processing, as far as the selection of the rare earth  minerals, they have to come from either North America or our free-trade  agreement countries. That gives us a solid supply. We are not dependent  on China or Russia or any other nation that does not have our best  interests and is not a democracy, does not have the same beliefs that  we have for human rights and everything else that we do. We have that  first, and then basically, it has to be manufactured in North America.  Then you get the other 3,750.   So we use the $7,500 as the carrot to reimplement ourselves into the  manufacturing and self-reliance of our transportation mode. That is  simply it.   I would hope everybody watching, listening, or anything else, as far  as trying to get the knowledge of what we have done and what we have  tried to do and what we are intending to make sure happens--which is to  hold this administration, hold basically the Treasury Department and  every other Agency that thinks that they can free will and just make up  what they want and do what they want and pick regulations that they  think that they would rather implement rather than implementing the  law.   That is where we are. That is what I want is to set the record  straight. First  [[Page S164]]  of all, all the automakers in America who hit the 200,000 cap, this was  a new lease on life for them--the IRA, selecting it, and I would quote,  and I am going to read again from Mary Barra, who is the CEO of General  Motors:         [The] [d]irect sourcing [of] critical EV raw materials and       components from suppliers in North America and free-trade-      agreement countries helps make our supply chain more secure,       helps us manage cell costs, and creates jobs.    Now, that is one of our largest manufacturers of automobiles in the  United States of America. If she thinks it is good for her company, if  she thinks it is good for the American citizens and the car buyers in  America, then it should be good enough that the bill should be  implemented the way it was intended to. What we are going to do is  reestablish ourselves: major manufacturing; not being reliant;  superpower of the world--maintain that; have the energy sources; use  our fossil, clean as anywhere in the world, for the next 10 years, as  we are investing $369 billion for the new technology of carbonless or  carbon-free energy. Then that is leadership. That is what the world  needs. That is what the world expects from the United States, and if we  are going to maintain this world power, be the superpower of the world,  we must maintain that leadership.   And it is tough at times, but we can do it. We have always done it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
