 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Washington  State's 141st Air Refueling Wing at Fairchild Air Force Base. In  countless ways, the 141st Air Refueling Wing has answered the call of  service.   Because of the COVID-19 crisis, they have also taken action to help  families in need. For example, they have helped food banks distribute  more than 4.5 million pounds of food. They have partnered with the  Washington State Department of Health Incident Management Team on  testing sites. At this very moment, airmen and -women are operating  five mobile testing facilities in my State.   On top of all this, the 141st Air Refueling Wing is also fighting  fires. As the summer wildfire season ends, Team Fairchild's RC-26  Metroliner has flown hundreds of hours, detecting 110 new fires and  mapping more than 325 fires.   With this critical data, the 141st Air Refueling Wing has saved  lives, property, and businesses.   Mr. Speaker, the 141st Air Refueling Wing and Washington State  National Guard serve both at home and around the world. I thank them  for their lifesaving efforts and sacrifices.                            ____________________
