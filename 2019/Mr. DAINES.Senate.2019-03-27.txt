 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  congratulating Treasure County for 100 years of as one of Montana's 56  counties.   Although one of the least populous counties in Montana, Treasure  boasts many historic buildings that incorporate the rich history of Big  Sky Country from the Yucca Theater with its beautiful Spanish mission  style architecture that provided hope and entertainment during the  Great Depression, to the 1950s contemporary style courthouse in Hysham.  With a population less than a thousand, Treasure County's rich lands  provide a bounty for ranchers and farmers alike.   Treasure County is an important part of Montana's cherished history  and remains a vital part of our State's landscape. I congratulate the  folks down in Treasure County on celebrating 100 years of excellence in  local government.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
