 Mr. Speaker, I have just returned from  Armenia, where I went to the Armenian Genocide Museum. I cannot get the  pictures that I saw out of my mind: Armenian women and children  murdered in mass graves, Armenian leaders hung as examples to others,  Armenians forced onto long death marches without food or water.   There were 1.5 million Armenians killed in this genocide in 1915. I  saw the documents of the many who had witnessed it, including U.S.  diplomat Henry Morgenthau, and yet over 100 years later, the U.S. has  never officially acknowledged it.   This vote to finally acknowledge the Armenian genocide should have  come sooner, because of people in my district like Joseph ``Bebo''  Manjikian. When I met him, he was 104, but from his wheelchair, he told  me about the many family members he lost in the genocide. Bebo passed  away before he could see this day. He didn't forget them, and neither  can we.   Mr. Speaker, for the sake of Bebo and so many others, I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution.
