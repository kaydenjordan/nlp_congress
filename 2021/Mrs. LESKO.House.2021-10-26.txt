 Madam Speaker, the Biden administration and Democrats are  causing one crisis after another, whether it is the disastrous  withdrawal from Afghanistan; whether it is open border policy where  caravans are coming here; whether it is increasing gasoline prices at  the gas pump, increasing grocery prices, a shortage of goods so that we  can't even get gifts at Christmas. Now the Biden administration and the  Democrats want to pass a natural gas tax, which will cause heating  prices and electricity to skyrocket.   Yet, at the same time that he wants to decrease natural gas in  America, he is calling on OPEC to increase natural gas so that we can  rely on it here in America. This makes absolutely no sense to me. It is  as if he wants to hurt everyday Americans.   Madam Speaker, I object to these policies, and I hope that my  Democratic colleagues do, too.
