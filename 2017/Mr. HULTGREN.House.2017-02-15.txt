 Mr. Speaker, it is a bitter reality that universal  human rights are under daily assault around the world.   I rise today joining in celebration and in mourning with Chinese  democracy activist Zhu Yufu. This past week, he turned 64, but he  marked the occasion in prison.   Zhu Yufu has devoted his life to promoting democracy and human  rights, to the ire of Chinese authorities. In 2012, he was condemned to  7 years imprisonment on unjust charges. Since then, his health has  deteriorated, made worse by denial of medical care and inhumane  treatment. His family fears for his life.   The poem that led to Yufu's imprisonment is called ``It's Time.'' I  completely agree. It is time. It is time for the Chinese government to  provide Zhu Yufu with proper medical treatment and humane care. More  than that, it is time for the Chinese Government to release Zhu Yufu  and political prisoners like him who are unjustly detained. It is time  for the Chinese Government to recognize and support freedom of speech,  assembly, thought, and belief.                            ____________________
