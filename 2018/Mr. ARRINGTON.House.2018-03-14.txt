 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland, Dr.  Harris, for his leadership on the most sacred of issues.   Mr. Speaker, in the shadow of over 60 million precious American lives  aborted in the United States, there is light. This light shines through  the roughly 2,000 pro-life pregnancy centers in communities across our  Nation, including mine in west Texas. These pregnancy centers are  dedicated to serving 2.3 million women a year. That is 6,500 a day.   Because of their good work, providing ultrasounds, medical services,  and parenting classes, and even ministering to their deeper emotional  and spiritual needs, these pregnancy centers save lives, hundreds of  thousands of lives.   You see, Mr. Speaker, they believe, like a lot of us do, that all  life is a gift from God and deserves their constitutional right to  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But now these pro-life  pregnancy centers in California are being forced by law to advertise in  a way that goes directly against their mission and, more importantly,  their conscience.   The State of California mandates that these pregnancy centers  disclose how patients can obtain a State-sponsored abortion.  California, in my opinion, is abusing the power of the State to force  people to post messages they do not believe in and which violate their  conscience.   Government coercion of speech or conduct that violates the religious  conscience of an individual is in direct violation of the First  Amendment. The Founders intentionally listed the right to freely  express our religious beliefs first because they recognized the vital  role faith in God plays in cultivating a moral foundation necessary for  this democratic society.   While this inherent right to religious expression is being  undermined, the Constitution could not be clearer on this question. I  am confident the Supreme Court will uphold this sacred right against  the heavy hand of government coercion.
