 Mr. Speaker, sometimes the press--when a story goes on  for months and months--begins to not pay attention or address things  they ought to be addressing. I am going to briefly address the Ukraine  war.   It sure would be wonderful if that war ended. There are different  estimates as to the number of people killed in that war, but I think  all estimates would put it over 20,000 people.   This--for countries that, quite frankly, have problems and a shortage  of people--is not frequently commented on, but Ukraine has the second  lowest birth rate of any sizable country in the world. Russia also has  a low birth rate and has a lot of people immigrating.   I would hope the press, or our government would look for somebody--we  can't do it--but look for some country, France, Turkey, Israel, someone  to broker peace here before any more people die, and the hatred that  inevitably comes with war becomes greater and greater.                            ____________________
