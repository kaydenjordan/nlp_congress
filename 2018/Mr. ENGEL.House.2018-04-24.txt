 Mr. Speaker, I do.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of this bill,   Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Senator Baldwin and Senator Rubio  for their tireless efforts on behalf of Holocaust survivors and their  heirs. I would also like to acknowledge the important work of my New  York colleague, Congressman Joe Crowley, and Chris Smith, who  introduced the House version of this legislation.   The Justice for Uncompensated Survivors Today, or JUST, Act would  shine a light on any country in Europe stalling on the return of or  restitution for wrongfully confiscated or transferred Holocaust era  assets.   Nearly 75 years after the end of World War II, we are still debating  property rights for Holocaust victims. That is truly astonishing.  According to the Holocaust Immovable Property Restitution Study, a  substantial amount of property confiscated from European Jews hasn't  been returned to its rightful owners or its owners haven't been  compensated at all.   We must ensure that the United States is holding governments to their  obligations and ensuring their property is properly returned. Holocaust  survivors have waited too long for justice. We cannot let them wait any  long.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Crowley), the chair of the Democratic Caucus. He is also the  sponsor of the House version of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch), who is a very well-respected member of our  Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This legislation is critical to ensuring that Holocaust survivors and  their heirs are compensated. Restitution and return will represent  another step moving past this heinous chapter of human history.   I want to thank my colleague and good friend, Chairman Ros-Lehtinen,  for her powerful remarks this afternoon and for her leadership for so  many years in fighting for Holocaust survivors. I have met many of her  constituents and many of my own who remain engaged in this prolonged  battle for justice. I am a cosponsor of Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen's  legislation, and I proudly support her in these efforts. I do hope that  her bill will come to the floor as well.                                time  1615    I also support Congressmen Crowley and Smith, as well as Senators  Baldwin and Rubio, in the effort to ensure that property is restituted  and returned through the JUST Act. This legislation has already passed  the Senate; so when we pass it here, it will go right to the  President's desk for signing. With this vote, we can push it across the  finish line.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure. Let me start  by thanking Congressmen Deutch and McCaul, both valued members of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs, for their hard work on this bill. I want  to also thank Chairman Ed Royce, who has been a strong bipartisan voice  in things that are so important to our country and to the world. We  always say that we take pride in having the Committee on Foreign  Affairs being the most bipartisan committee in the entire Congress.   Iran has isolated itself on the global stage because it refuses to  abandon a range of aggressive activities that pose a threat to the  region and a threat to the entire international community. On that list  is the regime's terrible mistreatment of its own people and its heinous  practice of prolonged and politically motivated detentions of American  citizens.   The bill before us now seeks to put an end to these intolerable  practices. It would place sanctions on anyone responsible for  politically motivated harassment, abuse, extortion, extended detention,  or trial of Americans or Iranians.   Earlier this year, we stood on this floor in solidarity with  protestors in Iran who sought a better future for their country and for  the next generation. They wanted to see their government abandon its  support for Iranian proxy forces and terrorist groups, like Hezbollah,  in favor of funding healthcare and employment opportunities for average  Iranians.   This is a country that has suffered so much under the ayatollahs and  the economic mismanagement of its leaders. The protests in December and  January were a stark reminder of the regime's tight grip on power, as  many protesters were killed in the streets and blocked from  communicating with the outside world.   Today, as we pass this legislation, we think about the Americans who  currently sit in Iranian prisons. We think about Robert Levinson, Mr.  Deutch's constituent, who has been missing for over 11 years, who has  missed the weddings of his children and the births of his  grandchildren.                                time  1630    The Iranian regime had promised to cooperate with the investigation  to locate Mr. Levinson, but to this date, that cooperation has been  virtually nonexistent.   There is no real clarity in U.S. policy toward Iran. The United  States faces a looming deadline on the nuclear deal, and the future  remains uncertain. But there is one thing we can all agree on: we  cannot let up the pressure on Iran for its human rights violations,  particularly against American citizens.   So, again, I want to thank Mr. McCaul and Mr. Deutch for doing a  great job with this. This is a bipartisan piece of legislation. If you  care about the injustices going on in Iran, then it is important to  support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on the  Middle East and North Africa of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that the United States and Iran's  leaders are at odds on a host of issues. Iran has killed Americans in  Iraq. Its proxies seek to harm our citizens and our interests around  the world. But let me be clear: the United States has no quarrel with  the Iranian people.                                time  1645    This legislation seeks to protect the human rights of the Iranian  people and Americans who are unfairly detained in Iran. This bill  signals our solidarity with the protestors and demonstrators to Iran's  rulers that any action that violates the human rights of an American  will be met with severe consequences.   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) just mentioned the 1988 massacre  that was horrendous, and there were many, many more. This brutal regime  has blood on its hands, and it is important for the United States to  call them out.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of the No Assistance for Assad Act.   This act, H.R. 4681, was written by me. I am proud to be the lead  sponsor in this bill. And I am proud of the bipartisan support that we  have gotten from Chairman Royce and others on both sides of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, every time we think that the crisis in Syria could not  get any worse, the Assad regime manages to plunge the country into even  deeper depths. Children living in besieged Madaya could not get food,  so they resort to eating leaves. A 7-year-old and her mother tweeted  good-bye messages from Aleppo under siege. What has happened recently  in eastern Ghouta is just unfathomable.   The White Helmets--first responders--rushing to the scene of an  aerial attack, have been targeted themselves once they arrived to  render aid. And the regime has continued using chemical weapons, which  the world swore we would never use again. But no matter how Assad's  victims have met their ends--from nerve gas or barrel bombs or at the  hands of Assad's Russian or Iranian patrons--the loss of innocent life  is staggering.   My heart really bleeds for the people of Syria. What they have had to  endure should not be endured by anyone. The United States needs to be  vocal and we need to take action.   As we continue to find some way to end the bloodshed, we also need to  start thinking about what will come down the road.  [[Page H3473]]    This bill says that American assistance for reconstruction in Syria  should be available in areas controlled by Assad only if the regime  stops indiscriminate use of weapons, ends attacks on civilians and  civilian facilities, releases political prisoners, allows human rights  organizations access to the prisons, and removes senior officials  complicit in human rights abuses.   If Bashar al-Assad--the butcher of Syria--wants to destroy his own  country and then expects the United States to pick up the pieces, he is  sorely mistaken. That simply won't happen. He and Russia and Iran broke  Syria, and now they have to buy it.   We were careful in crafting this legislation to ensure that these  limitations won't affect locally administered projects. And the bill  permits humanitarian assistance to all in need.   Recovery in Syria will be a slow and painful process. But we cannot  allow those responsible for hundreds of thousands of murders to control  American dollars meant to help the country rebuild.   Who in the Foreign Affairs Committee can forget those horrendous  pictures taken of all these dead corpses lying one by one right next to  each other? Who could ever forget those atrocities that are being put  up with by the people of Syria each and every day?   I am grateful for the bipartisan support this bill has already  received. I particularly want to thank Congressman Kinzinger,  Congressman Boyle, and Chairman Royce for their partnership in crafting  this legislation.   This legislation sends a message--particularly after the Assad regime  again used chemical weapons--that we are closely watching the  developments in Syria and that the United States will not assist those  who are party to such heinous war crimes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, reconstruction and stabilization of a post- ISIS Syria is estimated to cost in the neighborhood of $300 billion.   And, by the way, I wish I could say a post-Assad Syria, because he is  the one who really should go.   The Syrian regime has spent the last 6 years destroying civilian  infrastructure and driving people from their homes. It is simply not  the role of the United States to support reconstruction in Syria,  especially if the Assad regime continues to suppress the Syrian people  and there is no accountability for his war crimes.   For those who are considering investing in Syrian reconstruction in  Assad-controlled territories, just know that Syria is one of the most  corrupt countries in the world. Therefore, it should be expected that  reconstruction money would be syphoned off to those who have  perpetrated war crimes and those who facilitate terrorism. We must  prevent this.   Again, we must not forget the plight of the Syrian people. We must  continue to stand with the Syrian people. We must demand that there is  an end to all chemical weapons and all weapons killing civilians with  barrel bombs, with people trying to get out of the way, little children  dying with their mothers, in their mother's hands. This cannot  continue.  [[Page H3474]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   First, let me thank Congressman LaHood for authoring this bipartisan  resolution and Chairman Royce for bringing it to the floor.   With this resolution, we send a strong message of support for the  efforts of the United Bid Committee to bring the FIFA World Cup  competition to the United States, Mexico, and Canada.   We share critical relationships with our neighbors to the north and  south, and it is important that we keep those good relationships. So I  am pleased that Congress continues to push back on anything that would  hurt the relationship.   Last year, the House passed my resolution with Congressman McCaul  reaffirming the importance of the U.S.-Mexico partnership, as well as a  resolution from Congressman Jeff Duncan on the U.S.-Canada alliance.  The 2026 FIFA World Cup provides another key opportunity for us to  reinforce our strong alliances with both Mexico and Canada.   The United States has hosted the World Cup three times: the men's  tournament in 1994, and the women's World Cup in both 1999 and 2003. We  have the infrastructure. We know how to prepare. We have 25 American  cities eligible to host. Bringing the world's most popular tournament  back to North America would generate increased tourist revenue for host  sites as fans arrive from all over the world.   Congress should not only pass this resolution, but Congress should  also continue to provide support for the United Bid Committee and its  efforts in our own conversations with foreign leaders and other  stakeholders.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor), an original cosponsor of this resolution, but  even more importantly, co-chair of the Congressional Soccer Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The ties between the United States, Mexico, and Canada are  longstanding and deep; and I am pleased that the United States can  continue to come together in partnership with our friends from both of  those countries on the United Bid Committee to try to bring the 2026  World Cup to North America.   I stand ready to support the North American bid in any way that I  can. It would really be terrific to get it, and I know we all feel the  same way.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
