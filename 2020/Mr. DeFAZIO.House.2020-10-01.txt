SEC. 14. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5139, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5139, the Stop Sexual Assault  and Harassment in Transportation Act, as amended.   The number one goal in transportation of people, whether it is across  town, across the ocean, in the air, on the ground, or on the sea, is  that there should be comprehensive policies in place for those  companies that are entrusted with their well-being. While it is  estimated that 90 percent of U.S. companies have a sexual harassment  policy on the books, one in five does not offer training to prevent  such incidents. This can leave passengers vulnerable and personnel  unequipped to adequately address incidents when they occur.   Some people may wonder whether this problem is as rampant as many may  suggest and ask if there is enough robust, organized data out there  that sheds light on this issue. Unfortunately, I have to say no. That  is exactly the problem.   There is no accumulated data. There is no Federal clearinghouse for  transportation-related sexual assault and harassment incidents.   The lack of centralized data leaves the traveling public in the dark  about the risk. But in reality, sexual assault and harassment  constitute a growing problem in transportation.  [[Page H5187]]    For example, FBI investigations of in-flight sexual assaults in  passenger airplanes rose from 38 in 2014 to 119 in 2019. Those are only  the ones that are reported. Many people don't report.   According to a 2018 national study, 17 percent of all respondents  experienced sexual harassment while using mass transportation. Since  2016, 260 sexual assaults aboard cruise ships have been reported to the  DOT. It is by far the most frequently reported crime on cruise ships.   In recent years, there may be no other industry that issue has  plagued more than transportation network companies such as Uber and  Lyft.   In September 2019, 14 women sued Lyft, citing the company's failure  to address a sexual predator crisis among its drivers. Uber identified  nearly 6,000 sexual assaults and attempted sexual assaults on its  platform in 2017 and 2018 alone.   Anecdotal evidence suggests that sexual assault is a big problem with  transportation network companies and traditional taxis alike, but TNCs  and taxi companies don't share the data that would provide a complete  picture of the problem.   In my own hometown--I live in Springfield, Oregon, but in our urban  area of Eugene-Springfield, we had one of the TNCs operating. All of  their drivers had been through their intensive background checks, which  are laughable, but then the Eugene police insisted that they go through  real background checks. They found 12 people totally disqualified by  the own standards of that company, Uber: one murderer, one rapist, and  10 serious felons. They were picking up women alone from bars at 1  o'clock in the morning, et cetera. The company didn't know it.   In fact, those companies have fought--we are the last State that  isn't bound by State law. They have been lobbying all the States to say  you can't keep track of this; you cannot require more vigorous  background checks. Unfortunately, 49 of the States have caved in to  them, under threat of losing their services. My State hasn't. And, you  know, this has to stop.   That is why the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure passed  my bill, H.R. 5139, the Stop Sexual Assault and Harassment in  Transportation Act. This bill will:   One, require transportation providers to establish formal policies  addressing sexual assault and harassment;   Two, direct employees to receive specific training for not just how  to handle sexual assault or harassment incidents, but also how to  recognize and respond to potential human trafficking activities,  something that has been identified numerous times by flight attendants  who have alerted authorities and other workers in transportation; and,   Three, charge the DOT with establishing the first-ever Federal  clearinghouse for transportation-related sexual assault, harassment,  and child trafficking, to allow the traveling public to fully  understand the scope of the problem and spur further action.   We can no longer allow sexual violence and abuse to persist on our  roads, on our waters, or in our skies. We must be doing everything in  our power to ensure our transportation system is safe for those who  work in it and for everyone who uses it. This bill, which will allow us  to finally track, respond to, and ultimately prevent sexual assault and  harassment within all areas of our transportation system, brings us one  step closer to attaining that goal.   I want to acknowledge and express my appreciation for the supporters  of this bill. It has been endorsed by the American Association of  Justice, the Association of Flight Attendants, the Air Line Pilots  Association, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, the  National Center on Sexual Exploitation, Rights4Girls, Survivors for  Solutions, and the Transportation Trades Department.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, February 7, 2020.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Defazio: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 5139, the ``Stop Sexual Assault       and Harassment in Transportation Act,'' that fall within our       Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us on       those provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection to       your including them in the bill for consideration on the       House floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to       forgo action on H.R. 5139, with the understanding that we do       not thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Commitee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                  Washington, DC, February 7, 2020.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 5139, the Stop Sexual Assault and Harassment in       Transportation Act, which was ordered to be reported out of       the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on       November 20, 2019. I appreciate your willingness to work       cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that by foregoing formal consideration on       H.R. 5139, the Committee on Judiciary does not waive any       future jurisdictional claims to provisions in this or similar       legislation, and that your Committee will be consulted and       involved on any matters in your Committee's jurisdiction       should this legislation move forward. In addition, should a       conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your       effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving provisions       within this legislation on which the Committee on Judiciary       has a valid jurisdictional claim.        I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation,       and I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R.       5139.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,                                                             Chair.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her support and the support  of the other Republican members of the committee. There were some  technical issues relating to particular modes of transportation, and  the minority wanted to get this bill done, and we worked out those  concerns. I think everybody should support this today. Hopefully, it  will be unanimous.   Mr. Speaker, there was a section that got left out of my opening  remarks, and this is a stunning number.   On U.S. airlines alone, 68 percent of flight attendants say they have  experienced sexual harassment during their careers. In fact, on  November 8, 2019, a flight of a major airline diverted due to a  passenger groping another passenger. The risk of an unwelcome and even  threatening environment is real for both passengers and transportation  workers alike.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington, D.C. (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Washington, D.C. (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I have no  further speakers. I yield back the balance of my time.
