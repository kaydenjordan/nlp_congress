 Mr. Speaker, one of the best parts of this job is getting  to develop relationships with outstanding people in my district, people  who are difference makers in the best sense of the word. Kitsap County,  Washington, is a better place because of one such person: Natalie  Bryson.   Our schools are providing more opportunities for young people because  of all she has done for the local school district and her work with the  Paul Linder Foundation.   Our communities are more welcoming places because of Natalie's work  with Kitsap Pride and her involvement with the HIV/AIDS Foundation.   More doors are open for women because she has been such a trailblazer  in our community, even becoming the first woman to join the Silverdale  Rotary Club, where she was so kind to welcome me and let me have lunch  with her.   Whether she is participating in the Central Kitsap County Council or  giving loving advice to her Member of Congress, Natalie has been such  an impactful person, a fierce advocate, a voracious volunteer, and an  amazing friend.   Mr. Speaker, sometimes it is important for us to just express some  gratitude, to say thank you, and that is something I want us to do  today for someone who has done so much for so many.   Thank you, Natalie. You are so appreciated.                            ____________________
