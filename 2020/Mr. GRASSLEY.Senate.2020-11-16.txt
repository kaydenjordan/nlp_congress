 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute for  morning business.    Although promising vaccines for the coronavirus are on  the horizon, it is more important than ever to stop the surge.  Countries across the world are seeing cases explode.   It is critical for Iowans to step up their personal responsibilities  to stay safe and healthy for themselves and their loved ones. And that,  of course, includes our tireless healthcare professionals--those on the  frontlines, working to save lives.   This virus is hitting rural and urban areas alike. No community is  immune. I ask every Iowan to continue to do their part to keep their  family and neighbors safe: Wash your hands; limit your activity outside  your household; social distance; wear a mask.   We are going to get through this together, but we need everyone to do  their part.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I pay tribute to our former  colleague and my friend, former U.S. Senator Roger Jepsen. Roger Jepsen  passed away last Friday, at age 91, at Clarissa C. Cook Hospice House  in Quad Cities, IA.   An Iowa native and an American patriot, Roger devoted his life in  service to his family, faith, and community. He spent his youth on his  family farm near Cedar Falls, about 5 miles from where I was born and  grew up. I still reside within 4 miles of the farmhouse where I was  born.   Regardless of the close proximity of us as young people, I didn't  become acquainted with Roger until he represented Scott County in the  Iowa Legislature. I wish I had known him earlier when we were  neighbors, as children.   For 14 years, Roger served our country in the U.S. Army. He was a  paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division, and then he later served in  the Army Reserve.   Roger worked for 20 years in the life insurance business and was a  member of the National Association of Life Underwriters. Along the way,  Roger answered the call to public service and civic leadership. For  more than two  [[Page S6692]]  decades, he climbed the ranks of elected officials in service to his  community and the State of Iowa.   He started out as a county supervisor in Scott County, IA, and went  on to represent his neighbors in Iowa Senate District 15. An active,  grassroots leader in the Republican Party of Iowa, Roger served as a  delegate to the national GOP convention of 1972 and 1980.   In 1968, he was elected as Iowa's 39th Lieutenant Governor, where he  served with Governor Bob Ray for two terms. Until Iowa adopted reforms  under a constitutional amendment in 1972, the office for Governor and  Lieutenant Governor were on the ballot every 2 years in my home State.   In 1978, when I won reelection to Iowa's then Third Congressional  District in the U.S. House of Representatives, Roger Jepsen flipped  Iowa's U.S. Senate seat. He defeated incumbent Senator Dick Clark. At  the time, political observers gave Roger scant chance of a victory that  year, but on election day, Roger Jepsen pulled off the upset, beating  his opponent by more than 26,000 votes.   In that same election, Roger returned both houses of the State  legislature to Republican control for what would be Governor Ray's  final term in office. In the previous legislative session, Iowa  expanded its historic ``right to work'' law. For decades, this  instrumental policy has enhanced Iowa's ability to attract businesses,  create jobs, and grow wages across the State.   It was under attack in the last election. Iowa voters responded by  expanding the Republican majority at the Iowa State House under a  Republican administration led by Governor Kim Reynolds.   During his 6 years here in the U.S. Senate, Roger Jepsen solidified  his pro-life, pro-family credentials. He was a fiscal conservative. He  flexed steadfast support for the military, and he worked to put money  back in the taxpayers' pockets.   In 1981, he voted to end ``bracket creep'' by indexing for inflation  across-the-board tax rate cuts.   An outspoken advocate for rural America, Roger Jepsen fought to boost  the economic recovery across the farm belt. He championed farm exports,  expanded lending and tax relief for farmers.   He was chairman of the Joint Economic Committee and served on the  Senate Agriculture and Armed Services Committees.   After losing his bid for reelection in 1984, President Reagan  nominated Roger Jepsen to serve as Chairman of the National Credit  Union Administration, where he served from the years 1985 to 1993.   Although he and his wife Dee retired to Florida, Scott County was  what he considered his home. Roger and Dee devoted considerable time  and effort to end religious persecution and promote religious liberty.  Alongside Congressman Jack Kemp, they cofounded the Christian Rescue  Effort for the Emancipation of Dissidents, known as CREED, to promote  religious freedom as a human freedom around the world.   Each time I return home by way of Cedar Falls, IA, I pass Jepsen  Road. In fact, it intersects my street. Over the years, Roger's and my  paths crossed many times in service to Iowans. Seeing that street sign  reminds me that no dream is too big for an Iowa farm kid.   Roger and Dee celebrated 62 years of marriage in September. Together  they raised 6 children.   Barbara and I extend our condolences to his family and loved ones. On  behalf of the State of Iowa, we thank Roger for his service here on  Earth as he is welcomed home into the hands of the Lord.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
