 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember and pay tribute to  a true hero, Alan Moskin, a resident of the 17th District of New York  who recently passed away at the age of 96.   Alan was a World War II veteran who fought with valor and bravery  against Nazi Germany.   Alan was among the liberators of a sub-camp of the notorious  Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria, where he and his unit freed  more than 1,500 prisoners from certain death.   Alan Moskin's service and courage serve as a stark reminder of the  sacrifices made by so many of our Greatest Generation during the Second  World War.   Alan dedicated himself to fighting for freedom and justice, and his  bravery will never be forgotten. He frequently visited schools and  spoke with students about the importance of never forgetting the  Holocaust or the horrors perpetrated during it. He spoke at Yom HaShoah  events.   How fitting it is that his passing comes as we enter Holocaust  Remembrance Day.   His community involvement was a testament to his desire to further  the education of our youth and impart to them the importance of  treating each other with kindness. Most of all, I will miss seeing him  at our naturalization ceremonies where he would talk about the  importance of service and lead new citizens in the Pledge of  Allegiance.   May Alan's memory always be a blessing. He will be sorely missed.                            ____________________
