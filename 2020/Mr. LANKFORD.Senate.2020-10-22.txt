 Mr. President, I spent some one-on-one time yesterday  with Amy Coney Barrett. I had the opportunity to be able to ask her  questions about agency deference, about religious liberty, and about  the responsibility of the three branches of government and the  separation of those. We spent time talking about antitrust laws, Tribal  laws, and all sorts of things to walk through some things that were not  covered in the hearing time.   I walked away even more impressed with her as a leader, her  knowledge, her judicial temperament, her sense of responsibility, the  awe that she is taking on this responsibility that the Nation would ask  her to do.   It stands in stark contrast to some of the conversations I have had  with some of my colleagues on the other side and from the hearings over  the last week where, most of the time, my colleagues spent their time  saying that people should be afraid of this mother of seven, that she  is a terrifying individual who will take away your healthcare, who will  take away your right to be able to destroy your unborn child if you  choose to, that she is racist and that she is anti-woman, which I  thought were the ultimate challenges to her as a woman herself,  obviously, and when she was challenged over and over again about being  a racist and a segregationist. She is the mother of a multiracial  family.   It is a bizarre side-by-side to actually meet the actual person and  to go through the law versus hearing the descriptions.   Amy Coney Barrett is a native of New Orleans, LA. She is the daughter  of a lawyer and a teacher, the oldest of seven children. She has been  married to her husband Jesse for 21 years. She herself is the mother of  seven children, as I mentioned before--Emma, Vivian, Tess, John Peter,  Liam, Juliet, and Benjamin. We got to watch them sitting behind her,  quietly watching, proudly, their mom.   She graduated summa cum laude from Notre Dame Law School. After  graduating from law school, she clerked for DC Circuit Judge Laurence  Silberman and for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. She was  challenged over and over again, with people saying: You are just like  Scalia. She kept responding very calmly to people: ``I have my own  mind.'' She practiced both trial and appellate litigation.   Judge Barrett also worked for more than 15 years in academia. She was  a distinguished legal scholar at the Notre Dame Law School, the  University of Virginia School of Law, and George Washington University  Law School. She published articles in the  [[Page S6390]]  Columbia, Virginia, Texas, and Cornell law reviews. Three graduating  classes at Notre Dame Law have selected Judge Barrett as the  Distinguished Professor of the Year.   In 2017, she was nominated by President Trump to serve on the Seventh  Circuit Court of Appeals and was confirmed by this Senate with a  bipartisan vote. Judge Barrett's colleagues at Notre Dame signed a  letter supporting her 2017 nomination, calling her ``a model of the  fair, impartial and sympathetic judge.'' Since joining the U.S. Court  of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in 2017, Judge Barrett has  participated in over 600 cases.   The ABA Standing Committee issued Judge Barrett a ``well qualified''  rating based on ``the qualities of integrity, professional competence,  and judicial temperament.''   When confirmed, Justice Barrett will be the fifth woman to serve on  the Supreme Court in its history. She will be the first mother of  school-age children to serve on the Court. She will be the only sitting  member of the Court to have graduated from a law school other than  Harvard or Yale. She will also be the second sitting member of the  Court to have been born in the South and only the second member in the  Court's history to have been born in Louisiana. She will be the only  sitting member of the Court to have served on the Seventh Circuit,  which hears cases arising out of Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.   During the Judiciary Committee hearings, we heard testimony from  Laura Wolk, a former student of Judge Barrett's. It was remarkable  testimony.   She said, in part:         [S]hould you confirm Amy Barrett, the country will receive       something far greater than simply an unparalleled legal mind.       The Supreme Court--and therefore all Americans--will gain the       service of one of the kindest individuals I have ever known.       Her brilliance is matched only by her compassion, and her       honesty is beyond reproach.        I do not speak in mere abstractions. Rather, I have       experienced these characteristics firsthand, with life-      changing results. . . . Judge Barrett described a mentor who       gave her a treasured book of literature to commemorate their       relationship. Judge Barrett has now passed that torch onto       me, giving me a gift of immeasurable value: the ability to       pursue an abundant life with the potential to break down       barriers so that I can leave this world a better place than I       found it.    I could not agree more with her or with her colleagues and peers  about her superb qualifications and preparedness to serve in this role.  As an originalist and a textualist, her commitment to both the role of  the Court and the rule of law are clear. To read her opinions from the  perspective of the losing party demonstrates her fairness, her empathy,  and her temperament as a judge.   Beyond her resume and accolades, her character, her commitment to  faith and family, and her service to her students and the community  should not go overlooked. Judge Barrett has my unqualified, full  support, and I look forward to voting for her nomination in the next  few days.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
