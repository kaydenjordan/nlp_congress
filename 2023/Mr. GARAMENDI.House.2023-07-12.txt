 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member  Smith for their leadership on the committee and the work that has been  done. Also, a special shout-out to Chairman Waltz, with whom I have the  pleasure of working on the Readiness Subcommittee.   Throughout the creation of this bill and the previous four bills, the  subcommittee has focused on our core mission: ensuring America's  military servicemembers have the resources and training to execute  their missions and return home safely to their families.   The bill that advanced from the subcommittee made great strides to  improve the housing, childcare, and barracks for the servicemembers and  their families; develop resilient installations capable of withstanding  the challenges of natural events; reduce the consumption of petroleum  fuel and address the impacts of climate change while ensuring our  forces are prepared to face the challenges and threats wherever and  whenever they may arise.   There are, of course, still areas for improvement. We must do more to  fully factor sustainment and maintenance into everything we do. We  cannot be distracted by the purchase of shiny, new equipment if that  equipment cannot be sustained for the mission when it is needed.   We must also continue to fight price gouging by defense contractors,  which takes taxpayer dollars intended to equip our forces and redirects  them to corporate profits. We will continue to tackle these issues, but  I remain proud of what this committee has done.   I am, however, concerned that the majority has forced into this bill  controversial social and political issues that do not advance our  national security. Unreasonable demands which roll back efforts to  ensure our military reflects the country that it serves or to prepare  the military for the future are the absolute wrong direction. I hope  that we eliminate these divisive issues and that they will not be  included in the final bill.   We will work together, therefore, to prioritize the authorizations  that our armed services need and our servicemembers and military  families deserve.                                time  1430
