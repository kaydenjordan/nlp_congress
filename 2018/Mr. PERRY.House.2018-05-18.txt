 Mr. Speaker, I rise in celebration of the 100th  anniversary of the Republic of Azerbaijan.   On May 28, 1918, Azerbaijan declared its independence following the  Bolshevik victory in the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the withdrawal  of Russian troops from the Caucasian Front during World War I. Just 2  years later, Azerbaijan fell to the Red Army and lost its independence  to the Soviet Union.   While its initial independence was short, it laid the foundation for  the country that exists today. Since ultimately gaining its  independence in 1991, Azerbaijan has played an increasing important  role in the region and the world.   Azerbaijan is a key military ally to the United States. Its  peacekeepers have served alongside American and NATO troops in Kosovo,  Iraq, and Afghanistan. Today, Azerbaijan has 120 troops in Afghanistan  supporting the NATO-led Resolute Support mission there.   Azerbaijan also became a leader in the energy sector. Since one of  the world's first oil wells was drilled south of Baku in 1848,  Azerbaijan has developed its natural resources and is helping to reduce  Europe's reliance on Russian gas through the development of the Trans- Anatolian Pipeline.   The Baku Flame Towers, now a global city for the country, pays homage  to Azerbaijan's nickname, ``the land of fire,'' hailing from the rich  deposits of natural gas.   The United States is grateful for Azerbaijan's friendship and we wish  its people continued peace and prosperity.                            ____________________
