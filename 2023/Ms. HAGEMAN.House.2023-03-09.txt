 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the House resolution.   As a water attorney and a natural resource attorney, I have fought  for over 25 years to protect water and property rights and to stop the  unlawful rules enacted by our Federal Government. In Congress I am  continuing that fight.   The Feds have far exceeded their authority under the Clean Water Act  and have expanded on the scope and intent of the original law by  redefining what is a navigable water of the United  [[Page H1227]]  States. This rescinds the recent changes made under the Trump  administration that actually carried out the intent of the Clean Water  Act, and the increasing regulation of both land and waters must be  stopped.   In many instances, these new and punitive regulations are a de facto  taking of private property. Wyoming farmers, ranchers, builders, energy  producers, and small business owners, among others across the State,  would suffer significantly if these changes to the navigable waters of  the United States definition were enacted.   This is just one more example of an out-of-control and unelected  Washington bureaucracy intruding into our personal lives and seeking to  destroy our property rights.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support today's disapproval vote  and protect Americans from the ridiculous government overreach these  WOTUS revisions would enable.
