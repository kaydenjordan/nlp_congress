 Madam President, I understand that in the order I  have 15 minutes; is that correct?    Thank you very much.   Madam President, this has been my ninth Supreme Court nomination  hearing, and I must say, I have never experienced anything like this.   Never before have we had a Supreme Court nominee where over 90  percent of his record has been hidden from the public and the Senate.  Never before have we had a nominee display such flagrant partisanship  and open hostility at a hearing, and never before have we had a nominee  facing allegations of sexual assault.   The nominee before us being considered for a pivotal swing seat, if  confirmed, would be the deciding vote on some of the most important and  divisive issues of our day.   I would like to start by speaking about some of the issues in  relation to Judge Kavanaugh.   President Trump promised to nominate to the Supreme Court only  individuals who would be pro-life and pro-gun nominees and who would  automatically overturn Roe v. Wade. In my judgment, Judge Kavanaugh  clearly meets the test.   In a speech in 2017, Judge Kavanaugh focused on praising Justice  Rehnquist and his dissent in Roe v. Wade, where he challenged the right  to women's privacy as protected in the Constitution.   Also, last year, Judge Kavanaugh argued in a dissent in a Texas case  that a Jane Doe should not be able to exercise her right to choose  because she did not have family and friends help her make the decision.  If adopted, this argument could rewrite Supreme Court precedent and  require courts to determine whether a young woman has a sufficient  support network when making her decision, even in cases--as is in this  one--where she had gone before a court.   His reasoning demonstrates that Judge Kavanaugh not only is willing  to disregard precedent, but his opinions fail to appreciate the  challenging realities women face when making these most difficult  decisions.   When I asked him about whether Roe and Casey were settled law and  whether they were correctly decided, he refused to answer. He would say  only that these cases are ``entitled to respect.''   As we all know, Roe v. Wade is one of a series of cases that upheld  an individual's right to decide who to marry, where to send your  children to school, what kind of medical care you can receive at the  end of life, as well as whether and when to have a family. According to  these cases, the government cannot interfere with these decisions.   Another issue that gives me great pause is Judge Kavanaugh's extreme  view on guns. In reviewing his record and judicial opinions, it is  clear his views go well beyond simply being pro-gun.   During a lecture at Notre Dame Law School, Judge Kavanaugh himself  said he would be ``the first to acknowledge that most lower-court  judges have disagreed'' with his views on the Second Amendment.   Specifically, in District of Columbia v. Heller, Judge Kavanaugh  wrote in a dissenting opinion that ``unless guns were regulated either  at the time the Constitution was written or traditionally throughout  history, they cannot be regulated now.''   In his own words, he said gun laws are unconstitutional unless they  are ``traditional or common in the United States.''   Judge Kavanaugh would have struck down DC's assault weapons ban  because they have not historically been banned. This logic means that  as weapons become more advanced and more dangerous, they cannot be  regulated at all.   When I asked Judge Kavanaugh about his views that if a gun is in  ``common use,'' it cannot it be regulated, he replied this way:         There are millions and millions and millions of semi-      automatic rifles that are possessed. So that seemed to fit       ``common use'' and not be a dangerous and unusual weapon.    Think about that. Judge Kavanaugh made up a new standard that had  nothing to do with ``common use'' but instead relied on whether a gun  is widely possessed and owned as determinative of whether it is subject  to any regulation.   The United States makes up 4 percent of the worldwide population, but  we own 42 percent of the world's guns. By Judge Kavanaugh's standard,  no State or locality will be able to place any limitation on guns  because of widespread ownership in this country.   I am also concerned about his views on Presidential power.  Specifically, he has said that sitting Presidents cannot be indicted,  cannot be prosecuted, should not be investigated, and should have the  authority to fire a special counsel at will. In other words, the  President of the United States is above and outside the law.   These views raise serious concerns that should concern us all,  especially at a time when the President continually threatens to fire  the leadership of the Department of Justice for failing to be loyal and  reigning in the Mueller investigation.   These views alone are sufficient for me to vote against Judge  Kavanaugh, but what we have seen and experienced in the past several  weeks has raised serious new concerns--concerns I believe should worry  us all.   Judges are expected to be ``evenhanded, unbiased, impartial, [and]  courteous''; however, at the hearing last week, we saw a man filled  with anger and aggression. Judge Kavanaugh raised his voice. He  interrupted Senators. He accused Democrats of ``lying in wait,'' and  replacing ``advice and consent with search and destroy.''   He even went so far as to say that Dr. Ford's allegations were  nothing more than ``a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled  with pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election,'' and  ``revenge on behalf of the Clintons.'' How could he?   This behavior revealed a hostility and belligerence that is  unbecoming of someone seeking to be elevated to the U.S. Supreme Court.  His display was so shocking that more than 2,400 law professors from  around the country have expressed their opposition.   They wrote: ``Instead of trying to sort out with reason and care the  allegations that were raised, Judge Kavanaugh responded in an  intemperate, inflammatory and partial manner, as he interrupted and, at  times, was discourteous to senators.''   The professors concluded: ``We have differing views about other  qualifications of Judge Kavanaugh. But we are united as professors of  law and scholars of judicial institutions, in believing he did not  display the impartiality and judicial temperament requisite to sit on  the highest court of our land.''   Madam President, finally, I want to mention the serious and credible  allegations raised by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez,  the two women who came forward to tell their experiences facing sexual  assault.   When Dr. Ford decided to make her story public, she faced all her  worst fears. She was harassed. She received death threats. She had to  relocate her home, her husband, and two children. Yet, in less than a  week, she came before the Senate and told 21 Senators she had never  met, along with millions  [[Page S6562]]  of Americans, about the most tragic, traumatic, and difficult  experience of her life. She did so with poise, grace, and, most  importantly, bravery.   Unfortunately, she was met with partisanship and hostility. My  Republican colleagues have largely chosen to ignore her powerful  testimony.   Senators weren't allowed to hear from any witnesses who could  corroborate or refute her account. They refused to gather evidence or  do an impartial investigation into her allegations.   Deborah Ramirez also reluctantly came forward to tell her story. Like  Dr. Ford, Ms. Ramirez offered to speak to the FBI. Both Ford and  Ramirez submitted evidence to support their allegations, including  naming over two dozen witnesses each.   Unfortunately, the limited investigation that was conducted by the  FBI failed to interview any one of the witnesses these who women  identified who could support her account.   Let me say that again. They refused to investigate--to talk with--any  of the 24 witnesses that could have supported their accounts.   I think it is important to remember why we are here today. We are  here to determine whether Judge Kavanaugh has demonstrated the  impartiality, the temperament, and the even-handedness that is needed  to serve on this great High Court of our land.   If confirmed, he will join eight other individuals who are charged  with deciding how the laws of the land are interpreted and applied. He  would be a deciding vote on the most important issues affecting our  country and every American for generations to come.   Based on all of the factors we have before us, I do not believe Judge  Kavanaugh has earned this seat.   Thank you.
