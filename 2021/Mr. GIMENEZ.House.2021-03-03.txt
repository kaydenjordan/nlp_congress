 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1.   Americans love election season. They absolutely love the endless  political ads, having their phones blown up by political calls and  texts, and having their email inboxes littered with solicitations from  want-to-be politicians. My phone keeps ringing off the hook from all of  my constituents just pleading for Congress to use their dollars to fund  more campaign ads.   This is the fantasy world that government bureaucrats and career  politicians who want a Federal takeover of our elections live in. They  want to take Americans' money and give it to campaigns at a 6-to-1  ratio, effectively forcing you to finance political campaigns you don't  support.   H.R. 1, the so-called For the People Act, weaponizes the FEC into a  partisan commission and throws out commonsense voter I.D. laws, just to  name a few. As one of the only Members of Congress who has actually had  to implement election protocols, I speak on authority when it comes to  our elections. This bill is a travesty for all Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this  egregious, so-called police reform bill. The process used to craft this  bill is nonsense.   In a normal functioning Congress, the Speaker would bring together  Republicans and Democrats to discuss ways to push needed police  reforms. But in this dysfunctional Congress, we got a bill that strips  our frontline police officers from qualified immunity, that will weaken  and possibly destroy our communities' police forces.   Mr. Speaker, as mayor and sheriff of Miami-Dade County, and a former  SWAT medic myself, I was actually responsible for ensuring my community  was kept safe from lawlessness. I understand firsthand the importance  of qualified immunity for police officers to carry out their jobs.   Officers perform vital tasks requiring split-second decisions under  intense circumstances. Taking away qualified immunity will lead to  police officers not taking the decisive actions and rendering it  impossible for them to do their job. Without this security, officers  will resign and deplete our police force, leaving our communities--the  very ones who need a strong police force the most--less safe and  costing the lives of countless Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to vote against this  dangerous bill.
