 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Reverend Jesse  Bernard Bilberry, Jr.'s lifetime of service.   Reverend Bilberry has dedicated nearly four decades of pastoral  service and educational leadership throughout the State of Louisiana. I  am proud to have Reverend Bilberry as my constituent. He just recently  retired from the historic Mount Pilgrim Baptist Church in  Scotlandville, Louisiana, and was named pastor emeritus.   Reverend Bilberry began his career in service as an officer in the  United States Army, and we owe him a deep seed of gratitude for his  service to our country.   After an honorable discharge from the Army, Reverend Bilberry spent  several years as an administrator at Southern University, ending his  tenure there as director of admissions.   Reverend Bilberry has distinguished himself as a well-respected  community and religious leader both at home and abroad. From leading  missionaries in the West Indies to leading several service-oriented  organizations and his church, Reverend Bilberry has led a life of  compassion and courage that has resonated with the people of Baton  Rouge and throughout the State of Louisiana.   I thank Reverend Bilberry for his tireless contributions serving his  community throughout his career in ministry and education.                            ____________________
