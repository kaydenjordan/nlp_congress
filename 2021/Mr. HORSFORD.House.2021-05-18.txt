 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize and celebrate Ms.  Juliana Urtubey, a Nevada teacher whose commitment to joyful and just  education has led to her well-deserved selection as the 2021 National  Teacher of the Year.   Ms. Urtubey is a first-generation immigrant and bilingual educator  who works in special education at Booker Elementary in Nevada's Fourth  Congressional District.   At Booker Elementary, she is known as Ms. Earth for beautifying the  community with gardens and murals.   She teaches her students to take pride in themselves, their  identities, and their strengths.   She is the best of Nevada, the best of our educators, and we are so  proud of her.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 398, the  resolution recognizing the forthcoming centennial of the 1921 Tulsa  Race Massacre.   One hundred years ago, the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma, was home to the  Greenwood district, a thriving, prosperous community where Black  families could pursue the American Dream.   On May 31, 1921, this vibrant community was attacked and destroyed by  white supremacists in one of the worst acts of racial violence in  American history.   But today, Greenwood is rising again.   H. Res. 398 commemorates the victims of the Tulsa Race Massacre and  mourns the loss of Black Wall Street to hatred and bigotry. It  celebrates the strength and perseverance of Black Americans, and it  calls on all Americans to work toward a more perfect Union, one that  will finally fulfill our Nation's promise of liberty and justice for  all.
