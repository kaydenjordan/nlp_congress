 Madam President, Washington, DC, is in the middle of a  carjacking crime wave. There have been more than 100 carjackings in our  Nation's Capital so far this year. It is only March 8. I think that is  more than one a day. Two-thirds of DC carjackers use guns to force  their terrified victims out of their vehicles.   What do the Washington Democrats do in response to this carjacking  crime wave? Do they support ``fund the police,'' install more cameras,  put more cops on the streets? No. They passed a law to reduce criminal  penalties for carjacking--reduce criminal penalties for carjackings and  other serious crimes. I wish I were joking; but, sadly, I am not.   Washington's answer to higher crime is less prison time for violent  criminals. The only reason this is not going to happen is because  Congress retains its constitutional authority over our Federal city  because Washington is not a State, nor should it ever be a State. But  in this case, some Democrats--even President Biden--got skittish about  the political price they would pay for being this weak on crime, so  they broke ranks and headed for the hills.   When House Republicans voted to disapprove Washington's soft-on-crime  bill, 31 Democrats voted with them. I suspect something similar will  play out later here today. President Biden says he will sign the  resolution of disapproval once it passes because--and these are his  words:         I don't support some of the changes the DC Council put       forward over the Mayor's objections, such as lowering       penalties for carjackings.    Those are the President's words. I welcome the Democrats' rebuke of  the Washington, DC, City Council. I hope it is more than a passing  moment of sanity, but I do have my doubts.   So let's put their new tough-on-crime attitude to the test. It is  really not enough to stop carjackings just here in Washington, DC,  because carjacking is not a Washington, DC, problem alone. Many cities  are suffering from carjacking crime waves as well, just as they are  suffering from increases in the murder rate and other terrible crimes.   According to a recent report, carjackings rose an astonishing 29  percent in seven major cities between 2020 and 2022. Why the increase?  Well, one reason is the FIRST STEP Act, soft-on-crime bill that  Congress passed in the final days of 2018. That bill let criminals out  of jail early for even serious violent offenses like mild molestation,  bank robbery, assaulting a police officer, and, yes, carjacking.   The FIRST STEP Act wasn't the only effort to coddle violent  criminals, but it is an egregious law that made clear too many of our  elected officials no longer take serious crime seriously. The FIRST  STEP Act increased, by about 15 percent, the amount of time that  Federal criminals, even carjackers, can get off their sentences for so- called good behavior. This is in addition to the extensive sentencing  reductions and early release programs for other crimes in the bill. The  result was that if a carjacker, say, got 6 years in prison, he could be  back out on the street to offend again in as few as 5 years.   It is time to rectify this mistake and to keep carjackers behind  bars. That is why I am offering my bill, the No Early Release for  Carjackers Act. The bill is as simple as its title. If you go to jail  for violently hijacking someone's car, you should serve your entire  sentence, not get time off for supposed good behavior.   So if President Biden and congressional Democrats are really  committed to getting tough on carjackers--not just here in Washington,  DC, where they drive around a lot--then they should support this  effort.   I know that some of the defenders of the First Step Act will say,  yes, carjackers should get out of jail early for good behavior. These  criminals will, after all, get out of jail one day--or so the argument  goes--so shouldn't we rehabilitate them by rewarding them, encouraging  their good behavior?   To which I answer: Sure, we can reward good behavior for carjackers  in prison. We can encourage good behavior, but we shouldn't reward it  in a way that endangers the public. Letting dangerous criminals out of  jail early endangers the public.   If the Members of the Senate are truly concerned with rewarding good  behavior, we can offer well-behaved inmates other incentives, say,  greater access to prison telephones, transfers to lower security  facilities. And carjackers will remain eligible for other incentive  programs that are so beloved by the soft-on-crime set like gardening  classes or whatever else it is liberals think will turn supposedly  hardened criminals into model citizens. But there is simply no good  reason to release dangerous criminals from prison early, especially  not in the middle of a violent carjacking crime wave.    Crime is a policy choice and the choice is simple: If we put  criminals behind bars, crime goes down; if we let criminals run amuck,  crimes goes up. We have seen the consequences of letting carjackers run  amuck. Now we  [[Page S689]]  have a choice to fix that terrible mistake.   Therefore, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 713, which is at the desk.  I further ask that the bill be considered, and read a third time and  passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.    Well, Madam President, I am disappointed that our  bipartisan bonhomie this week about carjacking only lasted as long as  overturning Washington, DC's law.   We should address how we can stop more carjackings. I don't think we  should blame cars for carjacking the way some would blame guns for gun  violence. The simplest way to stop carjacking is to lock carjackers  away in prison for a long time and not to let them out early.   And the Senator from Illinois, I will say, is right. I was the most  implacable foe of the FIRST STEP Act, and I remain so. Guilty as  charged. I will walk free, like most violent criminals in Washington,  DC, who plead guilty as well, but continue my advocacy against that law  which has led to hundreds and hundreds of its beneficiaries committing  violent crimes. It was a mistake in 2018 when we passed it. Eighty- seven Senators committed the mistake, including most Republicans.  President Trump made a mistake in supporting the FIRST STEP Act. That  law is dangerous to public safety.   I yield the floor.
