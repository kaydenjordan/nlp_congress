 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that  will direct the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration,  FAA, to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences  to conduct a study on the diversity of the cybersecurity workforce of  the FAA in order to develop recommendations to increase the size,  quality, and diversity of such workforce.   Every day, Federal departments and agencies across our Nation face a  barrage of cybersecurity attacks that threaten our national and  economic security. An attack in 2006 forced the U.S. Federal Aviation  Administration to shut down one of its air traffic control systems in  Alaska. Another attack that possibly involved malicious hacking and  phishing targeted 75 airports in the United States in 2013.   Now, in recent years, the FAA has taken concrete steps to improve  cybersecurity protection mechanisms; however, Congress needs to ensure  that the FAA has the ability and resources to implement cybersecurity  protocols across all segments of the National Airspace System.   The mission of the FAA is ``to provide the safest, most efficient  aerospace system in the world,'' and one of the five values of the  agency to execute on that mission includes, in their vision statement:  ``People are our strength. Our success depends on the respect,  diversity, collaboration, and commitment of our workforce.''                                time  1645    According to CyberSeek, a national program of National Institute of  Standards and Technology in the Department of Commerce, in 2017, the  U.S. employed nearly 800,000 people in cybersecurity positions.  However, that same report goes on to add that approximately 350,000  jobs remain open in the cybersecurity space.   To ensure that FAA continues to safeguard the world's safest and most  productive aviation sector, Congress needs to ensure that the FAA has  all of the tools necessary to ready its workforce.   According to the FAA 2015 Performance and Accountability Report, the  agency has over 45,000 employees who have diverse educational and  career backgrounds. So when we look at our air traffic controllers,  researchers, maintenance specialists, safety inspectors, and mechanical  and electrical software engineers, innovative solutions to national  cybersecurity challenges will come from a diversity of perspectives.   That is why my amendment will study the needs of the existing  cybersecurity workforce of the FAA, and help identify and address any  gaps that exist, and ensure that the size, quality, and diversity of  such workforce at the FAA keep pace with the rapid technological  advancements in the aviation sector.   I want to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member Peter DeFazio for  their strength and their leadership. And I want to thank Chairman  Shuster for his leadership and emphasis on skills development and  training.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague on the other side  of the aisle for his support.   Our skilled trained workforce is one of the greatest challenges we  have in America in supplying a workforce that is going to address the  skilled needs of our workforce. If we don't address it and be  proactive, it is going to be creating a challenge not only to filling  jobs, but creating the workforce that will get the job done.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
