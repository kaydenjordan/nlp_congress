 Madam Speaker, today President Biden's  Department of Homeland Security announced that they did not know the  location of nearly 40 percent of illegal immigrants who have entered  our Nation.   The failed catch-and-release policies that have been championed for  the past 2 years have led to the chaos and the confusion that has made  each and every State a border State.   Since Joe Biden took office, there have been more than 5.5 million  illegal crossings at our southern border, and now liberal-run cities  are attempting to use our schools as shelters for illegal immigrants.   These policies have only worsened the situation, and it is time for  his administration to return to solutions that will address this  crisis.   It is time to reinstate title 42, it is time to stop using our  schools to house illegal immigrants, and it is time to fully secure our  border.                            ____________________
