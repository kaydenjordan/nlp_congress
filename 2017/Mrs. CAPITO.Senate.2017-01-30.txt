 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so  ordered.   (The remarks of Mrs. Capito pertaining to the introduction of S.J.  Res. 10 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced  Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')                            ____________________     Madam President, the Environmental Protection Agency,  which bears most of the blame for regulations targeting energy jobs, is  in dire need of a change of direction. The EPA under the Obama  administration was unwilling to engage the people of West Virginia in  public listening sessions or hearings about decisions that directly  impacted our State's economy, and I have described what the result of  that has been.   This failure to effectively engage resulted in a number of job- killing regulations, like the utility MATS rule for powerplants, the  so-called Clean Power Plan, and the waters of the U.S. rule.   As the Presiding Officer knows, the waters of the U.S. rule is  something that impacts not just mining but also agriculture,  construction, and it really has far-reaching implications.   Scott Pruitt, who is President Trump's nominee to become the EPA  Administrator, has gone through a thorough review process by the  Environment and Public Works Committee. At Attorney General Pruitt's  confirmation hearing, Senators from both parties were permitted to  engage in as many as four rounds of questioning, and some of them were  pretty tough. After the hearing, Attorney General Pruitt answered 1,078  questions for the Record. Combining both the hearing and the followup  questions, Attorney General Pruitt answered more than 1,200 questions  from our committees.   Through the process, Attorney General Pruitt has shown himself to be  a person who cares about applying our environmental laws as they were  written and intended by Congress. He has a  [[Page S465]]  strong record of enforcing environmental statutes in a balanced way and  ensuring clean air and clean water without unnecessarily sacrificing  jobs or economic growth.   Attorney General Pruitt has been clear that he will work with State  regulators and listen to the views of individuals who will be most  heavily impacted by EPA's regulatory decisions.   I believe Attorney General Pruitt will keep his word and provide a  refreshing change and direction for West Virginia coal miners, natural  gas workers, manufacturers, farmers, and, indeed, for all of our  communities struggling from the effects of overregulation.   I look forward to supporting Attorney General Pruitt's nomination in  the EPW Committee, which will come before the committee on Wednesday  morning, and I look forward to seeing him confirmed on the Senate floor  soon.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, the last 6 years have been devastating to  local economies across coal country. The Mine Safety and Health  Administration has estimated that at least 60,000 coal jobs have been  lost since 2011, and thousands of these jobs have been in my home State  of West Virginia.   Excessive government regulation and other factors have done more than  cost jobs. These policies have imperiled our coal miner retirement  benefits, and they have left local governments struggling to keep up to  pay for education, to pay for public works, and to pay for law  enforcement. I can tell my colleagues story after story I have seen in  our newspapers about this very thing.   In October, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee heard  testimony from Wayne County, West Virginia commissioner Robert Pasley.  He said that the coal severance tax revenues in Wayne County in West  Virginia--his county--dropped by 88 percent in 2013 and 2016. This drop  left the county without a vital funding source that traditionally  helped to pay for local volunteer fire departments, senior citizens  programs, and education.   West Virginia University economist John Deskins told the Senate  Energy  [[Page S494]]  and Natural Resources Committee in August that six West Virginia  counties were suffering a depression--a depression--because of the coal  downturn. And just last week, the State of West Virginia projected that  its annual State budget faces a $500 million shortfall.   So what was the response of President Obama's administration in its  last days in power? Yet another job-killing and anti-coal regulation  that would make a bad situation in my State worse.   The Department of the Interior published its stream protection rule  on December 20, 2016, and it made the rule effective on January 19,  2017--just 1 day before President Obama left office. There is a lot of  irony here, and I don't think it is by chance. According to a National  Mining Association Study, one-third of remaining coal jobs could be  placed at risk by the rule.   Today I am proud to join Leader McConnell as he introduces the Stream  Protection Congressional Review Act. We are also joined by my  colleagues in the West Virginia congressional delegation, including  Congressman David McKinley and Congressman Evan Jenkins, and others. We  are going to be introducing a resolution of disapproval under the  Congressional Review Act, blocking the Obama administration's stream  protection rule.   Once this resolution of disapproval is passed by Congress--and I  believe that it will be, and signed by President Trump, which I believe  that it will be--I am confident that both things will happen: The  stream protection rule will be nullified, and the Department of the  Interior will be prohibited from imposing a similar rule without  permission from Congress.   The stream protection rule deserves to be eliminated through the  Congressional Review Act process. Despite its title--because why would  we get rid of something called the stream protection rule--this rule  will do little to actually protect our streams, but if left in place,  this rule would cost even more coal jobs in my State and across the  country that have already been devastated.   West Virginia's former Department of Environmental Protection  secretary Randy Huffman told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources  Committee, on which I served last Congress, that the proposed version  of the stream protection rule was ``an unnecessary, uncalled for  political gesture.''   I would like to say that Secretary Huffman was serving under a  Democratic Governor in my State.   The stream protection rule is the result of an incredibly flawed  regulatory process that excluded State officials. Of the 10 States that  began the regulatory process--people were asked to join together to  begin this process--working with the Department of the Interior's  Office of Surface Mining, eight of those States eventually removed  themselves from the process because of the Department's unwillingness  to actually seriously consider their input. In other words, they were  just there for window dressing.   Ohio's chief of Mineral Resources Management Larry Erdos told the  Environment and Public Works Committee last February that ``OSM has not  provided for meaningful participation with the cooperating or  commenting agency states.''   Congress took action to instruct the Department of the Interior to  reengage with the States, realizing what was happening here, before  moving forward with this rulemaking process. However, despite this  direction from lawmakers in the Congress, the Department failed to  address the State concerns.   Wyoming director of Environmental Quality, Todd Parfitt, told the  Energy and Natural Resources Committee that ``the failure to engage  cooperating agencies throughout this process is reflected in the poor  quality of the proposed rule.'' He called on the Office of Surface  Mining to withdraw the rule and reengage with States and other  stakeholders.   Last week, West Virginia's newly appointed secretary of Environmental  Protection--again under a new Democratic Governor--Austin Caperton  wrote to congressional leaders detailing our State's concerns with the  stream protection rule. Secretary Caperton gave three main reasons for  West Virginia's opposition to this rule.   First, he said that the rule upsets the statutory balance between  environmental protection and allowing coal mining to take place in the  first place. Second, the rule conflicts with the congressionally  directed role of the States to be the exclusive regulators of mining  activities. And third, the rule conflicts with the Federal Clean Water  Act and State water quality standards--pretty broad-ranging concerns.   The concerns from environmental regulators in mining States across  the country explain why 14 States, including the State of West  Virginia, have already filed lawsuits to stop this stream protection  rule. Fifteen State attorneys general, led by West Virginia's attorney  general Patrick Morrisey, have written to Congress asking that this  rule be blocked using the Congressional Review Act.   State environmental regulators are not alone in their opposition to  this rule. Cecil Roberts, who is the president of the United Mine  Workers of America, wrote just last week in support of this resolution  of disapproval. He said that ``the last thing America's coal-producing  regions need at this time is another regulation that will have the  effect of reducing employment even more and further stifling economic  development.''   West Virginia cannot afford another job-killing regulation that once  again inserts Washington and their one-size-fits-all standard into a  regulatory process that is supposed to be effectively managed--and is  effectively managed--by our State agencies.   The stream protection rule is a flawed policy that was born out of a  flawed process.   The rule deserves to be eliminated promptly, and I encourage my  colleagues to cosponsor the McConnell-Capito resolution of disapproval  and to vote to block the rule in the coming days.                                  ______                                         By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Lee,          Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Paul, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Graham, Mr.          Lankford, Mrs. Ernst, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Boozman, Mr.          Enzi, Mr. Gardner, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Cassidy, and Mr. Sasse):   S.J. Res. 14. A joint resolution providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Social Security Administration relating to  Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007; to the  Committee on Finance.
