 Madam President, today I have the distinct honor  of recognizing Les Gilman of Madison County for his longstanding  dedication to protecting the land and people that make up Ruby Valley.   Les is a fifth generation Montana rancher in the Alder area with  family roots that date back to the Gold Rush in Virginia City in 1863.  The history of the Gilman family's revered land can be recounted by  historical documents written and compiled by Les' father, Lowell  Gilman, complete with photographs and stories of the agricultural and  mining activity that took place over the years. Les and his wife,  Donna, now proudly tend to their family's ranch along with other family  members.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S6821, November 28, 2022, in the first column, the  following appears: Les and his wife, Donna, now proudly tend to  their family's ranch alongside their son, Charlie, and daughter- in-law, Kaycee, in addition to their four grandchildren.
