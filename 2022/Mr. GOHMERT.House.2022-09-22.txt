 Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford).                        Brain Aneurysm Awareness Month     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for those  words and comfort that they will hopefully bring.   I think most Americans, especially those that knew anybody who fought  for our country in Afghanistan, are aware of how poorly things went a  year ago when the Biden administration, it appeared, tried to emulate  the disastrous leaving of Vietnam when so much was left behind,  including our allies.   Like in Vietnam, allies were left there, many of whom were killed. Of  course, 13 of our servicemen were killed that never should have been  and did not need to be if we had left properly, as some of our Northern  Alliance allies, a part of the Afghan people who fought for us and with  us beginning in October 2001, about a month after 9/11--many died  fighting for us and with us.   We helped provide them weapons, and we had about 300 or so Special  Operations people who were embedded with them, and they took the fight  to the Taliban. Within 6 months, there was no organized Taliban left in  Afghanistan. Some of them fled to Pakistan or other surrounding  countries, but they had been defeated with the great help of General  Dostum, who was the commander who was the overall commander of the  Afghan forces fighting against the Taliban.   President Biden and his advisers, for whatever reason, decided it was  better to leave tens of billions of dollars of equipment and weapons  for our enemies to use against our allies and probably one day use  against the United States itself.   We saw this kind of disastrous exit from Vietnam. An estimated 2  million or so people who helped us and were sympathetic to us were  killed in Southeast Asia. I just thought surely we would never be that  stupid and that callous to allow allies to be harmed like that.   I met with some of our Northern Alliance allies, along with a few  other Members of Congress, numerous times. Of course, there was the  great Afghan hero of the war between Afghanistan and Russia.  Unfortunately, our intelligence agencies here in the U.S. did not pick  up on the importance of Shah Massoud, Lion of Panjshir, being  assassinated by the Taliban within a day, day-and-a-half or so of 9/11  about to occur. Had they been awake and not asleep at what was going  on, they would have anticipated the Taliban was about to do something  to cause great harm to the United States.   They knew once we realized that the attack originated from  Afghanistan that we would be coming and looking for allies, and we  would certainly want Massoud and his brother and all those others who  wanted the Taliban gone, we would be using them and working with them  to eliminate the Taliban. So, the Taliban eliminated that great Afghan  hero before 9/11.   In numerous meetings with our Afghan allies for a decade or more,  going back to the Obama administration days, they were telling a few of  us: Look, we know you have to leave at some point. We know that. But  what we are begging is that you help us amend the Constitution that you  forced on us. We like it; it is based on sharia law. But this is a  country that is perfectly suited for the federalist system where you  have so much power in your country in the States and our country, they  said, in the provinces. But right now, the Constitution that you gave  us, forced on us, the President appoints the governors, the mayors, the  chiefs of police, and it is a system made for corruption.   It sounded to me like the way things were going over there, the times  I went to Afghanistan, and you are hearing the reports of what was  going on, whether it was Karzai or Ghani, that they may well have taken  a great deal of money, like the old Roman days, and whoever gave the  most money would get the best governorship.   They were appointing governors that didn't even live in the province  that  [[Page H8107]]  they were going to be governor over. They were not allowed to have  militias like they wanted, as Zia Massoud told me more than once in  trips to meet with them.    In fact, the Obama administration did not want me meeting with our  allies. They did what they could to keep me from meeting with our  allies, even though the Obama administration basically threw them to  the curb and was anxious to work deals with the Taliban.   In fact, the colonel there at the Embassy in Afghanistan, I told him  that I have a meeting with Massoud, Dostum, numerous of our allies, and  he said: We can't let you do that.   I said: I am not asking you for a ride. Massoud is sending a vehicle,  and they will make sure that I am protected. They are not going to let  me be killed because they want to protect the relationship.   The colonel said: Well, we are not authorized to let you do that.   I said: You see the gate over there? When the car gets here, I am  going to get in that car, and I am going to go meet with our allies. I  know the Obama administration has rejected any type of relationship  with those people that fought for us and with us, who lost family  members, but I am going to go meet with the allies that have sacrificed  so much to help us, help both of us.   Well, they ended up getting a car, and I was told before the vehicle  that Massoud was sending: Will you let Massoud know we are going to  bring you there?   Michele Bachmann went out there with me. She had not met them before.   Mike Burgess went out there.   But all they wanted was for us to help them fix the Constitution we  forced on them. They needed a federalist form of government, and that  is what they said: If you will help us get that, we can elect our own  governors, and we can elect our own mayors, pick our own police chiefs.  Then, each province will have a militia because when you leave, the  Taliban is going to try to take back over, and then they will  eventually want to hit you again. But if we are allowed to elect our  own governors and mayors, we will be able to have a militia in each  province. So, when you leave, then we will be able to band together and  whip the Taliban again. But if you leave it like it is and keep  negotiating with the Taliban--which the Obama administration had been  doing basically the whole administration--then we are all going to be  killed. Then they will hit you again, and then you will want to come  back to Afghanistan and try to find allies, but we will all be dead,  and no one will be crazy enough to help you again. So, just help us  elect our own governors.   I said: What makes you think we can help you get your Constitution  amended? It is your Constitution now.   He said: You are paying most of our government's annual budget, so if  you say the Constitution needs to be amended or we are not going to pay  this year's budget for you, then it will be amended, and we will be  able to protect ourselves from the Taliban whenever it is that you  leave.   I know Secretary Pompeo also negotiated with the Taliban, but there  is no way President Trump would have ever allowed our troops to leave  and leave tens of billions of dollars' worth of equipment for our enemy  to someday use against us. He wouldn't do that.                                time  1730    And on the other hand, the Taliban knew that if they did anything to  our folks during a projected move of coming back to the United States  that President Trump would bomb them back to the Stone Age so they  would not have done what they did. They perceived America to be weak  under this administration, and we lost 13 soldiers, military members  that should never have been lost.   So as if that wasn't enough damage, I see this article, I just saw it  today, it is dated September 12 by Daniel Greenfield. It says: ``White  House Democrats have a history of fighting against terror victims suing  Islamic terrorists. The Obama administration battled American terror  victims suing the PLO. In 2015, after they won a $218 million judgment  against the terror group, Blinken, then only a Deputy Secretary of  State, intervened claiming that the lawsuit threatened `several decades  of U.S. foreign policy.'   ``But now Biden is fighting 9/11 victims''--that is American  victims--``on behalf of the Taliban.''   We have this administration helping the Taliban fight in court  against 9/11 victims. The rhetorical question arises to the Biden  administration: Whose side are you on? You are helping the Taliban.   The article goes on: ``At stake are billions'' of dollars ``being  held by the Afghan central bank fund in the United States.   ``A decade ago, 9/11 families sued the Taliban, al-Qaida, and Iran.  The court found that the Islamic terrorists were responsible and a  judgment of $6 billion was handed down.'' That is for the 9/11  families.   ``The verdict was described as `symbolic' at the time. CBS News  commented that `it would be near impossible to collect any damages,  especially from the Taliban or al-Qaida.' But that was before Biden  turned over Afghanistan to the Taliban. Since Afghanistan has assets in  this country''--in the U.S.--``including $7 billion in bank funds, it's  now entirely possible to collect that . . . `' $7 billion, or it would  be if the guy who let the Taliban take over wasn't also in the White  House.   ``Biden officially announced that he was splitting the $7 billion  between the families of the victims and a `trust fund' to provide  `humanitarian aid' for the people of Afghanistan.''   In other words, we are going to help the Taliban out to make the  people of Afghanistan feel better about the Taliban being in charge.  That is what is going on here.   Biden officially announced that he was going to make that split.   ``The $3.5 billion was placed in a separate trust that would be  `separate and distinct' from the around $800 million the Biden  administration has already spent on aid to Afghanistan. Officials  admitted that the money could actually be used for matters other than  `humanitarian aid.'''   In other words, it could be used to help the Taliban itself, the  people that killed 3,000 or so Americans on 9/11, the worst attack on  American soil in American history, and this administration is making  sure they get billions of dollars.   The article goes on: ``The media headlined it as, `Biden frees frozen  Afghan billions for relief, 9/11 victims.' But a Biden official  admitted that it was done to stop 9/11 families from getting access to  the money.''   ``As a Lawfare blog post noted, `the administration's . . . `'-- talking about the Biden administration's--``' . . . plan would insulate  nearly half of the Afghan assets at issue from these attachment  efforts.   ``What Biden actually did was take the money off the table for the 9/ 11 victims. And it got worse.   ``Secretary of State Blinken claimed that the administration `will  continue to support these victims and their families, recognizing the  enduring pain they have suffered at the hands of terrorists, including  those who operated from Afghanistan prior to the September 11 attacks.  These victims and their families should have a full opportunity to set  forth their arguments in court.''' This article says: ``Blinken, like  his boss, lied.''   ``While the 9/11 families would have their claims `heard in court,'  neither Biden nor Blinken mentioned that the administration would be  advocating against . . . `' these 9/11 victims.   ``On the same day as Biden's executive order reserving $3.5 billion  for the terrorists, his Justice Department filed a statement of  interest in court arguing that the judgment for the victims of  terrorism was too large and that actually turning over the money''--the  $3.5 billion--``to them''--or all $7 billion to them--``would interfere  with the Biden administration's foreign policy in Afghanistan.''   Like we have a policy in Afghanistan? No. All the rare Earth  minerals, the things that could have paid us back for ridding the  Afghan people of the Taliban, well, not only were they allowed to come  back and take over, but they made deals with China to let them have the  rare Earth minerals. In other words, this administration just  exponentially magnified the loss in life, assets, and money that they  lost for America.   ``Now a magistrate judge has repeated back most of the DOJ's  arguments, ruling against the 9/11 families  [[Page H8108]]  who were laying claim to the other half of the money. Judge Sarah  Netburn's arguments closely mirror the contradictory positions of Biden  and the DOJ. And they reveal the underlying corruption behind the  ambiguous status of Afghanistan's central bank.   ``Netburn, like the Biden administration, contends that the  Afghanistan bank enjoys `sovereign immunity' because the country itself  was not sanctioned as a terrorist state, only the Taliban were. And  that the Taliban once again control Afghanistan is irrelevant,  according to the judge, because Biden hasn't recognized the reality  that this is actually the case.   ``Banks don't enjoy `sovereign immunity' and neither do the Taliban.  Netburn and Biden act as if there were some entity representing  Afghanistan that is not the Taliban. That position might make sense if  they were backing a resistance movement to the Taliban. But they are  not.''   It was sad enough that this administration's mishandling of  negotiating--we should have been negotiating with our allies to leave  the country in their hands with an amended constitution. Instead, we  left it in the hands of our enemies.   As some of our allies there have said, the day will come when the  Taliban will hit America again. Next time it will be harder. They have  got more money. They have got tens of billions of American assets to  utilize or sell and use the money, but the difference will be this time  after America loses thousands of lives at the hands of the Taliban and  America comes to Afghanistan seeking allies to help them defeat the  Taliban, as we did in 2001 and 2002, we will all be dead, those of us  who were America's allies, and no one will be stupid enough to trust  the United States again. What a tragic, horrific blunder by this  administration.   Now, the exit was the blunder, but turning against the 9/11 victims'  families, that is not a blunder. That is very intentional by this  administration. Being much more helpful and sympathetic to the Taliban,  who were terrorists that hit this country, and have never apologized  and will never apologize, instead of standing against them and making  sure they never commit terrorist acts again, this administration wants  to be sure they get billions of dollars; like the Obama administration  was ensuring that Iran got the largest state sponsor of terrorism. So I  guess at least we can say that is a good thing. This administration,  the Biden administration, is at least being consistent with the Obama  administration.   The Obama administration helped the Taliban. The Obama administration  did not help the 9/11 families. Now, the Biden administration is  working against the 9/11 families, and they are actually helping the  Taliban with more money than the Taliban has ever had. An amazing  development.   If things don't get turned around soon where we have a wiser  administration next time with Republicans in the majority come January  that helps get back to using more common sense, then this will be a  horrific chapter in the book rise and fall of the United States of  America and how we helped our enemy ultimately destroy ourselves  because of some misguided, hairbrained idea that you can give your  enemy billions of dollars, give them tens of billions of dollars of  military equipment and weapons and think you were going to come out  just fine on the other side.   I want to address some energy issues. This article from NPR, August  25, reports that ``California is poised to set a 2035 deadline for all  new cars, trucks, and SUVs sold in the State to be powered by  electricity or hydrogen, an ambitious step that will reshape the U.S.  car market by speeding the transition to more climate-friendly  vehicles.''                                time  1745    It is a long article, but it does not deal with the reality that we  are already seeing take place as this administration and people in some  States are demanding to get rid of all fossil fuel immediately and  quickly, but China will continue to own hundreds of coal-powered  plants. Unfortunately, China doesn't utilize the scrubbers and things  that allow American coal plants to have much more clean operation in  producing electricity.   In fact, I have heard experts and people with whom we have consulted  say there will be so much pollution coming from China that even if the  U.S. totally eliminated every single coal plant, the air would not be  improved because of all of the pollution that will be coming our way  from China.   My good friend,   Thomas Massie, has more patents than anybody in the  House or Senate. Even though he got an MIT education, he is a brilliant  guy.   Thomas Massie has pointed out that actually plugging in one  electric vehicle is about the equivalent of plugging in 17  refrigerators, and this administration wants everybody to start buying  electric vehicles, so everybody has electric vehicles and the sooner  the better.   But the fact is that even if half of the cars that run on fossil fuel  now were replaced immediately with electric vehicles, then first of  all, we would end up causing no telling how many children around the  world to be used as slave labor more than are being used right now in  order to gather and mine the lithium and the things that are needed to  produce electric cars.   And we won't even bother to talk about right now the massive problem  in dealing with that many batteries with all that lithium and what will  be done with all of that. We don't know. We are just going headlong  into trying to have all electric vehicles.   Mr. Speaker, you can't make an electric vehicle right now--not one  that is any good--unless you use fossil fuel. And you have to have  natural gas as feedstock to make so many of the products that are used  in the vehicles. I guess you could do like Fred Flintstone and have one  made out of stone and wood.   Why would this administration want to take us back to the Stone Age?   It seems some of these policies are determined to do that.   In fact, here is an article from The Epoch Times: ``States to Ban  Gas-Powered Cars Despite EVs' Human, Environmental Costs''.   It was written by Katie Spence on September 12.   She points out some of these hidden costs that I have been alluding  to, she says, ``According to politicians like Newsom and President Joe  Biden, electric vehicles, or EVs, are `zero emission' because they use  lithium-ion batteries--consisting of lithium, cobalt, graphite, and  other materials--instead of gas.   ``Thus, starting in 2035, California will ban gas-powered vehicle  sales, while several other States plan to follow suit, citing that as a  goal and `critical milestone in our climate fight'.   ``Additionally, according to a statement from Biden, banning gas- powered vehicles will `save consumers money, cut pollution, boost  public health, advance environmental justice, and tackle the climate  crisis'.   ``John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, disagrees,  pointing out to The Epoch Times that `industrial' nations might benefit  from the transition to EVs, but it's at the expense of all others.   `` `This expansion of [lithium] mining will have immediate  consequences for front-line communities that are taking the ``hit'' '.   ``For example, Copiapo, the capital of Chile's Atacama region, is the  location of one of the world's largest known lithium reserves.   `` `We used to have a river before, that now doesn't exist. There  isn't a drop of water,' Elena Rivera Cardoso, president of the  Indigenous Colla community of the Copiapo commune, told the National  Resources Defense Council.   ``She added that all of Chile's water is disappearing because of the  local lithium mine.   `` `In all of Chile, there are rivers and lakes that have  disappeared--all because a company has a lot more right to water than  we do as human beings or citizens of Chile.'   ``In collaboration with Cardoso's statement, the Institute for Energy  Research reports that 65 percent of the area's limited water resources  are consumed by mining activities.   ``That's displacing indigenous communities who have called Atacama  home for more than 6,000 years, because farmers and ranchers have  cracked, dry soil, and no choice but to abandon their ancestral  settlements, according to the U.N. Conference on Trade and  Development.''   Now that is so interesting.  [[Page H8109]]    But where is the compassion?   We are so determined to have electric vehicles so that we can say to  the world that we are cleaning up the world when we are not cleaning up  the world. We are making the world a disastrous place so that woke  liberals here in America can think that all is right with the world  when actually they have put children into slave labor by creating this  market causing countries to dry up like Chile.   It is rather tragic, and people who mean well and think they are  doing great need to understand the damage they are doing to the planet  and to people who don't live in Martha's Vineyard.   Another issue that is particularly troublesome, Mr. Speaker, we have  had a bipartisan effort in this body to work and to fight to stop  genital mutilation. Yet now, after years of working together and trying  to stop such a horrendous practice, we now have people who claim to be  exceedingly liberal and caring, and they are pushing to have little  children's genitalia mutilated, cut off, and eliminated and have those  children take puberty blockers that will likely stunt their growth,  make them infertile, and destroy the wonder that would have been their  lives without the so-called caring people pushing them to destroy their  bodies.   According to the most extensive study ever done by people who have  been through sex change surgery, the Swedish Institute followed people  who had been through sex change surgery for 30 years. And what was the  most disturbing to me of the result of that 30-year study was that if  you have sex change surgery, Mr. Speaker, you are 20 times more likely  to kill yourself, to take your own life.   We had a press conference.   Marjorie Taylor Greene has a bill that would stop this kind of  outrageous abuse of children.   You see, Mr. Speaker, my background, I have been a prosecutor, and I  have been a litigator. I have been a felony judge and a chief justice  before coming to Congress. I am quite familiar with the laws of Texas  and Federal laws. Most States have very similar laws because we have  advanced so as a people that we have understood that children need to  grow up in innocence. It is so much more productive.   Some have felt that it may well be that Americans have been the most  ingenious and most productive in creating new inventions and that our  patent system before it got screwed up in recent years by Congress  encouraged individual inventors to come up with new things. But I have  read indications that some people believe it is because we encourage  children to use their imagination in growing up, and they have  developed more imagination.   Now we have got some people who think they are do-gooders, but they  encourage genital mutilation of a child that can never be fixed. Oh,  Mr. Speaker, you can do a transition back, but it is so devastating. It  is horrific.   That is supposed to be an advanced civilization doing this to  children?   The studies, and Dr. Paul McHugh--who was the head of psychiatry at  Johns Hopkins, which is the first hospital in America to do sex change  surgeries back in the sixties--points out that it is child abuse to  give puberty blockers because of the adverse effects on the body to  then do gender mutilation.   Mr. Speaker, I presided over criminal felony trials. Even if someone  underage, a child, or a minor consents, the laws have made clear we  recognize they are not mentally and judgmentally mature enough to give  consent for anybody to do anything with their private areas.   I have sent lots of people to prison. So if an adult takes advantage  of their immaturity, people have been sent to prison for that all over  America. And the huge majority of Americans agree that it was the right  thing to do when they sexually abuse a child, even if the child  consented, because we know they are not mature enough to give  legitimate consent.   Yet we have adults who should be mature enough to say, you are not  going to touch this child's body.   They have to come of age, the age of majority, and make their own  informed decision and give their own informed consent.   No one else should ever be able to do that in their place because  these kids are the ones who have to live with their bodies for the rest  of their lives, even though they are 20 times more likely to kill  themselves because of what the adult gave consent for them to do.   I am hoping at some point there will be laws in every State and  through Congress that we will do, as we have done with sexual assault  of a child laws, where most States, if not all, that I am aware of, say  we are going to extend the statute of limitations to a certain number  of years past the time when they would become adults.                                time  1800    So that if any adult gave permission for someone to have perfectly  functioning organs removed, changed, puberty blockers, and the child  later feels that was an assault, then let them sue within those extra  years of statute of limitations. I think it would be a good idea to do  something like that.   Adults should not have the right to consent to destroying or harming  a child's body, and especially when it makes it 20 times more likely  they will take their own life because of what some adult did on behalf  of the child.   Well, we had a young lady named Chloe Cole, a beautiful person, she  is 18. Actually, this article by Christine Buttons from The Daily Wire,  September 20, talked about the press conference we had.   It says: ``An 18-year-old detransitioned woman gave a powerful  testimony on Tuesday against the `gender affirming' model of care that  led to her irreversible medical transition as an adolescent.   ``Chloe Cole spoke at a press conference in front of the''--it was in  front of the Capitol--``in support of Representative Marjorie Taylor  Greene's new bill, the Protect Children's Innocence Act, that aims to  shield minors from assessing the permanent body- and life-altering  medical treatments that they may later come to regret.''   Chloe said: `` `How did we get to the point where nearly every  pediatric institution in the country considers it best practice to  remove the healthy breast tissue of children while administering drugs  typically used to chemically castrate high-risk sex offenders?' Cole  said of the widespread acceptance of radical gender theory in medicine  driving `gender-affirming care,' which effectively puts children in the  driver's seat to dictate the terms of their own sex change.   `` `I believe Americans deserve to know the truth about this radical  and perverse ideology, marketed as necessary and ``live-saving''  healthcare,' said Cole. Cole opened her speech with a chilling  statistic.''   She said, `` `Over the past decade, there has been as high as a 4,000  percent increase in children being referred to so-called ``gender  clinics'' across the United States. I was one of these children.' A  recent UCLA survey found that the number of trans-identified teens has  doubled in the last 5 years to about 300,000 in the United States,  while the rates of adults identifying as transgender have remained the  same. According to the Gender Mapping Project, only a handful of  pediatric gender clinics existed in the United States a decade ago. Now  over 200 have spawned to meet the growing demand of adolescents who  identify as transgender seeking medical transition.''   I read an article that the former head of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins  had written, pointing out that 80 percent of children, boys and girls,  who identify or seem to have gender dysphoria--is what it is now called  in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual-V.   Dysphoria--if you look it up--it means confusion, sort of an antonym  to euphoria. People are encouraging people to become more and more  gender-confused.   Dr. McHugh pointed out about 80 percent of those who have confusion  about their gender growing up, if they never have counseling, they  never have some do-gooder adult encouraging them to have their  genitalia mutilated and their life shortened, and perhaps most likely a  good chance of infertility, that if they are just left alone, go  through childhood, 80 percent transition into exactly what they are  biologically without any problems whatsoever.   Yet, we have people in this country that want to create laws against  anybody allowing a child to go through  [[Page H8110]]  childhood and then adjust, and not have the physical horrors that these  surgeries cause.   I was deeply moved by Chloe Cole. She is a beautiful person. She was  very unfortunate in having people think they knew better and  encouraging her to take steps that she should not have taken, as she  will tell you now.   We are supposed to be the ones that are mature and help children  avoid going through horrors, and, yet, we have even got States passing  laws--don't you dare help this child. Let's help the child go through  genital mutilation, even though it will be his or her body.   As Dr. McHugh has pointed out and studies have pointed out, you can  go through sex change surgery or gender reassignment surgery--whatever  you want to call it--DNA-wise, biologically, you are still the same  gender you were before the surgery, and your DNA will remain the same.   Now, who knows, I read a Swedish study this year about the mRNA  vaccines. It was interesting, it says there is radiation at the point  of the injection, and more radiation found in the liver after the  vaccination with the mRNA vaccines. But the study documented that they  found that the mRNA ends up going to the liver and rewriting the body's  DNA for them. We don't know where all that is going to end up, but it  certainly doesn't appear to be going a good direction.   I have got no problem with people continuing to get the vaccinations  and the boosters, I think that is fine, so long as the wonderful  doctrine that we developed making healthcare better than it has been in  the history of the world, called informed consent.   That doctrine that requires that a physician or healthcare provider  advise the patient of all the potential risks of a vaccination,  treatment, surgery, whatever, and then letting them talk to their  doctor and making their own mind up about whether or not to go through  with it.   If we could do that, and I would submit, also allow the healthcare  providers and the pharmaceuticals to be liable for any damage that they  cause if they don't allow informed consent and allow the individual to  make up his or her mind, unless it is a minor. We don't allow minors to  make decisions normally unless it is in the sick area of genital  mutilation that I was just talking about.   If pharmaceuticals are that excited about continuing to make tens of  billions of dollars providing vaccinations, vaccines, great, just stand  good for whatever damages you cause. It sure seems like that would be  the right thing to do.   I won't have time to get to it, but this article from Jennifer  Margulis and Joe Wang, The Epoch Times, September 10, the headline is,  ``'Unethical' and up to 98 Times Worse Than the Disease: Top Scientists  Publish Paradigm-Shifting Study About COVID-19 Vaccines.''   It points out the boosters for young people may cause 18 to 98 actual  serious adverse events for each COVID-19 infection-related  hospitalization theoretically prevented. So for each hospitalization  prevented, they are saying 18 to 98 actual serious consequences to the  body will result.   It is going to be an interesting week next week. I look forward to  seeing what more damage that Congress can do to our economy, to our  country. I hope that people, Mr. Speaker, will let their Members of  Congress know what they agree with and what they disagree with.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
