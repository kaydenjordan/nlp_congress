 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole) for yielding.   These are strange times. I saw my friend Alcee Hastings on the floor.  I wanted to sit down beside him and whisper in his ear like we would  have done when we gathered last year. I wanted to grab his hand and  tell him I have been praying for him. Now, he is gone, back off the  House floor and back into social distancing.   No one denies that these are unusual times, even dire times, that  require a substantial response. In many ways, what we are doing here  today isn't unusual. We have a majority in the U.S. House of  Representatives that will, in fact, jam through, on an almost party- line vote, its agenda. That is not unusual.   We have a majority in the House that is going to implement its ideas  for rules changes in the House, even without a minority amendment. That  is not altogether unusual. But I have listened to colleague after  colleague come to the House floor and talk about the unusual times  that, I would argue, require an unusual response.   I feel a little empty today in what I usually enjoy as a Rules  Committee debate. I know how the Rules Committee goes, Madam Speaker.  There are nine members of the majority and four members of the  minority. The majority wins every vote, and not by a little, by a lot.   Your job, as a minority member on the Rules Committee, is to lose.  You go up there, and you lose every day. That is often the way the  House is when we are trying to put together a House position that is  going to go into negotiation.   But I have heard the sense of urgency that I know each of my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle believes, and our sense of  urgency today doesn't allow us time to push a messaging bill across the  floor.   Madam Speaker, this is the single largest borrow-and-spend bill the  country has ever seen, and it included not one Republican amendment-- not one. The single largest rules change the House of Representatives  has seen in any of our lifetimes, and the underlying rules  change includes not one Republican amendment--not one.    I listened to my chairman, for whom I have great respect. Candidly,  with the small nature of the Rules Committee, we are able to develop  relationships that the entire institution is not able to develop. I  wish everybody on the House floor knew the gentleman from Massachusetts  as I believe I know the gentleman from Massachusetts. When he talks  about fighting hunger, when he talks about us doing better, he is  absolutely right and absolutely sincere. When he talks about people  suffering, when he talks about people in desperate need, he is  absolutely right and absolutely sincere.   When my friend from Florida, Ms. Shalala, said that she doesn't get  calls in her office but that she gets cries from desperate people for  help, I know that feeling because my office gets the same ones.   But that is not everything that is in this bill. This bill isn't all  testing. This bill isn't all hunger.   I offered an amendment yesterday in the Rules Committee that said:  You know what? We are going to perpetuate the myth that we disagree on  everything in this institution. In a partisan way, let's divide this  1,800-page bill up. Let's divide it up into sections, and let's support  those things that we can support and oppose those things that we  oppose. Let's support hunger prevention and remediation. Let's support  food for children. Let's support testing for first responders. Let's do  those things.   Madam Speaker, this bill also repeals the SALT tax. It reinstitutes  the SALT tax deduction. This is not an idea that has come about in an  emergency. This is something we have been arguing about since 2017.  This is something the Ways and Means Committee acted on in an almost  purely partisan way in December. This is something the House acted on  in a purely partisan way in December, long before we were talking about  COVID.   This is a provision where 80 percent of Americans, the bottom 80  percent of all income-earning households, receive 4 cents out of every  dollar of this provision, 4 cents to the bottom 80 percent of  Americans. The top 5 percent of Americans, the top 5 percent of income  earners, receive 80 cents out of every dollar.   It is not an emergency. It is not COVID-related. It is not going to  the neediest of these. It is not a million-dollar provision. It is not  a billion-dollar provision. It is not a $10 billion provision. It is a  $200 billion provision tucked into this borrow-and-spend bill.   Madam Speaker, we don't disagree on serving those who need to be  served. We don't disagree on medical research. We don't disagree on  education. But we do have disagreements.   An 1,800-page bill, and I offered an amendment to say let's divide it  up into sections so we can support what we can support in a bipartisan  way and push through in a partisan way the things that we can't  support. It was denied.   There are times and places to have partisan debates, Madam Speaker.  Today is not one of them, and I reject the path that we are on.    Madam Speaker, we have an opportunity, and not an  opportunity that is an untread path as the path we are on today. We  have a well-tread path.   I will remind my colleagues, as we fight amongst ourselves on this  legislation, we have been to this floor already on COVID-related  measures in a bipartisan, partnership-negotiated way. Not once, not  twice, three times we have gone down that path.   For folks who are watching the debate today, Madam Speaker, I hope  they don't take away that we are divided when it comes to supporting  our constituency. I hope they don't take away that we are divided when  it comes to standing united on behalf of those families that cannot  stand for themselves in this tough time. And I hope, for my colleagues  who feel like they need to push a messaging bill through no matter  what, that they remember those times just a few short weeks ago where  we came together, where we stood together, largest change in American  history, largest bill, not one Republican amendment.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
