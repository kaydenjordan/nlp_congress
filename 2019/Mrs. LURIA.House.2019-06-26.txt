 Mr. Speaker, today I am happy to announce House passage  of a commonsense amendment to prohibit Federal spending for offshore  drilling throughout the entire Atlantic Ocean.   Protecting our coastal Virginia district from the threat of offshore  drilling is among my top priorities. One of my first actions in  Congress was cosponsoring the Defend Our Coast Act. This bipartisan  bill would forbid any drilling, exploration, development, or production  of fossil fuels off the Continental Shelf in the mid-Atlantic region.   As a 20-year Navy veteran who trained off the Virginia coast, I know  that having to dodge oil platforms would impact military readiness and  undermine our national security. I also know what offshore drilling  could do to Virginia's beautiful shorelines and thriving economy. This  is why I proudly cosponsored and continue to support Congressman Frank  Pallone's amendment to protect and preserve the Atlantic Coast from  offshore drilling.   I urge the Senate to follow the House's lead.                            ____________________
