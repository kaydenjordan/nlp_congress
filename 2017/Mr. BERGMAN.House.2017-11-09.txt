 Mr. Speaker, as a nation, we find ourselves in seemingly  uncertain times: instability in North Korea, terrorism throughout the  world, and divisiveness on so many fronts. Yet across our Nation, young  men and women continue to step up to serve when their country needs  them most. They serve our great Nation willingly, honorably, and  without bias.   In the 1940s, when an unprecedented attack on American soil led us  into the Second World War, our brave men and women in uniform stood up  to defend our Nation.   In the 1950s, when our country faced the spread of communism to  Korea, it was our veterans who were there.   In the 1960s and 1970s, when the United States was brought into the  war in Vietnam, knowing there would be no hero's welcome when they came  home, our men and women were steadfast.  [[Page H8685]]    In the first Gulf War, Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi  Freedom, and the many missions they have faced in the past two decades,  our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen have  defended our great Nation from those who wish to do us harm.   On this Veterans Day, I submit to our men and women: Your service is  not over and your mission is not complete. Now, more than ever, your  country needs you. Stand up. Tell your story. The next generation needs  to hear from you. We are forever grateful for your service.                            ____________________
