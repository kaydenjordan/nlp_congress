 Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank Chairman  Hensarling. Without his incredible commitment and effort, we would not  be here today. I am convinced of that.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the very bipartisan  S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer  Protection Act.   I was not here when the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, but I  have been interested in addressing some of these damaging effects since  first running for office, and it was a big reason why I ran for  Congress.  [[Page H4346]]    This legislation is a historic opportunity to tailor financial  regulations in order to maximize economic growth in Illinois and across  the country. We need to make sure that our community banks and credit  unions are able to meet the needs of families and neighborhood  businesses.   I am especially happy to see a number of provisions that I had the  privilege of authoring with my colleagues in the House make their way  into this package of bills. They were also very bipartisan bills.   The Community Bank Reporting Relief Act simplifies the call report so  that smaller institutions can better focus on serving their customers.  The Encouraging Employee Ownership Act makes it easier for private  companies to provide ownership to their employees under SEC rule 701 so  they can share in the benefits of growth.   I am also very excited that other legislation that was introduced by  my colleagues that I also had a part in cosponsoring is also part of  this: the MOBILE Act; the Protecting Children from Identity Theft Act;  the Protecting Veterans Credit Act; the Pension, Endowment, and Mutual  Fund Access to Banking Act; the Municipal Finance Support Act; the  National Security Exchange Regulatory Parity Act; and the SEC  Overpayment Credit Act.    I am incredibly supportive of the commonsense reforms that are made  so that our regional banks are not automatically treated like major  Wall Street banks. Please support this bill.
