 Mr. Speaker, our country is seeing  unprecedented numbers of illegal aliens attempting to circumvent U.S.  immigration and asylum laws at our southern border.   The Department of Homeland Security reported that 104,344 arrests  occurred last month, making 4 straight months of arrests totaling over  100,000. That is the equivalent to the entire population of Watauga  County in  [[Page H5916]]  North Carolina's Fifth District being detained at our southern border  every 2 weeks.   Our Border Patrol officers, aid workers, and National Guard units  have been overwhelmed performing the vital and often thankless work  upholding the rule of law to keep our country safe. They deserve the  support of this body, and so do those who have legitimate asylum  petitions and humanitarian needs.   As we know, many in this recent migrant influx include women with  children who want the life of opportunity that this country and our  freedoms afford. Caring for children and families at our southern  border need not be a partisan issue.    Last month, House Republicans delivered $4.6 billion to help manage  the humanitarian crisis and strengthen border security. While this  funding is necessary to address the border crisis, more needs to be  done to modify the law and streamline asylum regulations.   Rather than pivot to political pandering and policy extremes like  open borders, we need to recognize the complex failures of our current  system and address them head-on. That is why I am proud to cosponsor  the Fix the Immigration Loopholes Act. This bill updates immigration  law to efficiently process real asylum claims and safely return  children to their countries of origin. It is past time that we debate  it on the House floor.   I call on Speaker Pelosi to continue our progress addressing the  border crisis by bringing up bipartisan legislation for comprehensive  immigration reform. The immigration crisis our country is facing has  strained our country's border security and customs enforcement  protections to the breaking point. Letting this crisis continue is not  an option.                            ____________________
