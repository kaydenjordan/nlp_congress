 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts  for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, just before I begin, I also want to acknowledge that I  had sent the chairman of the Rules Committee a letter earlier in the  week, to which he today kindly responded, and I appreciate the prompt  response to my concerns about Capitol security.   Madam Speaker, today's rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1319,  the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. Throughout this process,  Republicans have been completely excluded. I sit on the Committee on  Energy and Commerce, I sit on the Budget Committee, and I sit on the  Rules Committee, and throughout the markups in each of these committees  Republicans offered sincere amendments to improve the bill for the  American people.   While only 2 of the 245 Republican amendments offered were adopted,  the rule before us today strips out the one amendment adopted by a  rollcall vote.   Earlier today in the Rules Committee, over 200 amendments were  offered and debated, not a single one was made in order. The American  people at least deserve to have the suggestions of Members that they  elected to be debated on the House floor. They don't have to be  adopted, but they should at least be heard on the House floor. It seems  that the Democrats are unwilling to allow elected Members of Congress  to do their job and represent their constituents.                                time  2045    With $1 trillion of funding left unspent from the previous--from the  [[Page H763]]  previous--coronavirus response bills, it does seem that we do have some  time to do our work, but, instead, we didn't even hold markups on this  portion of the bill.   While the Energy and Commerce Committee did hold a markup, all  Republican amendments were defeated. This portion of the bill includes  changes that will take months to implement, if indeed they happen at  all. Perhaps the most startling figure is less than 10 percent of these  dollars are actually spent on combating the coronavirus.   Despite spending over $14 billion on vaccines and therapeutics, after  $28 billion was just recently provided in the fiscal year 2021 omnibus,  this package does not contain any funding--zero funding--for the  National Institutes of Health. The National Institutes of Health has  been a critical partner in Operation Warp Speed and getting the vaccine  through the approval process in literally warp speed time and helping  the vaccine manufacturers in developing the coronavirus vaccine that we  are now so urgently needing.   This legislation includes many provisions that really should be  addressed outside of a coronavirus relief package, like providing a  State option for postpartum Medicaid coverage for women. While this is  a policy I have long advocated for, it should not be temporary, as this  legislation directs it to sunset after 7 years. Let's bring that bill  separately to the floor and get this policy right, just as we did in  the last Congress.   Furthermore, although there are billions of dollars directed to  public health, the Provider Relief Fund is curiously not replenished.   Again, why are we not supporting programs which we know work and we  know provide direct, targeted relief?   The Provider Relief Fund is a program that works, and that is why I  offered an amendment to add $35 billion to the Provider Relief Fund.   Adding to the partisan nature of this legislation is the lack of any  Hyde protections ensuring that none of this funding is used to  subsidize abortion. The Hyde amendment is a longstanding, bipartisan  agreement. Instead, there is $50 million included for Title X Family  Planning, which likely is going to go to Planned Parenthood and has  nothing to do with coronavirus relief.   This is a $1.9 trillion partisan wish list that could ultimately  increase the Federal deficit to between $2 trillion to $3 trillion  without addressing the immediate needs of Americans simply trying to  survive this pandemic.   So I would suggest that now is not the time to push through partisan  priorities. Barely a month ago, Congress passed, and President Trump  signed into law, a $900 billion coronavirus relief package. Combined  with previous relief packages, which were bipartisan and which were  worked on by both Democrats and Republicans in the last calendar year,  there remains $1 trillion in unspent funding.   Why is it so urgent to pass another $2 trillion now?   It is reminiscent of our former colleague, Rahm Emanuel, who said:  Never let a crisis go to waste.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), who is a valuable member of the Rules  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Pfluger), who is another valuable member of the Texas  delegation.    Madam Speaker, I thank the Chair for that reminder.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Smith).    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the ranking member of the House Committee on  Rules.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Womack), a valuable member of our Appropriations  Committee and a subcommittee ranking member.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee  on Energy and Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Malliotakis).    Madam speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Hinson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), a valuable member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida ( Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Cline).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Lubbock, Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, Republicans will  amend the rule to strike the consideration of the Pelosi payoff bill,  and instead, consider H.R. 1371, the Crush the Virus Act, introduced by  Representative   Tom Reed, which is attached, and will provide over  $160 billion to expand the administration of vaccines and provide  direct relief for the coronavirus.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the record along with extraneous material immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez), who is here to explain the amendment.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Madam Speaker, I recognize the critical work that was done by the  Congressional Doctors Caucus on this effort. The thesis was that we are  going to crush the coronavirus.   You think that you would want to involve the people who left the  world of healthcare providing to come and serve in the people's House.   Unfortunately, those amendments that were thoughtfully introduced  were rejected at the Committee on Rules.   We had amendments, such as allowing the FDA to use real-world  evidence in their evaluation of the emergency use authorization that is  currently pending.   We were going to reduce the Medicaid payment error rate, which seemed  like a good idea.   Medicaid home- and community-based services, substance use disorder  treatment, and mental health services were to be expanded.   The public health workforce allowing for loan repayment was rejected.   An amendment providing for coronavirus testing at the southern  border--we know we have got a problem with increased people coming  across the southern border without authorization. President Biden has  indicated that he is welcoming that, but as a consequence, we need to  be certain that we are protecting Americans from the introduction of  the coronavirus. This was a measure to allow for increased testing on  the southern border, but we couldn't accept that.   Hyde protections, you have heard many people talk about that. That  was rejected at the Committee on Rules, with a variety of amendments.   Dr. Miller-Meeks had an amendment to allow for the standardized  testing to go on in classrooms this next year, not using it to reduce  payments to schools that don't measure up but using it as a diagnostic  test. Let's find out how far behind some of our classrooms are.   All of these were thoughtful amendments introduced by the GOP Doctors  Caucus. Unfortunately, all were rejected. You would think if you wanted  to crush the coronavirus, you would ask your doctor.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, in closing, it doesn't look like this bill is going to  open our economy. It is not going to open our schools. It is not going  to provide targeted relief to those who need it most. I am willing to  talk about nutritional assistance, but what I am not willing to talk  about is a gilded underground railway under Silicon Valley.   Madam Speaker, this is one of the most expensive bills in the history  of the people's House. And it doesn't prioritize the immediate needs of  the American people. Rather than work for the American people,  Democrats are working for their own future 2 years from now. I think  that is unacceptable.   Look, I recognize that President Biden has worked hard to make  vaccines more available, but the very vaccines he's making available  are the ones that President Trump worked so hard to get developed and  into production.                                time  2145    Let's acknowledge success where it has occurred. I am going to urge a  ``no'' vote on the previous question so we can offer the amendment. I  am going to urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, a ``no'' vote on the  underlying measures.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
