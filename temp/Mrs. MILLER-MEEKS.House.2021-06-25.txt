 Mr. Speaker, Sunday is National Post-Traumatic  Stress Disorder Awareness Day, a day to bring attention to a disorder  that affects countless of my fellow veterans.   PTSD is a disorder that tens of thousands of Americans are diagnosed  with every year. Sadly, our veterans and Active Duty servicemembers are  among those that face the toughest challenge.   As a 24-year Army veteran, and as a member of the House Veterans'  Affairs Committee, I was proud to work together with my colleagues  across the aisle in addressing PTSD by introducing two pieces of  legislation to help veterans get the mental healthcare they both  deserve and need. The Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans Mental Health Act  will expand VA mental healthcare for veterans in rural areas. It passed  the House last month and unanimously passed the Senate last night.   I am now proud to cosponsor the recently reintroduced Brandon Act,  which will make it easier for veterans and servicemembers to seek  confidential mental health resources.   We, as Members of Congress, have the ability to take action, and I  urge all of my colleagues to support the mental health of our veterans  and our servicemembers through passing the Brandon Act.                            ____________________
