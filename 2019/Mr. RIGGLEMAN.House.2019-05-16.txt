 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember David King, an  indomitable family man, a constituent of mine who passed away after a  hard-fought battle with cancer on May 2.   David was born in Houston, Texas, but moved to Virginia in 1995 and  spent over 2 decades there. He will be remembered for his lasting  contribution to the Virginia wine industry and his King Family  Vineyards. It is one of my favorite places for a glass of wine.   David served as a chairman of the Virginia Wine Board and worked  tirelessly as a free-market advocate for vineyard agriculture and  agritourism in Virginia. He leaves an enormous legacy in both the wine  industry and his local Crozet community.   David is survived by his loving wife, Ellen; his six sons and  daughters-in-law, Carrington and Corie, Stuart and Ali, James and  Kelly; as well as his eight grandchildren.   One of David's favorite phrases was this: ``A rising tide lifts all  boats,'' and David lived by that, lifting up those around him in  success.   We will miss him dearly.                            ____________________
