 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment would increase the  Army Corps investigation account by $1.2 million.   Increased funding under this account will allow additional studies  that were previously authorized in the Water Resources Development Act  to be completed by the Army Corps.   One example is the Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study. This study  was authorized in 1986, and, although it is a priority of the Army  Corps, it has not been funded. This study pulls together Federal,  State, local, and private resources to create a strategy to preserve  and protect the shorelines of the Great Lakes.   Last year, my constituents in western New York felt the devastating  impact of high lake levels. We saw the worst flooding we have seen in  decades along Lake Ontario. The flooding destroyed homes and wreaked  havoc on businesses along the shoreline. This study will create a  comprehensive strategy to protect these communities so they do not  suffer again.   I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress, as well as  the Army Corps, to ensure that studies like the Great Lakes Coastal  Resiliency Study receive funding.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.
