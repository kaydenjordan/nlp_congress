 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in tribute to Bob  Redford, who founded the Walnut Valley Festival in the Fourth District  of Kansas back in 1972, and served more than 40 years as its president.  Bob Redford passed away in December of last year.   Bob Redford's dedication to live music resulted in this legendary  event, which is one of the longest running music festivals in U.S.  history. For 46 years, pickers and music lovers have journeyed to this  special place on the Kansas plains to celebrate life with music.   Bob Redford gave so much to the community in Cowley County and  dedicated years of service to leading and promoting this iconic  festival that has become known as Pickers Paradise.   There is no place on earth like the Walnut Valley Festival, which is  home to national and international instrument championship contests and  where thousands return year after year to experience outstanding live  music, in the grandstands, performed by world famous musicians, along  with legendary campground jams.   Bob Redford's legacy lives in the community of musicians and music  lovers from around the world, who will gather next weekend in the pecan  grove along the Walnut River in Winfield, Kansas, for the 46th Annual  Walnut Valley Festival.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of  Representative Fitzpatrick's amendment. My career in the private sector  required skills in identifying deficiencies in systems and processes.   When I look at the program, or lack thereof, with the financial  systems modernization effort, beset by poor management and lack of  transparency, my last course of action would be to throw more money at  it.   Good systems require a good plan. Currently there is no plan, no path  forward, and no guarantee to the taxpayers that this money is well  spent. This effort has already cost $133 million, 50 percent more than  originally expected, and it has failed to accomplish the designated  task.   When I go back to Kansas, I am accountable to every taxpaying  constituent for every dollar spent in Washington. Therefore, I support  this amendment to shift those tax dollars from this inefficient program  to the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General,  which protects those very same tax dollars.   This money will provide operating funds to continue funding  efficiencies and savings until a good plan is developed for the  Financial Services Modernization effort.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and  fiscal accountability to the American taxpayer.
