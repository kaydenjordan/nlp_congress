 Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, the agencies listed in this amendment are by no  means perfect, and on multiple occasions I have condemned some of their  actions, both publicly and behind closed doors. But I do believe we  lose the ability to influence both agencies' agendas towards the United  States' priorities if we cut off all U.S. funding.   Despite my past criticisms of their significant shortcomings, I  continue to believe that each of these agencies plays a pivotal role in  providing critical services for the Palestinian people. We should never  lose focus on helping the people who need aid the most.   We should also think strategically about U.S. interests. The United  Nations Relief and Works Agency is an effective alternative to Hamas.  Each year, the agency provides health services to more than 3 million  individuals, and education to half a million students in the West Bank  and Gaza. Cutting off funding will simply strengthen Hamas by driving  countless individuals into Hamas-controlled schools and services.   Additionally, the Human Rights Council and the High Commissioner for  Human Rights highlight the voices of the oppressed and underserved  globally and have elevated the rights of women and sexual assault  victims.                                time  1700    As human rights are increasingly threatened around the globe, now is  not the time to walk away from these agencies. I oppose the amendment  because I strongly believe that here in Congress we must do all we can  to preserve and advance U.S. interests and influence. This amendment  would diminish U.S. influence at a time when our Nation's global  standing is already slipping.   Mr. Chair, how many minutes do I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 3 minutes remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Rogers).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Rogers).    Mr. Chair, I yield 50 seconds to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).    Mr. Chair, I yield 50 seconds to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As stated, now is not the time to walk away from the U.N. Human  Rights Council. This amendment would do nothing to change the agencies  for the better. It would only weaken our ability to influence the  advancements we want to see. We can't be leaders if we are not at the  table.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.
