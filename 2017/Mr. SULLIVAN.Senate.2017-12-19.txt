 Mr. President, I would like to spend a few moments  talking about why my colleagues and why the American people should be  supportive of this very important legislation, historic legislation,  that we are debating on the Senate floor. It is particularly historic  for my State, the great State of Alaska. There has been a lot of  misinformation on this bill, and we are seeing a robust debate, which  is fine.   I don't need to repeat all the arguments on both sides, but I will  say that my colleagues on the other side have seemed to focus on one  particular point. They are coming here and making this point again and  again; that is, the point that this bill will supposedly raise taxes on  the middle class. We are hearing it, and everyone is saying it. The  problem with that argument is, it is fundamentally untrue. The truth  will be in the paychecks of the American people, which they will see in  a few months.   Let me talk about some of the provisions that are in the bill. The  bill will be a middle-class tax cut for the vast majority of Americans.   Here are some of the provisions. These are in the bill. These are the  facts. The bill doubles the standard deduction. For an individual, the  standard deduction goes from $6,300 to $12,000. For married couples, it  goes from $12,700 to $24,000. That is in the bill. That is important  for middle-class families. It doubles the child tax credit. The child  tax credit is doubled from the current $1,000 to $2,000, so more  parents can claim it. It is in the bill. That is a fact. And it lowers  rates. In fact, it not only lowers rates for middle-income Americans,  it lowers rates on every single income bracket in the IRS code. That is  a fact.   Bottom line, an average family of four making $75,000 a year will  have about 200 more dollars per month in take-home pay under this  bill--$2,400 a year. A single parent making $41,000 a year will see  their tax bill decrease by $1,300. That is a 73-percent decrease. That  is a fact. It is in the bill.   Let me mention one other critical way in which this tax bill will  bring middle-class and working-class tax relief. It will get rid of the  very regressive and unfair individual mandate of the Affordable Care  Act. About 20,000 hard-working Alaskans and over 6 million Americans  have to pay a tax, a penalty to the IRS for not buying something-- health insurance--that they cannot afford. Let me repeat that. They are  penalized for not buying something that they can't afford. Think about  the absurdity of that.   Here is why this is such an important middle-class tax cut. When we  get rid of that penalty, close to 80 percent of the 6 million Americans  who pay the ObamaCare individual mandate tax--close to 80 percent of  them--make $50,000 or less. Think about that. Tonight, we are getting  rid of that tax, that unfair penalty, and that will undoubtedly bring  tax relief for the middle class.   This bill also decreases taxes on small businesses and companies so  that they can reinvest at home in our great Nation, hire American  workers, give pay raises, and help grow our economy.   Many of these ideas, doing these kinds of things, have been  bipartisan policy ideas for years when we have talked about tax reform.  Let me give you one. In 2012, President Obama said that our current  business tax structure hurt American business and inhibited growth. He  said that the tax system ``provides tax breaks for moving jobs and  profits overseas and hits companies that choose to stay in America with  one of the highest tax rates in the world.''   That is from President Obama. It was true then, and it is true today.   Something has to be done, and we are doing it tonight. The bill will  also give small businesses and large companies a chance to help grow  our economy. You have heard Senator after Senator come to the Senate  floor. My colleague from South Carolina has talked about this  eloquently for years. It is an issue I care deeply about. But here is  the issue. We have had a lost decade of economic growth. For over 10  years, we have not hit 3 percent GDP growth once in a year.   It is an issue I care deeply about. As a matter of fact, I come to  the floor and I talk about it a lot. One thing I have noticed in my 3  short years in the Senate is that I am not sure I have seen my  colleagues from the other side ever come here and talk about the need  [[Page S8131]]  to rev up the economy or about the fact that 1\1/2\, 2 percent growth,  which is what we have had for almost the last 13 years, is not good for  the country. I think, unfortunately, a lot of them believe in this idea  of the new normal--that America hitting at 1\1/2\, 2-percent GDP growth  is America hitting on all cylinders. Don't believe it.   We talk about GDP growth. What is that? It is really a proxy for the  health of the U.S. economy. It is a proxy for the American dream. In  the last 10 years, that economy has been sick. For millions of  Americans, the American dream, which is based on a strong American  economy, has been a mirage. We have to change this. This should be a  bipartisan issue. Getting back to traditional levels of 3 percent or  higher GDP growth should be something 100 Senators agree on. This bill  is going to help us do that.   Finally, I would like to talk about something in the tax bill that  will greatly benefit my State and our country; that is, opening the  1002 section of the nonwilderness Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for  American energy development. A lot of my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle have talked about this, but I am going to tell you this. I  can't begin to describe the elation that will be felt by many--so  many--in my State when this passes. The vast majority of Alaskans  support this provision and have supported it for decades. Hundreds, if  not thousands, of Alaskans have worked tirelessly to get it passed  since the 1002 area was set aside by this body in 1980 for possible  energy development.   Don't believe all the rhetoric about ``Oh, that area is off-limits.''  That area is actually on-limits. In 1980, the Congress said: We know  there is a lot of energy there, and we should look at the opportunity  to explore it. Congress, come back and make the call someday.   Hundreds, thousands of my constituents, my fellow Alaskans--and I  know some are in the Gallery right now, right above me--have been  working on this for decades, and I want to thank all of them. But we  have been stopped. We have been repeatedly stopped. You are seeing some  of the arguments, many of which are truth-challenged. So I am being  polite to all of my colleagues.    Year after year, we have tried. The last time that we made a big  effort in this, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle killed  this provision in 2005. It was a crushing evening in 2005 when this  provision did not pass. It was a crushing evening for the late, great  Senator Ted Stevens, particularly when then-Senate Minority Leader  Harry Reid said that killing the ANWR provision and beating Ted Stevens  was ``one of the joys of my life.'' That is from the former Senate  minority and majority leader.   Voting for the provision to unlock ANWR tonight will be one of the  joys of my life, and I am certain that Ted Stevens will be joyfully  watching from above, smiling.   Last month, a group of Alaskans came to DC to testify before Senator  Murkowski's Energy and Natural Resources Committee about the importance  to America, to Alaska, and to our communities of the energy provision  in this bill.   Matthew Rexford, who lives in Kaktovik, AK, which is a village that  is actually in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, provided riveting  testimony. Let me quote from that testimony:         My fellow Inupiat and I firmly believe that attempts to       permanently block development in the 100--an area       intentionally NOT designated as wilderness because of its oil       and gas potential--is a slap in the face to our region and       its people. It's exactly the same thing as saying ``It's okay       for everyone else in this country to have a THRIVING economy,       but you can't have one at all.''    To you people living on the North Slope and you people living in  Kaktovik: Sorry, you can't do it.   Matthew went on to talk about how responsible oil and gas development  supports local communities by providing jobs, business opportunities,  and infrastructure investments, like schools and hospitals and  clinics--things that most communities in America have in abundance. We  don't have those in abundance in my great State.   He said that the industry ``has moved our people away from third- world living conditions--we refuse to go backward in time. It has  provided other basic services most Americans may take for granted''  that communities like his don't have.   Increasing domestic energy production will not only be good for my  State and for communities like Kaktovik, but it will also boost our  country's economy, and--this is a very important point--it will  strengthen America's national security.   My colleague from Maryland, for whom I have a lot of respect, just  talked about how this is going to hurt our national security. I  couldn't disagree with him more. Producing more energy responsibly-- oil, natural gas, renewables--and making the United States the world's  energy superpower once again will dramatically increase our Nation's  national security. This is something that we should all agree on.   I have served in the Marines for over two decades, and I have served  as a U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, whose portfolio included global  energy issues. I have seen how energy can be used as a tool for good,  productive diplomacy and for troublesome power grabs by our Nation's  foes. When we don't have to import energy from countries that don't  like us or when we have the opportunity to actually export energy-- American energy--to our allies, this dramatically strengthens our  Nation's national security.   The Presiding Officer and I both sit on the Armed Services Committee.  We have heard for years from the Department of Defense's military and  civilian leaders. Whether he be Secretary Carter, a Democrat, or  Secretary Mattis, a great Marine general, they have all consistently  emphasized this point: Making America the world's energy superpower  will help with jobs, will help with our economy, and it will  dramatically help our Nation's national security.   Let me conclude by telling a story that really emphasizes this point.   Last year, I attended the Halifax International Security Forum.  National security leaders throughout the world attended. I was in a  meeting with a great national security leader of this body, Senator  John McCain, and we were meeting with a senior-level Russian dissident.   We asked him at the end of the meeting: What more can we do in our  country to help push back against the Putin regime and the activities  that it is undertaking to undermine U.S. interests around the world and  in our own country? What more can we do?   He looked at us and said: The No. 1 thing that you can do is to  produce more American energy.   Let me repeat that. In terms of national security, the No. 1 thing  that we can do is to produce more American energy. We do it more  responsibly and with the highest environmental standards of any place  in the world. Opening the 1002 area in using those high standards--the  world's highest standards--with the most advanced technology, will  produce more American energy for the betterment of my State, my  constituents, and for the whole country. We are on the cusp of passing  a bill that will put more money in the hands of the middle class, grow  our economy, and fulfill a 40-year-long dream for Alaska.   The might of America has always been and will always be in the  ingenuity of our people--the ability of Americans to make decisions for  themselves, to live their lives as they see fit, to build, to grow, and  to make a better tomorrow for the next generation.   The American dream does not have a price tag, but it can be stymied.  It can be stymied and stunted by an overbearing Federal Government that  wants to hinder the freedom of the individual and an overbearing  Federal Government that crushes economic hope and opportunity through  overtaxation or overregulation. It does this by telling someone like  Matthew Rexford, who is from a small village more than 5,000 miles from  here, that he and his people cannot make better lives for themselves  and for their children by developing resources on their own land.   That is going to end tonight. At long last, that is going to change,  and the vast majority of Alaskans--Democrats and Republicans, Native  and non-Native--are going to celebrate. I believe, when the American  people realize and experience the positive benefits of this bill  through stronger economic growth, better jobs, and more take-home pay,  that they are going to celebrate too. I  [[Page S8132]]  urge my colleagues to vote for this historic legislation.   I yield the floor.
