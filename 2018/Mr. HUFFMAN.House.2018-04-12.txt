 Mr. Speaker, on Monday morning, the FBI's raid of Donald  Trump's personal attorney triggered another Trump meltdown. He ranted  that this move, approved by senior Justice Department officials and a  Federal court, was an attack on our country and a witch hunt; and, once  again, he mused publicly about firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller.   Let's be clear. Firing the special counsel or any chain of firings to  interfere with the special counsel's investigation would spark a  constitutional crisis and unleash a public uproar like we have never  seen. Senator Lindsey Graham summed it up by saying that it would be  the beginning of the end of the Trump Presidency.   The American people deserve answers. What are Trump and his Russia- connected cronies hiding? What are they so afraid of us finding out?  The only way we are going to get these answers is by protecting  Mueller's investigation and allowing him to do his job.   Now, if President Trump crosses the red line and declares himself  above the law, millions of Americans all over this country are ready to  take to the streets to defend our democracy and the rule of law.   So, Mr. Trump, whatever you are hiding, you won't get away with it,  and we won't let you tear down American democracy in a desperate  attempt to hide the truth.
