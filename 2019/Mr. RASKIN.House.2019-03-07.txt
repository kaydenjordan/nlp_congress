 Mr. Speaker, at Sunday school, Jewish kids learn the  imperishable words of Hillel, who said: If I am not for myself, who  will be for me? But if I am for myself only, then who am I? And if not  now, when?   Today, we must all stand strongly and proudly for ourselves and our  communities, but we must also stand in strong solidarity with other  people and their communities. We must act now because in America and in  nations all over the world, anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim bigotry, and  other forms of racism and intolerance are sharply on the rise.    These old and lethal poisons are not only a threat to individual Jews  and Muslims and African Americans and Hispanic Americans and Asian  Americans and Native Americans walking down the street, and to our  children playing at school, they are the common enemy of liberal  democracy, which depends upon tolerance and pluralism to survive.   As the world's oldest liberal democracy and a thriving multiracial  and multicultural society, America must reject the myths and  stereotypes and libels and tropes that make up these ancient hatreds.   Anti-Semitism and racism are the gateway to destruction for  everything that we believe in as a society. They are a threat to the  values of our constitutional creed: pluralism and tolerance, religious  freedom and freedom of association, equal protection for all citizens.   Let us stand up today for our most hard-won American ideals, and let  us vote for this resolution condemning racism and anti-Muslim bigotry  and other forms of racism and intolerance.
