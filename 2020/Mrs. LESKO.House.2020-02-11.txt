 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Scanlon for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Before I get to the points, I know that we differ on policy, but I  have to tell you that I was offended by what I thought were racist and  sexist comments made by my Democratic colleague about the Republican  party makeup, and I totally disagree with her.   Madam Speaker, to begin, I would like to clarify what H.J. Res 79 is.  It is not the equal rights amendment. It is a date change. The  legislation is a joint resolution removing the deadline for  ratification of the equal rights amendment in States that the amendment  shall be valid and adopted as part of the Constitution whenever  ratified by the legislatures of three-quarters of the States.   Democrats say this is about equal rights for women. Well, I am a  woman, and so I, obviously, support equal rights for women. But I  oppose H.J. Res 79 for the following reasons:   First: The bill is totally unconstitutional.   When the ERA originally passed on March 22, 1972, Congress explicitly  set a deadline for ratification stating that the amendment shall be  valid when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several  States within 7 years from the date of its submission by the Congress.  That meant that the final deadline was March 22, 1979, almost 41 years  ago.   By the end of this initial deadline, only 35 of the 38 States needed  had ratified it, so Congress with a simple majority vote, which is  questionable, extended the deadline once to 1982, but no other States  joined in ratification. Thus, the equal rights amendment was dead.   It is also imperative to note that five of the 35 States rescinded  their ratifications. So then the count was down to only 30 States.   In fact, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a legal opinion just  last month reiterating that the ERA ratification timeline is expired.   Ultimately, when the 1972 ERA's deadline passed without ratification  by three-fourths of the States, the proposed amendment expired and is,  therefore, no longer pending. The 1972 ERA, therefore, can no longer be  ratified because it no longer exists.   In one of its works, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service,  which we all turn to, states that the ERA formally died on June 30,  1982. The U.S. Supreme Court also dismissed all cases related to the  ERA because it held the cases to be moot, saying that the ERA  ratification date had expired.  [[Page H1026]]    Regardless of one's view on whether or not the equal rights amendment  should be adopted, the fact remains that the equal rights amendment was  not ratified by the necessary 38 States by the deadline set forth in  the text of the amendment itself.   Just last night, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, certainly  not known as a conservative, said Virginia's recent adoption of an ERA  resolution was long after the deadline passed. She went on to say, ``I  would like to see a new beginning. I'd like it to start over. There's  too much controversy about latecomers. Virginia--long after the  deadline passed. Plus, a number of States have withdrawn their  ratification.'' Remember the five I talked about. ``So if you count a  latecomer on the plus side, how can you disregard States that said  we've changed our minds?'' And deratified.   In addition, the Democrats' sneaky act to slip into this resolution  language that would deem that a mere majority vote instead of the two- thirds vote needed on a constitutional amendment, has significant  constitutional and legal ramifications.   Should my Democratic colleagues wish to proceed with seeking to add  the ERA to the Constitution, the appropriate method would be to follow  the procedure outlined in the Constitution: Passage by a two-thirds  majority in both Houses of Congress, followed by ratification by three- quarters of the States. And it seems as recently as last night, Supreme  Court Justice Ginsburg agrees.   Secondly: The ERA amendment is not necessary.   Women's equality of rights under the law is already recognized in our  Constitution in the Fifth and 14th Amendments.   Women do deserve fairness and equality under the law. Through  established law such as Title IX, the Equality Opportunity Act of 1963,  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Pregnancy Discrimination Act,  and Equal Pay Act, plus State and local laws, women have made huge  strides against institutional discrimination against women in  education, employment, sports, politics, and many other aspects of  society.   The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently ruled that both the equal  protection clause of the 14th Amendment and the due process clause of  the Fifth Amendment guarantee women equal protection under the law.   That is why the ACLU women's rights director Lenora Lapidus wrote in  response to what Ms. Scanlon brought up about Justice Scalia, ``it has  been clearly understood that the 14th Amendment prohibits  discrimination based on sex. In decision after decision, many authored  by conservative Supreme Court Justices, this principle has been  reaffirmed.''   Third: If ratified, the ERA would be used by pro-abortion groups to  undo pro-life legislation and lead to more abortions and taxpayer  funding of abortions.   Don't take my word for it. Let's look at what pro-abortion groups  have done and what they are saying now.   Abortion activists have already utilized State-level ERAs to require  taxpayer-funded abortion.   In 1998, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the  State ERA required the State to fund abortions since procedures sought  by men like, prostate surgery, are funded. A lawsuit in Connecticut  used similar arguments and achieved the same objective, full taxpayer- funded abortion.   In 2019, Planned Parenthood and Women's Law Center filed a lawsuit in  Pennsylvania arguing that the Pennsylvania's ERA means abortion must be  included in medical coverage for women because men aren't denied  coverage for anything.   In another example, NARAL Pro-Choice America--which is a pro-abortion  group--in a March 13, 2019, national alert asserted that the ERA would  reinforce the constitutional right to abortion. It would require judges  to strike down anti-abortion laws.   Further, in a 2019 letter to the House Judiciary Committee, the ACLU  stated, ``The equal rights amendment could provide an additional layer  of protection against restrictions on abortion, contraception, and  other forms of reproductive healthcare.''   And the pro-ERA website itself, EqualRightsAmendment.org, explicitly  states that ratifying the ERA into the U.S. Constitution would  ``provide a strong legal defense against a rollback of women's rights,  including but not limited to Roe v. Wade.''   In conclusion, H.J. Res 79 is unconstitutional. The ERA is  unnecessary since constitutional, Federal, State and local laws already  guarantee equal protections, and the ERA, if ratified, would be used by  pro-abortion groups to undo pro-life laws.   Also included in this rule is H.R. 2546, the Protecting America's  Wilderness Act.   My Republican colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee have  expressed concern that each of the bills in this package will remove  large swaths of land in rural areas from development, threaten the  economic base of these regions, and reduce the effectiveness of fire  prevention plans.   My Democratic colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee have  continued the disappointing trend of moving bills that are not  supported by the Members who represent the impacted lands. In fact, all  the wilderness designations in H.R. 2546 are located outside the bill  sponsor's district. Instead, most are located in Representative Scott  Tipton from Colorado's district, who opposes the bill.   One of the greatest concerns about this piece of legislation is that  significant opposition from local counties, communities, and  stakeholder groups seem to go ignored. The consensus is that these  bills will negatively impact individual homeowners, agricultural  entities, water providers, first responders, and the recreation tourism  industry.   Today, it seems what we simply have before us are examples of:   Legislating in other Members' districts without their support or any  attempt to collaborate.   Increased risk of wildfires due to the lack of management and  inability to use mechanical means to fight or prevent fire within all  newly designated wilderness areas.   Lack of support from local leaders and stakeholders across each of  the bills in this legislation.   Concerns about threats to private property rights when the vast  majority of land proposed to be added to the Santa Monica Mountains  National Recreational Area is nonFederal.   I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Missouri.    Madam Speaker, I am waiting for another speaker, but I  will yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, there are a couple of things that my colleague from  the Rules Committee, Ms. Scanlon, said. She said something to the  effect of nothing in the Constitution sets a deadline. Well, I have to  disagree with that. Actually, it is not just me; it is the Supreme  Court. A 1921 Supreme Court decision, Dillon v. Gloss, affirmed that:         Congress has the power to fix the definite time limit for       ratification of a proposed constitutional amendment under its       authority to determine the mode of ratification for an       amendment under Article V of the Constitution.    As I said before, this expired back in 1979. I mean, that is 41 years  ago. Then, of course, back then, Congress came forward, and my  understanding is they just did a majority vote instead of the two- thirds that I believe is needed to deal with a constitutional  amendment.   But no other States had ratified. In fact, by the 1979 deadline, five  States had withdrawn their ratification. So you were at 35, then it  went down to 30, and it is dead.   When my colleague says Justice Ginsberg supports the ERA, I know  that. That is my point. She does support the ERA. But even she said we  need to start all over again because the deadline has passed.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to make in order a resolution to prevent any  moratorium on the use of hydraulic fracking on Federal lands unless  authorized by Congress.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, this amendment would affirm that States  should maintain primacy for the regulation of hydraulic fracturing and  prevent any President from imposing a ban on hydraulic fracturing.   Many of the Democratic candidates for President have pledged to ban  hydraulic fracturing in the United States, a campaign promise straight  out of the ``keep it in the ground'' playbook.   While this widely used practice is often vilified by proponents of  the Green New Deal, in fact, hydraulic fracturing is heavily regulated  by the States and governed by stringent industry standards throughout  the country.   Thanks to hydraulic fracturing, U.S. gas bills have fallen by $13  billion collectively every year from 2007 to 2013. The U.S. is leading  the way in emissions reductions through innovation in the energy  sector. In 2017, U.S. carbon emissions reached the lowest level ever  since 1992, and per capita emissions reached the lowest level since  1950.   And, very importantly, the U.S. has become an energy exporter, and we  no longer have to rely on OPEC oil like we did in the 1970s. Fracking  and U.S. energy independence strengthens our national security.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Dakota  (Mr. Armstrong), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, in closing, I want to urge my Democratic colleagues to  halt their attempts to change the rules and bring back an expired  amendment that would rewrite our Constitution. Not only is this  unprecedented, but it is wrong, and it is unconstitutional.   I believe Congress should oppose pointless legislation to remove the  deadline and focus, instead, on upholding women's rights, dignity, and  opportunity.   I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution and work together to  promote truly helpful legislation for women.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question and  ``no'' on the underlying resolution, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend, Mr.  Gianforte, for giving me the opportunity to speak about this bill.   I am from Arizona, so border security has been for years and still is  the number one issue that people in Arizona care about. They welcome  legal immigrants, but they also want to make sure that Arizona and our  Nation are secure and that illegal drug trafficking is mitigated.   We used to see mostly single male adults crossing our border, and  they would evade the Border Patrol officers; but, recently, however,  thousands and thousands of illegal migrants are coming from Central  America, and they are being coached by the cartels, who charge them  $5,000 to $8,000 a person. They are saying: Let's go up there and turn  yourselves in to the Border Patrol officers, because there is a  loophole, and just claim asylum.   And they know that, once they are in, they are in the United States  and they can stay.                                time  1500    Instead of running away from Border Patrol, they turn themselves in,  claiming asylum, so our immigration courts are overloaded and  legitimate asylum claims languish amidst frivolous claims.   This backlog is severe. It is a nonpartisan challenge facing our  immigration courts. A recent report stated that backlog cases in  immigration courts exceeded 1 million claims.   This backlog has rapidly increased over the last decade, and as the  backlog increases, so do wait times. Sometimes, it takes years for  these cases to proceed through the courts.   We currently have approximately 400 immigration judges. That is about  2,500 cases per judge. This backlog strains housing facilities and  prevents judges from granting asylum to legitimate asylum seekers and  from swiftly removing those who have frivolous claims and are abusing  the loopholes in our laws.   This is a big national security and humanitarian crisis. We need  efficiency in the Federal Government, especially when it comes to  immigration.   That is why I introduced H.R. 3859 to help reduce the immigration  court backlog and help legitimate asylum seekers.  [[Page H1041]]    This bill provides an additional 100 immigration judges to reduce the  asylum backlog. Adding more judges will allow these cases to be  adjudicated faster and help reduce the backlog.   I thank the task force chairman,   Greg Gianforte, and the Republican  Study Committee chairman,   Mike Johnson, for their hard work to  increase efficiency and accountability in our government, especially  when it comes to immigration.
