 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Nadler for the time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 357. As a Member of  the legislative branch, I take very seriously our responsibility to  provide oversight of the executive branch. We must always look to  utilize the tools that we have available to us, including through the  appropriations process, to ensure accountability and provide the  appropriate scope and direction to our Federal agencies.   I also believe that elections matter, and that we in the legislative  branch should do our utmost to find common ground and advance policies  and programs that promote the best interests of our communities.   Unfortunately, I believe that this measure goes too far to  deliberately hinder Federal agencies from advancing their priorities.  For this reason, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to  recommit this bill back to committee. If the House rules permitted, I  would have offered the motion with an important amendment to this bill.  In addition to exceptions for rules that impact public safety and  national security, my amendment would also provide exceptions for rules  related to veteran health benefits.   As the ranking member of the House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigation, I believe we must continue to do all we  can to work together and advance initiatives that ensure our veterans  receive the care and benefits that they have earned.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Madam Speaker, I thank, again, the ranking member for the  time.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
