 Mr. President, I thank the majority leader, and I thank  the Presiding Officer for allowing me to speak this evening.   I just returned from the southern border and want to give a brief  report and talk about some potential ways forward to deal with what is  happening on the Mexican border. I went with Secretary of Homeland  Security Mayorkas and also with the chair of the Homeland Security  Committee, my colleague from Michigan, and also with my colleague from  West Virginia and my colleague from Connecticut, who are the chairs and  ranking members of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations  Committee. We had a bipartisan group and those of us who were involved  on the authorizing side and on the appropriations side.   You probably heard that the situation is bad, and it is. There is a  record number of unaccompanied children coming to our border today,  being let in, and ending up in Border Patrol detention facilities.   Just yesterday, CBP reported that there were more than 15,500  unaccompanied kids in Federal custody. That is a record. But it is not  just children. More than 100,000 migrants were apprehended in February  alone. This is a 15-year record, representing a 28-percent increase  just since January. All the numbers from March look even higher. We  won't know the final numbers for another couple of weeks, but the point  is, it is getting worse, not better.   These numbers, by the way, are worse than the previous two surges at  our southern border--both the 2014 surge, we all remember, during the  Obama administration and the 2019 surge during the Trump  administration. And, by the way, we have yet to  [[Page S1676]]  reach the predicted peak because that normally would happen in April  and May. In fact, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro  Mayorkas, who was with us on this trip, said that he believes this will  be the worst year in 20 years for unlawful entry into the United  States.   However, the numbers only tell part of the story. This is also a  humanitarian crisis. Migrants often face violence, sickness, and tough  terrain on their dangerous journey north--predominantly, those from the  Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. Many  are abused by the smugglers who charge them large amounts of money and  bring them.   Unfortunately, this is a crisis that could have been avoided. On day  one, the Biden administration issued five Executive orders to overturn  Trump policies and since has taken more than a half dozen additional  actions to dismantle policies from the previous administration.   These included a 100-day pause on all deportations; no longer using  the COVID-19 healthcare emergency under title 42 of the United States  Code to turn away unaccompanied children and some families; suspending  the construction of the border fence and technologies, such as sensors  and scanners used by the Trump administration to help our overworked  Border Patrol agents secure key stretches of our southern border; and  abandoning the migrant protection protocols, also known as ``Remain in  Mexico,'' which required some asylum seekers at the southern border to  remain in Mexico rather than in the United States while their claim for  asylum is being processed; and, of course, proposing an amnesty bill on  day one.   The administration has every right to do that, but it creates a  disincentive to push back on new migrants coming in who are trying to  get into the United States before that amnesty might become law. It  certainly does unless you also make it clear that you don't qualify for  amnesty unless you are already here. And I think that is an important  message that I hope will be part of any future discussions about any  kind of an amnesty bill so it doesn't encourage more people to come.   The Biden administration took these and other actions that  incentivize people to head north but then said: Please don't come yet.  We are not ready for you.   It was no surprise that didn't work. An unprecedented number of  children and families came to take advantage of the new policies. As I  heard on the southern border over the last few days, actions speak  louder than words. And the actions of the new administration were  clear.   These abrupt moves to dismantle the immigration policies that were  working to provide a disincentive for unlawful migrations hit the green  light to a lot of people seeking a better life, but it also gave the  smugglers and the human trafficking groups in the Northern Triangle and  in Mexico the ability to convince more families and more children to  take the dangerous trip north. It gave them a narrative, and, of  course, they used it to their full advantage. That has overwhelmed  Border Patrol and our immigration system, in general, unequipped to  handle the surge.   I heard directly from Border Patrol agents about how the current  surge of unaccompanied kids is draining resources and endangering not  just those vulnerable kids but the security of our own border   It was stunning to see people who unlawfully crossed the border  during a ride-along patrol I joined on Thursday night. People just kept  coming. The Border Patrol told me they are seeing an increase of about  150 to 200 percent of illegal entries in the El Paso sector, with many  illegal crossers escaping into the United States because they have not  apprehended them.   Just as concerning, they told me unaccompanied children and families  are being used by the smugglers as a distraction so the smugglers can  more easily move dangerous and illicit substances across the border  into our communities.   While the Border Patrol is busy processing the kids and the families,  which takes a while, the smugglers move. In fact, Customs and Border  Protection has reported an increase of 360 percent in seizures of the  deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl, which is 50 times deadlier than  heroin.   There is no question that more of this is now coming across the  border. It is already resulting in a surge of overdose deaths, by the  way, over the past year during the COVID-19 pandemic. In my home State  of Ohio and around the country, it looks like, sadly, we are in for a  record year of overdose and overdose deaths, primarily from fentanyl  and fentanyl being mixed with other drugs.   Fentanyl used to come from China directly, mostly through our mail  system. Now, increasingly, it is coming from Mexico, since we passed  legislation here to stop it coming through our mail system.   Down at the border, I also had the opportunity to visit with the  facilities where they are currently holding unaccompanied kids. These  children are being kept in tightly packed facilities, supervised by  overworked Border Patrol agents, law enforcement, who should be out in  the field.   Due to a lack of space for children in the Department of Health and  Human Services facilities, Border Patrol is having to detain  unaccompanied kids for an average of about 137 hours, nearly double the  72-hour limit required by law.   I am concerned about the well-being of these kids, as we all are,  because when the system gets overwhelmed, people, and especially the  kids, suffer. And the processing system right now is overwhelmed; it is  overcrowded; it is irresponsible. It is a situation you would never  want your own children to be in. Not only are these children crammed  into the facilities that are, by their own rules and regulations,  overcrowded, there is no testing for COVID-19 in these facilities.  Current policy is going to result in tens of thousands more children  being released into our communities, waiting for their immigration  court cases.   During previous surges at the border that overwhelmed our immigration  system, HHS stopped doing background checks on sponsors for  unaccompanied kids, and many fell into the custody of abusive human  traffickers. In 2014, for example, HHS placed Guatemalan children with  criminals who put the children into forced labor on an egg farm in my  home State of Ohio, where they were forced to live and work in squalid  conditions.   It is an issue I have worked a long time on. Between 2015 and to  2020, as chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I led  three bipartisan reports and hearings across two administrations that  found repeated failures by the Federal Government to ensure the well- being of these vulnerable children once they were handed off to  sponsors, as well as the fundamental refusal by HHS to accept that they  were responsible for the welfare of these kids they placed with adults  who are not their legal parent or guardian.   Obviously, we are going to see a lot more pressure to get these kids  out to as many sponsors as quickly as possible, and, again, I believe  we are going to have some of these problems.   Last week, I introduced bipartisan legislation called the  Responsibility for Unaccompanied Minors Act that will direct the  Federal Government to meet the stringent requirements necessary to  ensure children are not abused or exploited by their sponsors; that  they show up for their asylum hearings to determine their eligibility  to stay in the United States. These are necessary steps to address the  current crisis at our border and safeguard these children.   By the way, on the debate as to whether to call the chaos at the  border a crisis or not, when I was on the border talking to Border  Patrol agents, one of them told me, although he believes it is a  crisis, that he is fine not calling it a crisis now because he knows it  is going to get much worse, and he wants to have something to call it  then. He wants to see, like all Americans, concrete actions and a  change of course at the border, much more than having a debate about  words. By the way, we should all sympathize with those migrants who  want a better life for their families. I sympathize with them. I am  sure we all do.    There are millions of people around the world who want to come to our  country. We have a legal immigration system that accepts a million  people a  [[Page S1677]]  year. In addition to that, we accept refugees and those who apply for  asylum. At the end of the day, those individuals coming to our southern  border right now are making a rational choice to come to the border  based on policy decisions by the Biden administration. What we need is  a legal, orderly, and proper system to be sure the people follow the  rules.   The bottom line is, what I saw at the border is unsustainable, and,  unfortunately, it is going to get worse. We are working against the  clock to try to find a way forward.   When the Biden administration changed the rules and dismantled the  existing provisions that were keeping people from coming across the  border, they could have put their own policies in place to try to deal  with what everybody predicted was a surge that was coming. They didn't.  More to the point, even if they weren't going to put their own policies  in place, they should surely have waited until they had the facilities  ready to handle the surge. They didn't. That is why you see this  terrible overcrowding at Border Patrol detention facilities, holding  these kids much longer than they should, and why you see HHS not having  the beds prepared that they should have.   By the way, some have said the Trump administration dismantled the  asylum system. Well, because of the rules they had in place, there were  very few people coming to apply for asylum. The facility I saw, which  was a modern facility built just last year with $48 million of our  taxpayer money, was built to try to deal with the next surge.  Unfortunately, it is not big enough, and, again, it is overcrowded, so  you have kids sleeping on the floor on thin foam mattresses with only a  space blanket. None of them have been checked for COVID. They are  living not 6 feet apart, as we are required to do here with social  distancing, but inches apart and together.   It is one thing to say we are going to change all these policies. It  is another thing to say we are not going to put anything in its place  or because that is OK--we are OK to have a surge come--at least to be  prepared for that surge, and that is not what is happening.   I believe there is a path forward for the Biden administration and  the Congress to address this crisis in the short term; then work on  medium- and long-term solutions to lower the risk of future surges.   Here is what I would propose. First and foremost, the Biden  administration should recommit to enforcing our immigration laws by  providing overwhelmed Border Patrol agents and our Immigration and  Customs the help they need to be able to ensure they can get what they  need to be able to enforce the law. That means better pay for our  Border Patrol. It also means better overtime provisions. We have  legislation to do that.   It also means ensuring that they have the tools they need to be able  to protect the country. That means not stopping construction of the  fence, which, by the way, is almost done. In the El Paso sector, I  think there is 150 miles of fence totally--in total, 124 miles is  already done. The parts that are not done, unfortunately, are some of  the gates, so you have gaps. Border Patrol are very frustrated by this  because they literally have to have people at the gaps because they  can't monitor them as they can with the fence because with the fence,  it takes people a while to get over the fence. With monitoring devices,  which are, to me, more important even than the fence itself, they are  able to do their jobs.   They are also being told they can't continue the technology, so  although there is 124 miles of fencing, there is much less technology  than that. Yet they have been stopped from doing that as well.   Let's give them what they need to be able to do their jobs. They are  in an impossible situation. I am not talking about a new fence or a new  wall, but at least for the part that has already been appropriated by  Congress, let's complete it. Let's not leave these gaps.   I literally saw the supplies they have. Construction material is on  the ground, and the Border Patrol agents told me--these are rank-and- file Border Patrol agents: This is bad for morale. We see this stuff  right there. If that could be put up to take the place of the temporary  fencing migrants are able to simply push over or walk through, that  would make our jobs much easier.   No. 2, the asylum system needs to be changed immediately. Now, with a  backlog of 1.2 million asylum seekers, they are waiting several years  for court hearings to find out if they are qualified. During that time,  they are living in the United States and often vanishing into the  United States. We know from the data we have--and, by the way, the data  is not very good on this--that only about half of them, maybe more or  maybe less, are even showing up for their court cases. We know this  because, for about 48 percent of those who are seeking asylum, there  are now removal orders out for them for not showing up for their  hearings. So about half of them have removal orders to be removed from  the country because they haven't shown up for their hearings. Remember,  this is a 1.2 million-person backlog, so it may be 3, 4, 5, 6 years  before they get to their court cases. Is there any wonder some of these  people are not showing up?   Finally, at the very end of the process, after you go through all the  adjudication, guess what the percentage of success would be for someone  to achieve an asylum status: only 15 percent--15 percent--have a  successful claim. So people are being told to go into the country and  await their court cases, and 1.2 million people are doing that. It  takes several years for that to happen. At the end of the day, only 15  percent will get asylum.   Yet, again, many are not being removed even though there is a removal  order out on them because the immigration system is overwhelmed, so  they are focusing on those who have a criminal record, which I  understand. This means, if you don't have a criminal record and you are  in the United States, you know that it is unlikely you will actually be  removed even if there is a removal order for you.   So one policy change would be to simply resume a practice that was  started in the last administration as a pilot and ended in November  2020. It is called the Prompt Asylum Claim Review process. An efficient  and timely determination of who is eligible for asylum and who is not  would really help. It would enable us to start reducing the number of  migrants being held in custody and deter migrants who do not have a  valid claim.   You might say: Why not start with the 1.2 million backlog? That would  be great. We should do that as well. We need more immigration judges.  We need more lawyers involved in the process, on both sides,  representing those who have the claim and representing the government.  That would be good, but in the meantime, these rapid adjudications on  the border with due process would have the effect of deterring the next  migrant. Think about it. If you are just dealing with the last person  on the list, the person who comes in most recently gets more of a  deterrent than if you are dealing with the person who came in 4 or 5  years ago because they think: Well, if I get up there and make my claim  and come into the United States and go out into one of the communities  represented in this body, it will be 4 or 5 years before my court case  comes up. Perhaps there will be amnesty during that period or something  else or perhaps I will just stay.   If you come to the border and you seek amnesty--you seek asylum--your  claim will be adjudicated immediately, and you may receive asylum or  you may not. Again, 15 percent is the number now. That is the best  number we have, and that is from 2019. We don't have the numbers from  2020 yet Most think that is about what it will be.    I think this is a good system. I don't know why it was ended in the  Trump administration back in November. It shouldn't have been. I hope  the new administration will take it up.   As part of this, my colleagues from Texas and Arizona, Senator Cornyn  and Senator Sinema, have suggested we stand up multiple regional  processing centers to rapidly and fairly conduct asylum cases in one  location. I support that. I think this idea is consistent with what I  am talking about to discourage illegal immigration and to ensure that  we have a quick decision with regard to asylum. Have all the Federal  Agencies together--Border Patrol, Customs and Border Protection, ICE,  the Justice Department, HHS--everybody together in one place, and  quickly  [[Page S1678]]  make these decisions so that people aren't held for a long period of  time, so they can have the decision made.   I think it is worth the funding because it will be expensive. It will  be expensive to hire the new immigration judges to have the system set  up, but it is well worth it, in my view.   Third, to deal with the asylum process, the Biden administration  should look at the new Migrant Protection Protocols or ``Remain in  Mexico'' policy. ``Remain in Mexico'' allowed us to keep our detention  center populations down in the United States and asylum seekers close  to the immigration courts while officials sorted out the claims.  Getting rid of the policy served only to overcrowd our temporary  housing and sent a lot more people into the interior, awaiting a  hearing by an immigration judge.   There are concerns about ``Remain in Mexico'' in terms of the  conditions at some of the camps in Mexico. Although nongovernmental  organizations play a substantial role there already, perhaps for those  who are still in that process--and there are probably 45,000 people who  are still in that process; there were initially maybe less, but,  initially, there were about 75,000 people--a lot of people have just  gone home because they don't want to remain in Mexico for their asylum  claim. They would rather go back to their home in Northern Triangle  countries--Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador--but for those who are  there, perhaps there should be more oversight of those camps and more  Federal funding provided through the U.N. High Commissioner for  Refugees, HCR, and others to ensure those conditions are better.   What the Biden administration is doing now is saying ``We are going  to stop the program,'' and they are bringing people over the border. I  saw this, the processing center. About 350 or 450 people a day are  leaving the ``Remain in Mexico,'' the Migrant Protection Protocols  Program, and coming into the United States. Those people are given the  ability to come into the interior, so they are coming into communities  in the United States.   One thing you would hope they would get would be a notice as they go  through the processing that says: Here is your court date. You have to  show up at this court date.   What we have learned in the last several days or what I learned down  at the border is that they are not being given those court dates. They  are given a piece of paper that has 24 ICE offices in the major  metropolitan areas in America, and they are told: We don't know where  you are going to end up. We don't know where you are going. You are  welcome in the United States, but wherever you are going, please check  into the ICE office in your region.   My hope is we can at least get a system together where we don't,  again, dismantle a program until we have something in its place to  ensure people are going to their court dates to be able to have the  asylum claims dealt with.   On my trip to the border, I asked a reporter to come with me to the  border wall because I believe it is important that the public know what  is going on. I was surprised to learn that was the first time this  reporter or other reporters had been able to kind of see what was going  on for quite a while. They haven't been able to come into any of the  detention facilities, including the processing center I talked about  earlier, where the kids are crammed into--100 kids crammed into 1 room.  I think the press should be able to see that because I think that will  provide more transparency for all of us.   My constituents don't know what is going on at the border, in part  because the media haven't had that level of access. I know we have to  protect the confidentiality of individual migrants, and I get that. I  think that should be done. I think it can be done, but also by letting  the media have that access, we would be able to have more transparency  about the realities of what is going on along the border.   So, fourth, I think the Biden administration should invest in  finishing the work on the fence, as I said, but they should also work  to enact something that is even more important than a fence, and that  is to relieve the magnet. This is going to involve Congress.   We did pass an immigration bill in this body with a strong provision  called E-Verify several years ago. It basically says that for  employers, there will be a sanction if you hire somebody who is not  legal. The difference between E-Verify and some of the earlier programs  that attempted to do that unsuccessfully is that E-Verify lets us use  the new technologies we now have to ensure that fraudulent documents  that are often used can be determined to be fraudulent. In other words,  you can use technology--facial recognition and so on--to ensure that  the employer knows for sure whether the person is legal or not.   Again, this requires some Federal funding. Some of that software for  small businesses, in particular, may be expensive, but to have an E- Verify Program that says you mandatorily--by the way, it is not  mandatory right now either. It doesn't have the technology. It is not  mandatory. You have to make it mandatory and say: If you want to hire  somebody, you have to run them through the system. Make it as easy as  possible to use the technology.   In talking to the migrants I met--and my colleagues have spoken to  many people who have come to this country, and I am sure they have had  the same experience--when I asked them why they are coming here, they  all have the same answer, basically, with slight variations, which is,  as one guy told me from Guatemala, he can make 10 times as much money  here. He cares about his family and their future. The economy is much  better here, but that is because he knows he can get a job probably  with a document, either a driver's license or a Social Security card  that will be fraudulent, but he can buy it for 25 bucks. So we need a  system here to stop the magnet.    Don't put the Border Patrol and all of those involved--the  immigration system is in such an impossible position that we have a  wide-open system here where anybody can come and work.   Let's do E-Verify. That is more important to me than any other  enforcement tool that we have. Federal Reserve economists found that  States that mandate the use of E-Verify reduce the number of likely  unauthorized immigrants who stay in that State. Of course it does.   Sixth--and this is the final one--the Biden administration should  work with our Central American partners, including the Governments of  Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, to discourage unlawful  migration. They can do that by incentivizing migrants to apply for  asylum in their countries of origin. Some have said this should be  mandatory. To me, that seems to make sense. Maybe there is a reason it  shouldn't be mandatory, but it certainly should be encouraged, and  these countries should certainly offer this.   We should provide more aid to the countries of Central America  because there is a push factor. Everything I have talked about so far  is the pull factors, bringing them in. But if we do that, that aid  ought to be conditioned on them helping us to provide people the  ability to seek asylum in their own country. Where they have such a  fear of persecution that they can't do it in their own country, they  should be able to do it in a third country.   There was a program started in the Trump administration that never  really got off the ground, and it was called Safe Third Country. The  program with Guatemala was starting to work. Honduras and El Salvador  had signed up, but it hadn't started to work yet. Mexico didn't provide  it. But what it says basically is, if you cross through a third  country, you have to seek asylum in that third country.   Specifically with Guatemala--as you know, you have to go through  Guatemala coming from Honduras or El Salvador or Ecuador or elsewhere.  Why not have the asylum claims done there? Again, due process, yes, but  don't make people take this long and treacherous journey up to the  southern border of the United States. Don't make them go through this  process of the detention facilities and so on. Have them seek asylum in  their own country or in other countries. That, to me, seems like it  makes a lot of sense.   The Biden administration suspended the Safe Third Country program on  February 6, shortly after the inauguration.   One program they would like to restart that I think makes sense is  called the Central American Minors Program. They are going to restart  that program  [[Page S1679]]  now, starting in March. This is a program where, during the Obama  administration, if you had a family member, a parent--it had to be a  parent or a guardian--in the United States legally, then you could come  through this program called CAM, Central American Minors Program. I am  glad they have restarted that program. That makes sense. I will tell  you, over 5 years, only 3,500 kids were processed in that program.  Again, your parent has to be in the United States legally. There are  3,500 kids coming across our border every 9 days right now. So the  program is not going to solve all our problems, but it will help, and  that is a good idea.   We need to take a hard look at all of this, at all of these pull  factors we talked about and certainly at the push factors.   I will say that the Biden administration has proposed $4 billion to  go to these three countries--Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras. As a  Congress, we have appropriated and $3.6 billion has been spent in the  last 5 years in these three countries. So we have done almost that much  in the last 5 years, and yet, because of the corruption, because of the  lack of transparency, because of the lack of rule of law, the money has  not been as effectively spent as it should have been. So we have to be  sure the money is conditioned upon reforms to actually improve the  lives of the individuals in those countries. Despite the corruption, we  need to cut through that and say: If you take this money, you have to  commit to the reforms. Second, again, it should be contingent upon  helping with our asylum system to be sure that we can deal with this  surge that we are now facing.   If the Biden administration takes these six recommended actions I  have laid out today, I believe we would move toward bringing a quicker  end to this crisis on the border, and we would be able to secure our  southern border with regard to the drugs that are coming over and other  contraband and be able to say that we, together, worked on this.   I know this is a time where everybody is in their corner, the  Republicans and Democrats, and it is impossible, it seems like, to make  progress. But I think these are pretty sensible ideas, and the  alternative is a bad one: that this is going to get worse. You will  have more and more kids in detention centers. You will have more and  more families released to communities in the United States where they  don't come forward for their hearings. And it is something that  discourages people about our immigration system. It just doesn't seem  to work. It is certainly not working on the border today.   So my hope is that these ideas or others--maybe others in this  Chamber have better ideas, but hopefully they can be bipartisan, and we  can get some of this stuff done and actually deal with the crisis we  all know exists and we have a responsibility to face.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
