 Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Res.  908, condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment related to COVID-19.   Since this pandemic began, there have been thousands and thousands of  reports of discrimination and xenophobic attacks against Asian  Americans in the United States, including in my district, which has one  of the highest concentrations of Asian Americans in the country.   As an Asian American myself, this is deeply personal and offensive to  me. When people, including those in the White House, refer to COVID-19  as the Chinese virus or the kung-flu, they encourage bigotry or  discrimination against Asian Americans.   To put it simply, promoting anti-Asian-American sentiment or anti- Asian sentiment as related to COVID-19 is un-American, which is why I  am proud to cosponsor this resolution and encourage my colleagues to  vote ``yes.''
