 Mr. Speaker, it was once said: ``The greatness of a man  is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his  ability to affect those around him positively.''   By this definition, John R. Hatcher, III, was a great man.   As the founding father of the Ventura County chapter of the NAACP,  John was guided by his passion for social justice, and he was a  champion for diversity, equality, and civil rights.   An Air Force veteran, a civil servant, an extraordinary citizen, our  community is forever grateful for his immeasurable contributions.   For these reasons, I thank my colleagues for supporting the passage  of H.R. 5659, which will designate the post office in Oxnard,  California, as the John R. Hatcher, III, Post Office.   This bill is but a small measure of appreciation that recognizes John  and his life's work, and I urge the bill's swift consideration before  the Senate.                            ____________________
