 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the Committee  on Science, Space, and Technology, to  [[Page H2544]]  voice my support of the HONEST Act. This legislation gives independent  scientists a fair chance to validate the studies EPA uses to make  regulations. As someone who has made a career in science, I know that  determining anything less is unwise and unscientific.   Whether you are studying a new oncology drug or EPA regulations,  transparency and the ability to reproduce and share these findings are  some of the basic tenets of science. Costly regulations that impact  American citizens and Kansas farmers should be based upon data that is  available to independent scientists and the public.   Let's continue to be a voice for the people with sound, transparent,  scientific regulatory policy.
