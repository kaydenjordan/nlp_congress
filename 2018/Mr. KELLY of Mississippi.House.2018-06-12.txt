 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor today to rise  in memory of Army Sergeant Julius E. McKinney, who paid the ultimate  sacrifice while defending our Nation during the Korean war.   Sergeant McKinney was a member of the Heavy Mortar Company, 32nd  Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division. While engaged in heavy battle  at the Chosin Reservoir in North Korea on December 2, 1950, Sergeant  McKinney became unaccounted for and was later declared missing in  action.   Many years after the Korean war, permission to excavate burial sites  in the areas where fighting occurred around Chosin Reservoir led to the  recovery of human remains. More years would pass before the use of DNA  technology would help unite families with their loved ones. Eight years  ago, retired Mississippi State Guard Colonel Bill Huff, Sergeant  McKinney's nephew, submitted DNA samples along with two relatives to  the United States Army.   In March 2018, Sergeant McKinney's remains were identified. ``For 67  years, we waited for answers,'' Mr. Huff said. ``It has been so hard  for all of us in the family. It was hardest on our uncle's youngest  sister, Effie. For years, she would not eat much for fear her brother  was starving. She would remove the bed cover at night because she  worried that her brother was shivering somewhere.''   On Wednesday, June 6, 2018, members of the Patriot Guard Riders  escorted members of the family to the Memphis International Airport to  bring Sergeant McKinney's remains to Corinth, Mississippi. Friends and  loved ones attended the funeral. Interment was held at the Corinth  National Cemetery. Sergeant McKinney was buried with full military  honors.   ``We are so grateful that DNA technology helped us find Uncle  Julius,'' Mr. Huff said. ``We will share our story with the public  every chance we get in hopes that others will not give up on the search  for their loved ones.''   Joyce Tanner, Sergeant McKinney's niece, expressed her gratitude in a  written tribute to her uncle. ``We are thankful the U.S. Army did not  abandon their search for you until they were able to find and identify  portions of your body after 67 years,'' Mrs. Tanner wrote. ``They have  pieced together records and information that has brought a sense of  rest and peace to our hearts, minds, and souls, and to them, we are  forever grateful for their diligent efforts.''   Sergeant McKinney's awards include: the Purple Heart; National  Defense Service Medal, Korean Service Medal, United Nations Medal, and  the Combat Infantryman's Badge.   Sergeant's McKinney's service will always be remembered. It is  through the blood of our patriots that we are free. We will never quit  searching for our warriors. We encourage families with MIAs to go  through the process and give DNA, or whatever else that we ask, so that  we can find your warrior and bring them home when possible.   On the eve of the historic meeting in North Korea, I also want to  recognize all of our brave men who died at the Chosin Reservoir and in  the breakout to fight back to the 38th parallel from there. Heavily  outnumbered and outgunned, these brave men fought in the most extreme  of weather conditions, and against a numerically superior enemy. They  never gave up on America, and we will never give up on America and  never give up on this world.                 Honoring the Life of Judge Charles D. Thomas     Mr. Speaker, today I want to rise and  recognize my friend Judge Charles D. Thomas, who died recently and who  was a great mentor and friend to me.   Judge Thomas was a former military member and served as a company  commander in the Mississippi Army National Guard. He was a graduate of  Marion Military Institute, the University of Alabama, and he also  graduated from the University of Mississippi School of Law, or Ole Miss  Law.   Judge Thomas was the judge that swore me in when I started practicing  law. But he was more than just a judge. He was a mentor and a friend,  and I want to acknowledge all that he did to help me become successful.                  Honoring the Life of Billy ``Dog'' Brewer     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a former  Ole Miss football coach, Billy ``Dog'' Brewer, who also passed away  recently and was great friends with Judge Thomas.   Coach Brewer was always loved by his players. He was a fighter and he  got the best out of all of his players all the time. He took Ole Miss  back to a bowl that they won for the first time in 13 years in 1986,  and took them to multiple other bowl games, including a Gator Bowl in  1990.   On this day, I would just like to recognize the contributions that  Coach Billy ``Dog'' Brewer made to the University of Mississippi, and  the great State of Mississippi.                            ____________________
