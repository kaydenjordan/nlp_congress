 Madam Speaker, I would ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks, to include extraneous materials on the topic of this Special  Order.    Madam Speaker, I am joined by my colleagues today to  discuss how sanctuary city policies threaten the safety of American  citizens.   Before I dive in, I want to commend the Trump administration for its  crack-down on sanctuary cities, and I applaud the recent Second Circuit  Court of Appeals' decision allowing the Department of Justice to  withhold funding from sanctuary cities.   Now, back in June, Immigration and Customs Enforcement released a  list of criminal illegal aliens that were allowed back into their  sanctuary communities by local officials. One such criminal is Rosalio  Ramos-Ramos, he is a Honduran citizen who was deported four times  before authorities arrested him in Washington State in October of 2017.   Once notified of Rosalio's arrest, ICE issued a written detainer  request, asking the local authorities to imprison him for an additional  48 hours so that they could decide whether or not to begin deportation  proceedings.   Instead, local authorities ignored the detainer request and released  Rosalio back into the community. In January of 2018, he murdered his  cousin, and then he hid the body in a dumpster.   In another instance, in 2015, Garcia Zarate, an illegal immigrant  from Mexico shot and killed 32-year-old Kate Steinle, a very well-known  case, and a tragedy, while she was walking with her father and her  friend on Pier 14 in San Francisco.   Prior to the shooting, Garcia Zarate had been deported five times,  and was supposed to be deported for a sixth time. He had been  transferred to San Francisco's jail to serve a sentence for selling  marijuana, but local authorities released him a few days later, despite  a detainer request from Federal law enforcement.   Situations like these are more common than they should be in our  country, and many local officials protect illegal immigrants and ignore  Federal immigration laws up to the point of leaving dangerous  individuals in their communities.   As you can see from these horrific examples, refusing to honor  detainer requests and frustrating local law enforcement has dire  consequences. Not only does it make our Nation less safe, it leaves no  room for the victims of these offenders to obtain justice.   That is why I introduced the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities  Act, along with my colleague, Representative Bradley Byrne, here in the  House, and my fellow North Carolinian, Thom Tillis, over in the Senate.   This legislation would allow anyone who is a victim of murder, rape,  or any felony, to file a lawsuit and bring civil action against the  State or the sanctuary city if that city failed to honor a lawful  immigration detainer request from the Department of Homeland Security.  Any individual who is injured or harmed by an illegal immigrant, who  benefited from a sanctuary city's policy, will be able to sue the  sanctuary city or State.   My bill also requires sanctuary cities to waive a criminal's immunity  as a condition of receiving certain Federal grants. If the jurisdiction  doesn't agree to waive immunity, it will not be eligible for grants for  public works, grant planning, and administrative expenses, and grants  for training, research, and technical assistance.   I am extremely proud that President Trump endorsed our bill during  his 2020 State of the Union address. It is time for Congress to force  sanctuary cities to comply with Federal law enforcement, and to stop  them from letting dangerous criminals remain on our streets. It is  finally time to give victims of sanctuary city policies a legal pathway  to justice.   During my trip to the southern border last year, I witnessed the  humanitarian and security crisis up close and personal. I saw the sorry  state of some areas of our border. I saw places that were only defended  by thin, barbed-wire fences. These weak defenses allow practically  anyone to break into our country, and that includes dangerous members  of drug cartels who fuel our country's devastating opioid crisis.   I will continue to support policies that crack down on sanctuary  cities across the United States.   Madam Speaker, with that, I yield to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman), my dear friend, someone who has been a staunch  advocate for securing our border.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Norman.   Madam Speaker, at this point, I would yield to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Byrne), a friend and colleague who led the effort with me  to introduce the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act.  [[Page H1582]]    Like all of us here tonight, he is tired of hearing stories about  illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities committing horrific crimes  against American citizens. I want to thank him for spearheading the  effort against this dangerous sanctuary city policy.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Byrne for his friendship and  leadership on this.   Madam Speaker, at this point, I would like to yield to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).   I want to thank him for his leadership on the Immigration Detainer  Enforcement Act. This bill makes it easier for local law enforcement to  comply with lawful detainer requests from the Department of Homeland  Security.   I also want to thank him for his steadfast leadership on the  Committee for Homeland Security.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Babin). I thank Mr. Babin for his leadership as co-chair of the House  Border Security Caucus and for fighting to make America safe.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Allen). I appreciate his steadfast leadership on highlighting the  danger that sanctuary cities pose to cities across America.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Williams), a great capitalist and a great baseball coach.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  Watkins). I appreciate his support on this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Steube). I thank the gentleman for his history of being a strong  proponent of Federal immigration enforcement at  [[Page H1584]]  the State level and for his time in the Florida Legislature, and I  appreciate his support here, as well.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. LaMalfa), a great friend of mine and a hardworking Member.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. LaMalfa, and I appreciate his  thoughts.   Madam Speaker, at this time, I yield to someone who is focused on  securing our border, making sure as well that West Virginia remains a  great place to live, work, and raise a family, almost heaven, if you  will.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs.  Miller).    Madam Speaker, I thank Mrs. Miller for being here tonight.  I appreciate her support on this.   Madam Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues who have made it tonight  to speak on the dangers that sanctuary cities pose to the communities  around us.   It strikes me as common sense to pursue legislation that allows  families and victims legal recourse against the municipalities and  policies that have caused them so much damage.  [[Page H1585]]    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
