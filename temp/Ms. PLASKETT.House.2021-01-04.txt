 Madam Speaker, as we begin the 117th Congress, I am  truly grateful to the Democratic Caucus for bringing the six  representatives of the territories of the United States and the  District of Columbia--duly elected by 4 million Americans,  collectively--to where we are today.   That was done in the 116th Congress when the rules package  strengthened our democratic representation by returning floor voting  rights to Delegates and the Resident Commissioners in the Committee of  the Whole. The principle that every American deserves to be represented  by a vote on the floor of this House is important, and we have somewhat  of a voice now.   Moving forward, I think it is high time that we continue to expand  that. The Constitution gives the fate, the rights, of all the  territories solely to this body, to the Congress. That being said, it  is important that we respect those votes, and I believe that our system  for remote voting should apply with respect to votes cast in the  Committee of the Whole in the same manner as it applies with respect to  votes cast on the floor.   That being said, I commend the further strides we are making in this  rules package. As a former prosecutor and counsel on the House Ethics  Committee, I applaud the tightening of the whistleblower laws.    As a former counsel on the House Ethics Committee, I am  pleased with the tightening of the whistleblower laws, and I commend  the creation of the Select Committee on Economic Disparity and Fairness  in Growth to recommend policies to address economic disparities and  make the economy work for everyone. I expect this to be a positive  development, and I urge my colleagues to adopt this package.
