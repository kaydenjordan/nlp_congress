 Mr. President, it is with great pride that I  recognize 45 South Dakota veterans who are visiting our Nation's  capital on May 15, 2018, as part of the Midwest Honor Flight.   South Dakota's veterans have played an important role in making our  Nation great. Through their sacrifices, America has triumphed, remained  a free and vibrant nation, and helped others obtain their own freedoms.  I am honored to welcome these American heroes to our Nation's Capital  to see the symbols of their sacrifice, and I appreciate the opportunity  to meet with them and thank them for their service. We cannot thank our  veterans enough for putting their lives on the line when America's  security demanded it.   The Honor Flight veterans, in alphabetical order, are as follows:  Stanley Allen, Jr., William Anderson, Benard Aning, Wallace Bothwell,  Gordon Brower, Charles Bryan, Merdith Buchholz, Lucien Charette, James  Davis, Elmer Frank, Donald Freese, Donald Gross, Robert Hempel, Arlen  Jensen, Leroy Johnson, Kenneth Jorgenson, Harold Kleihauer, Lloyd  Kraft, Richard Landsman, Donald Leat, Gordon Leboutillier, Melvin  Lubbers, Kenneth Mattheis, Robert Mcclaren, Clayton Mclaughlin, Ronald  Mount, Ray Nielsen, Kenneth Peterson, Arvis Raml, Milton Schavee,  Eugene Schnider, Ronald Schorg, Arnold Schwarz, Warren Sealey, Ronald  Sheard, Richard Sinclair, Wayne Spars, Gordon Spars, John Stene, Gerald  Sutherland, Chester Vander Zee, Clarence Vanderlei, Norman Woods, James  Yonkers, and Herbert Yost.   It gives me great pleasure to honor those who have defended our  freedom and to recognize the service and sacrifice of these courageous  South Dakotans.                            ____________________
