 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairwoman  Lofgren for yielding, but also for her tireless leadership on so many  issues that confront our country today.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2019.  It is a historic bill to restore the promise of our Nation's democracy  and repair our democratic institutions. H.R. 1 represents a coordinated  effort to protect and promote the voting rights of all Americans.   H.R. 1 would also end the culture of corruption in Washington; reduce  the role of big money in politics; and make it easier, not harder, to  vote.   Mr. Chairman, let me be clear. The right to vote is a sacred civil  right in our Nation, but we know that there are those who want to turn  the clock back on voting rights and suppress minority voters. There are  those who want to undercut the power and representation of communities  of color and, really, lock us out of the political process.   With this historic bill before us we say, ``Enough is enough.''  Instead, H.R. 1 will ensure that every eligible voter has the chance to  participate in our democracy.   This bill also includes important provisions to ensure clean and fair  elections. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill and vote  ``yes'' to restoring our democracy once and for all.
