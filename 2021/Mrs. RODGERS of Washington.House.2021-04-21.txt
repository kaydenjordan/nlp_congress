 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I am disappointed that we are kicking the can down the road on a  short-term extension of DEA's emergency scheduling order to keep  dangerous fentanyl analogues in schedule I.   While I will vote in favor of this bill today because allowing this  lifesaving order to expire is unacceptable, this short-term extension  from the Democratic majority fails to meet the gravity of the situation  facing our communities, our border, and our country.   They have had 2 years to come to the table and work with us on a  permanent solution to combat fentanyl and fentanyl analogues and the  dangers that they pose to Americans. If we don't act, these dangerous  drugs being smuggled across our southern border would effectively  become street legal.   We need a permanent solution to save the lives of people in despair  and to protect our communities, and we need Democrats in the House and  the Senate to wake up and take it seriously. Nearly all States are  seeing a spike in synthetic opioid deaths, with 10 Western States  reporting a more than 98 percent increase. This pandemic has made it  worse.   In my home State of Washington, the fentanyl positivity rate has  increased 236 percent, more than any other State in the country. My  community lost two teenagers recently from a suspected fentanyl-related  death. They had their whole lives in front of them.    Just a few milligrams of fentanyl, what can fit on the ear of Abraham  [[Page H2026]]  Lincoln on our penny--that is a pretty small amount--is lethal.   Fentanyl analogues are oftentimes more potent, and more than a  thousand of them have been created over the years to mimic fentanyl's  opioid effects and outsmart the law.   With class-wide scheduling, any dangerous variant of fentanyl is  controlled under schedule I. According to the DEA, right now, there are  27 new fentanyl-related substances that have been encountered and  immediately controlled under the class-wide scheduling order. All of  those substances are many times more potent than heroin and pose  serious health and safety risks. One recently encountered substance was  approximately eight times more potent than fentanyl.   In addition to the ongoing, unprecedented humanitarian crisis at the  border, fentanyl and other dangerous opioids are also pouring across  our border at an ever-increasing rate. The Border Patrol just reported  a 233 percent increase in fentanyl seizures at the southern border just  in the last year.   If the class-wide scheduling of fentanyl-related substances is  allowed to expire, drug traffickers will be further emboldened to  smuggle this poison into our communities.   The Trump administration also worked hard to make the Chinese  Communist Party accountable for the fentanyl analogues that were being  manufactured in China, forcing them to crack down on it. If we let this  expire and do not make it permanent, we will be sending a clear message  to the CCP that it is okay for them to ease up and let this illicit  industry continue to grow.   Moving forward, we must work with the DEA and other agencies to make  this scheduling permanent, just like Mr. Latta's FIGHT Fentanyl Act,  while making reforms to improve scientific research on these  substances.   I am glad that the majority is agreeing with us that we cannot let  this expire. I am gravely disappointed that it is only a few months.  This extension will buy us far less time than the 1-year extension  Republican leader   Jim Jordan and I put forward and the 7-month  extension that was requested by the Biden administration.   If this 5-month extension is signed into law, I call on Democrats and  Republicans to begin working immediately on a longer term solution. We  stand ready to immediately begin the bipartisan work necessary to get a  permanent fix signed into law. I am committed to working over the next  5 months to solve this issue once and for all and not just settle on a  short-term extension.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this temporary extension, and  I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1515     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the lead Republican on the  Health Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Tampa, Florida, (Mr. Bilirakis), a leader on the  Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), the only pharmacist on our  committee, and a leader on this issue.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlemen from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), a great member and leader on  the committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Fitzgerald).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Madam Speaker, I have no further  speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.
