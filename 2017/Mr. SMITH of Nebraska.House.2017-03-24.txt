 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017. This legislation is the  first step in a process to unravel ObamaCare's taxes and mandates and  provide relief to the American people.   To understand the extent of ObamaCare's failures and their impact on  hardworking Americans and their families, just look at the rapid  collapse of ObamaCare's Consumer-Operated and Oriented Plans, or CO- OPs.   The story of these failed ObamaCare CO-OPs began in my home State of  Nebraska, with the abrupt collapse of CoOportunity Health, which left  120,000 Nebraskans and Iowans without health insurance. I repeat: It  left 120,000 Nebraskans and Iowans without health insurance.   CoOportunity Health was the first ObamaCare CO-OP to collapse, but it  wasn't long before 18 more followed suit, closing their doors and  leaving hundreds of thousands more without health insurance. Only 4 of  the 23 CO-OPs created under ObamaCare actually remain, and these  remaining 4 will likely face the same fate as they continue to struggle  with dire financial challenges.   Americans were falsely promised, if they liked their insurance, they  could keep it. After complying with ObamaCare's mandates, many  Nebraskans could not even keep the insurance this law created.   One of my constituents in western Nebraska, Pam, who is self- employed, lost her insurance four times under ObamaCare. Prior to  ObamaCare's implementation, she had a plan she liked and that actually  covered her preexisting condition. She was forced off of that original  plan when ObamaCare began and then lost her coverage three more times  through no fault of her own.   For Pam and millions of others across the country, ObamaCare has  severely limited options for affordable care. This is simply  unsustainable. Constituents in rural districts like mine are being hit  the hardest by ObamaCare's dwindling insurance markets. Because of  ObamaCare, Nebraskans are down to only two insurers from which to  choose, and other rural areas are down to only one or even zero  providers on their exchanges.   Adding insult to injury, according to the Obama administration's own  report on the individual market, 2017 premiums in Nebraska increased by  51 percent.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, places like Oklahoma are  experiencing premium increases of 69 percent, and it is only projected  to get worse if we do not act.   Doing nothing is certainly not an option. We must come together to  rescue this rapidly collapsing healthcare system. Let's come together  to do right by the American people.   I urge passage of this bill.
