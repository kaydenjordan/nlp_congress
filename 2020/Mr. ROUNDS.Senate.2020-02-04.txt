 Madam President, today, I rise to discuss the decision on  whether to remove the President from office based on the Articles of  Impeachment sent to us by the House of Representatives.   Our Founding Fathers included impeachment--effectively overturning  the will of the American electorate--to be used only as a last resort.  They trusted the Senate, requiring more solemn judgment than their  counterparts in the House, to decide whether an allegation by the House  has the substantiality to require removal from office.   According to ``Commentaries on the Constitution'' by Joseph Story,  the Framers saw the Senate as a tribunal ``removed from popular power  and passions . . . and from the more dangerous influence of mere party  spirit,'' guided by ``a deep responsibility to future times.''   This impeachment process, driven by partisan desire, was rushed and  lacked any proper form and substance. This is an attempt by the House  to undo the results of the 2016 election and impact the 2020 election.   Article II, section 4 of the Constitution states: ``The President,  Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be  removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason,  Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.''   During the debates at the Federal Convention of 1787, James Madison,  Alexander Hamilton, and others relied heavily on Sir William  Blackstone's work, ``Commentaries on the Law of England,'' which  Madison described as ``a book which is in every man's hand.''   Within his work, Blackstone discussed ``high misdemeanors,'' which  included many crimes against the King and government, including  maladministration. According to Blackstone, maladministration applied  to high officers in public trust and employment and was punished by the  method of parliamentary impeachment. It is from this understanding that  the Framers selected ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' for the  impeachment clause in our Constitution.   The term ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' had a limited and technical  meaning that was well known to the Framers. It was a term of art. As  early as 14th century England, high crimes and misdemeanors were a  category of political crimes against the State and were tried in  parliamentary impeachments. It should be understood that the word  ``high'' in high crimes and misdemeanors is a modifying adjective and  also applies to the word ``misdemeanors.''   ``High misdemeanors'' was applied in impeachment proceedings  conducted by Parliament long before there was such a crime as a  misdemeanor as we know it today. Misdemeanors alone referred to  criminal sanctions for private wrongs. High crimes and misdemeanors  were charged against officers of the ``highest rank and favor with the  crown'' or who were in ``judicial or executive offices'' and, because  of their stations, were unindictable by ordinary rules of justice.   For those individuals who were not indictable by the ordinary rules  of justice, the Founding Fathers, in their subtle brilliance, sought to  have something akin to crimes and misdemeanors that allowed them to  impeach for great and dangerous crimes committed against the State.   As we know, the Founding Fathers specifically adopted the phrase  ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' The emphasis on high misdemeanors is  important in this context because the House of Representatives has not  alleged treason, and they have not alleged bribery. Their case rests on  whether the articles charged are the types of high crimes and high  misdemeanors intended by our Framers.   In defining high misdemeanors, Blackstone stated that ``the first and  principal is the mal-administration of such high officers.'' However,  the Founding Fathers specifically chose not to include  maladministration as a basis for impeachment.   When George Mason and James Madison debated the specific language of  the impeachment clause, Mason stated:         Why is the provision restrained to treason and bribery       only? Treason as defined in the Constitution will not reach       many great and dangerous offences. Hastings is not guilty of       Treason. Attempts to subvert the Constitution may not be       Treason as above defined.    Mason then moved to add after bribery, ``or maladministration,'' to  which Madison replied and I quote: ``So vague a term will be equivalent  to a tenure during pleasure of the Senate.''   The Framers knew what they were adopting when they chose ``high  crimes and misdemeanors.'' They explicitly rejected maladministration  and other vague terms in favor of more specific allegations, which had  a limited and technical meaning.   In the first Article of Impeachment before the Senate, the question  is whether abuse of power as a charge on its own is an impeachable  offense.   The answer is no. Abuse of power does not have a limited meaning and  is as vague as maladministration. The Framers actually discussed abuse  of power and rejected it.   At the Virginia ratifying convention, James Iredell, one of the first  Supreme Court Justices, stated:         No power of any kind or degree can be given but what may be       abused; we have, therefore, only to consider whether any       particular power is absolutely necessary. If it be, the power       must be given, and we must run the risk of abuse.    In the first Article of Impeachment, the House has claimed that the  abuse of power is within the scope of high crimes and misdemeanors. I  believe the Founding Fathers saw abuse of power as an inherent risk  within the delegation of that authority. The Framers did not intend  impeachment proceedings to be brought every time an abuse of power is  alleged.   In the second Article of Impeachment, the House alleges the President  obstructed Congress when he refused to comply with congressional  subpoenas. The President rejected the legitimacy of those subpoenas.  The House then failed to pursue redress through the courts, rejecting  the court's rightful role in settling disputes between the two branches  of government.   The separation of powers doctrine recognized executive privilege as a  lawful exercise for the President to protect both Presidential and  deliberative process communications. The House showed a deliberate  disregard for the proper role of the judicial branch and now expects  the Senate to gather evidence after they have already impeached.   Alleging an obstruction of Congress charge before the House exhausted  its remedy for judicial relief would change the balance of power  between our co-equal branches of government and ignore the rightful  place the courts hold in arbitrating differences between the executive  and legislative branches.   No branch of government is above the Constitution. We are obligated  [[Page S837]]  under oath of office to support and defend it.   Article I, sections 2 and 3 of the Constitution state ``the House  shall have the sole Power of Impeachment,'' and ``[t]he Senate shall  have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.'' The Framers  intentionally separated these authorities.   The Senate does not have the authority to impeach; however, the  Senate does have the authority to judge the sufficiency of articles  presented to it. The Senate, as a trier of facts, should not overstep  its role. It is the House's responsibility to bring the evidence to  make their case, not simply make an allegation.   This does not mean that the Senate cannot call witnesses, but it most  certainly should not be the Senate's obligation to do so because the  House failed to do so in the first place.   Upon the founding of the Senate, James Madison explained that the  Senate would be a ``necessary fence'' against the ``fickleness and  passion'' that tended to influence the attitudes of the general public  and Members of the House of Representatives.   George Washington is said to have told Thomas Jefferson that the  Framers had created the Senate to ``cool'' House legislation, just as a  saucer was used to cool hot tea. For impeachment, there can be no  difference.   When the House is ignited by partisan passions, eager to reach a  desired result, the Senate must be cool and firm in its heightened  review. In recognizing the haste and half-hearted attempt by our  colleagues in the House, the Senate must also recognize these Articles  of Impeachment to be wholly insufficient and not warranting a removal  from office.   Let this decision lie in its rightful place, with the electorate. The  Senate has conducted a fair, impartial trial. We did our due diligence  and fulfilled our constitutional duty. Now it is time to bring this  process to a close and get on with the business of the American people  who sent us here.   I will vote against the Articles of Impeachment, in keeping with the  constitutional intent our Framers expected.
