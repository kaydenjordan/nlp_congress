 Mr. Speaker, I want to speak a little about decorum and  civility. Here in Washington, D.C., we have a lack of it, it seems, and  it is spreading all over. We are seeing it in the news. We are seeing a  lot of it happen right here in this building.   Just a few days ago, an intern on the Senate side decided it would  somehow be good or proper to make obscene comments as the President was  walking around in the building. That intern received only a slap on the  wrist for doing so.   We see it happening inside this Chamber in several ways. It is in  something as simple as the 1-minute speeches we have in this Chamber  each day. Members frequently blow through that time up to 80, 90  seconds before finally being gaveled down.   House rules are supposed to mean something. Sometimes in those  speeches, even though they know it is against House rules, Members are  disparaging individuals, calling them out by name, only to be gaveled  after the speech is over with, instead of during, to stop that  bad behavior.    About 2 years ago in June, we even had a sit-in that occurred in this  Chamber in a big part of this side of the room over here; a sit-in  where bootleg videos were being sent out and C-SPAN broadcast them,  outside of the House rules, because one particular group felt like  their voice needed to be heard, even outside of the rules, instead of  working within the process the American people sent us here to do. Very  disappointing.   Then, just last week, one of our Members decided that they wanted to  play a tape recording that came allegedly from inside one of the  detention centers along the border, outside of clear decorum of House  rules. The Member was repeatedly told it was outside the rules. Yet  that recording went on for at least 3\1/2\ minutes, disrespecting this  institution, disrespecting what the people sent us here to do.   We need to have enforcement of these rules. They need to be stronger.  We need to empower the Speaker and the Chair to enforce the rules. When  it is time, shut off the mike. It goes against the grain of what the  American people sent us here for in the over 200 years of this  institution.   Outside of this room we have Members of this body actually publicly  calling for intimidation and harassment of fellow workers in  government, whether it is in the Cabinet or fellow Members of this  body.   What have we come to as a country when that behavior is called for by  elected Members of this body? What have we come to?   We have seen it on the streets after the election and after the  inauguration of this President, with Antifa and other groups claiming  to be the voice of, I don't know who. Certainly, it isn't the voice of  the people, hiding behind masks, hiding their identity, and causing  wanton destruction.   When words like this come from people elected as a part of this body,  that just fuels the fire, not only for bad behavior and disrespect for  people who are doing their jobs, maybe with a different opinion from  others, but respectfully doing their jobs; harassing them in  restaurants or in markets, at the gas station, or wherever it is going  to be; it is completely out of line.   I do not know where we are going as a country when our elected  officials are calling for that kind of bad behavior.   So what are we going to do about it?   A lot of what drives this is what the people think, when the people  demand that their elected leaders ratchet up their behavior to be just  a little bit better.   You don't have an institution here when there are no rules, no order,  no function. Instead, you have chaos. You can't get anything done  around here, or anywhere else--even something as simple as a board  game--if people are not following the rules. All that breeds is more  misbehavior and more rule breaking.   There are a lot of people across this country who feel like that with  the government out of control, legislation out of control, rules are  for suckers. Why should they play when no one else is; when our borders  aren't enforced; when laws on the books aren't enforced; and they see  people being given rewards, whether the benefits of citizenship or just  as simple as running this House Chamber. It is very discouraging and  disappointing to the American public.   This institution is a much older and much more hallowed place than  any one of us will ever walk through for whatever time we are bestowed  the opportunity to serve people in our respective districts 2 years at  a time.   So it is high time that we have the rules in place, and that they are  enforced, but also to look inwardly at ourselves as Members of this  body to uphold the rules, the integrity of this institution.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend my colleagues in  this House for passing H.R. 299, the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans  Act. The legislation makes 90,000 Vietnam sea-service veterans eligible  for disability pay for health issues that could possibly have been  caused by Agent Orange exposure.   The truth is, we don't know for sure how many have been exposed to  Agent Orange, but we owe them the benefit of the doubt that we give to  Vietnam servicemembers who have served on land as well.   It is a long time coming. They pleaded with us for years to pay  attention to Agent Orange, and it has been obscured for a long time. It  is well-documented that some of these soldiers weren't treated very  well when they returned home to this country. They finally are going to  receive the respect and the care they deserve.   I want to thank our chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Dr.  Phil Roe, as well as the author of this legislation, my California  colleague,  David Valadao, for their tireless work on making this  happen.   Countless veterans have developed health issues as a result of Agent  Orange exposure, and it is about time we set this right for our blue  water Navy vets who are eligible for these benefits that they need and  their families pleaded for.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad we finally got this done for them.                            ____________________
