 Madam President, last evening the Vice President  notified me of the President's decision to respond to the Syrian  regime's use of chemical weapons against its own people through  military action. The action was taken to deter the Assad regime from  using chemical weapons again.   I support both the action and the objective. The planning of this  operation was clearly well considered. It was taken against the Shayrat  airfield from which the aircraft used in the attack had been launched,  where chemical weapons had been stored, and was taken against assets of  importance to the regime--aircraft, hardened shelters, and air defense  systems.   In the days ahead, I am committed to working with the administration  to continue developing a counter-ISIL strategy that hastens the defeat  of ISIL and establishes objectives for dealing with the Assad regime in  a manner that preserves the institutions of government in an effort to  prevent a failed state.   Our gratitude goes out to the world's most capable military, which in  a span of just hours presented options, capabilities, and plans to the  Commander in Chief and then executed a difficult mission. None of this  occurs without years of training, investment, and the dedication by our  servicemembers.   This was an action of consequence. It is a clear signal from America  that Bashar al-Assad can no longer use chemical weapons against his own  people with impunity.   In addition, for the attention of all Senators, we will have a  briefing on this matter later today.                            ____________________     Madam President, yesterday, as we all know, was a  consequential day for the Senate. In the end, we restored to this body  a tradition that Democrats first upset in 2003 by using a tool  Democrats first employed in 2013. As a result, we will move to the  confirmation of Judge Gorsuch shortly. He is going to make an  incredible addition to the Court. He is going to make the American  people proud.   After all, at this point, a few things about this man seem beyond  dispute. He has sterling credentials, an excellent record, and an ideal  judicial temperament. He has independence of mind and a reputation for  fairness. He has also earned plaudits from so many across the political  spectrum.   President Obama's former Acting Solicitor General lauded Judge  Gorsuch as ``one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have  served our nation over the last century,'' while President Obama's  legal mentor called Judge Gorsuch a ``brilliant, terrific guy who would  do the Court's work with distinction.''   An appointee of President Clinton's, Judge James Robertson, said  Judge Gorsuch ``is superbly well prepared and  [[Page S2436]]  well qualified to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court.  There is no real dispute about that.''   An appointee of President Carter's, Judge John Kane, perhaps summed  it up best when he said: ``I'm not sure we could expect better [than  Judge Gorsuch] or that better presently exists.'' In other words, no  one is better.   Of course, we all know what longtime Democrat and board member of the  left-leaning American Constitution Society, David Frederick, had to say  about Judge Gorsuch. ``The Senate should confirm him, because there is  no principled reason to vote no''--``no principled reason to vote no.''   There is a reason Neil Gorsuch enjoys the support of a bipartisan  majority of the Senate. There is a reason that a bipartisan majority  stands ready to confirm him today. He is an exceptional choice, and I  am very much looking forward to confirming him today. Of course, I wish  that important aspect of this process had played out differently. It  didn't have to be this way. But today is a new day. I hope my  Democratic friends will take this moment to reflect and, perhaps,  consider a turning point in their outlook going forward.   The Senate has a number of important issues to consider in the coming  months. Each Member, if he or she chooses, can play a critical part in  that process.   I urge colleagues to consider the role they can play, and I ask them  to consider what we have been able to achieve in years past by working  together, including the numerous bipartisan accomplishments of the last  Congress, because, as we all know, the Senate does more than confirm  Supreme Court nominees, although I sure am looking forward to  confirming this one.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there a sufficient second?   There is a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.    Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I  move to table the motion to reconsider.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on agreeing to the motion.   The motion was agreed to.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on agreeing to the motion.   The motion was agreed to.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 34, Rod Rosenstein to be Deputy Attorney  General.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on agreeing to the motion.   The motion was agreed to.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk will report the nomination.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Rod J.  Rosenstein, of Maryland, to be Deputy Attorney General.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call with respect to the cloture motion be waived and  that notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the cloture vote on  the nomination occur following disposition of the Perdue nomination on  Monday, April 24.    Mr. President, I am proud to say the Senate has now  confirmed Judge Neil Gorsuch as an Associate Justice on the Supreme  Court. I want to congratulate Judge Gorsuch on this significant  achievement. I look forward to observing his good work in the years to  come.   The confirmation process was certainly a significant undertaking--one  that would not have been possible without the dedicated efforts of so  many. I would like to take a moment to recognize them now.   First, I would like to thank the man who made this moment possible by  sending us this outstanding nominee. He is our President, Donald Trump.  This has been one of the most transparent judicial nomination processes  anybody can remember, and President Trump should be commended for his  efforts.   I also appreciate the role Vice President Pence played in moving this  nomination forward as well as the outstanding work of the White House  staff, led by Don McGahn, and for the wise counsel they provided  throughout this process.   Of course, we all know how tirelessly our dear friend Senator  Grassley has worked in leading the Judiciary Committee through this  process. He has been an unwavering leader, though we know it has not  always been easy. Chairman Grassley worked long and hard to ensure this  process ran efficiently, to give Members on both sides ample  opportunity to review the nomination, to see that the nominee was  treated respectfully, and, ultimately, to help bring this well- qualified jurist over the finish line.   I would be remiss if I did not also mention the work of the Judiciary  Committee collectively for its time and effort as well. I am referring  to members of the committee, and I am referring to Chairman Grassley's  excellent Judiciary staff as well. They were critical to this effort.   Specifically, I thank the following: Staff Director Kolan Davis,  Chief Nominations Counsel Ted Lehman, Communications Director Beth  Levine, Megan Lacy, Lauren Mehler, Kasey O'Connor, Katharine Willey,  Bill Lane, Carol Szurkowski, Dan Guarnera, and Katie Roholt.   To that end, I would also like to acknowledge our former colleague  Kelly Ayotte. From dozens of meetings with Senators to lengthy days- long hearings, she helped to ensure that this process ran as smoothly  as possible, and she did so with a sense of grace that we all came to  know when she was one of our colleagues.   Similarly, I want to recognize several White House Legislative  Affairs staff who helped guide Judge Gorsuch through this process,  including Mary Elizabeth Taylor, Marc Short, and Amy Swonger.   There are several others I would like to thank as well.   To the floor staff, Laura Dove, Robert Duncan, and their team, thank  you for keeping the floor running smoothly and guiding us through  Senate procedure. You all do incredible work and very difficult work,  and you make it look effortless during each and every time.   To the folks who keep our institution running--the Parliamentarians,  the clerks, the reporters of debates, the doorkeepers, Capitol Police,  and numerous others who have sacrificed and worked long--often  grueling--hours, thank you for everything you do and for always doing  it with a smile.   Of course, I would also like to thank my Republican colleagues for  their months of hard work. It has been a winding and sometimes bumpy  road, but together we were able to confirm a judge who, I believe, will  serve his country very well.   In particular, let me thank Republican whip, John Cornyn, and his  team, led by Monica Popp, for their efforts. Theirs is certainly not an  easy job, but it is a necessary one.   There are a few others I could not leave today without mentioning.   To each and every member of my own staff, I want to express my  sincere appreciation. There are almost too many names to mention, but,  if I may, I would like to acknowledge a few individuals who have been  particular assets through this entire process.   My chief of staff, Sharon Soderstrom, led our team through this  lengthy and arduous confirmation process while balancing a never-ending  list of demands. She has been a constant source of support and, as  always, an indisputable and fearless leader.   Sharon, I am immensely grateful to you for being at the helm of my  leadership office.   My deputy chief, Don Stewart--``Stew'' as we like to call him--always  knows exactly what to say or not to say, as the case may be. He has  been a critical member of the team in charting the way forward and in  helping convey our efforts to the American people.   Stew, thank you for your discerning advice and, yes, for your good  humor as well.   My policy director, Hazen Marshall, has steered our policy objectives  forward, balancing numerous legislative items and making it look  effortless along the way.   So thanks, Hazen, for your sound counsel and for driving the train  forward on so many different issues.   To my counsel, John Abegg, where do I begin? John has been an  invaluable member of my team, a guiding source of wisdom, and a driving  force in bringing Judge Gorsuch over the finish line. He has put in  countless hours and has never stopped working, even in the most trying  of times.   John, literally, this moment would not have been possible without  you.   I know there are many others whom I wasn't able to name right now,  but I want them to know we recognize their efforts, and we are  immeasurably grateful for the work they do.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
