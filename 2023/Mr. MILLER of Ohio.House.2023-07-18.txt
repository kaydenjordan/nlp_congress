 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to once again reaffirm my steadfast  commitment to a free and prosperous State of Israel.   Mr. Speaker, today every single Member of this honorable body will  have the opportunity to stand against anti-Semitism, to stand against  bigotry, to stand against hatred, and to stand for the forever home of  the Jewish people, our great friend and democratic ally in the Middle  East, the key pillar to freedom and democracy for the entire region,  and the home of so much of our shared history: the State of Israel.   Today we bring forward yet another opportunity. It is yet another  opportunity for individuals in this body to set their words and their  records straight and to walk back their words, which they so often  choose to do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution.
