 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mayor John  Koniar of Foley on his upcoming retirement after a remarkable career in  public service.   Mayor Koniar began his official service to the people of Foley upon  his election to the city council in 1980. He began serving as mayor pro  tem in 1996 until his appointment to mayor in 2006. The people of Foley  have shown their continued trust to Mayor Koniar by reelecting him in  2008, 2012, and 2016.   Mayor Koniar has been absolutely indispensable in the promotion of  Foley and its remarkable growth over the past several decades. Despite  that growth, Foley has maintained its small-town Alabama charm, so  exemplified by Mayor Koniar himself.   He leaves big shoes to fill, but in no small part due to his  leadership, Foley is positioned better than ever.   It has been a pleasure to work with Mayor Koniar during my time in  Congress, and I wish him and his family all the best as they embark on  this new stage in their lives together.                            ____________________
