 Mr. Speaker, as of today, Congress has less than 3 weeks  to reach an agreement on government funding before the September 30  deadline. If we cannot complete this fundamental task, the one thing we  have to do as Members of Congress, we risk shutting down the  government, an outcome that would have devastating consequences for the  American economy, American families, and our national security.   I wish I could stand here and talk about all the great bipartisan  work that the House Appropriations Committee has been doing and  reassure you that we are on track to fund the government on time, but  unfortunately that is far from reality.   This year, House Republicans have abandoned bipartisanship and  instead chose to draft some of the most extreme partisan and harmful  legislation that I have ever seen. Their bills would enact devastating  cuts that would jeopardize our children's education and futures, weaken  our rural communities, increase costs for families, and leave our  country less safe by directly cutting funds for necessary law  enforcement.   On top of this, they have packed these bills to the brim with extreme  policy riders that have no chance of becoming law, including abortion  bans and extremist discriminatory policy.   We often say that your budget is a reflection of your values, and  these shameful funding bills show that the House Republicans are  lacking many.   It doesn't have to be this way. Over in the Senate, Democrats and  Republicans have put together bipartisan funding bills, all of which  have passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee with  overwhelming bipartisan support. House Republicans, however, are on an  island of their own, seeking to jam their rightwing ideology down the  throats of the American people or else subject them to a shutdown that  will have devastating consequences. This would be the height of  irresponsibility.   It has become clear that the House Republicans do not have a plan.  Faux impeachment is just a distraction. They do not have a strategy,  and the chaos and confusion will come at a cost of a government  shutdown that the American people cannot afford.   Republicans in the House need to do the right thing: Come to the  table with Democrats and both parties in the Senate and let's fund the  government. It is not rocket science. It is just basic governance.               Wisconsin Shouldn't Impeach Justice Protasiewicz     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about what is happening  in my home State of Wisconsin. There are calls from the gerrymandered  State assembly to impeach the newest State supreme court justice before  they have even heard a case.   Justice Janet Protasiewicz was elected overwhelmingly. She defeated  her opponent by more than 200,000 votes. She won by 11 points. In a  purple State like Wisconsin, that is a landslide. However, because she  mentioned that Wisconsin's extremely gerrymandered State legislative  and congressional districts might be a problem, the current State  assembly is threatening to use their impeachment powers before she even  has a chance to hear a case.   The State assembly is trying to overturn the will of the voters  because they don't like who won the election. Using this logic, if the  legislature doesn't like the possible outcomes of any election or cases  before the court, it can conceivably threaten impeachment without  actual cause and undermine the separation of powers of government. The  legislature does not trump the judiciary. They are co-equal branches of  government.   Under the Republicans' absurd logic, they could threaten impeachment  over their gerrymandered maps or keeping Wisconsin's 1849 abortion law  or even potentially over giving themselves a pay increase even if they  thought the court would find it unconstitutional.   There is a standard for impeachment. It is for wrongdoing in office,  not for disagreeing with the legislature. The fact that Justice  Protasiewicz has not heard a single case makes this even more  ridiculous.   Now the Republicans in Wisconsin are maybe changing their tune. They  likely realize this impeachment farce might be a bad idea, but that is  not stopping them from coming up with new bad ideas to stay in power.  Now they claim they want an independent commission, a Trojan horse, to  distract as a way to stay in power, an idea that they previously  dismissed.   If the Republicans don't like the so-called fair maps that come out  of this commission, they can still draw their own maps under this  Trojan horse plan. It only requires a simple majority, which when you  have gerrymandered maps, you certainly have. This is wrong. It does not  represent Wisconsin's values and, frankly, it is un-American.                            ____________________
