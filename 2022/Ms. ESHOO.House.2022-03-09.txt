 Mr. Speaker, I rise in full support of H.R. 2471, the  fiscal year 2022 appropriations bill.   Every Member has met with countless constituents who have pleaded for  Congress to do more to address diseases that are currently death  sentences . . . pancreatic cancer, Alzheimer's disease, glioblastoma,  ALS.   Today's legislation delivers for those constituents by providing $1  billion to create an independent Advanced Research Projects Agency for  Health, ARPA-H.   ARPA-H will embody the nimble spirit of the esteemed Defense Advanced  Research Project Agency to pursue large-scale, high-risk projects. It  will break the mold for federal research agencies by being uniquely  focused on solving the ``valley of death'' to deliver transformational  cures. ARPA-H will correct the gap that currently exists between the  basic research pursued by the National Institutes of Health and the  development of commercial products by the private sector. With this  mission, ARPA-H will drive scientific breakthroughs to improve our  nation's health and will help fulfill President Bidens promise to end  cancer as we know it.   I'm proud to have championed this bipartisan investment in this  year's budget.   Our work is not yet done. As Health Subcommittee Chairwoman, I look  forward to passing my ARPA-H bill to provide the agency the full  authorities it needs to be successful from Day One.   I've worked on this legislation over the past year after President  Biden convened a small group of bipartisan and bicameral members in the  West Wing last March to describe his vision for the agency.   I came to Congress to solve problems and better the lives of the  American people. It is with great pride and joy to vote for today's  budget that will fund the beginning of ARPA-H. This is a momentous  first step in creating an agency that will be a beacon of hope to the  American people.
