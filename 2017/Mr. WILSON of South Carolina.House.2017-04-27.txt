 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, last Sunday marked Tax  Freedom Day, determined by the Tax Foundation, led by President Scott  Hodge. This is the day when our citizens have earned enough money to  pay their tax bill for the year.   It is alarming that American taxpayers must work 113 days to foot the  bill for their annual tax obligation. Collectively, American families  spent more on their taxes this year than on food, clothing, and housing  combined. This is an abuse of the American people, limiting their  ability to spend their own hard-earned wages.   As Tax Freedom Day is pushed later each year, we must commit to  commonsense reforms to the Tax Code. The Federal Government takes too  much from American workers with an obsessive push to increase taxes,  destroying jobs.   I am encouraged by the tax plan President Donald Trump outlined  yesterday and look forward to working with him to provide tax reform  that will create jobs, simplify the Tax Code, and grow the economy. I  am confident that, by working together, we can deliver comprehensive,  balanced tax reforms for American families which will promote jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
