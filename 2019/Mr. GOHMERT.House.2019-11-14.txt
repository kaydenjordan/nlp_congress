 Mr. Speaker, these are interesting times, and I build  more respect for my friend from Arizona every time I hear him speak. I  am very grateful for his presence and his efforts.   At this point I would like to address this ongoing issue, ongoing for  only about 3 years, because it was immediately upon President Trump  being elected President that we immediately started hearing all of the  saber-rattling that we have got to impeach this guy, he is not  qualified, he is crazy, he has committed crimes.   And we have been hearing for nearly 3 years: there is no question,  there is lots of direct evidence, President Trump has committed crimes,  a lot more than you might think; in fact, a lot more than  circumstantial evidence. Oh, it is overwhelming.   We have heard from so many people for nearly 3 years--well, actually,  over 3 years now--over 3 years.   Then we get down to it. The great hope was the man that I believe did  more damage to the FBI than all of the FBI directors for the last 50  years, a guy named Mueller.  [[Page H8874]]                                     time  1730    He ran off thousands and thousands of years of our best FBI  experience. Apparently, he just wanted yes-people. He didn't want  people who had enough experience to tell him when he was on the wrong  track.   He said he had no reason to apologize when he destroyed the lives of  innocent people. And yet, that is the person who was put in charge of  this investigation.   What did he do? He went out and hired over a dozen people who  absolutely despise Donald Trump, put them to work trying to destroy our  sitting President. They harassed him and his family, business  associates, people in the administration, threatened their families,  threatened them.   Even after all that, after virtually 2 years, nearly 2 years of  investigation by the Mueller cabal, they had nothing. They had nothing.  I think Mueller would have been happy to keep investigating and using  up millions and millions of taxpayer dollars, tens of millions, as he  had been doing. Fortunately, his investigation came to an end.   After thousands of witnesses, they had nothing. No Russia collusion.  A hoax is what it turned out to be.   When it was clear there was no Russia collusion--of course, it is not  a crime to collude. It is a crime to conspire.   There was no Russian conspiracy between anybody with the Trump  campaign and the Russians. But it is very clear, the Russians, what  they really wanted, for people who have really dug into this, they  wanted and what they always want, always have wanted, back when it was  the Soviet Union, they want to divide America. They want to destroy  this Republic.   Unfortunately, they found allies, willing or otherwise, here in this  country, to take absolute lies that were created, were spun up, were  twisted--had the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court, the FISA  court, manipulated fraud upon the FISA court, which has exposed to me,  as a former judge and chief justice, that since we have seen nothing  from the FISA court of outrage, as a good judge should have when they  realized there has been a fraud upon the court, nothing, which tells me  we either need to totally get rid of the FISA court or we need to have  some dramatic changes.   We certainly need to change the FISA judges themselves because either  they were unwilling and unknowing accomplices with the fraud upon the  court, or they knew what was going on and he or she, or they, were  proud to play a part in trying to destroy the Trump campaign and the  Trump Presidency.   I think it is interesting, this call between President Trump and  President Zelensky, July 25, I mean, when so many people--we find out  now so many people were on the call, including at least four  stenographers taking down every word.   I mean, I have been in courts for my whole adult life, and you might  have a stenographer miss a word here and there. They are amazing. They  hardly ever make mistakes. But if you have four stenographers sitting  on a call, you are not going to have four stenographers miss anything  when they consult each other and work together. That is just not going  to happen.   I had one of the best court reporters in the world, and, you know,  there was a mistake now and then.   You put four people like that together, like we are taking down the  President and President Zelensky's call, and they don't make mistakes.   But it had to send shivers up the spines of anybody in our  intelligence community that had worked with Ukrainians, Russians,  former MI-6, Italians, Australians to try to destroy President Trump.  It had to send shivers up their spine. It had to get them very  concerned.   Oh, my gosh. This President is going to close in on us because this  new President, we understand he is honest. That is what we keep  hearing, that he wants to end corruption in Ukraine.   This whole body, I think there were maybe 10 or 12 or so that didn't  vote for the bill in 2014 that talks about Russia, I mean--not Russia,  but Ukrainian corruption, and how we need to push them to end that  corruption. So, I mean, everybody on this floor basically knows. And I  think the ``no'' votes were based on some other reason, not on a desire  not to end corruption. We all had the same goal, just concerns about  different parts.   The fact is, people know. There has been a lot of corruption. It  sounds like President Zelensky wants to end it. You put that with a  President who doesn't mind rattling cages and trying to drain the swamp  and trying to change the way we do things for the better, and of  course, it offends those whether they say they are part of the deep  state or not. It is the people that work here that have never been  elected here but think they run this country, and those in embassies  who, beyond what they are assigned to do, they think they run foreign  policy. We have gotten a taste of that through these hearings and  through these witnesses and through their testimony.   The star witness yesterday, Mr. Taylor, I don't impugn his military  service, but I know if he had been the kind of gossipmonger in the Army  or at West Point that he has turned into at the State Department, he  sure wouldn't have gone very far. His next OER in the Army would have  destroyed his career. In West Point, he would have gotten the lowest  peer review ratings. He would not have done very well at all.   This is, apparently, a different Mr. Taylor than the one that went  through West Point and served honorably and well in the Army.   But as Ambassador Sondland testified, and our friend   Jim Jordan  read yesterday, Ambassador Taylor recalls, and this is Sondland's  testimony, that Tim Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that Sondland  ``told Mr. Morrison that I conveyed this message to Yermak on September  1, 2019, in connection with Vice President Pence's visit to Warsaw and  a meeting with President Zelensky.''   Astounding. That is where Mr. Taylor says he got his clear  understanding of what had happened.   If you look at his testimony, you get a real sense of how this  honorable serving military member, fine graduate of West Point, has  been tainted over the years.    You look at his testimony, first of all, he says something like--he  answered a question. He had never seen aid conditioned on political  interests. And yet, what he probably had in his mind is he had never  seen aid conditioned on something he disagreed with.   Most of our aid is conditioned on something. If it is not, we need to  find it and get conditions on it.   As I have said ever since I have been here, you don't have to pay  people to hate you. They will do it for free. And yet, our country  continues to pay dictators that hate us.   That stuff ought to be stopped. It ought to be conditioned on making  those countries less corrupt. That is what this House has tried to do  on both sides of the aisle, in prior years, to end corruption in  Ukraine.   But you get a sense of things when--this is his testimony, at page  11, Mr. Taylor's. Let's see. ``The first summary of the July 25 Trump- Zelensky call that I heard from anybody inside the U.S. Government was  during a phone call I had with Tim Morrison, Dr. Hill's recent  replacement at the NSC, on July 28.''   That is what Ambassador Sondland was apparently talking about. He got  that from Tim Morrison, who conveyed a message that Yermak got from  Ambassador Sondland about Vice President Pence's visit to Warsaw and  meeting with President Zelensky.   He goes on, and his next statement, next paragraph: ``By August, I  was becoming more concerned.''   Yeah, Mr. Taylor was becoming concerned because he had heard fourth- hand the President wanted to end some corruption in Ukraine that was  affecting the United States election.   I thought that is what everybody here wanted to do. That is what we  have been hearing from the leftwing, or many call it the mainstream,  but the leftwing, alt-left media. They have been saying, oh, how  horrible.   Well, here you have a President trying to do something about it, and  Mr. Taylor, the wonderful, honorably serving Army man, is now concerned  because of the fourth-hand account he got about what the President did.   Now, we are told: Oh, by the way, I heard about a staffer who  overheard a conversation between the Ambassador and the President, and  he mentioned  [[Page H8875]]  the interviews, had some question about the interviews, maybe how they  were going.   Oh, my goodness. The investigation, wanted to know how it was going.  Gee, how horrible that we had a President who wanted to know about  corruption in Ukraine that was affecting the United States.   Then we get down--and I think this tells us a great deal about their  star witness, until his staffer, who was eavesdropping and heard a  conversation, we are told, when Mr. Taylor says, ``A formal U.S.  request to the Ukrainians to conduct an investigation based on  violations of their own law struck me as improper.''   Well, my understanding was the President wants to know about  corruption in Ukraine that may have violated American law, our laws,  work with our U.S. Attorney General to try to get to the bottom of not  Ukraine, per se, but Ukrainians' effort to affect our election.   That offends these deep staters in the State Department, these people  that don't like a President that doesn't see things exactly like they  do. How dare this President come in and want to exert his foreign  policy that he got elected to put in place. He doesn't understand. We  are the ones that run things.   You see it here. He says that ``struck me as improper.'' I am the  judge, the purveyor of what is right or not in my realm.   You find that in a number of people in the State Department. We run  things.   Of course, they come in and testify. ``I have worked for this many  Presidents, carried out their foreign policy.'' Then we find out that  what means. ``I carry out their foreign policy as long as they do what  I tell them. Or I ignore them and carry out what I know is much  better.'' You get that sense.   He goes on: ``And I recommended to Ambassador Volker we `stay  clear''' because I, Mr. Taylor, know much better than the elected  President. I know better than the Attorney General.                                time  1745    I know better than all of these clowns who are elected or have been  confirmed by the Senate. Who are they to go around what I think?   And he goes on: ``To find out the legal aspects of the question,  however, I gave him,'' the Ambassador, ``the name of a deputy assistant  attorney general, whom I thought would be the proper point of contact  for seeking a U.S. request for a foreign investigation.''   How dare President Trump try to go around the way I, Mr. Taylor,  think that foreign affairs ought to be handled and the way corruption  ought to be addressed when it affects the United States? How dare he? I  am the one who knows these things, not this clown President.   I mean, it is pretty clear what was in his mind, and it needs to  stop.   And I would just suggest, if we have a vote to send this matter of  impeachment, actually impeach this President for violating the sense of  propriety of somebody who is so deep in the state and in the intel that  they don't like somebody coming in trying to drain the swamp, if that  is what they want to impeach this President over, trying to end  corruption in Ukraine that affects our election, well, then, the  Senate, I know some have said, ``Oh, we are not going to have a vote on  that,'' well, I imagine they probably will, and they are going to need  to have a trial.   In looking back and researching this again, you know, there are no  rules of evidence for impeachment; there are no rules of procedure. The  Constitution provides for it, the impeachment trial in the Senate. But  as I understand it, the Senate may have even gone to the Old Senate  Chamber to have a session out from under C-SPAN cameras to work out the  rules of evidence and procedure, limit time, limit witnesses, how  questions are asked, all that. They have to come up with that every  impeachment, a new set of rules.   I would point to Article III, Section 3 for a little bit of guidance  here.   Article III, Section 3 talks about treason, and President Trump is  not guilty of any treason. He is not being accused of treason, except  from people who are suffering from PTSD. That is President Trump stress  disorder. But otherwise, there will be no charge of treason against  this President, because it didn't happen.   But it is such an important issue when you talk about removing a duly  elected President for the first time in our history. And there is a  rule on treason. It is in the Constitution: ``No person shall be  convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the  same overt act.'' That means direct evidence, no hearsay, two people  who actually witnessed this despicable act.   I would submit to the Senate that removing a President properly duly  elected for the first time in our history, even after there were  Ukrainians and Russians trying to help the Democrats to keep him from  being elected--he still won, got a huge majority of the electoral  college votes. This would be every bit as serious as charging someone  with treason. The Senate ought to set a rule that says: We have got to  have two direct witnesses to whatever they are saying he did wrong. We  are not going to take hearsay to remove a President for the first time.   I would suggest that if the Senate would do that, they won't even  have to worry about setting time deadlines, witness deadlines. Just put  that requirement on, and it will be a very short trial because there  are no direct witnesses of any allegation that would rise to the level  of what is being accused here.                Military Personnel Have Been Treated Unfairly     Now I want to turn quickly to the issue of some of our  United States military personnel who have been unfairly treated, people  who saw it as their patriotic duty to sign up and serve this country,  risk their lives and limbs and their life as a family member to serve  this country.   Greater love hath no one, Jesus told us, that they would be willing  to lay down their lives for their friends, and that is what these  people do.   My group, my 4 years on Active Duty, we were never sent to combat,  but we have, currently, a Secretary of the Department of Defense who is  trying to stop efforts and came out and publicly--basically threatened  the President, don't you dare try to right what you think are wrongs in  people who I would tell you have been railroaded by a broken military  justice system.   The reason Congress created the UCMJ, where military members don't  even get all the rights that we give to terrorists, to foreign  terrorists illegally in our country--we don't give our military as many  rights as they have.   The reason we had to shortcut, or Congress did, back when the UCMJ  was passed was because both sides of the aisle understood that, when  you are in a combat theater, you don't have time to go back and have a  thorough investigation, gather up all the forensic evidence and then  come back and have a nice jury trial in America. You have got to deal  with it quickly and then get back on the battlefield.   And yet what we have seen over and over, when the military chooses  for political expedience or political correctness purposes or when they  want to satisfy a terrible leader like Maliki was in Iraq who created  all kinds of trouble for that country, we would send a Vice President  over to stand by him and say we are going to get these guys, or tell  Karzai, a corrupt family in Afghanistan, oh, yes, we are going to  prosecute our guys who, turned out, killed people who created IEDs that  killed Americans, people who were Taliban trying to kill Americans, and  yet we have hung some of our own people out to dry.   So we have a letter, a bunch of us do. It should go out in the  morning, I guess, to the Defense Secretary, and, you know, I put the  words in there myself that I think, if he doesn't realize that there  needs to be some corrections within military justice so we don't keep  sending innocent people defending our country, defending their brothers  and sisters on the battlefield, if we don't stop sending them to prison  and bring them back to America for a trial, don't allow the defendant  to bring witnesses back from the combat theater, oh, no, but the CID  and our officials will make deals with Taliban or with people in Iraq  who want to destroy our country and us, if they will come over and say  terrible things about our military member, we will put them in prison,  and we will give them visas.    And that happened with Sergeant Derrick Miller. We got a whole bunch  of people.  [[Page H8876]]    Clint Lorance, hoping that the President will act. Apparently got  slowed down by the Defense Secretary jumping in.   John Hatley, a first sergeant, two bronze stars, He should have  gotten a silver star, but that was apparently pulled as a  recommendation.   Michael Behenna, Corey Clagett, we have got a whole bunch of folks,  and we have a Congressional Justice for Warriors Caucus here that is  working on this.   And we have got a guy who recognized a Taliban member from the day  before when he had his AK-47 and grabbed him in the middle of our U.S.  Army camp in Afghanistan and starts questioning him, and he starts  lying through the interpreter: Oh, I was here to fix electrical. Oh,  no, I was here to fix plumbing.   And that sergeant pulled his gun and demanded answers. The guy grabs  for the gun and, in the struggle, the Taliban member was shot. That  sergeant was brought back to America. The translator, who they told  separate stories--I mean, they told separate stories, but it was the  same story told separately.   Yet, after the CID got through promising or somebody promising this  guy that had been trying to get a visa into America and turned down  every time: If you will come to America and testify that the Taliban  member never grabbed his gun, then we will give you and your family  visas; you will probably be able to get citizenship.   Oh, okay, then that is my story now, he never tried to grab the gun.   And you threaten another witness who was there, he is going to prison  if you don't turn around and change what you have said from the very  beginning without any influence from Sergeant Miller, and you put the  guy in prison for premeditated murder?   You don't have the weapon? Oh, no, you don't let him have the weapon.  You don't have it examined so that it can show that the fingerprints of  the Taliban member were on that gun, he did try to grab it. And he is  sentenced for premeditated murder for the rest of his life.   Well, we got that turned around. We got it paroled, and thank God we  did. He is one of the finest people I have ever known, Sergeant Derrick  Miller here, working for me now, and he is working for our caucus.   We have a system that is broken, and we need to fix it. And if our  Secretary of Defense doesn't recognize that, he needs to go, and we  need to take the money that we have allowed them to use to drag people  back to America, away from the combat field, away from juries that have  combat experience, we need to put them on trial in a civil Federal  court and let them have all the rights and privileges they should have  as American citizens.   If you are not going to do it in the combat theater the proper way  with the proper investigation, let's bring them back. Use your money  from defense. Use that not in courts-martial but here in the United  States in a civil court, and that will solve the problem.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
