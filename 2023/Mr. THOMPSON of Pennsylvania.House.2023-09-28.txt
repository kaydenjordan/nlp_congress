 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember  the life of Sergeant Richard Sharrow of Marienville, Pennsylvania.   Army Sergeant Richard M. Sharrow was reported missing on July 25,  1950, at the age of 22. Sergeant Sharrow was deemed missing after his  unit sustained heavy casualties while defending against the North  Korean army's advance near Yongdong, South Korea.   Last week, Sergeant Sharrow's remains were returned home. On Monday,  with full military honors, he was laid to rest in Marienville.   Madam Speaker, we still feel the pain of those missing from conflicts  fought generations ago, and we are forever indebted to their service.  My prayers are with Sergeant Sharrow's family during this solemn time.  It is my hope with his return his family is able to find peace and  solace in knowing their loved one died a hero in service to the Nation.                            ____________________
