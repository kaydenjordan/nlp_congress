 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his tireless  effort, along with the committee staff, to highlight that the House  Veterans' Affairs Committee is truly how a congressional committee is  supposed to operate: together.                                time  1645    The name of the act is the VA MISSION Act. Any member of the military  understands that mission accomplishment is always first, and with this  VA MISSION Act of 2018, what you are going to see is some extremely  important elements in accomplishing that long-term mission of providing  results for the veterans.   The community care improvement consolidates seven duplicative  community care programs into one cohesive program. It removes arbitrary  one-size-fits-all parameters in the Choice Program.   Previously, the Choice Program limited accessing care to convenient  and affordable. It wasn't good enough. The VA MISSION Act provides  Choice funding shortfalls, ensuring that the 1-year funding bridge is  complete so that the veterans have a continuity of care during the  implementation of the new program.   It also provides for the Asset and Infrastructure Review. This  transforms the VA from relying on outdated inpatient facilities to more  modern facilities meant for outpatient care of the future that includes  delivery through telehealth, through different and unique circumstances  that our veterans expect and deserve today.   The VA is one of the Federal Government's largest property holders  and needs to make sure that its resources aren't wasted keeping lights  on in unused buildings. Those limited resources need to be focused on  the veterans.   And finally, the caregiver expansion, this VA MISSION Act expands  caregiver support to both pre- and post-9/11 veterans. That is  essential and long overdue.   When you reform the VA and allow for greater veteran choices but do  not--and I repeat, do not--privatize, this is making the VA the best it  needs to be going forward in support of our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank the chairman for his efforts.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to  H.R. 2.    Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple. It directs GAO to  study the credit needs of agricultural businesses that are owned and  operated by Indian Tribes on Tribal lands.   My district is home to eight federally recognized Tribes, and it has  been my honor to represent each of them over the last 16 months. We  often hear about how most Tribes are located within food deserts, but  we must remember, most Tribes are also located within credit deserts.   Credit deserts occur when there are very few lenders available in a  region. The lack of credit options severely impacts the ability of  Tribes and Tribal Members to invest and expand their agricultural  businesses. By directing GAO to study the unique credit needs of  Tribes, we can identify solutions that will result in a system under  which their needs are met in an equitable and effective manner.   The Farm Credit System is vitally important for agricultural  communities in rural America. Without sufficient access to credit,  young farmers will not be able to begin a career and experienced  farmers will not be able to expand their businesses. Tribes across the  country need fair and equal access to all agricultural programs so they  can promote their historical and cultural knowledge for the next  generation of American farmers.   This farm bill represents an investment in rural America. With net  farm income dropping by nearly 50 percent over the past 4 years,  Congress must recognize the vital role our agricultural communities  play and provide the resources they need for success.   I thank Chairman Conaway for his leadership in bringing forth a bill  that is responsive to the needs of farm country.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support for my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
