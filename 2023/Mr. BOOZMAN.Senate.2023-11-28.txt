 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize CMSgt Joshua K.  Leonard for his dedicated service to the U.S. Air Force and the Senate  as a legislative defense fellow. Josh has served as a vital part of my  team since January 2023. He has been a trusted adviser on issues  relating to the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland  Security.   Josh enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in June 2005. His continued  service is a reminder of the dedication and sacrifice of every  servicemember who protects our Nation and defends our freedoms. His  effort and passion distinguished him as a valuable member of my  legislative team. I am proud to have someone like Josh on my staff, who  understands the significance of maintaining America's air superiority  and caring for our servicemembers and their families.   During his tenure in my office, he led the charge in introducing the  Gerald's Law Act. This critical initiative would expand the Department  of Veterans Affairs burial benefits eligibility to terminally ill  veterans who pass away at a non-VA facility while receiving hospice  care. As he is soon to be promoted to the rank of chief master  sergeant, Josh's character and consistent display of knowledge,  leadership, and devotion deserve to be recognized and rewarded. I am  confident he will continue to serve our country honorably.  [[Page S5635]]    I am incredibly grateful for his support on behalf of the people of  Arkansas. Both in the Nation's Capital and while visiting the Natural  State, he spoke with and listened to the concerns of Arkansas's  veterans and their families. While stationed at the Little Rock Air  Force Base, Josh worked tirelessly to ensure the concerns of our  veterans and military community were heard and their issues were  resolved. We have been very fortunate to have Josh serve Arkansans as a  legislative defense fellow. I also want to thank his wife Mrs. Shauntai  Leonard and his beloved children Josiah, Lincy, and Kayla for their  support during his time in uniform. Growing up in a military family, I  understand that service in the Armed Forces is a family affair and  impossible without their sacrifice and unconditional support.   Josh, thank you for your continued service to the U.S. Air Force and  all your heartfelt, committed work as a member of my staff. Having you  on my team has been a privilege, and you will always be welcomed here.  I know that you will remain an asset to our military and veterans in  addition to any other endeavors you pursue; I wish you and your family  the best and congratulate you on this well-deserved promotion.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Arkansas  Farm Bureau president, Mr. Rich Hillman, and the integral role he has  had in serving the State of Arkansas and her agricultural pursuits and  to celebrate his years of fervent dedication and leadership as his  tenure at the helm of the organization comes to a close.   For the past 4 years, Rich has served faithfully as the Arkansas Farm  Bureau State president, preceded by 11 years as vice president, and  prior involvement on the Arkansas Farm Bureau board of directors dating  back to 2001. His influence on the industry is further proven through  his service in a number of leadership positions on the national and  State levels and especially in his local community.   For more than 20 years, farm families and rural communities across  the Natural State have welcomed Rich's leadership with gratitude and  depended on him to be a true advocate of their needs. They have relied  on him to ensure that policies developed in Washington will benefit  farmers and ranchers and the communities that surround them.   Rich's leadership has been marked by wisdom gained through  experience. To lead by example is a trait worthy of admiration and one  that Rich has undoubtably exemplified. He is a proud sixth-generation  farmer in Lonoke County, where he and his wife Tina have grown rice,  soybeans, corn, and most importantly, a capable and passionate seventh- generation of agriculturalists in their children Collin and Caroline;  their grandchildren; and generations to come.   It is because of people like Rich that I remain hopeful for the  future of agriculture. His pragmatic advice has long been paramount in  informing our work on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition,  [[Page S5636]]  and Forestry Committee and been instrumental in crafting important  legislation to support Arkansas agriculture.   I cherish the friendship and counsel I have found in Rich and wish to  thank him again for his unwavering dedication to Arkansas's  agricultural producers. Though he is stepping down from his role as  Arkansas Farm Bureau State president, I know that he will continue to  be a fierce advocate for the needs of the industry.   I wish Rich, Tina, and the Hillman family the best as they enter into  this new chapter of their lives.                            ____________________
