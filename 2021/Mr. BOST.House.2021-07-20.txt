 Madam Speaker, as a father of three and a grandfather of  11, I know what the love of family feels like and how we love our  children and when that child takes its first breath.   For over 40 years, the Hyde Amendment has prohibited taxpayer dollars  from being used to fund abortion. Both Republicans and Democrats have  supported it. However, President Biden's budget plan will remove this  vitally important protection. That is why I am proud to cosponsor H.R.  18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full  Disclosure Act.   This bill will make the Hyde Amendment permanent. Today, tomorrow,  and every day, I am proud to stand for life.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18 and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
