 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  the life and legacy of Ruth Cox Mizell, a staple figure in the  religious life of this Capitol for decades.   Ruth served as campaign chair for George H.W. Bush, adviser to the  U.S. Peace Corps under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan,  liaison for the Capitol Hill Prayer Partners, and was the spouse of  Congressman Wilmer Mizell.   She used her positions in and around the Capitol to passionately  advocate for the power of Scripture and prayer on a personal and  national level.   Many bible studies and prayer groups take place on Capitol Hill and  are attended by a great number of my colleagues in Congress. And these  groups honor Ruth's legacy and serve as a reminder that faith is still  alive in our Nation and certainly our Nation's Capitol.   I will end with Ruth's favorite scripture quote from Lamentations,  chapter 3, verses 22 and 23: ``The steadfast love of the Lord never  ceases, His mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning;  great is thy faithfulness.''   Ruth Mizell was a strong woman of faith and rests in the loving arms  and comfort of her Savior.                            ____________________
