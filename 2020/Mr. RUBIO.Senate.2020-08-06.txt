 Mr. President, I pay tribute to the memory of Ben  Hill Griffin, III, a lifelong resident of Polk County who left a  lasting impact on Florida and the citrus industry.   Ben Hill Griffin, III, was born on March 3, 1942, in Frostproof, FL,  to Ben Hill Griffin, Jr., and his wife, Frances. The only son of five  children, Ben Hill worked his father's cattle ranches and citrus fields  at a young age, learning early that success requires hard work and long  hours.   While attending Frostproof High School, Ben Hill played several  sports and attended Boys' State, where he was fittingly elected  commissioner of agriculture. After graduation, he attended the  University of Florida before returning home to Frostproof.   Ben Hill spent a year at the Lake Alfred Experiment Station, gaining  experience with various aspects of the citrus industry before joining  his father's business. He spent a year and a half working in the  fertilizer division, 3 years in the harvesting division, and 2 years in  the processing and sales divisions. After paying his dues, his father  welcomed him into Ben Hill Griffin, Inc., naming him president and  chief operating officer. He would later serve as its chairman of the  board and chief executive officer.   Throughout his career, Ben Hill was recognized as a thoughtful leader  and savvy businessman within the Florida agricultural and citrus  industries and statewide business communities. He was elected to  numerous corporate boards, served in leadership positions and they  became better companies under his leadership.   During his time as chairman of the Florida Citrus Commission, Ben  Hill flew to New York to defend the State from negative media coverage.  He succeeded in his efforts to have processed products branded with the  Florida symbol and was inducted into the Florida Citrus Hall of Fame in  2009, the Florida Agriculture Hall of Fame in 2010, and the Frostproof  High School Hall of Fame in 2010. Even in the face of the challenges  before the industry, he continued to invest in Florida citrus and  believed in Florida agriculture and her producers.   Ben Hill was also a benefactor of higher education, including the  University of Florida and Florida Gulf Coast University, of which he  donated the land for the university's construction. He served as a  board member for both  [[Page S5265]]  university's foundations. He was steadfast in ensuring scholarships  were available at numerous Florida institutions to help students  attending college to use the opportunity to fulfill their dreams.   My wife Jeanette and I express our heartfelt condolences to his  children and grandchildren on the loss of an important leader and great  Floridian. May God bless his family during this time of sorrow.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Sheryl Avery, the  Liberty County Teacher of the Year from Liberty County High School in  Bristol, FL.   Sheryl believes that being a teacher means understanding her students  will eventually become leaders of our society. Her lifelong goal is to  seek opportunities to change the world, which she believes can be done  from the classroom.   Sheryl believes that writing is an important skill. It is a skill  that all students need to know, not just for school, but for when they  join the workforce. She is a published author with three works in print  and enjoys writing in her spare time.   Sheryl teaches English for ninth and tenth graders at Liberty County  High School. She has worked as an educator for 21 years, with 19 years  in the Liberty County School System. She earned her bachelor's degree  in English and ESOL from Armstrong Atlantic State University, her  master's degree in curriculum and instruction from Georgia Southern  University, and is currently studying for her doctorate degree in  theology from South University.   I extend my best wishes to Sheryl on her more than two decades of  teaching students. I look forward to hearing of her continued good work  in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Kerrianne Edwards,  the Jackson County Teacher of the Year from Sneads Elementary School in  Sneads, FL.   Kerrianne comes from a family of teachers. Her parents were teachers  and played a pivotal role in encouraging her to make the profession her  career. Kerrianne teaches at the same elementary school that she  attended, and her classroom is located directly across from Sherry  Faircloth, the same first grade teacher that taught her and her son.  She considers Mrs. Faircloth an excellent role model and continues to  teach her long after she was her student.   Kerrianne is a first grade teacher at Sneads Elementary School and  has been a teacher for 28 years. She previously was a librarian, K-3  teacher, and a second grade teacher at Chattahoochee Elementary School  and was named its Teacher of the Year in 2000.

Tonie knew she wanted to be a teacher from a young age, crediting God  for placing a love for teaching in her heart. She brings a positive  attitude and patience to her classroom each day, knowing that some of  her students see her more than they see their parents.   Tonie considers it her job to love and cheer for her students, wipe  away their tears, and open the doors of learning to them. She does not  know what her students go through before coming to class each day, so  she shows them kindness and instills in them a ``never give up''  attitude, no matter how challenging the day may be for them.   Tonie is a kindergarten teacher at West Glades School. She is a  graduate of Palm Beach Atlantic University and credits its school of  education and behavioral studies for preparing her to be a teacher. She  previously taught in kindergarten classrooms at Frontier Elementary  School and Jupiter Christian School.

Harn,  the Hendry County Teacher of the Year from Clewiston High School in  Clewiston, FL.   Leslie's goal each day is to make his classroom one where students  enjoy learning. He spends the school day helping students to better  understand science and other challenges that life has thrown at them.  Leslie credits his seventh grade science teacher, Mr. Bowdler, with  having a huge impact on him and hopes to have the same effect on his  students' lives.   Leslie's biggest inspiration for teaching comes from his faith and  his family. His father was an orange grove manager, and his mother  drove a school bus. Both instilled in him a strong work ethic and  desire to help others whenever possible. In his family, three are  educators, and the fourth is in college with plans to pursue education.   Leslie teaches biology at Clewiston High School and previously taught  in Collier County. He and his wife are members of Caloosa Baptist  Church and work to help families throughout the area.   I am grateful for Leslie's commitment to his students and extend my  best wishes.

Miranda teaches fourth grade at Brooker Elementary School and  considers this award the culmination of the educational career she  began 14 years ago. Miranda wants her students to know that she cares  about their education. Since she cannot know what burdens they are  going through at home, she works to make sure school is a safe and  caring place for them, whether they are in her classroom or with  another teacher. She uses testing data to identify her students'  strengths and weaknesses and builds her lesson plans to fit their  individual needs.   Miranda uses humor and motivational activities to keep her students  engaged throughout the school year. Her class votes on a Student of the  Month and chooses rewards and consequences. She also hosts a Monday  Math Club for her top students and afterschool sessions on Wednesdays  and Thursdays for those below their grade level on State exams or on  the bubble between passing and not passing.   I offer my sincere gratitude to Miranda for her good work and  dedication to her students. I look forward to hearing of her continued  success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize  Vincent Miller, the Polk County Teacher of the Year from Winter Haven  High School in Winter Haven, FL.   Vincent believes as teachers enter their classrooms, they should ask  themselves a few simple questions: What will they add to their  students' lives? What class memories will students remember? How will  they, themselves, be remembered by students?   He says teachers should be intentional with their approach to meeting  students' needs, knowing students are more than just a score or a test;  they are the future. Vincent credits his successes today to his former  teachers for creating countless memories when he was a student. Being  cast by one teacher for a school play changed his life, allowing him to  travel the world and perform on cruise ships before becoming a teacher  at his alma mater.   Vincent is a math teacher and the girls' basketball coach at Winter  Haven High School. He also mentors students, provides afterschool  tutoring lessons, hosts a back-to-school supplies event, and sponsors  the Key Club and the Culture Club. Vincent holds a doctorate  [[Page S5266]]  degree in education from Lynn University and is an adjunct professor at  Southeastern University.   I offer my sincere gratitude to Vincent for his commitment to  teaching. I look forward to hearing of his continued success in the  years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Pamela Moseley,  the Lafayette County Teacher of the Year from Lafayette Elementary  School in Mayo, FL.   Pamela was presented with this important recognition by Lafayette  Elementary School's principal, Stephen Clark, and Superintendent Robby  Edwards. They were accompanied by her husband, Ralee, and their three  children, Lilli, Mallory, and Trevor. During these unprecedented times,  Pamela's inspiration comes from her students, their reactions to  connections, and their willingness to look for them.   Pamela's ability to adapt her education style to her students ensures  they are able to learn at their personal pace. She is always there for  her students, providing extra tutoring if they are having trouble  learning new subjects.   Pamela has been a teacher for 17 years and has taught fifth grade at  Lafayette Elementary School for the past 4 years.

Sallie always wanted to make a difference in the lives of children.  If she is able to do that each day, it makes her want to come to school  and work with a smile on her face. Her students describe her as a great  teacher, and they appreciate her help in understanding what they are  reading.   Sallie teaches third grade at Greensboro Elementary School.

She tutors  students during lunch and after school and provides them with  incentives and rewards to celebrate their accomplishments, believing  this helps to make her instructions more effective.   Melissa teaches eighth grade algebra at Allapattah Flats K-8 and  previously worked as a data specialist.

She enjoys seeing what her students can  achieve after leaving her class.   Trikia makes sure each minute of class time is worthwhile to her  students.
