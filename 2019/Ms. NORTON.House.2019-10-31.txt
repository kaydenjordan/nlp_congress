 Madam Speaker, with the impeachment inquiry vote, the  House made history today, but the Washington Nationals made  unprecedented history just last night.   Our D.C. Nats won the World Series for the very first time in  American history. Our Nats were the underdogs throughout the series,  just like their hometown, the District of Columbia, has been for 218  years.   But hold on, America. We are about to make it a double: Nats' victory  last night; House passage of H.R. 51, the D.C. statehood bill, during  the 116th Congress.   Watch for how I make my friend, Sheila Jackson Lee, pay up on our bet  against the Houston Astros.   Go Nats! Long live D.C. statehood!                            ____________________
