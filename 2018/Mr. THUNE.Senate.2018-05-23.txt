 Mr. President, today I recognize Grenville, SD. The  town of Grenville will be celebrating its centennial on June 8 through  June 10, 2018. Grenville will host centennial events which include a  parade, street dances, a softball tournament, raffles, a pig roast,  children events, and much more.   Grenville, located in Day County, was given the christened name of  Zielona Gora, meaning ``green hills,'' which is an accurate description  of the area's beautiful sloping hills and majestic landscape. Since its  founding 100 years ago, the community of Grenville remains resilient in  upholding South Dakota values. Today the robust traditions passed down  by determined settlers continue to endure throughout the Grenville  community.   I offer my congratulations to the citizens of Grenville on their  centennial celebration and wish them continued prosperity in the years  to come.
