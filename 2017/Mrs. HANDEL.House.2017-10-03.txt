 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 548, I call up  [[Page H7713]]  the bill (H.R. 36) to amend title 18, United States Code, to protect  pain-capable unborn children, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 36         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Pain-Capable Unborn Child       Protection Act''.       SEC. 2. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF                     CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY FOR ENACTMENT.         Congress finds and declares the following:        (1) Pain receptors (nociceptors) are present throughout the       unborn child's entire body and nerves link these receptors to       the brain's thalamus and subcortical plate by no later than       20 weeks after fertilization.        (2) By 8 weeks after fertilization, the unborn child reacts       to touch. After 20 weeks, the unborn child reacts to stimuli       that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult       human, for example, by recoiling.        (3) In the unborn child, application of such painful       stimuli is associated with significant increases in stress       hormones known as the stress response.        (4) Subjection to such painful stimuli is associated with       long-term harmful neurodevelopmental effects, such as altered       pain sensitivity and, possibly, emotional, behavioral, and       learning disabilities later in life.        (5) For the purposes of surgery on unborn children, fetal       anesthesia is routinely administered and is associated with a       decrease in stress hormones compared to their level when       painful stimuli are applied without such anesthesia. In the       United States, surgery of this type is being performed by 20       weeks after fertilization and earlier in specialized units       affiliated with children's hospitals.        (6) The position, asserted by some physicians, that the       unborn child is incapable of experiencing pain until a point       later in pregnancy than 20 weeks after fertilization       predominately rests on the assumption that the ability to       experience pain depends on the cerebral cortex and requires       nerve connections between the thalamus and the cortex.       However, recent medical research and analysis, especially       since 2007, provides strong evidence for the conclusion that       a functioning cortex is not necessary to experience pain.        (7) Substantial evidence indicates that children born       missing the bulk of the cerebral cortex, those with       hydranencephaly, nevertheless experience pain.        (8) In adult humans and in animals, stimulation or ablation       of the cerebral cortex does not alter pain perception, while       stimulation or ablation of the thalamus does.        (9) Substantial evidence indicates that structures used for       pain processing in early development differ from those of       adults, using different neural elements available at specific       times during development, such as the subcortical plate, to       fulfill the role of pain processing.        (10) The position, asserted by some commentators, that the       unborn child remains in a coma-like sleep state that       precludes the unborn child experiencing pain is inconsistent       with the documented reaction of unborn children to painful       stimuli and with the experience of fetal surgeons who have       found it necessary to sedate the unborn child with anesthesia       to prevent the unborn child from engaging in vigorous       movement in reaction to invasive surgery.        (11) Consequently, there is substantial medical evidence       that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain at least       by 20 weeks after fertilization, if not earlier.        (12) It is the purpose of the Congress to assert a       compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of       unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical       evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain.        (13) The compelling governmental interest in protecting the       lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial       medical evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling       pain is intended to be separate from and independent of the       compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of       unborn children from the stage of viability, and neither       governmental interest is intended to replace the other.        (14) Congress has authority to extend protection to pain-      capable unborn children under the Supreme Court's Commerce       Clause precedents and under the Constitution's grants of       powers to Congress under the Equal Protection, Due Process,       and Enforcement Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.       SEC. 3. PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 548, the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. Handel) and the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Conyers) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Georgia.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 36.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 36.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable  Unborn Child Protection Act, also known as Micah's Law.   This bill prohibits most elective abortions at 20 weeks after  fertilization and thereafter. That is the beginning of the fifth month  of pregnancy. That is the point in a pregnancy when a substantial body  of medical evidence shows that a baby in the womb can feel pain.   H.R. 36 is humane legislation for innocent babies and for mothers. It  includes exceptions for the life of the mother and exceptions in the  case of rape and incest. Additionally, this bill imposes criminal  liability only on the medical professional performing that abortion,  not on the mother.   Mr. Speaker, there is broad consensus within the medical community  babies at 5 months in the womb are not only able to feel pain, they can  hear music. They can even respond to human voices.   America is one of only seven countries in the world that still allows  elective late-term abortions, joining North Korea and China.   Today, we understand so much more about a baby's development during a  pregnancy. Voluntarily terminating the life of an innocent baby when we  know that baby can feel pain can no longer be acceptable, and a  majority of Americans agree.   Hearts and minds are changing. How many of us have marveled at the  vivid sonogram images of a soon-to-be-born son, niece, or grandchild?  How many of us have been amazed and so very grateful that babies born  early, as early as 20 weeks, have a very real chance of survival?                                time  1600    Mr. Speaker, this bill reflects today's medical understanding about a  baby's ability to feel pain. Micah's Law reflects those changing hearts  and minds of Americans. Micah's Law reflects the higher aspirations of  this Nation, a truly moral nation, to foster a culture of life.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 36.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Georgia for her leadership on this legislation, and I rise to support  life.   Madam Speaker, this is about the values that define us as Americans.  We see the potential in every life, and that includes the unborn. The  Micah Act is life-affirming legislation that shows compassion for the  baby and the mom.   Ten years ago, I received tough news that our son had Down syndrome,  an extra 21st chromosome. The doctors told us it would be a long road  ahead.   Today, I see more clearly. Too often others try to define a baby's  future before they are even born. Part of being an American is not  letting others define us.   I look at our son, Cole, and I see a healthy 10-year-old working his  way through fifth grade. His life is different than we imagined--in a  good way. He lights up a room. People are drawn to him. He plays sports  and is in Cub Scouts. He is living a full life with huge potential.    Madam Speaker, I am proud to support this legislation that reflects  our values and protects the sanctity of life, and I urge my colleagues  to do the same.

Madam Speaker, last week I had the pleasure of meeting  a young boy named Micah Pickering. He was cute and shy and, you know,  as young boys often are, he would give me a high five, play around and  run to where everybody had to catch him.   Now, he gave me this bracelet. You see, it says: ``Miracles for  Micah.'' And you know what? He is a miracle. He is strong. He was born  prematurely at only 20 weeks. He spent the first 128 days of his life  in a neonatal intensive care unit.   Though he could fit in the palm of your hand, his parents couldn't  hold him at first. His skin was so sensitive, the slightest touch would  cause little Micah intensive pain. It didn't matter where he was. If he  was in that intensive care unit, or if he was still waiting for that  expected date to be born, he could feel, and he wanted to live.   The fact is that children at 20 weeks feel pain. Science increasingly  shows it. The European Journal of Anesthesiology describes how it is  critical to administer anesthesia during fetal surgery procedures.   You know, a standard text on human development, Patten's Foundations  of Embryology, shows how the basics of the nervous system are formed by  week 4.   Dr. Ronald Brusseau, of Boston's Children's Hospital, wrote that by  week 18, children have developed sensory receptors for pain.   Two independent studies in 2006 used brain scans and showed unborn  children respond to pain. These children have noses, eyes, and ears.  You can hear their heartbeats and feel them move. They are human.   The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act--I like to call it  Micah's Law--is called what it is because children like Micah feel  pain. Those children are strong, just like Micah is strong, and those  children should be protected.   Now, I have to admit, Madam Speaker, across the aisle I do hear some  beautiful speeches filled with compassion for the voiceless, the  defenseless, and the marginalized. They are trying to speak for those  who can't speak for themselves.   But what about Micah? What about the thousands of others like him,  the same age he was born? What about the millions who were never given  a chance?   Look into Micah's face--I think we all should--and tell me he isn't  human. Look at him when he was born and tell me that child doesn't have  a right to live.   We should care for the voiceless, for those whose cries of pain are  never heard. We should care for the defenseless, for those who will  only be saved if we act to protect them.   We should care for the marginalized, for those who have their very  humanity denied, even as their noses, eyes, ears, and heartbeats, every  movement are visible testaments of their lives.   These children need love. Their mothers need love. Let's end the  pain. These children are suffering, so let's end the pain. These  children want to live, so let's end their pain.   Micah is a beautiful kid, and there are millions of Micahs who will  never smile; Micahs who will never walk; Micahs who will never scrape  their knees and get into trouble; Micahs who will never learn to read;  Micahs who will never fall in love and have children of their own;  Micahs who will never have the chance to tell their mother and father:  ``I love you.''   We will never know those Micahs. Our lives are poorer because their  lives were cut short. But there are more. Instead of pain--instead of  pain--we should fill them with love.                                time  1645     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Smith).   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, a former abortionist, Dr.  Levatino testified before Congress and described how he and other  abortionists actually kill helpless babies. He killed 1,200 of them. He  said: ``Imagine, if you can, that you are a pro-choice OB-GYN like I  was. Using a Sopher 13-inch clamp with rows of ridges or teeth, grasp  anything you can inside the womb. Once you grasp something inside,  squeeze on the clamp, set the jaws and pull hard--really hard. You feel  something let go, and out pops a fully formed leg about 6 inches long.  [[Page H7720]]  Reach in again and grasp anything you can, and out pops an arm. Reach  in again, and again, and again with the clamp, and tear out the spine,  the intestines, the heart and lungs.''   Even if pain wasn't present, Madam Speaker, dismembering a child is  violence against children, and it is inhumane. But these babies  actually suffer excruciating pain during the abortion.   Dr. Colleen Malloy from Northwestern University has said: ``In  today's medical arena, we resuscitate patients at 20 weeks and are able  to witness their ex-utero growth. I could never imagine subjecting my  tiny patients to horrific procedures such as those that involve limb  detachment.''   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 36.   Overwhelming majorities of Americans--some 60-64% according to  pollsters--support legal protection for pain-capable unborn children.   Today we know that unborn babies not only die but suffer excruciating  pain during dismemberment abortion--a cruelty that rips arms and legs  off a helpless child.   A former abortionist, Dr. Anthony Levatino, testified before Congress  that he had performed 1,200 abortions--over 100 late-term abortions up  to 24 weeks.   Dr. Levatino described what the abortionist actually does to the  helpless child. ``Imagine if you can that you are a pro-choice  obstetrician/gynecologist like I was.'' Using a Sopher 13'' clamp with  rows of ridges or teeth, ``grasp anything you can'' inside the womb.  ``Once you've grasped something inside, squeeze on the clamp to set the  jaws and pull hard--really hard. You feel something let go and out pops  a fully formed leg about six inches long. Reach in again and grasp  anything you can . . . and out pops an arm.'' He noted that ``a second  trimester D&E abortion is a blind procedure.'' He said, ``Reach in  again and again with that clamp and tear out the spine, intestines,  heart and lungs.''   Madam Speaker, even U.S. Supreme Court Justice Kennedy gets it. In  his dissent to the U.S. Supreme Court's 2000 Stenberg v Carhart  decision, Justice Kennedy observed that in D&E dismemberment abortions,  ``The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human adult or child would:  It bleeds to death as it is torn limb from limb. The fetus can be alive  at the beginning of the dismemberment process and can survive for a  time while its limbs are being torn off.'' Justice Kennedy added in the  Court's 2007 opinion in Gonzales v. Carhart that D&E abortions are  ``laden with the power to devalue human life . . .''   Even if pain wasn't present, dismembering a child is violence against  children and inhumane. But these babies actually suffer.   Dr. Robert White, professor of neurosurgery at Case Western Reserve  University said an unborn child at 20 weeks gestation ``is fully  capable of experiencing pain . . . without question, (abortion) is a  dreadfully painful experience . . .''   In an expert report prepared for the U.S. Justice Department, Dr.  Kanwaljeet S. Anand, a pediatrician specializing in the care of  critically ill newborns and children who has conducted intensive  research of pain and stress in the human newborn and fetus said: ``. .  .the human fetus possesses the ability to experience pain from 20 weeks  gestation, if not earlier, and the pain perceived by the fetus is  possibly more intense than that perceived by term newborns or older  children . . .'' Why? Dr. Anand points out that ``the highest density  of pain receptors per square inch of skin in human development occurs  in utero from 20 to 30 weeks gestation . . . Thus, a fetus at 20 to 32  weeks of gestation would experience a much more intense pain than older  infants or children or adults.''   Dr. Colleen Malloy, assistant professor, Division of Neonatology at  the Northwestern University, in her testimony before the House  Judiciary Committee said: ``When we speak of infants at 20 weeks post- fertilization we no longer have to rely on inferences or ultrasound  imagery, because such premature patients are kicking, moving and  reacting and developing right before our eyes in the neonatal intensive  care unit.''   Dr. Malloy went on to say, ``in today's medical arena, we resuscitate  patients at this age and are able to witness their ex-utero growth.''  She says ``I could never imagine subjecting my tiny patients to  horrific procedures such as those that involve limb detachment or  cardiac injection''   In an undercover video released by David Daleidan, a Planned  Parenthood Medical Director explains that before beginning a late  abortion she completes a clinical documentation form that says ``I  intend to utilize dismemberment techniques for this procedure.''   Notice the words--``dismemberment techniques''--in order to ``extract  the fetus in multiple parts.''   But seriously, we've known much of this for years. In 2006 I authored  the Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act that garnered 250 votes in favor-- including 40 Democrats--to 162 against. I remember thinking on the day  of the vote: ``how can anyone vote to refuse to make child pain  information part of informed consent?''   Congressman Trent Franks has authored four extraordinarily important  bills over the years to actually protect pain-capable babies in federal  law from the violence of abortion including Pain-Capable Unborn Child  Protection Acts that passed the House of Representatives in 2013 and  again in 2015. Tragically, President Obama vowed to veto this child  protection legislation and the Senate failed to even pass it. However,  should the House pass H.R. 36 today and if the Senate passes it as  well, President Trump has said he would sign it.   Not only will babies be protected by federal law at five months and  the pain suffered by these babies averted, but H.R. 36 requires that a  late abortion permitted under limited circumstances provide the ``best  opportunity for the unborn child to survive'' and that ``a second  physician trained in neonatal resuscitation'' be ``present and prepared  to provide care to a child'' to the same degree as the Born-Alive  Infants Protection Act of 2002.   Thus, ``any health care practitioner present at the time shall  humanely exercise the same degree of professional skill, care, and  diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as a reasonably  diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to a  child born alive at the same gestational age in the course of a natural  birth.''   Moreover, ``following the care required to be rendered . . . the  child born alive shall be immediately transported and admitted to the  hospital.''   Sixteen states have enacted pain-capable unborn child laws that  closely parallel the bill before us today. These include Ohio, Texas,  Nebraska, Idaho, Oklahoma, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Arkansas, North  Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wisconsin, South Carolina,  Kentucky and Kansas.   Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that my colleagues respect unborn  children as our nation's littlest patients who like any other patient  may need diagnosis and benign interventions to treat disability or  disease.   And preemies are surviving earlier and healthier as technology and  medical science advance. Micah Pickering is a healthy 5 year old today.  He was born prematurely at 20 weeks and was the size of this M&M candy  bag. Micah is the face of the pro-life movement. That is why the bill  before us today is ``Micah's Law.''   A recent study of nearly 5,000 babies published in the New England  Journal of Medicine confirmed that nearly a quarter of the premature  babies born at 22 weeks survived. (Let me note that the 22 weeks  gestational age referred to in the study is equivalent to 20 weeks  fetal age using the age dating system employed by H.R. 36).   Researchers at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) are  developing a technology that they hope--in a decade--will be the new  standard of care for extremely premature infants. Building a bridge  between the mother's womb and the outside world, the artificial wombs  provide a soft, sterile, fluid filled environment for the child to  continue to grow.   The babies we seek to protect from harm today may survive if treated  humanely, with expertise and compassion--not the cruelty of the  abortion.   Four years ago, Pennsylvania abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell was  convicted of murder, conspiracy to kill and involuntary manslaughter  and sentenced to life imprisonment.   Even though the news of Gosnell's child slaughter was largely  suppressed by the mainstream media, many of my colleagues may remember  that Dr. Gosnell operated a large Philadelphia abortion clinic where  women died and countless babies were dismembered or chemically  destroyed often by having their spinal cords snipped----all gruesome  procedures causing excruciating pain to the victim.   The Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, Micah's Law, is needed  now more than ever because there are Gosnells all over America,  dismembering and decapitating pain-capable babies for profit. The bill  protects kids from preventable pain--and death.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry).

Madam Speaker, we have heard many impassioned stories this afternoon.   Much has changed since Roe v. Wade was upheld in the 1970s. We have  made extraordinary medical advances. Today, we know with great  certainty that babies in the womb, starting at the fifth month of  pregnancy, do indeed feel pain.   It is extraordinarily heartbreaking when an unborn baby is diagnosed  with a severe and life-threatening abnormality, still that baby  deserves a right to life and right to dignity.   My sister was born with no esophagus and given little hope to live.  By the grace of God and a miracle, within just weeks of her birth, a  new technology, a new treatment came forward. Today, she is the proud  mother of my two nieces.   Madam Speaker, this is a good bill. It is a just bill. It is a moral  bill to do what we are called to do, not just as Americans but as human  beings: to protect lives of the most innocent.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support and urge every colleague to vote in  support of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
