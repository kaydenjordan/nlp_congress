 Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, it doesn't bring me pleasure to  claim the time in opposition to my good friend from Missouri, and he  knows how much I appreciate the work he has done on this matter.   The amendment is certainly, Mr. Chair, well intentioned, but as  currently drafted, I would argue that this language does more harm to  consumers than good.   Let me step back and say that, unrelated to Mr. Clay's amendment, I  introduced H.R. 4231, the Credit Access and Inclusion Act, which  expands consumers' access to credit by allowing them to use their rent,  utility, and telecom payments to help build their credit scores. In  other words, it would help more people have access to credit with those  additional facts.   As my friend noted, and as we have heard in our Task Force on  Financial Technology and in the Financial Services Committee's Consumer  Protection and Financial Institutions Subcommittee, additional data  allows millions more to have access to the credit they need.   This bill, the Credit Access and Inclusion Act, was introduced in the  114th Congress and the 115th Congress by my friend, former  Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota. I joined in the last  Congress with him and cosponsored it, and in the 116th, I have  introduced it.   So I find it interesting that in the last two Congresses, my bill was  the appropriate way to handle additional data, but in this Congress, it  is not.   Mr. Chair, I would also raise the point that there is a bipartisan  Senate companion to my bill introduced by Senators Scott and Manchin.                                time  1445    Furthermore, the language I have introduced was offered as an  amendment to this bill by Gwen Moore but was ruled out of order in the  Rules Committee.   As I have outlined, H.R. 4231, my legislation, has strong,  bipartisan, bicameral support. I believe Mr. Clay is trying to do  something similar with the text he has offered today. But in my view,  his version makes it more difficult for consumers to establish a credit  history which is underscored by the lack of bipartisan and bicameral  support for this text.   As drafted, Mr. Clay's amendment creates a new barrier because it  requires written consumer authorization before furnishing a customer's  payment information to a consumer reporting agency for a lease, for a  utility, or for a telecom service. This is in stark contrast with how  the current credit reporting methodology works.   This amendment requires consumers to opt-in to have their rental,  utility, or telecommunication payments included in their credit  reports. I believe that is a defective viewpoint.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I ask how much time remains.    Mr. Chair, let me thank Mr. Clay for his work  on this. Requiring an opt-in and excluding data that would not allow  lenders to get the full picture of a consumer's financial health, in my  view, makes it more difficult for consumers to access credit because  practically no rental, utility, or telecommunication companies would  actually furnish the Expanded Access program.   Therein lies the conundrum here. Therein lies the challenge with Mr.  Clay's approach compared to my approach. But it doesn't stop me from  [[Page H685]]  thanking my friend for his work on this. I know it is an area that we  share an interest in. I know that this area is keenly important to him.   However, this amendment, as it is currently drafted, I cannot support  it.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' But I hope my colleague would be  open to working together to finding a better solution that truly  benefits consumers, expands additional data, and allows people to offer  these products because it will qualify more credit-needy Americans for  badly needed credit.   I think in the case of Mr. Clay's approach, ``perfect is the enemy of  the good.'' I think we ought to work within the system that we have and  make it better. That is why I support my measure I have introduced in  the House and oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at  the desk.    I am, in its present form.    Madam Speaker, let me start by saying the  spirit of this bill is noble. Finding ways to ensure that all  Americans, no matter of race, creed, color, or ZIP Code, have access to  affordable credit is a noble pursuit. It is a top priority of the House  Financial Services Committee.   In fact, Madam Speaker, it is a personal priority. I have introduced  H.R. 4231 that has bipartisan and bicameral support. It facilitates the  use of additional data from rental, utility, and telecom payments to  help more Americans repair and build their credit score. Thousands more  would qualify and have better access to credit.   The reality is that, while this is an issue that faces all Americans,  it is communities of color that overwhelmingly face the greatest  obstacles when it comes to obtaining access to affordable credit.   Legislating is difficult. It requires good faith negotiation,  compromise, and a willingness to take a small degree of political risk  that occasionally makes our political lives a little more complicated.   Messaging, Madam Speaker, on the other hand, is easy. It only  requires the inherent power of the majority.   There was a bipartisan path that could have been taken, but today,  House Democrats chose to detour down the messaging-only path.   With a vote today, the majority is, sadly, seeking to socialize  credit, consumer credit ratings, and credit risk. This will jeopardize  access to credit for millions of low-income and moderate-income  families.   This legislation will inhibit lenders' ability to get the full  picture of a consumer's financial health, making risk more difficult to  assess. This ultimately increases the cost and decreases the  availability for our consumers.   The good news is, Madam Speaker, that Republicans will stand united  in opposition to a government takeover of our credit bureaus.   Today, the majority in Congress seeks to socialize our credit system  by having credit scoring and credit scoring models taken over by the  government, specifically, the unaccountable Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau. However, I hope that we can all come together on one  major principle.   My amendment will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. It  will ensure that we do not allow Federal agencies to pick winners and  losers based on political, religious, or other beliefs protected by our  Constitution.   Specifically, my friends, we need to ensure that the CFPB does not  exploit this newfound power and punish Americans based on their  heartfelt First Amendment rights. Simply put, my motion to recommit  will prohibit the CFPB from requiring credit scoring models from using  information related to Americans' political opinions, their religious  beliefs, or other expression that is protected by the First Amendment.   Let's make certain, my friends, that the United States Government  doesn't use the tactics now made so popular in Beijing.   In China, Madam Speaker, agencies are collecting enormous amounts of  data related to individual financing, social media accounts, health  records, and facial recognition. In China, my friends, now we have the  social score. It permits rewards and punishments based on each  individual's social score.   For example, if you have a higher social score, you might get a  discount on your monthly energy bill. If you have a lower score, you  might not be able to get on that train or airplane.   According to the Chinese Government, all social scores for 1.4  billion Chinese will be made publicly available this year.   American ideals go against everything the social credit system  represents. Supporting this MTR would ensure what is happening in China  will never happen in our country.   The CFPB has too much power, and we should make sure that Americans  do not lose access to credit based on the decisions of an unaccountable  organization. This unaccountable organization has a history of  overstepping its bounds.   As policymakers, we need to support measures that increase access to  affordable credit and increase accuracy and security of the consumer  credit information while remedying concerns about the existing system.   This legislation undermines the fundamental strengths of that credit  reporting system and makes it more difficult, more expensive, for  lenders to analyze the credit risk of our friends and neighbors across  this country.   The United States has the best financial system in the world. I urge  my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this motion to recommit; vote ``no''  on the underlying bill. Help maintain the United States as the most  competitive consumer finance system in the world. And I would urge my  friends, there is a right way to vote on this MTR and there is a Huawei  to vote on this MTR.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
