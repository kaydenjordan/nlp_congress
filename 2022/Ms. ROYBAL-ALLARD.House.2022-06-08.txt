 Madam Speaker, we have a gun epidemic which is  unique to America.   As a mother and grandmother, like the rest of the nation, I am  heartbroken by the horrifying killings of innocent Americans,  especially our children.   In 2021, homicides hit a 15 year high in Los Angeles. And this year,  according to the Los Angeles Police Department, people are being killed  at a faster pace than last year.   According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), in 2020, 45,222  people died from gun-related injuries. Of these, 19,384, died  violently.   These are not just numbers. They represent individuals whose lives  were cut short as a result of gun violence. They were moms, dads, sons,  and daughters. They belonged to a family, they were loved, and will  forever be missed.   They should be here today.   Mass shootings must not be an acceptable norm.   Changing our culture of gun violence will not happen overnight. We  must start the process now. There is no excuse for failing to try.   I urge my Republican colleagues to put partisan politics and special  interests aside and join us in support of this commonsense legislation  to help keep our children and fellow Americans safe.    Our thoughts and prayers are not enough if we fail to act and  continue to ignore the gun violence which forever shatters the hearts  of families across our nation.   Martin Luther King Jr., reminded us that ``the arc of the moral  universe is long, but it bends toward justice.''   To my Republican colleagues, you do not need more time. Americans  need you to bend towards justice now and help us to prevent another  Uvalde, another Buffalo, Tulsa, El Paso, Parkland, Sandy Hook, and  Columbine.   Enough is enough.   We must pass this legislation and the Senate must get it to the  President's desk, without delay.   I urge my colleagues to make our children's lives a priority and  support this commonsense legislation.
