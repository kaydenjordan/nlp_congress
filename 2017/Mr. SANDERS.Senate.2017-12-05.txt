 Mr. President, President Trump and the Republican  leadership, as we just heard, are talking every day on television, at  news conferences, telling the American people how this tax bill that  was passed here at 2 o'clock in the morning on Saturday--without any  hearings, with no serious debate--how this tax bill is designed to help  the middle class and how it was written for the middle class.   Unfortunately, I suspect that I will not shock too many Americans by  suggesting that what President Trump has been saying is not truthful.  This legislation, according to numerous independent studies, will  provide 62 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent--62 percent of  the benefits will go to the top 1 percent--while increasing taxes on 83  million middle-class households by the end of the decade. Why? The  reason is that the tax cuts for middle-class families expire by the end  of 2025, while the tax breaks for large corporations are made  permanent.   We are living in a moment in American history where we have an  unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality, where the top one- tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90  percent, where the top 1 percent owns almost twice as much wealth as  the bottom 90 percent, and, if you can believe it, where three of the  wealthiest people in this country--Mr. Gates, Mr. Bezos, and Mr.  Buffett--three people own more wealth than the bottom half of the  American population. That is where we are right now.   Yet, in the midst of this incredible level of income and wealth  inequality, my Republican colleagues believe that this is a moment when  62 percent of the benefits of so-called tax reform should go to the top  1 percent and 42 percent of the benefits should go to the top one-tenth  of 1 percent, while at the same time tens of millions of middle-class  families will end up paying more in taxes. How crazy is that? So we  have a situation in which the wealthy, who need tax breaks the least,  will benefit the most, and the working class and middle class of this  country, who need the most help, will benefit the least.   The President of the United States and my Republican colleagues tell  the American people that trickle-down economics--giving huge tax breaks  to the wealthy and large corporations--will expand the economy. We just  heard Senator Thune talking about that. They will create new jobs and  will bring in so much revenue that it will pay for the deficit it  creates.   Every independent expert who has taken a look at this tax bill has  said it will substantially increase the deficit, even after accounting  for the possibility of increased economic growth. The Joint Committee  on Taxation has told us that this bill will increase the deficit by  $1.4 trillion over the next decade. Why is that important?   First of all, it shows, if I may say, the hypocrisy of my Republican  colleagues who, year after year after year on this floor, lectured us  about the dangers of a $20 trillion national debt and growing deficits.  We heard this time and time again. But somehow, when it comes to the  need to provide tax breaks to billionaires, that concern about the  deficit seems to have disappeared.   Secondly and more immediately, there is no doubt in my mind that if  the Republicans are able to pass this bill, which will soon go to a  conference committee--this bill that gives huge tax breaks to the top 1  percent and raises the deficit by $1.4 trillion--there is no doubt in  my mind that they will suddenly rediscover their great concern about  deficits and the debt and move directly within the next few months to  begin the process of cutting programs desperately needed by the working  families of this country--the elderly, the children, the sick, and the  poor.   This is not just Bernie Sanders speculating. This is what the New  York Times said in a front-page article a few days ago:         As the tax cut legislation passed by the Senate early       Saturday hurtles toward final approval, Republicans are       preparing to use the swelling deficits made worse by the       package as a rationale to pursue their long-held vision:       undoing the entitlements of the New Deal and Great Society,       leaving government leaner and the safety net skimpier for       millions of Americans.        Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other Republicans are beginning to       express their big dreams publicly, vowing that next year they       will move on to changes in Medicare and Social Security.       President Trump told a Missouri rally last week, `We're going       to go into welfare reform.'    Let me take this opportunity to translate into English what phrases  like ``entitlement reform'' or ``welfare reform'' really mean. What  they mean in reality are massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare,  Medicaid, education, nutrition programs, affordable housing, and other  programs desperately needed by a declining middle class. It means that  after they pass this so-called tax reform bill, which would provide a  $200,000 tax break to CEOs who make over $16 million a year, they will  come back to the floor of the Senate and fight for cuts to Social  Security for senior citizens trying to survive on $12,000 or $13,000 a  year. So there are massive cuts for millionaires and billionaires in  their taxes at the same time as they want to cut Social Security,  Medicare, and Medicaid for struggling seniors.   ``Entitlement reform'' means that at a time when millions of seniors  are splitting their pills in half because they cannot afford the  outrageously high cost of prescription drugs, Republicans want massive  cuts to Medicare. It means that when two out of every three nursing  home residents in this country rely on Medicaid to pay for their long- term care, the Republicans want to make massive cuts to Medicaid.   We do not know exactly what form these cuts will take. I think that  is not yet clear. There has been discussion among Republicans about  raising the retirement age for Social Security to 70 years of age,  forcing older workers to work years more before they can get their  earned retirement benefits.    Maybe they will cut back on cost-of-living increases through a so- called Chained CPI--a new formulation that means lower benefits not  only for seniors but for millions of disabled veterans. They apparently  believe, for those of you on Social Security now, that the COLAs you  have been getting in recent years are just too high. That zero percent  increase you got a couple years ago? It is much too high; we have  [[Page S7834]]  to change the formula and lower benefit increases.   Maybe they will go back to their long-term dream of privatizing  Medicare and converting it into a voucher program, which will say to  the elderly in this country: Here is a check for $8,000. You go out and  find private insurance on your own. I would say good luck to any  elderly person in this country who is struggling with heart disease or  cancer. You see what kind of insurance program you are going to get  with a check for $8,000.   I would remind my colleagues that many of these proposals were  included in the budget resolution the Republicans voted for right here  on the floor of the Senate. This is not speculation; these are issues  and items that Republicans already voted for. They already voted for a  $1 trillion cut to Medicaid, which would throw some 15 million  Americans off of health insurance. They have already voted in the  budget to cut Medicare by $473 billion. In my view, the last thing we  should be doing is giving tax breaks to billionaires while cutting  programs for the most vulnerable people in our country.   During the campaign, Donald Trump, as a candidate, promised he would  not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. He made that promise  over and over again. I have some charts. Let me quote some of the  tweets and some of the things Donald Trump said on the campaign trail.   This is what he said: ``I was the first & only potential GOP  candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare &  Medicaid.''   On another occasion, he said:         I'm not a cutter. I'll probably be the only Republican that       doesn't want to cut Social Security.    That was January 24, 2015.         It's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way       it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is.    That was Donald Trump on March 10, 2016.   Here is another quote:         You know, Paul [Ryan] wants to knock out Social Security,       knock it down, way down. He wants to knock Medicare way down.       And, frankly--well, two things. Number one, you're going to       lose the election if you're going to do that. . . . Now, I       want to get rid of waste, fraud, and abuse. I want to do a       lot of things to it that are going to make it much better,       actually. But I'm not going to cut it, and I'm not going to       raise ages, and I'm not going to do all of the things that       they want to do. But they want to really cut it, and they       want to cut it very substantially, the Republicans, and I'm       not going to do that.    Before I go on to the next quote, I want to tell Donald Trump that,  as a candidate, man, he was exactly right. This is what he said on  March 29, 2016. He said that the Republicans wanted to cut Social  Security and Medicare and Medicaid.   Well, Candidate Trump, you were exactly right, because that is now  what we will see in a few weeks or a few months.   Another quote from Donald Trump as a candidate:         Social Security faces a problem: 77 million baby boomers       set to retire. Now, I know there are some Republicans who       would be just fine with allowing these programs to wither and       die on the vine. The way they see it, Social Security and       Medicare are wasteful `entitlement programs.' But people who       think this way need to rethink their position. It's not       unreasonable for people who paid into a system for decades to       expect to get their money's worth--that's not an       `entitlement,' that's honoring a deal.    Well, there it is. Candidate Donald Trump said over and over again  that he would not cut Social Security, that he would not cut Medicare,  that he would not cut Medicaid. In fact, quite correctly, he predicted  that the Republicans would try to do exactly that.   Now I would like to talk directly, if I might, to the President of  the United States.   Mr. President, on the campaign trail, over and over again, you said  that you would not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid. Today, I  am asking you nothing more than to keep your word. Don't lie to the  American people.   Millions of people voted for you because you said you would not cut  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Keep your word. Tell Senate  Leader McConnell and tell House Speaker Paul Ryan that you will veto  any legislation that cuts these programs.   With that, I yield the floor.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
