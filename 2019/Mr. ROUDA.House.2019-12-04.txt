 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  appreciate the opportunity to speak in strong support of the TRACED  Act.   The bipartisan provision I co-led with Representatives Clarke, Van  Drew,  [[Page H9243]]  Bilirakis, Foxx, and Walberg to address one-ring scams will make the  finances of vulnerable Americans--especially seniors--more secure and  the lives of all people in Orange County and across the country a  little more peaceful.   We can all agree that it is time to provide Americans with a greater  sense of security when it comes to our phones. We shouldn't have to  worry about unsolicited robocalls, and the vast array of tactics bad  actors are using to target our pocketbooks and our privacy.   This bicameral and bipartisan bill is a big step forward in combating  robocalls, and I am thankful for the bipartisan group of legislators  who reached across the aisle to protect Americans' bank accounts and  their sanity. I urge strong support of this bill.
