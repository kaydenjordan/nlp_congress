 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend and encourage the  thousands of great, noble North Carolinians participating in the 2018  March for Life this weekend.   We know from God's Word, the Holy Scriptures, that life begins at  conception. Unfortunately, since the Supreme Court decision of Roe v.  Wade, more than 59 million innocent lives have been terminated through  abortion. That is almost six times the population of North Carolina.   Without question, it is our moral obligation to fight for and protect  the lives of those who cannot speak for themselves, the talented and  able lives of those who are no different than our own.   Today and every day, I am honored to stand with those who so bravely  fight to protect the most vulnerable among us. With each passing day,  we shall continue to advance this very noble cause.                            ____________________
