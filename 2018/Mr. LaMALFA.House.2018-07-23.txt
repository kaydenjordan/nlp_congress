 Mr. Speaker, families who are veterans also sacrifice a  great deal when their loved ones have been deployed and even when they  come home. Current law, unfortunately, doesn't allow a spouse to be  recognized by the VA-provided grave marker after that spouse has passed  away.   Some veterans in the north State in my district recognized this issue  and brought it to my attention. The VA even requested this change in  this year's budget request. The budget requires a change in law by  Congress.   That is why I introduced the Honoring Veterans' Families Act in order  to correct this problem. Under the legislation, the VA will have the  ability to replace the marker of a veteran to add an inscription about  their spouse following the loss of that spouse.   Veterans certainly should have the option of including their spouse  on their own tombstone if they so choose. This is a bill that,  unfortunately, is needed to once again honor our veterans and the  sacrifices of their families. Let's hope we can pass it.                            ____________________
