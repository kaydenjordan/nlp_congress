 Mr. Speaker, for nearly four centuries Harvard has been  known for many great things: as America's first college, as the alma  mater of eight Presidents, as the most fertile of ground for new ideas  and cutting-edge research.   Yet now, in this moment, Harvard has become known for a truly  terrible thing--for anti-Semitism, for leading a 21st century American  resurgence of one of the world's most ancient and retrograde  prejudices. This is in large part because of the words and action, as  well as the silence and inaction of President Claudine Gay.   We have all now seen the shocking testimony from last week, but to  borrow a phrase from Dr. Gay, we need to also look at the context, the  context of Harvard having the very worst ranking in the entire country  for protecting free speech; the context of President Gay initially  refusing to condemn the Hamas terrorist attack and then refusing to  condemn the student groups that blamed Israel; the context of Harvard's  woefully inadequate measures to protect Jewish students both before  October 7 but especially after, to the point that at the hearing,  President Gay refused to even answer the question as to whether a  Jewish student can feel safe and welcome on her campus.   That Harvard has declined to remove President Gay, even after Penn  forced out its president, speaks volumes about the singular failures of  that university.   Yet, Harvard also offers a broader window into what ails higher  education in our country.   This is a moment of reckoning for American higher education. Our  universities cost too much, deliver too little value to graduates, and  have become the most intolerable places in American life.    Now is the time for fundamental change to reform the American  university, and this resolution is a first step.
