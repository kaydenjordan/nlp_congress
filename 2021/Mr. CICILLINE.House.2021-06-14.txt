 I thank Congresswoman Lee, our Speaker pro tempore,  for her longtime advocacy on this very important issue. Her leadership  on the fundamental question of the role of Congress in matters of war  has been unwavering, and we owe her a debt of gratitude for her  commitment to bringing this issue to the forefront.   Nearly two decades ago, Congress passed a resolution authorizing  military force against the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein. That  resolution was aided in its passage by deeply flawed intelligence that  we now know had no basis in fact.   It has been 18 years since Saddam Hussein was deposed. It has been a  decade since the United States declared a formal end to operations in  Iraq. The Iraqi Government is a regional partner, and the U.N. Security  Council resolutions referenced have been fulfilled.   There is no reason to allow the 2002 AUMF to stand. It does not  enhance our national security. It does not make Americans any safer. It  does not make the mission of our men and women in uniform any easier.   We must act so that Congress again asserts its responsibility in  authorizing war.   I urge my colleagues to adopt the rule and H.R. 256.   Again, I thank Congresswoman Lee for her extraordinary leadership.                                time  1730
