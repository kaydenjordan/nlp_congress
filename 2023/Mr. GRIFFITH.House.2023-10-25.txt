 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment is just plain common sense. It  addresses the importance of all types of research and development  funding at the Department of Energy, specifically the energy research  conducted at the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management at the  Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.   I believe we need a plan that is closer to parity between renewable  energy and fossil fuels and research on ways to reduce the  environmental and climate impact of the use of fossil fuels.   In the underlying bill, $2.994 billion is appropriated for energy  efficiency and renewable energy, while only $857.9 million is  appropriated for fossil energy and carbon mitigation. I am advocating  with this amendment that we should be closer to parity between the  amount of money appropriated for fossil energy and carbon mitigation  research and DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. My  amendment increases the fossil energy and carbon mitigation account by  $600 million, along with a reduction of $1.1 billion from the  renewables account.   This year alone, we have seen that these concepts that we are going  to get rid of fossil fuels are just not realistic, Mr. Chairman. We saw  a plant open up, or at least the plans for it, a Panasonic plant in  Kansas, that was going to do electric vehicle batteries. The problem  was, in order to get the plant, they needed more electricity. The  electric utility in Kansas, Evergy, decided that one of the coal-fired  power plants that they thought they were going to do away with, close  down, they needed to keep it open because they couldn't build electric  vehicle batteries without the fossil fuel, coal-powered plant.   This is not the only place that we see that. In India, there are  about 300 million people who don't have electricity, a little bit less  than the population of the United States. They don't have a steady  source of electricity. If you are a leader in India, Mr. Chairman, I  would submit, and you have coal, which they do, you are probably going  to build some coal-fired power plants because their people deserve and  want the same kind of electricity that we have in our country, at least  for now, so they are going to build coal-fired power plants.   China has been building coal-fired power plants left and right. Some  of the numbers indicate that the energy production of those plants is  equal to about two new plants every week last year. They are also  funding more coal-fired power plants in sub-Saharan Africa.   Here is what we have. While we want to clean up the environment, the  world is going to continue to use fossil fuels, particularly coal, not  just in the United States. People say we can be completely pure, but  that is myopic. We can't be because when we look at the air supply in  the world, according to a NASA study a few years back, it takes about  10 days for air to travel from the middle of the Gobi Desert in China  to the eastern shore of Virginia.   When all of these other places are using fossil fuels, isn't it smart  on our part, if we want a clean environment, Mr. Chairman, that we find  better ways to use that coal-fired power, that we find better ways to  use gas power? We are going to continue to use it whether we think we  are or not, and the rest of the world is going to continue to use it.   With the money we spend here, we can export that research and get  some of the money back maybe, but more importantly, we can clean up the  air for the entire world instead of thinking that we are living in some  kind of bubble in the United States and that if we get rid of coal- fired power plants and fossil fuel plants, everything is going to be  hunky-dory.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1900     Mr. Chairman, I say to my distinguished colleague and  my friend that we disagree, and here is why. We have to get to a point  where we are at parity. Every time we look at it, the money for  renewables is huge, and the money for fossil fuel research, where we  can make things better for the whole world, is minuscule in comparison.  I am trying to level it out, and I would hope that that would be the  long-term goal of our appropriators, to level it out. That is why I  brought this amendment.   I, too, am for all of the above. That is why I didn't zero out the  account. However, I think we have to pay attention to what is happening  in the world and not be myopic when it comes to recognizing that if we  are going to continue to use fossil fuels, we ought to do it cleaner  and do it better. We ought to put more money into U.S. research on  fossil fuels, everything from using fossil fuels to come up with rare  earth to making it cleaner when we burn it for electricity to build  electric vehicle battery plants.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
