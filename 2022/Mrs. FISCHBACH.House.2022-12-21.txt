 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), and the chair of the Rules Committee, for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, we are here to discuss the rule providing for  consideration of H.R. 9640 and S. 1942, bills that we were notified of  less than 2 hours ago.   The process leading up to this debate has been not just unacceptable,  but beneath this body. It seems the leadership of this Congress is  determined to disappoint us right up to the bitter end.   S. 1942, the National Heritage Area Act, establishes a national  heritage area system, attempting to standardize  [[Page H9969]]  the process for studying and establishing new national heritage areas.  This bill could likely go by suspension and enjoy support from Members  on both sides of the aisle.   Why we are called to meet on this bill with less than 2 hours' notice  that could otherwise go by suspension is beyond me and is indicative of  how this majority has run this body for the last 2 years.   H.R. 9640 is a supposed discussion draft, or at least described as  such by my colleagues in the majority, but it was introduced today. Not  last week, not a month ago, not even yesterday. It was introduced  today.   The bill supposedly justifies a legislative purpose required by the  Democrats' year-long crusade to weaponize the IRS to punish a political  opponent. It requires the release of Presidential tax returns by the  IRS and requires audits of returns submitted by such Presidents.   And that supposed discussion? Yesterday, the Ways and Means Committee  met and went into executive session to meet on releasing a report on  the IRS' mandatory audit program.   During the executive session, Republicans were told repeatedly that  the chair would not permit any amendments to be offered on the report.  Even though the committee was in executive session for approximately 5  hours, the chair abruptly reversed course and told the Members that  amendments would be available about 10 minutes prior to the final vote  on making these documents public. This left Members without options to  draft and offer amendments with any notice.    Democrats included multiple attachments to this report, one being a  discussion draft of the bill we are considering today. Democrat staff  told Republican committee staff that no exception on this legislation  would be considered before the end of the year. And we learned this  supposed discussion draft would be coming to the floor in a statement  by Speaker Pelosi.   Of course, as is this leadership's custom, this bill had no hearing  and no markup. To put it generously, this process has been a disaster,  but it is unfortunate how my colleagues have run this institution.   I would also note that the rule today deems an unvetted and  controversial resolution that reaffirms Federal preemption of State  laws regarding mail order abortion pills. This has never been  mentioned, but it is in this rule. Whether this Federal preemption was  ever affirmed is questionable, but whether this resolution actually  speaks for the body should be debated on the floor, not snuck in  through legislative smoke and mirrors.   Meanwhile, constituents in my district are struggling under the  crippling effects of inflation, diesel shortages, an increasingly  emboldened regulatory state, and a Democrat majority that continues to  focus punishment on their political opponents instead of the needs of  Americans. This is a shameful use of our time, and I look forward to  next year.   Madam Speaker, I oppose the rule and ask Members to do the same. I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   From beginning to end, this Democratic leadership has been in  disarray. It is pathetic to see them do anything they can to discuss  their favorite former President one last time before losing the  majority.   The bills we are debating today have gone through none of the  required processes, and Republicans have been given no time to provide  input. They have also added things that are highly controversial with  no discussion.   This is just the death throes of the Trump-obsessed soon-to-be  minority. I oppose this rule, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
