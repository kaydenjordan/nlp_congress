 Mr. Speaker, Orange County families are feeling the  squeeze of higher gas prices. As a single working mom, I share their  concern when I fill up my minivan. We can provide relief by holding oil  companies accountable.   These corporations are making record profits, the highest they have  been in over 7 years, even as Americans are struggling. And as the  price of crude oil falls, oil and gas companies have refused to pass on  savings to customers. Especially as Big Oil engages in profiteering,  they should not get our taxpayer dollars to line their pockets. Each  year, the industry receives roughly $650 billion in direct and indirect  subsidies, financed by taxpayers.   This week, I am leading an effort to bring legislation to the House  floor that ends these giveaways to a profitable industry and instead  puts these dollars toward helping families make ends meet.   Last week, I introduced the End Oil and Gas Tax Subsidies Act, which  would eliminate nearly a dozen longstanding egregious tax breaks to the  oil and gas industry. Healthy capitalism requires a level-playing  field. For far too long, Big Oil has manipulated the market in its  favor by lobbying Congress for sweetheart deals. Then, they raise  prices while simultaneously rewarding their executives with huge  bonuses.   Their record profits are proof that they can do without market- distorting government subsidies.   Eliminating these tax breaks would provide approximately $60 billion  in help to families feeling the squeeze. If my colleagues have the  political courage to stand up to Big Oil, we can quickly relieve the  pain that Americans feel at the pump. I am ready.                                time  1115                        Cracking Down on Porch Pirates     Mr. Speaker, porch pirates steal packages and make our  communities less safe. Over 1 in 3 Americans, myself included, have  been a victim of this theft, which costs us billions of dollars each  year.   I joined Democrats and Republicans to introduce the Porch Pirates  Act, which will crack down on this crime. This bipartisan bill expands  Federal protections for mail and parcels to cover deliveries from  private carriers.   Porch pirates are committing crimes of opportunity, and online  shopping--especially during the pandemic--has dramatically increased  these opportunities. I recently met with the Irvine police chief who  described to me how sophisticated these bad actors have become.   Our Porch Pirates Act modernizes Federal law and helps keep families  safe.                         Social Security is a Promise     Mr. Speaker, Social Security is a promise. It is a  promise that we make to older adults and disabled Americans, people who  count on our support.   One of Social Security's most important features--one not found in  traditional pensions--is that benefits automatically adjust for  inflation each year. The current level of adjustment isn't working. As  corporate profiteers drive inflation to new highs, people on Social  Security are not even treading water, they are sinking.   Democrats have a solution. The Social Security 2100 Act fixes the  inflation adjustment. It would put more money in the pocket of older  Americans and people with disabilities so they can afford higher  healthcare costs and other expenses.   It would also eliminate waiting periods for people with disabilities,  reducing disabled poverty. More than 200 Members of Congress support  this bill, and I am proud to be among them. By passing the Social  Security 2100 Act, we honor our promise to older Americans and disabled  Americans.                            ____________________
