 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment prohibits funds from being used  to provide for additional funding for national monument designations  under the Antiquities Act. The Antiquities Act, passed in 1906,  authorizes the President to singlehandedly designate any Federal public  lands as national monuments. Its creation was motivated by the looting  of Indian artifacts and archaeological sites dating back to the late  1800s.   While focusing on fixing a real issue of its day, the law was  carefully crafted to protect private citizens from government  overreach. The Antiquities Act designations should be done under, and I  quote directly from the legislation, ``the smallest area compatible  with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.''  Clearly, it was meant to be limited in scope.   Just like everything else, this administration and previous Democrat  administrations make it impossible for us to have nice things. Think  about this. In the 8 years that Joe Biden was Vice President under the  Obama administration, the Antiquities Act was weaponized for 550  million acres of land. That is roughly a quarter of the land by acreage  in the United States. That is a problem that goes beyond the scope and  intent of this act.  [[Page H5342]]    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I agree with my colleague on one point, that it  has been used, it has been overused, and it has been abused.   This is intended to protect historic sites that are being looted and  being damaged by whatever force is in play. To control, to take from  States and private citizens 550 million acres of land over an 8-year  period is not the intent of this act. It is clear that it no longer  serves its purpose and, quite frankly, if the President or Vice  President identifies an antiquity or area of land that needs  protection, they can come to Congress. If it is worthy of Congress'  designation, we can work with the administration, Republican or  Democrat.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2150     Mr. Chair, I ask for adoption of this amendment. We are at  a point in history that if any further monument needs designation, it  should come before Congress and have congressional approval.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment prohibits funds to be used by the  Environmental Protection Agency for the U.S. Global Change Research  Program, or the USGCRP.   This program coordinates with 13 different Federal departments and  agencies. Its focus as it relates to areas within EPA's jurisdiction is  to conduct research on climate change.   I think it is fair to say that the climate is changing, and we have a  role to play in it. However, there is a degree of climate alarmism in  this country that has compelled smooth-talking bureaucrats and their  grant-seeking associates in the private sector to grovel for more and  more funding.   At its core, climate alarmism is immoral. It is impacting industry  and business because people of power are telling Americans every day  that they are going to die unless they adopt these policies, and I  object.   I think more and more Americans are fed up with the subsidizing of  this agenda, of this alarmism. At a time of inflation and at a time  when the economy is struggling, it is time to stop.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I think part of the problem in this country is  that we tend to hold ourselves or the left tends to hold us to a  standard that is really unattainable. Meanwhile, our partners, like  China, are left to abuse the environment. They are the worst polluters  in the world or one of the worst polluters in the world, and they are  held to a different standard. This puts a burden on our industry.   It is climate alarmism, and this administration's agenda no longer  allows us to be energy independent. We are now dependent on our enemies  for precious metals and for gas and oil. We should be an energy- independent nation.   When we look at the crisis in this country with inflation and  economy, the fact that the American Dream of homeownership is slipping  away, it gets back to this alarmism. The fact that we are undermining  our oil and gas industry with ESG, this alarmism has made us no longer  energy independent.   If we are going to get out of this mess we are in with these  deficits, we have to grow our way out of it. When you look at  inflation, when you look at commodities, when you look at the price of  oil and gas, we have to move away from this alarmism and get back to  the facts.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, we may have had a hot summer, but I just went  trick-or-treating with my kids and the low that evening was 29 degrees,  so temperatures change. Temperatures have been changing for the  millennia.   That being said, it is this alarmism, this agenda, that stands in the  way of our energy independence.   If we were truly worried about the environment, if we truly wanted to  be energy independent, we would have modular nuclear reactors being  built all over this country. That is the future of electricity. That is  the future of the environment. That is the future of us being energy  independent. Meanwhile, this agenda blocks such types of projects.   It is time we admit the truth that they are making us more dependent  on our enemies. This amendment is a good amendment.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment prohibits the funds appropriated  by this act from being used to enforce any COVID-19 mask mandates. I  was fortunate enough to introduce this amendment during the Energy- Water appropriations, and I am happy to do so again here.   Policy involving mandatory mask implementation is not about safety  nor about science. It is about control. Let's be clear: Mask mandates  are about control.   Tom Jefferson, a leading epidemiologist who coauthored what The New  York Times Opinion section called ``the most rigorous and comprehensive  analysis of scientific studies conducted on the efficacy of masks for  reducing the spread of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19,''  found that there was no evidence that masks made any difference.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2200     Mr. Chairman, I go back to the study, and it found that  wearing a mask in public places makes little to no difference in the  number of infections.   For the folks on the other side who privately believe that masks  work, it should be noted that mask mandates include any type of mask,  even just your thin paper mask, but the study looked at N95 masks, the  gold standard of masks. You know what they found? It didn't make any  difference.   Even if you pair mask mandates with other preventative measures, such  as washing hands and social distancing, it found that none of it made a  difference.   Going on, Dr. Jefferson goes on to say that policymakers who imposed  mask mandates on Americans were convinced by nonrandomized studies and  flawed observations.   On the other hand, Dr. Jefferson and his colleagues analyzed 18  randomized control trials before reaching their conclusion. They looked  at science, not fear. They looked at science to seek a better outcome,  not seek control.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, to be clear, it was The New York Times. The  study was examined or authored with coauthors but, in particular, Dr.  Jefferson, and it looked at 18 different studies that used proper  scientific controls. By the way, if you are going to cite the WHO, you  are losing credibility with me.   Mr. Chairman, we have a choice between truth and science or fiction.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the Environmental Financial Advisory Board,  or the EFAB, was chartered under the 1972 Federal Advisory Committee  Act. The EFAB boasts of making recommendations that would supposedly  lower the cost of environmental protection.   Unfortunately, they are entirely beholden to the left's climate  alarmism agenda. In a November 2022 meeting, the EFAB spent taxpayer  resources gloating about the establishment of the Greenhouse Gas  Reduction Fund created from the so-called Inflation Reduction Act of  2022, a bill whose subsidies will cost the American taxpayers $1.2  trillion.                                time  2320    This de facto slush fund provides $27 billion to the EPA through  September 2024. If the argument here is that we need the EFAB to  expedite the rate at which the Biden administration can give out green  subsidies to his donor base, I submit to my colleagues that perhaps the  EFAB has outgrown its usefulness.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let's take a look at the eligible recipients  of this $27 billion boondoggle: State-sponsored green banks; nonprofit  or quasi-government green banks--so much for the free market, Mr.  Chairman--and nonprofit energy conservation funds and nonprofit social  funds, just to name a few. In other words, slush funds, Mr. Chairman.   If you look at the EFAB's charter, you will find that they provide  recommendations on ways the EPA can implement funding from the  infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act to support  environmental justice and to tackle the climate crisis, which is beyond  their original intent.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption at a time of inflation, at a  time when we are growing energy dependent on our enemies. It is time  that we cull back this alarmism. It is time that we cull back these  slush funds. It is time that we do the right thing and cut the budget.  Cut this nonsense.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, at a time of, again, increased dependency on  our enemies, my amendment addresses the royalty rates that were imposed  by the Biden administration through the Inflation Reduction Act of  2022. We can see today that it did nothing to reduce inflation but in  fact has increased inflation, taking away from many Americans their  dream of owning a home.   In order to pay for what ended up being approximately $1.2 trillion  in green subsidies, the Biden administration chose to raise the royalty  rate of onshore oil and gas leases from 12.5 percent to 16.6 percent  through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.   Democrats also voted in unison to quintuple the minimum bid amount  from $2 per acre to $10 per acre. They voted to increase the rental  rate by a factor of 9, from $1.50 to $15 per acre.   At the time of the bill's passage, estimates indicated the bill would  impose a $6.5 billion hike on oil and gas development.  [[Page H5354]]    Here is what I find to be one of the most remarkable things about the  so-called Inflation Reduction Act of 2022: Nowhere in that bill did  Democrats identify any government program worth cutting. Not one.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will point out that a $6.5 billion hike on  oil and gas development isn't going to decrease inflation. It increases  underlying costs.   When you look at commodities across sectors, everything has gone up-- food, oil, et cetera--because of things like this. Instead of saving  the American people money, this administration chose to surrender our  energy independence.   Again, I go back to the underlying cost of everything. Everything in  this room, everything in your kitchen, is dependent on oil, gas,  diesel. Everything in this country moves by that mechanism, so this so- called business-friendly idea has done nothing more than cripple our  oil and gas industry. It is contributing to inflation. The fact that it  is called the Inflation Reduction Act is offensive because it did  nothing.   They should admit their mistake and try to fix it. Instead, they go  on increasing costs to an industry that is the backbone of our country.  Again, for minerals, we are currently dependent on enemies. Oil and  gas, we are dependent on enemies.   Mr. Chairman, right now, oil prices are trading around $90 a barrel.  If the Hamas-instigated war against Israel continues or escalates, the  American people will endure the consequences of once again depending on  OPEC for our energy needs. Some estimates say that oil could go up to  $150.   Again, at a time of great inflation, we have to be taking steps to  roll back costs on our infrastructure, on oil and gas exploration.   I always make the comment in my townhalls that if you find oil and  gas in my yard, drill, baby, drill, because we need it. We need it for  our infrastructure. We need it for our independence. We need it for  national security.   It is about time we acknowledge the fact the Inflation Reduction Act  in 2022 was a scam that screwed America.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for wishing that I find  oil in my yard. I hope I do, but that being said, I joke.   Mr. Chairman, let me just say that this is a step in the right  direction to have a more responsible energy policy. It is lowering the  cost on the producers as they explore and continue to explore for our  energy independence.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
