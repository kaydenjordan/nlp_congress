 Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise  today to honor the memory and extraordinary life of an educator in  Bucks County, Pennsylvania, whose dedication of Pennsylvania's children  made her one of Pennsylvania's most prominent voices on education  advocacy, policy, and practices.   Dolores McCracken, who served as president of the Pennsylvania State  Education Association, passed away on November 13 following her  courageous battle with cancer. Dolores spent the past two decades as a  passionate activist for improved public education, working to promote  PSEA initiatives on the Federal, State, and local levels.   Dolores' professional contributions to Pennsylvania education are  impactful and incredibly far-reaching. She worked closely with numerous  statewide partners and served on the  [[Page H9543]]  board of directors at the Keystone Research Center, the Pennsylvania  Budget and Policy Center, and the Council Rock Education Foundation.  She also served as president of the Churchville Elementary Home and  School Association.   For Dolores, it always came down to improving the lives of our  community's children and their families. She firmly believed that every  child, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, deserves the  best education in the world.   A paralegal by trade, Dolores is survived by her husband, Jack Jr.;  her children, Jack III and Kristin; and her grandchildren, Dylan,  Reese, Paige, and Logan. May they take comfort in knowing Dolores' life  work will carry on in our students' lives for generations. Dolores  McCracken is our children's hero.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 6784  as this act will block vital protection for gray wolves across the  entire Nation, protections that were implemented under the Endangered  Species Act.   H.R. 6784 would direct the Secretary of the Interior to issue a rule  removing the gray wolf from the Endangered Species Act list, which  would preclude judicial review of agency decisions on wolf delisting  and deny citizens the right to hold the Government accountable for its  actions.   There is no mystery about the negative impact that passing this  legislation would have on the gray wolf, because we have already seen  it. In 2011, Congress used an appropriations rider to delist wolves in  Idaho and in Montana. And since 2011, over 2,500 wolves have been  killed in these two States where the management practices included  shooting wolves lured by bait, chasing wolves with packs of hounds,  using steel-jawed legholds, and using wire snare traps.   Given these concerns, Mr. Speaker, I oppose this legislation.  Endangered Species Act decisions must be made with caution. We should  also be extremely bipartisan in these approaches. And if there is  legitimate dispute over delisting, then delisting is premature and ill- advised. That is why I oppose this legislation.
