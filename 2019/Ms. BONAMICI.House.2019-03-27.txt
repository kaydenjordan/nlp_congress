 Madam Chair, today women make up nearly half of our  workforce. Sixty-four percent of mothers in the United States work  outside the home. Many are the sole family wage earner. Their wages pay  for rent, for groceries, for childcare, for healthcare. But even though  it is 2019, too often, equal pay for equal work is not a reality.   On average, White women earn 80 cents on the dollar compared with  White men in substantially equal jobs. The wage gap is even more  pronounced for women of color in nearly every line of work, regardless  of education, experience, occupation, industry, or job title.   This has severe and long-term consequences for the lives of working  women, families, and for our economy. With the Equal Pay Act, title VII  of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and more recently, the Lilly Ledbetter  Fair Pay Act, we have made some progress in reducing inequities for  women in the workplace. But, unfortunately, loopholes and insufficient  enforcement tools have allowed wage discrimination to persist.   For example, a lack of easily accessible data on hiring and wages has  made it difficult to detect, let alone prevent, wage discrimination.  And even when wage discrimination is discovered, working women face  significant barriers to fulfilling the heavy burden of proof for  holding discriminating employers accountable.   Last month, I was honored to chair the hearing on persistent, gender- based wage discrimination. We heard witnesses describe the barriers to  detecting wage discrimination and holding employers accountable. But  most importantly, we heard how the Paycheck Fairness Act will provide  workers with the tools they need to help close the gender pay gap and  achieve wage equality.   Several States have already acted to address pay inequities,  including bipartisan efforts in my home State of Oregon. It is time for  Congress to step up and address persistent wage discrimination  nationwide.   By passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, we have the opportunity to end  discriminatory pay practices that contribute to keeping women and  families in poverty. We have the opportunity to finally make equal pay  for equal work a reality.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record a letter from AARP outlining  support for the Paycheck Fairness Act because the bill will strengthen  financial security for women while in the workforce, and later enhance  retirement income security.                                                           AARP,                                     Washington, DC, March 26, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: On behalf of our       38 million members and all Americans age 50 and older, AARP       is writing to express our support for the Paycheck Fairness       Act (H.R. 7). This bill would strengthen financial security       for women both while in the workforce and later in       retirement, and it would provide an important protection for       all workers against age discrimination in hiring.        Pay discrimination against women jeopardizes their       financial security, both while working and in retirement. The       roughly 20 percent pay gap between women and men who work       full-time, year-round means women's median earnings are more       than $10,000 a year less than men's, with an even bigger       shortfall for women of color. Because all elements of       retirement income--Social Security, pensions, and savings--      are based on one's earnings while in the workforce, lower       earnings during women's work lives follow them into       retirement. As a result, women age 65 and older are 80       percent more likely than men to live below the poverty level       in retirement. By strengthening the law against pay       discrimination, H.R. 7 would help address women's lower pay       and lower incomes in retirement.        In addition, AARP supports the Paycheck Fairness Act's       provision on salary history. While asking about a job       applicant's prior salary history has long been recognized as       a barrier to equal pay it has also proven to be a barrier to       employment for older workers. A majority (56 percent) of all       older workers age 50 plus have been prematurely pushed out of       longtime jobs before they choose to retire. Once displaced,       older workers have great difficulty finding reemployment, and       most are unable to find a job with wages comparable to the       job they lost. It is quite common for prospective employers       to use a prior higher salary level to disqualify an older       applicant from consideration because they simply assume that       the worker will require the same wage. However, there are       many reasons why an older worker might be willing to accept a       lower salary, including better benefits or work hours; a more       desirable job/firm; a career change; or simply desperation to       find a new job. In these cases, the ability of the employer       to ask about and rely on salary history in considering an       older applicant often results in age discrimination in       hiring.        In conclusion, H.R. 7 will help prevent one of the age-      related assumptions that hinder equal opportunity for older       workers, as well as enhance retirement income security for       women. For these reasons, we urge support for the Paycheck       Fairness Act.            Sincerely,                                                  Nancy A. LeaMond,          Executive Vice President and Chief Advocacy & Engagement                                                            Officer.     Madam Chair, I also include in the Record a letter from  the AAUW in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act.                                                           AAUW,                                                     March 25, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than 170,000       members and supporters of the American Association of       University Women (AAUW), I urge you to vote in support of the       Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) and to oppose harmful       amendments when the bill comes to the House floor as soon as       this week. Despite federal and state equal pay laws, gender       pay gaps persist. The Paycheck Fairness Act offers a much       needed update to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by providing new       tools to battle these pervasive pay gaps and to challenge       discrimination.        In January, we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Lilly       Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. This vital law rectified the Supreme       Court's harmful decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &       Rubber Company. The law helps to ensure that individuals       subjected to unlawful compensation discrimination are able to       bring a case of ongoing pay discrimination regardless of when       it began. Despite the importance of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair       Pay Act, this law's enactment only restored decades of prior       law--it did not give women new tools to receive equal pay for       equal work.        There is no more fitting way to mark this historic       milestone than making real, concrete progress in ensuring all       women receive fair pay. While the gap has narrowed since       passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, progress has largely       stalled in recent years. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau       once again revealed that women working full-time, year-round       are typically paid only 80 cents for every dollar paid to       men. The pay gaps have grown even wider for women of color.       African American women and Latinas make, respectively, 61 and       53 cents on the dollar as compared to non-Hispanic, white       men. The overall pay gap has only decreased  [[Page H2852]]       by a nickel during the 21st century and, unless action is       taken, the pay gap between men's and women's earnings will       not close until 2106.        Research indicates that the gender pay gap develops very       early in women's careers. Controlling for factors known to       affect earnings, such as education and training, marital       status, and hours worked, research finds that college-      educated women still earn 7 percent less than men just one       year out of college. Over time, the gap compounds and widens,       impacting women's social security and retirement.        Ensuring that women have equal pay would have a dramatic       impact on families and the economy. Many companies have       already recognized the benefits and the power of women's       increased economic participation, and that is why business       groups like the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce and Main       Street Alliance have endorsed the Paycheck Fairness Act.       According to a 2017 report from Institute for Women's Policy       Research (IWPR), the poverty rate for all working women would       be cut in half, falling from 8.0 percent to 3.8 percent, if       women were paid the same as comparable men. The same study by       IWPR indicates that the U.S. economy would have produced an       additional $512.6 billion in income if women had received       equal pay for equal work. This is why I urge you to pass this       important bill.        The Paycheck Fairness Act would update and strengthen the       Equal Pay Act of 1963 to ensure that it provides effective       protection against sex-based pay discrimination in today's       workplace.        The bill takes several important steps, including:        Ensuring Non-Retaliation: The bill prohibits retaliation       against workers for discussing or disclosing wages. Without       the non-retaliation provisions of the Paycheck Fairness Act,       many women will continue to be silenced in the workplace--      that is, prohibited from talking about wages with coworkers       due to the fear of being fired. This is an issue that keeps       women--like it kept Lilly Ledbetter--from learning of pay       discrimination against them.        Prohibiting Use of Salary History: The bill prohibits       employers from relying on salary history in determining       future pay, so that prior pay discrimination doesn't follow       workers from job to job.        Ensuring Job-Relatedness: The bill closes loopholes that       have weakened the Equal Pay Act over time by ensuring that       disparities in pay are justified by a business necessity that       is related to the job.        Equalizing Remedies: The bill ensures women can receive the       same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that       are currently available to those subjected to discrimination       based on race and ethnicity.        Providing Additional Assistance and Resources: The bill       also provides technical assistance to businesses, requires       wage data collection, and supports salary negotiation skills       training programs to give workers the tools to advocate for       higher wages.        Providing a Small Business Exception: The Equal Pay Act and       the Fair Labor Standards Act have an exemption for small       businesses that generate less than $500,000 in annual       revenues a year, and the Paycheck Fairness Act would keep       that exemption intact. The bill would also support small       businesses with technical assistance.        The pay gap is persistent and can only be addressed if       women are armed with the tools necessary to challenge       discrimination against them, and employers are provided with       effective incentives and technical assistance to comply with       the law. I urge you to take a critical step towards achieving       pay equity by voting in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act       and opposing harmful amendments when the bill comes to the       House floor for a vote as soon as this week.        We urge you to stand with women and families and vote yes       on the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7). Cosponsorship and       votes associated with this bill and amendments may be scored       in the AAUW Action Fund Congressional Voting Record for the       116th Congress.            Sincerely,                                                 Deborah J. Vagins,                 Senior Vice President, Public Policy and Research.     Madam Chair, today, we have this opportunity. Let's  pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and make equal pay for equal work a  reality.
