 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the remarkable life  of an honorable patriot, the late Lois Bouton of Rogers, Arkansas. She  died recently at the age of 102.   Most know her lovingly as the Coast Guard Lady, but that nickname  didn't just stem from 20 years as a member of the U.S. Coast Guard  Auxiliary Flotilla on Beaver Lake in Arkansas. During World War II she  enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard Women's Reserve, where she acted as a  radio operator. She was discharged in 1945 from the SPARs. That is the  acronym reflecting the Coast Guard's motto: Semper Paratus-Always  Ready.   However, her passion for service never left. Lois made it a point to  visit with wounded and recovering military members, always taking  particular care to find her fellow Coasties. This was just the start of  her mission to uplift others. She tirelessly wrote over 100,000  handwritten letters to greet and encourage personnel. Her words have  crossed oceans and seas, reaching legions of Coast Guard members and  their families all over the world.   Her dedication earned her the rank of Honorary Master Chief Petty  Officer, Department of Defense Spirit of Hope Award, the U.S. Coast  Guard Distinguished Public Service Award, and more. But she always  maintained that her greatest accomplishment was the joy she helped  spread.   I want the Nation to know of this extraordinary American. Fair winds  and following seas to the beloved Coast Guard Lady from Arkansas.                            ____________________
