 Madam President, with only a few weeks to go until the  end of September, we have no time to waste when it comes to  appropriations. We had planned for the Senate to consider bipartisan  bills from the Appropriations Committee as soon as next week and make  significant headway before a partial interim continuing resolution  becomes necessary at the end of the month.   To this end, Democrats and Republicans in both the House and the  Senate, plus President Trump, formalized an agreement 1 month ago. It  set up funding levels to inform the appropriations process, and  everyone on both sides agreed there would be no poison pills, no  partisan wrenches thrown into the gears.   Unfortunately, yesterday brought some disturbing signals that  Democrats may be rethinking that commitment. New poison pills are  apparently being discussed. But everyone knows what we agreed to last  month. In fact, back on August 1, I asked consent to print the entire  terms sheet that everyone agreed to in the Record.   So I maintain hope that Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Leahy can  oversee a smooth process and that we can move all 12 appropriations  bills in a bipartisan fashion. Both sides have every reason to want a  smooth appropriations process to proceed as we had planned. I hope that  is exactly what happens in committee this week and on the floor soon  thereafter.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, as he departs the  position of National Security Advisor, I want to thank Ambassador John  Bolton for his many years of valuable service to our country.  Personally, I have always appreciated John's candor and clear advice.  He possesses something crucial--the ability to understand the world the  way it is. He knows that there are many threats to American interests  and that those threats will not recede if we retreat. He understands  that American leadership is essential to keeping these threats and  enemies at bay and that our partners and allies rarely act without us.   John appreciates the need to stand up to adversaries like Putin's  Russia, to approach them from a position of strength, and to hold them  accountable for their lies and their misdeeds.   I wish him well wherever his career next takes him.   Of course, the President deserves to choose his own team, and he has  assembled a strong one. He and our Nation are well served by leaders  such as Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Esper, and Director Haspel.   I hope the President selects a National Security Advisor who will  work well with these seasoned national security leaders who have been  chosen by the President and confirmed by the Senate.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another entirely different matter,  for 18 years today's date has held a tragic meaning. September 11 is a  day of mourning, a date stained by the terrorist murderers of so many  innocent people in New York, Arlington, and Pennsylvania. With each  passing day, the reality is still shocking, and the wounds are still  painful.   Each year we remember the innocent men, women, and children who lost  their lives: workers rushing to meetings, vacationers headed home,  emergency personnel whose quick response immortalized them as heroes.  Each year we honor the memories of the heroes who sacrificed their  lives to bring the perpetrators of this evil to justice and to prevent  similar attacks.   Our way of life was changed by 9/11. It changed our approach to  security. It awakened us to determined new enemies.   The dangers of radical Islamic terrorists remain real. Al-Qaida, its  enablers, and its allies still plot against America from Afghanistan  and Pakistan to Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Mali, and beyond. ISIS persists  in Iraq and Syria through an underground network of terrorists who have  not yet given up the fight. We cannot walk away from these dangers. We  must not leave our work undone.    Many nations have a stake in defeating the terrorists. NATO allies  have been with the United States since the early hours of this fight.  Eighteen years ago, this critical alliance invoked article V for the  first time.  [[Page S5415]]  Since then, many NATO partners have fought side by side with us in  Afghanistan, in Iraq, and in Syria.   We are not--and need not be--the world's policeman. Winning this long  war, like the Cold War, will require sustained efforts and  contributions not only from the United States but from our allies and  especially from local partners. For example, in Afghanistan the vast  majority of the fighting is done by local security forces, but we must  always remember the global coalition to defeat the terrorists will not  lead itself.   So, today, as we remember the tragedies of the past, we must renew  our commitment to leading the fight for a better future. Today, may the  memory of the nearly 3,000 victims who lost their lives on this day in  2001 serve as a lasting reminder of what is at stake in the fight  against terrorism and steel our resolve to continue the hard, necessary  work of defending our homeland. May we always keep foremost in our  thoughts all the U.S. servicemembers, intelligence officers, diplomats,  and first responders who have given their lives in pursuit of our  Nation's security.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the disposition of the Akard nomination, the majority leader and  Democratic leader both have a minute to speak and the Senate then  observe a moment of silence in remembrance of the events of September  11, 2001.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I think everyone knows today is the  anniversary of 9/11. Many of us here remember evacuating this very  building on September 11, 2001. We knew the world would never be the  same.   For the people of New York, an ordinary beautiful morning was brought  to a screeching halt as the clear blue sky filled with smoke. For those  at the Pentagon, the workdays in service of our Nation turned into a  literal nightmare. For hundreds of air travelers, routine flights gave  way to tragedy, and, thanks to the bravery of passengers and crew,  incredible acts of heroism.   The Senate stands with the entire Nation as we remember the terrible  events of 18 years ago today and the nearly 3,000 innocent lives that  terrorists stole away. We stand in solidarity with those who still  grieve, and we honor the patriotic resolve that inspired first  responders, U.S. servicemembers, and countless Americans who dedicated  themselves, that day and since, to selflessly keeping our Nation safe.   May our remembrances renew our commitment to building a world where  terrorist evil has no home. May we never forget.
