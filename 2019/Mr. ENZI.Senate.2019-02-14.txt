 Mr. President, I rise to support William Barr's nomination  to be Attorney General of the United States. After meeting with Mr.  Barr, I am convinced he is a qualified candidate and is committed to  upholding our constitutional liberties.   Mr. Barr's record of achievement and civil service to our country  stretches back over 30 years. Early in his career, he served as an  intelligence analyst at the CIA and an assistant attorney general in  the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel. He was later  appointed Deputy Attorney General in the George H.W. Bush  administration before becoming our 77th United States Attorney General.  Mr. Barr's suitability for the role of attorney general has been tested  before; in fact, he has excelled in that capacity.   Concerns have been raised regarding Mr. Barr's position with respect  to the Second Amendment. Wyoming is a State of gunowners, and I am a  strong defender of our Second Amendment rights, so naturally I probed  these concerns. I had the opportunity to personally meet with Mr. Barr  and directly ask him about his stance on the Second Amendment. He gave  me direct answers and made it clear that he does not support limiting  our Second Amendment rights.   Ultimately, the Constitution solely grants Congress power of law- making. I am prepared to work with my Senate colleagues to protect  against any efforts that would undermine our constitutional rights, and  I will continue to conduct congressional oversight on the executive  branch, a duty I take very seriously.    Madam President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory  limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to  those limits. In addition, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to  establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels  consistent with those adjustments.   The Senate will soon consider the conference report for H.J. Res. 31,  the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 This measure provides full- year appropriations for Federal Government agencies and contains  spending that qualifies for cap adjustments under current statute.   This measure includes $8,165 million in budget authority that is  designated as being for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on  Terrorism pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of BBEDCA. Of that  amount, $165 million is for spending in the security category and  $8,000 million is for nonsecurity spending. CBO estimates that this  budget authority will result in $2,980 million in outlays in Fiscal  Year 2019.   This measure also includes $12,000 million in nonsecurity  discretionary budget authority designated for disaster relief pursuant  to section 251(b)(2)(D) of BBEDCA. This designation makes the spending  associated with this provision and its associated outlays of $600  million eligible for an adjustment.   This legislation repurposes nonsecurity discretionary budget  authority for emergency efforts. This funding is designated pursuant to  section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. CBO estimates that this repurposing  of funds will result in $10 million in outlays this fiscal year.   As a result of the aforementioned designations, I am revising the  budget authority and outlay allocations to the Committee on  Appropriations by increasing revised security budget authority by $165  million, revised nonsecurity budget authority by $20,000 million, and  outlays by $3,590 million in Fiscal Year 2019. Further, I am increasing  the budgetary aggregate for Fiscal Year 2019 by $20,165 million in  budget authority and $3,590 million in outlays.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES  (Pursuant to Sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                        $s in millions                            2019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority.......................................    3,619,159     Outlays................................................    3,546,419 Adjustments:     Budget Authority.......................................       20,165     Outlays................................................        3,590 Revised Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority.......................................    3,639,324     Outlays................................................    3,550,009 ------------------------------------------------------------------------    REVISION TO SPENDING ALLOCATION TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR                             FISCAL YEAR 2019  (Pursuant to Sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                  $s in millions                            2019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Allocation:     Revised Security Discretionary Budget                        715,835      Authority.................................
