 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from  Texas, and I hate to see him leave because he has been so productive.   Madam Speaker, it is interesting. We had the talk and hear it going  back and forth about what the IRS is not going to do. I would just tell  my fellow citizens--and I am not going to talk to the other side  because we shouldn't be doing that anyway.   There is something wrong whenever we look at the money that is being  spent to hire agents for enforcement. I would tell my fellow citizens:  Be afraid. Be very afraid. If the events of this week don't shake you  to the bottom as to what this government can do to you whenever it  chooses to do it and however it chooses to do it, understand that this  agency, the IRS, is the most feared agency in the United States  Government. It is incredible the power that it wields.   It is incredible that it is going to increase the number of  enforcement officers. They are not coming in to help with the  processing because all of us in Congress, including my friends on the  other side, have been doing the work of the IRS for the IRS. They  haven't been back to work full time for 2\1/2\ years.   Madam Speaker, I urge my friends on both sides of the aisle to vote  ``no'' on this monstrosity that does not do anything about inflation  but continues to harass hardworking American taxpayers.
