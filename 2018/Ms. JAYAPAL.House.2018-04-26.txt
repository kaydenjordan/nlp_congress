 Mr. Chair, I would like to thank Chairman Shuster and  Ranking Member DeFazio for including two of my amendments in the en  bloc package. The gentlemen have set a high bar for leadership and  collegiality through this process, and I look forward to working with  them as the FAA implements this bill.   My amendments focus on two issues important not only to the residents  of Washington's Seventh District, but across the country; namely, the  issue of airplane noise and infrastructure needs of fast-growing  airports like Sea-Tac.   Many of our communities with large and medium airports are growing by  leaps and bounds. According to Airports Council International, over the  last 10 years, Sea-Tac's passenger traffic has grown by 52.6 percent,  second only to San Francisco. We need to be certain that our  communities are able to prepare for that growth, while still ensuring  that they remain livable.   These amendments will help to build that evidence base, and I deeply  appreciate the consideration.
