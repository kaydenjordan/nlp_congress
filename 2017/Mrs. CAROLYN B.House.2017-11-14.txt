 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding and for her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2874.   There are some good things in this bill, including the Zeldin-Maloney  bill, that would allow policyholders to receive mitigation credit for  elevating boilers and other mechanical systems to higher floors instead  of in easily flooded basements, which is a huge deal for the city of  New York and other big cities.   But there are too many provisions that would make flood insurance in  my district either unavailable or unaffordable. For this reason, the  city of New York opposes this bill.   The bill would raise premiums on homeowners by increasing the floor  on premium increases that Congress just set 3 years ago. Currently,  FEMA has to increase premiums by a minimum of 5 percent per year. Under  this bill, FEMA would have to increase premiums by a minimum of 6.5  percent per year.   When you add up the mandatory increases in premiums required to fund  FEMA's reserve fund and all of the other surcharges in the bill, the  effect would be to significantly increase flood insurance premiums for  homeowners.   Finally, I am concerned about eliminating the noncompete clause for  so-called write-your-own private insurers. This would allow the private  insurers that administer the National Flood Insurance Program to  exploit their access to FEMA's database in order to cherry-pick the  safest properties. This would leave FEMA with only the riskiest  properties, and would undermine the solvency of the National Flood  Insurance Program.   So, while there are many thoughtful good provisions in this bill,  there are too many provisions that would dramatically increase premiums  for my constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.
