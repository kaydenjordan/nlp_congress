 Mr. Speaker, this week, the House is voting on bills  meant to address the opioid crisis, a crisis facing communities across  the country. This crisis deserves our full attention and bipartisan  action. Mr. Speaker, 115 people die every day from overdose. These are  real human beings.   I think of Katie Lethbridge, from my home community of Brendan Bye,  lost to this terrible, terrible addiction, this terrible tragic  disease.   We need more than just the legislation that is coming before us this  week. We need a serious commitment to treatment, to funding treatment,  not just with direct funding to ensure that the programs that support  treatment are in place, but actually making sure that people have  healthcare coverage that includes coverage for treatment.   When this House works to undermine the guarantee that people with a  preexisting condition, which could include addiction, if it is taken  from them, we are really not living up to the promise that we owe to  these folks.                            ____________________
