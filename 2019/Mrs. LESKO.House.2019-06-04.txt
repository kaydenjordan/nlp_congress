 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank Representative Shalala for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.   Madam Speaker, circumstances demand that we make substantial  improvements to our Nation's broken immigration system. My home State  of Arizona is at the forefront of a crisis on our Nation's southern  border, but the bill before us today offers no solutions and will  instead, I believe, exacerbate the problem.   I have represented the people of Arizona for over a decade. Last  Congress, I was honored when the people of Arizona's Eighth  Congressional District sent me to represent them here in Washington,  D.C.  [[Page H4237]]    For my constituents, as residents of a border State, fixing our  broken immigration system is a top priority. With Customs and Border  Patrol apprehending 4,500 people per day and, in April, over 100,000  people just in that month alone, it is critical to develop and  implement a solution immediately. As a member on the Homeland Security  Committee, the Committee on the Judiciary's Subcommittee on Immigration  and Citizenship, and the House Rules Committee, I stand ready to work  with my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to develop real  solutions to our immigration crisis.   Unfortunately, with the bill and the rule before us today, it is  evident that the majority has no intention of advancing consensus  legislation to fix our broken immigration system. The bill advances a  series of what I believe are flawed policies.   As the bill worked its way through the committee process, the  majority denied reasonable amendments to improve the bill; and the rule  passed in a party-line vote--very partisan bill--by the Rules Committee  does not allow for amendments to be considered by this body as a whole  at all. It is a closed rule.                                time  1300    Democrats have framed this bill as a solution for recipients of the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program, or DACA, a laudable  goal.   In fact, last night in the Rules Committee, the chairman said it is  only designed for a small group of people, the DACA recipients. Well,  that is just not true.   In fact, the American people should know what this bill really does.  It provides green cards and, thus, a special path to citizenship to  millions of illegal aliens, whether they are current recipients of DACA  or not.   Unlike President Obama's executive order on DACA, this bill allows  people who have been living in the United States illegally for 40  years--decades--to get a special path to citizenship. That is not what  President Obama's DACA program did.   It places the interests of those who violated U.S. immigration laws  above the interests of those who have been waiting and waiting to enter  this country legally. It provides amnesty. It will only incentivize  further illegal immigration.   The American people should also know what this bill fails to do.   It does nothing to provide the men and women protecting our border  with the resources they need to keep our country safe. It does nothing  to fix the de facto system of catch and release. It does nothing to  remedy the crisis at our southern border. In fact, I believe it will  make it worse.   Finally, the American people should know the changes that my  Republican colleagues and I proposed to improve upon this bill, all of  which my Democratic colleagues rejected.   Democrats rejected an amendment to exclude aliens convicted of  misdemeanor firearms convictions from getting this special pathway.  Democrats rejected an amendment to exclude illegals convicted of a  misdemeanor DUI offense if the alien's conduct killed or injured  another person or if they had multiple DUIs.   What this means is, if there was an illegal immigrant who had a  misdemeanor DUI that severely injured someone, they are still welcomed  in under this plan.   Approximately half of the 158,000 people arrested by ICE in fiscal  year 2018, the illegal immigrants who were arrested, or about 81,000,  had been charged or convicted of driving under the influence. This bill  could reward people like this with a special pathway to citizenship.   Democrats also rejected an amendment to make gang members ineligible  for benefits under this bill.   Democrats also rejected an amendment to make fraud a ground for  ineligibility. In fact, I proposed an amendment that said, if they  fraudulently fill out the application form, or misrepresented  themselves as U.S. citizens in the past to get benefits, they would be  rejected. Unfortunately, my Democratic colleagues said no, welcome them  in.   Democrats rejected an amendment to remedy a confidentiality provision  that prevents information contained in an application from being used  for law enforcement purposes, thereby impeding law enforcement efforts.   To summarize, under this bill: Gun criminals are welcome. Drunk  drivers are welcome. Gang members are welcome. Fraudsters are welcome.  But law enforcement hands are tied.   From the bill's text and failure to adopt reasonable amendments, it  is clear that my Democratic colleagues do not value the integrity of  our immigration system or ensuring that criminals do not exploit  loopholes in their bill. At best, they are choosing to ignore the chaos  at the border and to ignore the perverse incentives of their policy of  wide-reaching amnesty. At worst, they are encouraging it.   Last Congress, Republicans voted for a DACA solution that enforces  the law and remedies our immigration system. Republicans recognized  that America is a nation of immigrants but also that the world has  changed since we put in place the immigration laws governing our  enforcement efforts along the southern border and that we need  immigration laws reformed.   That bill that Republicans proposed and I supported last year would  have addressed DACA by allowing DACA recipients to obtain legal status.  It would not have allowed for a special pathway to citizenship. It  would not have allowed them to jump in front of the line.   That Republican bill recognized that many DACA recipients entered  this country without legal documentation through no fault of their own  but that they were in the country and we needed a solution.   That Republican bill would have also secured our border, improved  enforcement, and addressed our need for skilled workers. It authorized  a border wall, mandated E-Verify, and increased visas for the skilled  workers we need most. It also eliminated the diversity visa lottery and  increased the credible fear standard to combat asylum fraud.   The bill offered reasonable immigration reform, but not one single  Democratic Member of Congress voted in favor of it. Instead, today, my  Democratic colleagues are advancing a bill that offers no reforms to  the legal immigration system, no border security, no solutions for the  humanitarian crisis that is happening each and every day at our border.  And it comes with a $35 billion price tag.   The crisis at our southern border is real and substantial, with  Customs and Border Protection apprehending an average of 4,500 people  per day on the southern border. Border Patrol facilities are beyond  capacity. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities are full.   The number of people apprehended in the past 7 months has already  surpassed any year since 2009. At this rate, CBP will apprehend over  1.64 million people in just 1 year. That is more than the last recorded  official population of the city of Phoenix.   We must develop and implement a solution to the crisis at our  southern border immediately. Instead, we have before us a partisan bill  to provide amnesty to millions of people and incentivize countless more  to cross our border illegally.    This bill has no chance of being taken up by the U.S. Senate or  signed by the President.   The majority's inaction to the crisis at our southern border is  absolutely unacceptable. Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leadership  refused to even fund the extra funding for the humanitarian crisis that  would help the children and the migrants themselves.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Arizona an  additional 2 minutes.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Woodall), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, you know I am from the State of Arizona. Border  security and immigration has been the top issue for years now, not only  in my district, but the entire State of Arizona, because we see it  firsthand. We also see the DACA recipients. I mean, they are good kids,  going to school, and I applaud the good and great DACA recipients that  we have.   But what Representative Woodall says is true: Republicans offered two  bills to give legal status and one a pathway to citizenship to DACA  recipients, but this bill goes beyond DACA. It is like DACA on  steroids, because it will allow millions more people to get a special  pathway to citizenship in front of the line of other legal immigrants  who are trying to do it the legal way.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle know this is going  nowhere in the Senate and the President is not going to do this. I hope  at one point we are actually going to work together, because as  Representative Woodall said, on those two bills that we put forward  last year that would have solved the DACA problem, not one Democrat  voted for them.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would inquire if my colleague has any  more speakers.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, again, Republicans, too, want to have a DACA solution  for the DACA recipients, but this bill isn't it, because it goes way  above the DACA recipients and basically lets millions more people in,  people who could be gang members, who have DUIs, and so on and so  forth.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to provide for additional consideration of H.R.  3056 authored by Representative Rogers.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    H.R. 3056, the bill, provides $4.5 billion in funding to  address the immediate humanitarian crisis we have on the southern  border. It includes $3.3 billion for humanitarian assistance, including  shelter capacity for unaccompanied children, care for children in  custody, and transportation for safe and efficient border processing  centers.   It also includes $1.1 billion for operational support, including  personnel, transportation, and resources to combat human trafficking  and drug trafficking--very serious issues.   It also includes $178 million for technology upgrades and law  enforcement pay adjustments to respond to this great influx of families  coming from Central America to our border.   The Democrats today are waiving all the rules to spend $35 billion on  their, I call, amnesty bill, but they have chosen to ignore the  humanitarian crisis that is happening right now on our southern border.  H.R. 3056 takes steps to resolve that problem.   Madam Speaker, in closing, it is critical that we develop and  implement a solution to the crisis at our southern border immediately.  I am from Arizona. There is a crisis at our border. Instead, H.R. 6 is  just another political messaging bill because my colleagues know it is  not going anywhere.   Madam Speaker, I urge ``no'' on the previous question, ``no'' on the  underlying message, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
