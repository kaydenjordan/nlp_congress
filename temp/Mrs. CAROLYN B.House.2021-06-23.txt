 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, with each passing  week, we are seeing the tremendous impact of the American Rescue Plan  on our Nation, in New York State, in New York City, and in my own  district of New York 12.   Included in the American Rescue Plan is the 1-year expansion of the  child tax credit. Next month, families will begin to receive credits of  up to $300 per month to help with food, to help with rent, to help with  the cost of childcare.   It is estimated that this funding will cut childhood poverty in half.  Let me repeat that. It will cut childhood poverty in half. In my  district alone, New York 12, this will help 54,000 children and lift  nearly 5,000 children out of poverty.   Knowing the impact this tax credit will have on our families, I am  asking all of my colleagues to join me in working to make it permanent.   When families do well, our Nation does well.                            ____________________
