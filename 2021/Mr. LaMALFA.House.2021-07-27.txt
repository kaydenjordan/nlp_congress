 Mr. Speaker, it has been obvious for years now that we  need to rethink our forest management strategies.   2020 was the worst fire season on record for California and much of  the West. California alone saw 4.2 million acres of land burned.  Currently, there are 85 large fires burning across the West and already  1\1/2\ million acres burnt.   Last week the smoke reached all the way to Washington, D.C., causing  health advisories for people not to be outside if they either have  health issues or for athletic purposes in D.C. and Baltimore. The plume  even reached all the way up to New York.   The U.S. Forest Service and the Department of the Interior have  identified more than 80 million acres that are overgrown and at a high  risk of fire.   As wildfires burn across California and the West, Republicans have  several bill proposals before this House that would improve forest  management. These bills propose comprehensive solutions to address the  declining health of our forests and help prevent catastrophic wildfires  by expediting the environmental analysis, reducing frivolous lawsuits,  and increasing the pace and scale of management practices.    We have suppressed fires for over 110 years which is okay on the  surface, but now most forests are intensely overstocked and overgrown  with the fuel that causes the fires because we didn't do the other side  of the coin: the harvest work, the treatment, and the removing of  materials.   For example, in California most forest types had in the past about 64  trees per acre in the mid-1800s. Now they sit at over 300 trees per  acre or more, causing weak trees that are more susceptible to insects  and ultimately death because they don't have enough water supply, and  so this in itself exacerbates the drought within the forest with all  the competition of trees per acre and the death of the trees  themselves.   One of my bills, the CLEAR Zones Act, would allow better clearing  around power lines. It would allow a wider buffer to prevent trees from  falling on the lines and igniting a fire which is what they do. A tree  falling into power lines lately was likely the cause of the Dixie fire,  currently the largest fire burning in California. So far it has burned  right around 200,000 acres in my district, and it is only 22 percent  contained.   This is hitting the area north of the Camp fire that burned in 2018.  As you might remember from history, Mr. Speaker, it burned the town of  Paradise, part of Magalia, Concow, and Yankee Hill, this large area  here.   Then following up in 2020 was the North Complex fire. They are  burning up against each other basically over history here. And now we  have the Dixie fire, as it is known, along with a smaller one called  the Fly fire which have burned together. Pretty soon the whole  landscape is going to have a history of having burned.   For what reason?   It is because we won't manage the lands. We won't do what needs to be  done to put the kind of buffers and the kind of zones in that would  help make it easier for the firefighters.   Well, the solutions we do have are: we have proper forest management.  We have seen that in this area here, around this current Dixie fire.   The Collins Pine Company based in Chester, California, and a lot of  areas in northern California, has done a lot of free work along  highways around the community that would be very, very helpful and  ultimately will be very helpful towards the type of management that  will make us fire-safe.  [[Page H3914]]    The thinning that is done along the highways and around the towns is  what has made it possible for the firefighters in a very difficult  situation--on the just seen Dixie fire, on my map there--to have a  chance to stop this fire finally. It has ravaged so much, and they have  done an amazing job of protecting communities and homes in those areas.   But it has turned from a fire where a tree hit a power line--we are  still waiting for the forensic report on that--from a small, half-acre  fire and just a couple weeks later 200,000 acres and all this  endangerment.   So work that had been done previously by Collins Pine is going to  probably save the day for the town of Chester and others up in that  direction.   So if we dramatically increase the fuel treatments across all these  landscapes, then it gives us a fighting chance. We need to thin the  forest and return low-intensity fire to these landscapes in the form  also of a prescribed fire at a time of year when we can control them.  The Native Americans used to use this method, and we can learn from  them.   This map of fuels treatment projects around the Whiskeytown National  Recreation Area, overlaid with the satellite image of the 2018 Carr  fire burn scar, shows that where the fuels were managed the fire was  less intense. The green area has been highlighted to show a better  contrast. The areas that had been thinned did not burn nearly as  intensely. Instead, the big trees survived, the fire goes through the  area at the bottom of the forest much more slowly, and it is much more  manageable. The upper areas are the ones that burned to a crisp.   So this map shows that forest management works and that thinning  works. We need to increase the pace and scale of this type of project  so when fires come, the landscape is ready, and it doesn't endanger our  firefighters and our communities unnecessarily.   Fire will happen. It is going to happen whether it is a manmade  accident or nature with lightning strikes and the things that happen  there. It is going to happen.   But what are we going to do to address that?   If we want to talk about change of temperatures and the drought  situation we are facing in the West, we have to do even more to address  overgrown forests and the amount of inventory per acre a forest can  handle. Basically, all these trees in an overloaded forest are called  ladder fuels. The fires will be lower intensity if we do the right  work. They are easier to put out and much less devastating. Indeed, it  is the natural landscape we used to have over 100 years ago when fire  was actually constructive.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, actions by the Federal Government are  devastating the Klamath Basin on the north end of California and south  Oregon. Earlier this year our government cut off all of the water for  the Klamath Basin from the farmers and the wildlife in order to deal  with Endangered Species Act rules for two competing species of fish.   Madam Speaker, you can see the devastation last year with a duck kill  that happened inside the refuge. We did manage to rescue this one.   The wildlife refuge has no water. The farmers who also provide water,  food, and resting areas for migratory birds now cannot provide food or  habitat, and the entire basin is hurting. The government has created an  ecological disaster that will result in the death of tens of thousands  of federally protected migratory birds.   Last year when the Bureau of Reclamation reduced the water by more  than half, 60,000 birds died of botulism. I toured this area last year,  and it is indeed devastating. This year there is zero water.   There is no habitat for nesting birds and no feed for them from  farmers. This is a government created disaster, and our environment and  people are paying the price. We need to deliver the water that farmers  own to the farmers, and that will also in turn help deliver water to  the Federal refuge.   Federal courts and the Bureau of Reclamation need to get out of the  way and let the people on the ground succeed for food and for our  wildlife.                            ____________________
