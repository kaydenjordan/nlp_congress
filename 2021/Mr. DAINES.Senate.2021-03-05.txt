 Mr. President, I have a motion to commit at the desk.    Mr. President, this motion to commit will send this bill  back to the Foreign Relations Committee to include authorization of the  Keystone XL Pipeline in the final bill. In fact, as we saw earlier this  morning, the Keystone XL Pipeline has bipartisan support.   Here is the difference. This morning's amendment vote was a 60-vote  threshold. This is a simple majority. This is good for union jobs. It  is great for our rural communities. It reduces emissions.   It is time to get this done. I urge my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to support this motion.    The only thing that has been killed is the Keystone XL  Pipeline by President Biden. This resurrects the Keystone XL Pipeline.   The union jobs are needed. The rural communities need these tax  revenues for their schools. This is what we want to do. We had  bipartisan support for that this morning. Let's do it again. I urge  passage of this motion to commit.                           Vote on Motion to Commit
