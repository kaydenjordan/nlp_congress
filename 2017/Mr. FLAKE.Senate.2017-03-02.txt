 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                      Remembering Sheriff Ralph E. Ogden     Mr. President, I rise with a heavy heart to mark the  passing of a pillar of the Arizona law enforcement community. When  people think of the Old West, they often picture a Stetson-wearing  lawman sitting astride his horse, keeping watch over his community.   For generations of residents in Southwestern Arizona, that lawman was  Yuma County Sheriff Ralph Ogden. With his towering frame and trademark  mustache, Sheriff Ogden looked every bit the part. Despite having an  imposing physical presence, Sheriff Ogden was a kind, compassionate  man, beloved by his deputies and celebrated by his community.   After 4 years of distinguished service in the U.S. Marine Corps,  Ralph Ogden began his 42-year law enforcement career as a dispatcher  and a jailer in Parker, AZ. A dedicated public servant, he would  eventually serve as chief deputy for 12 years. Ralph would go on to be  elected to five consecutive terms as sheriff, with his 20-year tenure  the longest ever in Yuma county history.   Sheriff Ogden always understood the importance of getting to know the  community he served. He encouraged his employees to get involved in  charities, religious groups, and service organizations. He valued  teamwork. He recognized that no one can succeed on  [[Page S1562]]  their own. This philosophy of always having some other person's back  was something he carried with him throughout his time in the sheriff's  office, and it was reflected in the way he treated those around him.   I was fortunate to get to know Ralph over the last few years and  learned a lot of what I know about the border and about law enforcement  from that great man.   Sheriff Ogden was known to write personal birthday and anniversary  cards for each of his employees, just to show that he valued their  service and their friendship and to show they were important to him.   When asked about the benefits of serving law enforcement, Sheriff  Ogden said that when you go home tired and beat after a long day, you  sleep well knowing that you did some good. Sheriff Ralph Ogden did a  lot of good. I know he is resting well.   I yield back my time.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
