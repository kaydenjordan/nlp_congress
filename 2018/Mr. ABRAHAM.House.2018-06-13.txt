 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of William  Allen Kendrick, Jr., a Marine and lifelong resident of Jena, Louisiana,  who died tragically on May 24.   Allen led a life driven by passion, patriotism, and faith, values he  lived and expressed through music. He served as a bandsman in the  Marine Corps for 8 years and brought his enthusiasm for music and  theater back to civilian life in his hometown of Jena, a small rural  community that I have the privilege to represent in my district.   Allen first discovered his love of music at Nolley Memorial United  Methodist Church when he joined the Nolley group known as the Nolley  Notables as a young student. As an adult, he created the Nolley  Memorial UMC Grace Notes Choir and doubled the size of the LaSalle  Parish Community Choir after becoming its director.   Not surprisingly, Allen incorporated his love for God and country in  his music, and it showed when he performed the most notable  arrangements during Independence Day, Memorial Day, and other veterans  events.   He was also a member of the Jena Community Theater Group called  Acting Up, and a former band director at Jena High School.   Allen shared a quote on his Facebook page that said: ``Music is not  what I do. It's who I am.'' He lived that life every day, and all of us  who heard his music are better for it.   I join all those who have been blessed by Allen's music, and I mourn  his passing, as does the community. It will be hard not to think of him  the next time I attend a service in Jena, though I know that his legacy  and his patriotism will forever be a special part of Jena and Louisiana  and, hopefully, the Nation.                            ____________________
