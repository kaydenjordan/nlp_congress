 Madam Speaker, 40 million Americans have lost their  [[Page H2620]]  jobs in the biggest global pandemic in modern history. Not long ago,  most of them would have lost their health insurance, too. I bet that in  the last 3 months every single one of us, Republican and Democrat, in  private or public moments with our constituents has reassured them that  at least the Affordable Care Act is there for you, you do not have to  lose your health insurance in the middle of this crisis.   So how can it be that at this very moment when the value of the ACA  is so plainly obvious to tens of millions of Americans, the  administration is in court trying to strike it down? The President has  told us repeatedly he wants to protect people with preexisting  conditions, but right there in his brief to the Supreme Court, it  explicitly says that should be struck down, too.   And when we ask him, What will you do to replace the ACA if it is  struck down? He says, I won't tell you until after the election. Come  on.   Now, today we are going to pass the Patient Protection Act, which  means, unlike the President, we are willing to tell the American  people, now, exactly how we plan to improve healthcare in America.   We believe that the ACA should be improved, not taken away. The  Congressional Budget Office says that this plan for doing so will lower  premiums Americans pay by 10 percent.   We want what President Trump said he wanted in the 2016 election, to  let Medicare negotiate the price of prescription drugs which will save  Americans money and save the government over $500 billion.   And we want to eliminate the junk insurance plans that the  administration wants all those folks who are losing their jobs to take,  even though they don't cover essential services like prescription drugs  and maternity care.   I hope everyone will vote for this bill. If there are Members who  disagree, so be it. I would just ask, Madam Speaker, that they please  be honest. Don't say you want to protect people with preexisting  conditions if you won't vote to do so or put forward a plan to do so.  Don't advise your constituents to take advantage of the ACA if you are  not going to do anything while the President tries to strike it down.                                time  1100
