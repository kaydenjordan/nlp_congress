 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2061) to reauthorize the North Korean Human Rights  Act of 2004, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2061         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``North Korean Human Rights       Reauthorization Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (22 U.S.C.       7801 et seq.), the North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization       Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-346), and the Ambassador James R.       Lilley and Congressman Stephen J. Solarz North Korea Human       Rights Reauthorization Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-172) were       the products of broad, bipartisan consensus regarding the       promotion of human rights, transparency in the delivery of       humanitarian assistance, and the importance of refugee       protection.        (2) Fundamental human rights and humanitarian conditions       inside North Korea remain deplorable, North Korean refugees       remain acutely vulnerable, and the congressional findings       included in the Acts listed in paragraph (1) remain       substantially accurate today.        (3) The United States, which has the largest international       refugee resettlement program in the world, has resettled 212       North Koreans since the enactment of the North Korean Human       Rights Act of 2004.        (4) In addition to the longstanding commitment of the       United States to refugee and human rights advocacy, the       United States is home to the largest Korean population       outside of northeast Asia, and many people in the Korean-      American community have family ties to North Korea.        (5) Notwithstanding high-level advocacy by the United       States, South Korea, and the United Nations High Commissioner       for Refugees, China has forcibly repatriated tens of       thousands of North Koreans.        (6) Congressman Eni F.H. Faleomavaega served 25 years in       the House of Representatives, including as the Chairman and       the Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on       Asia and the Pacific, was a leader in strengthening the       relationship between the American and Korean peoples,       authored multiple resolutions regarding issues on the Korean       Peninsula, was a champion of human rights, and stated, in       support of the Ambassador James R. Lilley and Congressman       Stephen J. Solarz North Korea Human Rights Reauthorization       Act of 2012, that ``just as Ambassador Lilley and Congressman       Solarz worked hard to protect the human rights of the North       Korean people, we must remain vigilant in helping the people       of North Korea who struggle daily to escape the oppression       and tyranny of the North Korean regime''.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) In General.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the United States should continue to seek cooperation       from all foreign governments to allow the United Nations High       Commissioner for Refugees access to process North Korean       refugees overseas for resettlement and to allow United States       officials access to process refugees for resettlement in the       United States (if that is the destination country of the       refugees' choosing);        (2) the Secretary of State, through persistent diplomacy by       senior officials, including United States ambassadors to       Asia-Pacific countries, and in close cooperation with United       States ally South Korea, should make every effort to promote       the protection of North Korean refugees and defectors; and        (3) because North Koreans fleeing into China face a well-      founded fear of persecution upon their forcible repatriation,       the United States should urge China to--        (A) immediately halt the forcible repatriation of North       Koreans;        (B) allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees       unimpeded access to North Koreans inside China to determine       whether such North Koreans require protection as refugees;       and        (C) fulfill its obligations under the 1951 United Nations       Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967       Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, and the       Agreement on the Upgrading of the UNHCR Mission in the       People's Republic of China to UNHCR Branch Office in the       People's Republic of China (signed December 1, 1995).        (b) Continuing Sense of Congress.--It remains the sense of       Congress, as specified in section 3(3) of the North Korean       Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-346;       22 U.S.C. 7801 note), that ``the Special Envoy for North       Korean Human Rights Issues should be a full-time position       within the Department of State in order to properly promote       and coordinate North Korean human rights and humanitarian       issues, and to participate in policy planning and       implementation with respect to refugee issues, as intended by       the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-      333; 22 U.S.C. 7801 et seq.)''.

(d) Report on Humanitarian Assistance.--Section 201 of the       North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (22 U.S.C. 7831) is       amended in the matter preceding paragraph (1) by striking       ``2017'' and inserting ``2022''.        (e) Assistance Provided Outside of North Korea.--Paragraph       (1) of section 203(c) of the North Korean Human Rights Act of       2004 (22 U.S.C. 7833(c)) is amended by striking ``2017'' and       inserting ``2022''.

SEC. 5. ACTIONS TO PROMOTE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND                     DEMOCRACY IN NORTH KOREA.         The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004, as amended by       this Act, is further amended--        (1) in subsection (a) of section 103 (22 U.S.C. 7813)--        (A) by striking ``radio broadcasting'' and inserting       ``broadcasting, including news rebroadcasting,''; and        (B) by striking ``increase broadcasts'' and inserting       ``increase such broadcasts, including news rebroadcasts,'';       and        (2) in subsection (a) of section 104 (22 U.S.C. 7814)--        (A) by striking ``The President'' and inserting the       following:        ``(1) In general.--The President'';        (B) by inserting ``, USB drives, micro SD cards, audio       players, video players, cell phones, wi-fi, wireless       internet, webpages, internet, wireless telecommunications,       and other electronic media that share information'' before       the period at the end; and        (C) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:        ``(2) Distribution.--In accordance with the sense of       Congress described in section 103, the President, acting       through the Secretary of State, is authorized to distribute       or provide grants to distribute information receiving       devices, electronically readable devices, and other       informational sources into North Korea, including devices and       informational sources specified in paragraph (1).

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me point out that the world is rightly focused on  the threat that North Korea poses to global security--the detonations,  the missile launches, the forward-deployed artillery--that we have seen  from across the border in South Korea.   I have been once to North Korea. I know my colleague, Eliot Engel,  has been twice to the capital there. But going along the eastern  coast--the eastern seaboard into North Korea--you can see the threat.  You can see the artillery--the tanks, the Katyusha rockets, and the  howitzers lined up--and you can see where they are aimed.   I think we have to maybe point out that the provocations underscore a  simple, jarring fact, and that is that Kim Jong-un wants to pose a  mortal threat, and not just to the United States, but to our democratic  treaty allies--to South Korea and to Japan.   But I think, as we face that reality, we cannot afford to forget that  the regime's greatest victims are the people of North Korea themselves.  That is the longest held hostage here. And remembering that this is not  just a moral imperative, but, also, it is a strategic one, too. If Kim  Jong-un had to answer to the North Korean people, he would pose far  less a danger to us, to South Korea, and to Japan. Maybe he would pose  no danger whatsoever if he really had to answer to his own people.   The truth is that Kim Jong-un's most potent enemy is his own  citizens, if they were to be empowered. The regime should be forced to  confront the dismal reality that it has inflicted on its own  population. Obsessed not just with self-preservation, but also with his  concept of reunification of the peninsula--based on the words he uses-- under his own leadership, he and his father and his father's father  have been willing to inflict starvation and stunting.   I asked Hwang Jang-yop, the former minister of propaganda--myself and  one of my colleagues here had asked him--and he said that 2 million  people had been starved by the regime. He said the real number was 1.9  million. And he said: You have to understand, we put all the resources  into the weapons program, into the ICBM program, and into the nuclear  capability. People fend for themselves basically. That is the system  there. And when he defected, the propaganda minister shared that with  us.   In the meantime, you will notice that there is one man in that system  that feasts on imported luxuries and on liquor, and that is the deity  himself. That is Kim Jong-un. The bonds of public affection for Kim  certainly are strong in the capital, but, in the countryside, those who  have defected tell me that they are so fragile that they can only be  maintained with purges, with public executions, and with deadly prison  camps.   It is no wonder, then, that the regime's harshest critics are escaped  North Koreans who have seen through the wall of misinformation that Kim  Jong-un works so hard to maintain. We have heard, time and again, from  North Korean refugees about the indelible impact of real information  from the outside world, whether it be defector broadcasts or pirated  South Korean TV dramas set in the affluent bustling metropolis of  Seoul.   Just last month, I was discussing these issues in Seoul with Thae  Yong-ho, the highest ranking North Korean defector. The minister is the  former ambassador to the U.K. Many of you read about his defection  there in Britain. He is now in Seoul. He emphasized that such knowledge  undermines the lie that North Korea is a worker's paradise and that it  is the envy of the world.   Increasingly, he says, for 30-some dollars, a village or a family can  purchase a device that plays these dramas from South Korea that come in  from the porous border with China, and, as a result of that, they learn  more. And, frankly, I will say that as a result of the two different  organizations of defectors from North Korea who broadcast on shortwave,  people are learning more as well. Our problem is that it needs to be  broadcast beyond just the area around the border. We need to figure out  how to help others hear the truth.   So, today, harnessing the power of information and public  expectations inside North Korea is more important than ever. Along with  enhanced sanctions on the regime's enablers, this is critical. It is a  critical nonmilitary tool because it confronts the growing North Korean  threat to our safety with a very different methodology by educating and  empowering North Koreans themselves.   This bill, H.R. 2061, does not merely reauthorize activities under  the North Korean Human Rights Act, but it enacts important updates to  freedom-of-information authorities, to reflect technological advances  beyond radio broadcasting, including USB drives, mobile devices, and  other very promising tools. It also renews the obligations of the  special envoy for North Korean human rights.   Finally, the bill enhances congressional oversight tools to help  ensure that our investments stand the best chance of paying dividends  in freedom for North Korea, and greater security for the rest of the  world will be the result of this.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman emeritus of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for authoring this bill. I also thank  our ranking member, Eliot Engel, for his work on this issue. And I  thank the chair and ranking member of our Asia and the Pacific  Subcommittee as well, Ted  [[Page H7443]]  Yoho and Brad Sherman. The gentlewoman from Florida is tireless in her  defense of human rights and has been a legislative leader on  North Korea for more than a decade.    I am a proud cosponsor of this excellent bill, which deserves our  unanimous support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.   Among a number of amendments that he has contributed to this bill,  there is one in particular that I think is very important, and that is  increasing the number of tools that can be used here, to include new  technologies to North Korea, like USB drives. It is a lot easier for  people to watch on USB drives as well as, of course, mobile phones and  DVDs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our ranking member, Mr. Eliot Engel,  also for his work on the original bill.   For a number of years, we have been focused in a bipartisan way,  those of us who are concerned about human rights in North Korea. This  is the reauthorization, but the original measure was to promote human  rights and free information inside North Korea, and to focus on the  protection of North Koreans who have fled the country and face a  heightened risk of exploitation and human trafficking. We have been  able to work on enforcement, but now with reauthorization, there is a  chance to update it.   Those updates in H.R. 2061 not only reauthorize the North Korean  Human Rights Act, but there are these promising new technological  advances to pierce the information darkness, as Mr. Ted Yoho mentioned.  That darkness is maintained intentionally by Kim Jong-un's regime.  Confronted by a rapidly nuclearizing North Korea, these tools are more  important than ever.   Rather than putting all of his energy into menacing the world, as he  does with his nuclear program, Kim Jong-un must be confronted with the  urgent needs, with the legitimate aspirations of the people of North  Korea. There are 120,000 of his people that are in what we call these  gulags across North Korea. Without reforms, these individuals are never  going to see the light of day, they are never going to be released to  freedom.   This critical bipartisan bill deserves our unanimous support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 2061, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 311) recognizing that for 50 years the  Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has worked toward  stability, prosperity, and peace in Southeast Asia, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 311         Whereas on September 10, 1977, the United States and the       Association of Southeast Asian Nations (in this resolution       referred to as ``ASEAN'') established dialogue relations,       with 2017 marking the 40th anniversary of United States-ASEAN       relations;        Whereas on August 8, 2017, ASEAN will celebrate fifty years       of regional cooperation towards greater stability, peace, and       prosperity in Southeast Asia;        Whereas on April 29, 2008, the United States was the first       non-ASEAN country to appoint an ambassador to ASEAN and the       United States became the first dialogue partner to establish       a permanent mission to ASEAN in 2010;        Whereas the United States committed in 2009 to hold an       annual United States-ASEAN Leaders' Meeting, and upgraded the       commitment in 2012 to an annual United States-ASEAN Summit;        Whereas on April 20, 2017, Vice President Mike Pence met       with the ASEAN Secretary General and ASEAN Permanent       Representatives in Jakarta, Indonesia, and stated that the       United States-ASEAN relationship ``without a doubt has       benefitted both ASEAN and America--diplomatically,       economically, and from the standpoint of national security'';        Whereas on February 16, 2016, at the Sunnylands Summit in       California, the United States and ASEAN reaffirmed their       shared commitment to maintain peace, security, and stability       throughout the region;        Whereas in 2013 ASEAN, as a whole, was the seventh-largest       economy in the world with an annual Gross Domestic Product       (GDP) of $2.4 trillion, and is the United States' fourth-      largest export market with total exports reaching       $102,000,000,000 in 2015;        Whereas the United States and ASEAN have strong economic       ties, as the United States is the single largest investor in       ASEAN with accumulated United States foreign direct       investment totaling almost $226,000,000,000 as of 2014, and       economic relations with ASEAN supporting more than 500,000       jobs in the United States;        Whereas the United States-ASEAN partnership is vital to the       security interests of the United States, as both the United       States and the members of ASEAN have a shared common interest       in a peaceful resolution of the South China Sea disputes and       achieving a denuclearized North Korea;        Whereas on November 4, 2002, the Declaration on the Conduct       of Parties in the South China Sea was signed by all members       of ASEAN and the People's Republic of China, committing all       parties to ``exercise self-restraint in the conduct of       activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and       affect peace and stability'';        Whereas ASEAN is a partner to the United States on key       transnational challenges, such as terrorism, violent       extremism, environmental degradation, energy, infectious       diseases, disarmament, proliferation of weapons of mass       destruction, cybersecurity, trafficking in persons, illicit       trafficking of wildlife and timber, and illegal, unregulated,       and unreported fishing; and        Whereas the 2016 East Asia Summit in Vientiane adopted a       statement on nonproliferation that reaffirmed the United       States, ASEAN, and other Dialogue Partners' support for       efforts at the national, regional, and international level to       promote nuclear disarmament, nuclear nonproliferation, and       peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and reiterated the       importance of nuclear security to combating nuclear       terrorism: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) supports and affirms the elevation of the United       States-ASEAN relationship to a strategic partnership, and       reaffirms the United States commitment to promoting a rules-      based order in the Asia-Pacific and economic growth, peace,       human rights and stability in Southeast Asia;        (2) recognizes the value of ASEAN working with economic,       political, and security partners, such as Australia, Canada,       the European Union, India, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, the       Republic of Korea, and Taiwan both inside and outside of       Asia, to both strengthen existing initiatives such as the       United States-ASEAN Connect and to develop new initiatives       that address mutual strategic concerns;        (3) encourages the enhancement of economic engagement       between the United States and ASEAN through the elimination       of trade barriers;        (4) supports cooperation with ASEAN to implement practical       counter-terrorism and countering violent extremism measures,       including efforts to counter homegrown radicalization and       stem foreign fighter travel;        (5) supports efforts by ASEAN member states and other       regional states, including the People's Republic of China, to       address maritime and territorial disputes in a constructive       manner and to pursue claims, through diplomacy and the use of       legitimate regional and international arbitration mechanisms,       consistent with international law, including through the       adoption of a code of conduct in the South China Sea to       further promote peace and stability in the region;        (6) urges all parties to maritime and territorial disputes       in the Asia-Pacific region to--        (A) exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities       that would undermine stability or escalate disputes through       the use of coercion, intimidation, or military force; and        (B) refrain from efforts to militarize uninhabited islands,       reefs, shoals, and other features, through actions including       the construction of new garrisons and facilities, and the       relocation of additional military personnel, materiel, or       equipment; and        (7) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to       continue joint efforts with ASEAN to halt human smuggling and       trafficking in persons and urges ASEAN to make increased       efforts to create and strengthen regional mechanisms to       provide assistance and support to refugees and migrants.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.  [[Page H7445]]                                     General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Congressman Joaquin Castro and  Congresswoman Ann Wagner for introducing this timely measure.   This is an important but, frankly, often overlooked part of the  world. This is Southeast Asia.   Mr. Speaker, Southeast Asian nations came together 50 years ago to  promote regional cooperation. Their goal was to achieve greater  stability and peace and prosperity by creating the Association of South  East Asian Nations. We know this as ASEAN today.   This year marks their 50th anniversary and the 40th anniversary of  relations between the United States and ASEAN.   This year, President Trump will visit the region for the first time  in November for the East Asia and ASEAN summits in the Philippines, and  the local leadership are going to be meeting in Vietnam.   Today, ASEAN is a force for peace and prosperity in the world, and  the relationship the U.S. has with ASEAN has benefited both sides  diplomatically, economically, and in global security.   ASEAN is the fourth largest goods export market for the United  States, and we are ASEAN's fourth largest trading partner. As the  second fastest-growing economy in Asia, with a combined economy of $2.5  trillion, the importance of the ASEAN market for the United States is  considerable.   Mr. Speaker, we are working with ASEAN to address security challenges  and threats, especially in the fight against terrorism, with the  recognition now of the emergence of ISIS fighting forces in the region.  Last month, Secretary of State Tillerson voiced support for increased  cooperation on border security, information sharing to track  individuals, and routing out and finding the source of terror financing  networks, finding their safe havens.   With so many challenges in the region today, as we look at the  democratic backsliding in Cambodia, the plight of the Rohingya in  Burma, it is more important than ever that we engage Southeast Asian  nations in the ASEAN grouping to solve regional problems.   We must also cooperate with ASEAN on the threat of North Korea and  have better coordination on maritime activities with regard to  security, environmental impact, and border and fishing regulations.   For all of these reasons today, the House of Representatives  reaffirms the importance of the U.S.-ASEAN partnership and recommits to  continuing engagement and cooperation.   Passage of this resolution demonstrates our support for ASEAN as an  institution and the United States' strategic relationship with  Southeast Asian nations.   I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), an esteemed member of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the primary cosponsor of this  resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), an esteemed member of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the primary cosponsor of this  resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   The first point I would make is I think our ranking member, Mr. Eliot  Engel, makes a very strong point about the importance of engagement.   I think, as a second point, U.S.-ASEAN engagement has trended up in  recent years. I think it remains strong. I think it has a bright  outlook. In 2015, the U.S.-ASEAN relationship was elevated to a  strategic partnership, an important step by the U.S.   2016 marked two important firsts: the first U.S.-ASEAN summit at  Sunnylands, and the first ever visit of a sitting U.S. President to  Laos. As an important economic and security partner, ASEAN shares the  U.S. pursuit of regional stability through rules, through order,  through the peaceful dispute settlement process, as our ranking member  pointed out. This resolution signals our resolve to maintain and deepen  our collaboration with our friends and allies in Southeast Asia.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of our colleagues here to join us in support  of this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 311, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 1141) to ensure that the United States promotes the  meaningful participation of women in mediation and negotiation  processes seeking to prevent, mitigate, or resolve violent conflict.  [[Page H7447]]    The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1141         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Women, Peace, and Security       Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Around the world, women remain under-represented in       conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and post-conflict       peace building efforts.        (2) Women in conflict-affected regions have achieved       significant success in--        (A) moderating violent extremism;        (B) countering terrorism;        (C) resolving disputes through nonviolent mediation and       negotiation; and        (D) stabilizing societies by enhancing the effectiveness of       security services, peacekeeping efforts, institutions, and       decisionmaking processes.        (3) Research suggests that peace negotiations are more       likely to succeed and to result in durable peace agreements       when women participate in the peace process.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the meaningful participation of women in conflict       prevention and conflict resolution processes helps to promote       more inclusive and democratic societies and is critical to       the long-term stability of countries and regions;        (2) the political participation, and leadership of women in       fragile environments, particularly during democratic       transitions, is critical to sustaining lasting democratic       institutions; and        (3) the United States should be a global leader in       promoting the meaningful participation of women in conflict       prevention, management, and resolution, and post-conflict       relief and recovery efforts.       SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It shall be the policy of the United States to promote the       meaningful participation of women in all aspects of overseas       conflict prevention, management, and resolution, and post-      conflict relief and recovery efforts, reinforced through       diplomatic efforts and programs that--        (1) integrate the perspectives and interests of affected       women into conflict-prevention activities and strategies;        (2) encourage partner governments to adopt plans to improve       the meaningful participation of women in peace and security       processes and decision-making institutions;        (3) promote the physical safety, economic security, and       dignity of women and girls;        (4) support the equal access of women to aid distribution       mechanisms and services;        (5) collect and analyze gender data for the purpose of       developing and enhancing early warning systems of conflict       and violence;        (6) adjust policies and programs to improve outcomes in       gender equality and the empowerment of women; and        (7) monitor, analyze, and evaluate the efforts related to       each strategy submitted under section 5 and the impact of       such efforts.       SEC. 5. UNITED STATES STRATEGY TO PROMOTE THE PARTICIPATION                     OF WOMEN IN CONFLICT PREVENTION AND PEACE                     BUILDING.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1141. Now, this is the Women,  Peace, and Security Act. This is the Senate companion to the bill H.R.  2484 that the House passed earlier this session. That bill was authored  by Representatives Kristi Noem and Jan Schakowsky, and I want to thank  them; and I, of course, want to thank, also, Ranking Member Engel. I  want to thank them collectively for their leadership on this important  issue.   I also want to thank Senators Corker, Cardin, Shaheen, and Capito for  working so well with us in the Senate.   I want to thank our assistant staff director, Jessica Kelch. I want  to thank her for her essential work on this important legislation.   I am happy to say that, with House passage today, this legislation  will go to the President's desk.   As I noted when this bill passed the House in June, this moment is  really a culmination of years of bipartisan work by Members of  Congress, including Jan Schakowsky and Kristi Noem. It is also the work  of prior and current administration officials and the many advocates  who want to see better, more sustainable solutions to ending wars, to  combating terrorism, and to improving human rights around the world.  What we are saying today is that women's participation is essential to  confronting these fundamental challenges.   Last Congress, the Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing, part of  its series of women in foreign affairs, where we heard powerful  testimony about the importance of including women in the peace  processes around the world.   It is an obvious point that many are aware of that, without the  participation of women, peace would not have come to Northern Ireland  in those discussions nor would the peace have held.   So now it may seem obvious that women should have an opportunity to  represent their communities as a matter of right; they make up half the  population. And what negotiation or agreement can claim to represent  women if their very participation is barred?   But our hearing also emphasized why women's participation in the  peace processes is important if we care about the likelihood of the  success of that process. Simply put, when women are at the negotiation  table, peace is more likely.   Compelling research shows that peace agreements are likely to be  reached and are likely to last when women's groups are meaningfully  involved. Women peacemakers often press warring parties to move beyond  mere power-sharing agreements, which benefit only a small percentage of  fighters, to more comprehensive and longer term accords, which benefit  the civilian population as a whole, which benefits the next generation  of that country.   We have seen this play out. We saw it play out, as I said, in  Northern Ireland. We saw it play out in Colombia; we saw it in Rwanda;  we saw it in Sri Lanka, where women's groups have pushed for practical  solutions to deescalate and resolve the conflict.   In fact, later today, I will be speaking with Liberia's President,  Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, whom I am proud to call a friend of many, many  years. Of course, President Sirleaf and the women of Liberia represent  what can be accomplished when women become involved in ending conflict.   After many failed attempts by politicians, combatants, and the  international community, it was the women of Liberia who forged an end  to one of West Africa's longest running and most brutal conflicts. We  must learn from history.   Efforts to ``keep the peace'' through policing and peacekeeping  missions also benefit from women's participation, which leads to better  crime reporting and higher levels of trust within the communities they  serve.   And women are essential to confronting one of the greatest national  security threats of our time: the spread of violent extremism around  the world. When we look at who confronts jihadists and who teaches  their children--if they have access to education, they can teach their  children--women are truly on the front lines of this fight. They often  possess unique insights into their families and communities and are  capable of gathering information that men cannot, yet their input is  frequently overlooked.   We must acknowledge women as partners in this fight, and that is why  the legislation before us today recognizes that it is in our national  interest to promote women's participation in resolving violence and  conflict.   This concept has been building support for some time: the Bush  administration pressed hard for women's participation in peace  negotiations and the political process in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and  elsewhere; the Obama administration expanded on these programs to  require a governmentwide approach to women's inclusion in conflict  resolution overseas; and the current administration has said that the  State Department's Office of Global Women's Issues will continue to  focus on these issues. I am eager to see an Ambassador nominated to  lead that office.   The bipartisan legislation before us today builds on these efforts.  It will continue to require a governmentwide strategy to promote  women's participation, along with specific goals and benchmarks and  reporting to Congress in order to gauge progress. And it also requires  that appropriate State, USAID, and Defense Department personnel receive  training in how to facilitate women's participation in conflict  resolution, security initiatives, and efforts to protect civilians from  violence and from exploitation.    I urge all Members to support passage today, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, whether we are talking about Liberia, or Northern  Ireland, or anywhere else where this world is in conflict, we have  watched women play pivotal roles in advocating before governments, or  before combatants, or in front of politicians, to bring an end to  conflict.   In recent years, we have seen armed conflicts flare around the world,  producing the largest number of refugees that we have ever seen on  record. Efforts to negotiate an end to these conflicts are more  important than they have ever been. We know that when women are  included in these discussions, we are more likely to see an enduring  peace as a result.   As a witness at our hearing on women's participation explained to us,  including women is not only the right thing to do, it is the smart  thing to do. The legislation before us today will strengthen U.S.  efforts to promote the inclusion of women in peace negotiations in  order to create more sustainable agreements and more stable partners  for the United States and for our allies.   Again, I want to thank Representatives Noem and Schakowsky and the  bill's Senate sponsors for their bipartisan work on this measure; and,  as always, Ranking Member Engel, for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, S. 1141.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
