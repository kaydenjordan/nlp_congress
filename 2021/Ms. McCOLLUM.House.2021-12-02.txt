 Madam Speaker, we are here today to prevent the  Republicans from shutting down the Federal Government tomorrow.   Republicans in the U.S. Senate are holding the FY 2022 appropriations  process hostage by refusing to do any work, let alone negotiate with  Democrats.   Rather than doing their job of funding the Federal Government, Senate  Republicans want to kick the can down the road, wasting the first 4\1/ 2\ months of the fiscal year.   As chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, it is clear  that Republicans are undermining our national security. They are  increasing waste and inefficiency, they are weakening our military  readiness, and they are sending a signal to our troops and the millions  of workers in the defense industry that they are not a priority.   The American people should be sick and tired of hearing Republicans  in Congress talk about how we need a stronger national defense while  doing everything in their power to weaken our national defense.   This is a time of instability in the world. Russia is knocking on the  doorstep of Ukraine. China is at the doorstep of Taiwan. There are  serious national security threats in the world.   When our adversaries look at Congress, they see Republicans playing  political games rather than investing in research and modernization.  What kind of message does that send to our adversaries? What kind of  message does that send to the men and women of our military, who we ask  to do the toughest jobs while putting their lives on the line?   I am voting for this continuing resolution to prevent a Republican  shutdown. But I must say, while this CR is necessary, I find it to be  unacceptable as an outcome.
