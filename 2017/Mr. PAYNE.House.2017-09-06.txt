 Mr. Chair, as the designee of Ranking Member Lowey, I move  to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the proposed amendment.  To coin it an earmark is unfortunate. The amendment would strike the  language passed out of the Appropriations Committee that supports  transportation projects of national significance. The committee voted  to appropriate $900  [[Page H7049]]  million to rail programs already authorized by Congress in the FAST  Act.   For the last 8 weeks, millions of commuters in the New York  metropolitan area suffered through a summer of hell after Amtrak  announced emergency track work at Penn Station, the busiest in North  America, because of three derailments in the span of a few weeks. This  was just an inkling of the turmoil that would be wrought if the Federal  Government does not live up to its promise to fund much-needed repairs  on the Northeast corridor.   I must emphasize, moneys approved by the Appropriations Committee are  for programs already authorized by the FAST Act, which was passed with  overwhelming bipartisan support.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote against the Budd amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
