 Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to Mike  Davis for his incredibly hard work on my Senate Judiciary Committee  staff as chief counsel for nominations. He is an Iowan, so his work  ethic should be no surprise, but he went above and beyond to ensure  that the Senate confirmed a historic number of Federal judges during  the 115th Congress, including the very difficult confirmation of  Justice Brett Kavanaugh. In December, Mike spoke about his work for me  to the Iowa Lawyers Chapter of the Federalist Society. I ask unanimous  consent that the text of Mike's speech be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Kavanaugh and Beyond: Judicial Confirmations in the Trump                               Administration         Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you to Sam Langholz and the       rest of the Iowa lawyers' chapter of the Federalist Society       for inviting me to speak today. The Federalist Society       continues to perform the critical task of building the farm       team of constitutionalist, originalist, and textualist       lawyers across America who can go on to serve in senior       government posts, including in the federal judiciary. Sam is       no doubt one of those lawyers. I have known Sam for more than       20 years, from our college internship days in Washington. Sam       is an exceptional lawyer and leader, and Governor Kim       Reynolds and all Iowans are fortunate to have Sam serving as       a senior member of the Governor's team.        I am completing my service as one of Senator Chuck       Grassley's lawyers on the United States Senate Committee on       the Judiciary, where Senator Grassley is finishing his 4-year       tenure as the Chairman. In January, Senator Grassley is       taking over the chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee,       along with assuming the constitutional office of President       Pro Tempore of the United States Senate. As President Pro       Tem, Senator Grassley will become third in line in the       presidential succession, behind the Vice President and the       Speaker of the House. It also means that Senator Grassley       must have a protective detail, which he absolutely does not       want. But as I remind him, the deer across Iowa can now cross       Iowa's highways a little more easily without the fear of       Chuck Grassley behind the wheel. At least for the next two       years, anyway.        In all seriousness, I am very proud to work for Senator       Grassley. He is 85 years old, and his health is excellent.       His mind is razor-sharp. He remembers everything. He still       runs several miles, several times a week. He still runs       circles around his staff, especially me. In fact, the       ``Farmer from Iowa'' schools me on the law, when I am       supposed to advise him on legal issues. When he does this, I       tell him that at least my jokes are better than his. He       laughs. Sometimes.        Senator Grassley is one of the most kind, caring, decent       people I have ever met. He comes home to Iowa virtually every       weekend. He puts Iowans above all. And he will never become a       creature of The Swamp, even after his 44 years in Congress.       Yet Senator Grassley is one of the most--if not the most--      consequential lawmakers in Washington. And his chairmanship       of the Senate Judiciary Committee has been one of the most       consequential in our nation's history.        In fact, earlier today, following Senator Grassley's dogged       and determined leadership, Senator Grassley joined the       President at the White House for the bill signing of the       First Step Act--a once-in-a-generation criminal-justice-      reform bill that Senator Grassley wrote and shepherded       through Congress. No one expected this legislation to pass,       let alone with overwhelmingly bipartisan support. Yet Senator       Grassley is the one senator--with the experience,       credibility, and trust of his colleagues across the political       spectrum--who could have made this happen.  [[Page S65]]         During his 4-year chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary       Committee, Senator Grassley led the effort to report out of       committee 61 bills. The Senate passed 45, and 29 became law.       Regardless of what you think about the particulars of any one       of these laws, very few in Washington have this record of       legislative success. As always, Grassley works. And Grassley       delivers. Like he has done for his 38 years in the Senate.        I am particularly pleased to join you today to discuss one       of Senator Grassley's most significant legislative       achievements of his nearly 60-year career in public office.       As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator       Grassley led the historic and record-shattering effort to       confirm President Trump's lifetime-appointed judicial       nominees.        Over the last two years, Senator Grassley has led the       effort in confirming 85 new federal judges. This includes       Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, an all-time record 30       circuit judges, and 53 district judges.        At 85 judges appointed under President Trump, Senator       Grassley has led the effort to confirm nearly twice as many       judges as the 43 judges that President Obama appointed in his       first two years in office.        Moreover, in 2017, Senator Grassley led the effort in       setting the all-time record for federal circuit judges       confirmed during a president's first year in office, at 12       circuit judges confirmed.        And earlier this year, Senator Grassley led the effort in       setting the all-time record for federal circuit judges       confirmed during a president's first two years in office. The       previous record was 22; Senator Grassley helped smash this       record, by leading the effort to confirm 30 federal circuit       judges in less than 2 years.        And Senator Grassley has readied the field for 2019, when       Senator Graham takes over as the chairman of the Senate       Judiciary Committee. Senator Grassley and the Senate       Judiciary Committee have already held hearings for 50 more       federal judicial nominees, including 6 more federal circuit       nominees, who will have confirmation votes in early 2019.       Senator Grassley has put the ball on the tee for his       successor.        While Senator Grassley had made this look easy, it       certainly was not. Senator Grassley and his team thoroughly       vet each of these nominees, carefully examining their       backgrounds and qualifications, understanding their judicial       philosophy, and carefully assessing their character and       fitness to serve. Senator Grassley held 20 nominations       hearings this year alone, generally every other Wednesday       that the Senate was in session. And Senator Grassley       generally held committee meetings for debates and votes on       nominees almost every Thursday that the Senate was in       session. And Senator Grassley worked both behind the scenes       and in public, to build support for these judicial nominees.        This took a significant amount of Senator Grassley's time.       But Senator Grassley understands the critical importance of       appointing judges who find and apply the law as the public       understood the law at the time of its writing. And Senator       Grassley also understands the dangers to liberty--in fact,       the tyranny--when judges think it is their job to substitute       their policy preferences for those of the American people and       their elected representatives in Congress.        Fortunately, we are winning. The President is fulfilling       his promise to the American people to nominate and appoint       judges who are constitutionalists, originalists, and       textualists.        Senator Grassley had to overcome historic obstruction by       Senate Democrats. The Senate Democrats forced time-wasting       and unprecedented cloture votes on 48 of the judicial       nominees brought to the Senate floor. How rare are cloture       votes for judicial nominees? Only 2 of President Obama's       nominees in the first two years faced cloture votes. Only 3       of President George W. Bush's nominees from the first two       years faced cloture votes. Only 1 for Clinton; 0 for H.W.       Bush; 0 for Reagan.        And the Senate Democrats' obstruction tactics were on full       display during the confirmation process for Justice Brett       Kavanaugh, who the Senate confirmed on October 7, 2018.       Senator Grassley oversaw the most comprehensive and       transparent confirmation process in history, including fully       investigating a number of allegations against Justice       Kavanaugh that turned out to be completely meritless.        Senator Grassley and his team reviewed the most       documentation in Supreme Court nomination history--including       more than 500,000 pages of Justice Kavanaugh's records from       his prior government legal service.        Additionally, Senator Grassley and his team also reviewed       more than 300 written opinions--more than 10,000 pages--that       Justice Kavanaugh wrote or joined in his more than 12 years       of service on the D.C. Circuit, the most important federal       circuit court in America. We also reviewed more than 17,000       pages of Justice Kavanaugh's academic writings, speeches, and       other materials provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee in       response to its most expansive questionnaire ever submitted       to a nominee.        Even after the 4-day hearing, in which Justice Kavanaugh       testified for more than 32 hours, Senate Democrats submitted       1,287 written questions for the record--more than the total       number submitted to all prior Supreme Court nominees in our       history, combined.        The normal hearing process confirmed for Senator Grassley       that Justice Kavanaugh was one of the most qualified, if not       the most qualified, Supreme Court nominee in our history. The       Senate Democrats and their liberal allies landed no punches.       Justice Kavanaugh had gone through 6 prior FBI full-field       background investigations, going back to 1993. He had served       in the highest positions in the White House and on the second       most important court in the land for more than a dozen years.       It was very clear that Justice Kavanaugh unquestionably had       the character and fitness to serve.        The Senate Democrats and their liberal allies ensured that       what should have been a ``normal'' confirmation hearing was       anything but normal. From the opening moments, Senate       Democrats conducted themselves more like petulant children       than United States senators. They interrupted the Chairman       with inappropriate motions and wild yelling. Indeed,       throughout the hearing, we experienced a senator--who       proclaimed to become Spartacus--willfully leaking       confidential records, another senator asking misleading       innuendo-laced questions with no basis, and other senators       doing other outrageous things.        Leftwing allies followed the disgraceful lead of these       senators. With Justice Kavanaugh's two young daughters in the       room, paid protestors shouted vile things, disrupting the       hearing and dragging the process on for hours longer than       necessary. This mob-like behavior was apparent throughout the       process, as angry paid protestors harassed senators, their       families, and their staffs.        When the hearing days were over and it was clear that       Justice Kavanaugh was a good man with impeccable credentials,       Senate Democrats and their leftwing allies went back to their       playbook from the Justice Thomas confirmation. But this time,       Senate Democrats and their leftwing allies went even farther,       accusing Justice Kavanaugh of being a serial gang-rapist who       drugged women at parties in his teenage years and even       through his 20s. While the FBI found no evidence of this in       any of its previous 6 full-field background investigations       conducted during Justice Kavanaugh's 25 years of public       service, Senator Grassley nonetheless took the allegations       seriously.        More than 20 staff members of Senator Grassley's Oversight       & Investigations Unit and Nominations Unit immediately began       investigating these claims. They worked around the clock.       Their work was thorough and comprehensive. Senator Grassley       was satisfied it contained all the answers he needed, but       some senators demanded a supplemental FBI investigation. All       senators were able to review that supplemental report, and       most were satisfied that it confirmed what we already knew       and what Justice Kavanaugh had been saying from the       beginning: Justice Kavanaugh was innocent of the outrageous       allegations made against him.        After Justice Kavanaugh's confirmation, Senator Grassley's       staff produced a report of more than 400 pages, which       catalogues the tireless work his staff did in investigating       these allegations. This report made clear that some of the       people who made the wild accusations against Justice       Kavanaugh deserved to be criminally referred to the Justice       Department. And Senator Grassley made those criminal       referrals.        Senator Grassley felt strongly about making this report       public, because it demonstrates his commitment to process--      something many Senate Democrats wanted none of. To them, due       process is inconvenient when it stands in the way of       achieving their political ends. Senator Grassley, however,       knows that upholding the constitutional cornerstone of due       process, of innocence until proven guilty, was worth fighting       for. And Senator Grassley helped deliver justice; Justice       Kavanaugh prevailed.        The American people clearly felt the same way. Indeed, in       an election that showed big gains for Democrats across the       country, Republicans actually gained 2 seats in the Senate.       Voters booted out of office Trump-state Senate Democrats who       voted against Justice Kavanaugh--like Claire McCaskill from       Missouri, Joe Donnelly from Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp from       North Dakota, and Bill Nelson from Florida. The one Senate       Democrat who actually voted the way his constituents wanted       him--Joe Manchin from West Virginia--won reelection.        These legislative victories are just more in the long line       of wins that the country has seen during Senator Grassley's       time chairing the Senate Judiciary Committee. Again, Senator       Grassley works; Senator Grassley delivers.        Thank you for your continued support of Senator Grassley.       And thank you for your continued efforts in helping to find,       credential, and appoint judges who share our judicial       philosophy. We can never get tired of winning. The stakes are       too high.        Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!        I am happy to answer your questions.                            ____________________
